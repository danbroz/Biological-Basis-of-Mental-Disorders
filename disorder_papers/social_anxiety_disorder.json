      "title": "A REVIEW OF THE SYNERGY BETWEEN LAW SOCIAL SECURITY AND NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT",
      "abstract": "Social insecurity negatives National Development as no given individual would like to fish in troubled water. We talk of social life, where one seeks enjoyment, sociable life or gregarious life, relating to, connected with, or suited to public or fashionable society, a social event, living or disposed to live in companionship with others, or in community, rather than in isolation and unfriendliness. Social problems are general factors that affect and damage society. A social problem is normally a term used to describe problems within a particular area or a group of people in the world. Social problem often involve problems that affect real life. It also affects how people react to certain situations [1] . Terrorism is psychological strategy of war for gaining political or religious ends by deliberately creating a climate of fear among the population of a State. Terrorism is also defined as the systematic use of terror and terror itself is defined as an alarm, dread, panic, fearfulness [2] . The benefits resulting from combing two or more different groups, people, objects or process or behavior of a system that cannot be predicted by behavior of its parts is called synergy. This work shall seek ways and manner, wherein Law and Social Security shall boost the enhancement of the National Development to the advantage of the citizens. That is where the Law enforcement Agency, through lawful means stop kidnappings and Terrorism. The Nation will be impacted negatively and National development will suffer a decline as nobody would want to remain in a country where life and/or social life, properties will not be secure. What are our values, especially the positive values; such as Right to life Rule of law, Human Rights, fair hearing and freedom of movement, all shall be observed and enforced.",

      "title": "Disintegration of the Self-Structure Caused by Severe Trauma",
      "abstract": "Severe trauma affects all structures of the self – one's image of the body; the internalized images of the others; and one's values and ideals – and leads to a sense that the self-coherence and self-continuity are invaded, assaulted, and systematically broken down. The traumatic events overwhelm the ordinary human adaptations to life and generally involve threats to life or bodily integrity, confront human beings with the extremities of helplessness and terror, and evoke the response of catastrophe. The vulnerable self-structure of traumatized individuals is evident in the following ways: (a) difficulties in self-regulation (self-esteem maintenance, lower tolerance levels, and the sense of self-discontinuity and personal agency), (b) appearance of the clinical symptomatology (frequent upsurges of anxiety/fear, depression, and specific fears or phobias regarding the external world or one's own bodily integrity), and (c) reliance on primitive or less-developed forms of the self-object relatedness. Severe trauma may lead to de-centering of the self (self-at-worst), loss of groundlessness and a sense of sameness, self-discontinuity and ego-fragility, leaving scars on the one's 'inner agency' of the psyche, fragmentation of the ego-identity resulting in proneness to dissociation.",

Referring to such an episode as a “panic” indicates that the concern about, fear of, and/or hostility toward the folk devil and his doings are out of proportion to the supposed threat. Some panics (or “scares”) are generated by threats that are entirely imaginary, but most are about a manifestly real condition that, evidence suggests, does not warrant the degree of concern that the public, a sector of the public, or representatives of a given institution manifest.",

It demonstrates the epistemological inferiority, even uselessness, of the psychologists' approach. Anxiety and fear belong to so-called general feelings (<i>Gemeingefühle</i>). Fear is an atavistic emotional heritage serving protective purposes against a threatening event, impending danger, or risky performance. This psychological emotion is a cortical function with repercussion on the diencephalic autonomic nervous system. Alteration of respiration, pulse rate, or blood pressure; blushing or pallor; inhibition of salivary secretion; or weeping are witness thereof. Anxiety is fear without extrinsic cause, without a substratum, not fear of something. It is an autonomous feeling aroused by intrinsic cortical processes, conscious or subconscious memories and associations originating from past experiences and life situations. It is a pathological outlet of mental processes involved",

      "abstract": "Environmental risks can result from contact with a toxic material or contaminant via the environment. A human health risk can be experienced by individuals or populations from contact with an environmental contaminant through inhalation, ingestion, or skin contact. Such risks can be acute (short-term) or chronic (long-term) in nature and can range from mildly irritating to life threatening. Risk is generally defined as the potential for an unwanted negative consequence or event. The term indoor environment, as used encompasses all enclosed spaces occupied by humans, including home, work, shopping, education, entertainment, and transportation. Humans have always estimated the risks of their actions or inactions in making personal decisions. However, the process was either intuitive or empirical until the mid-17th century when probabilities began to be described mathematically, initially to calculate gambling odds more precisely and later to calculate the odds of life events, such as the expected age of death for life insurance policies.",

The experience of fear is the immediate subjective experience of apprehension marked by activation of the fight or flight response. The experience of fear is best understood on the basis of its principle function. According to Seligman (1971), “the great majority of phobias are about object(s) of natural importance to the survival of the species.” In the most severe of circumstances (e.g., in the presence of a fast‐approaching predator), fear activates the organism to flee or battle for its life. A less severe illustration of fear function is seen in day‐to‐day social interactions in which individuals avoid saying or doing embarrassing things in order to prevent social rejection or maintain companionship.",

      "title": "Blushing, shame and social anxiety",
      "abstract": "The blush is regarded as a facial expression of the ‘self-conscious’ emotions –\nan outward manifestation of shame, embarrassment, shyness and/or modesty. In addition, the blush itself can be a source of self-consciousness and\nshame. Fear of blushing (erythophobia) can be the major presenting problem\nin social phobia and social anxiety. It creates a problem in several ways. First,\nunlike body shame associated with disﬁgurements, skin diseases or body\nshape, it is experienced as an involuntary reaction. Second, awareness that one\nis blushing can intensify it; indeed, simply being told (correctly or not) that\none is blushing can induce a blush. Third, people can regard their blushing in\na negative light. Not only may they be anxious of how others evaluate them\nbecause they blush (external shame), they may interpret their dispositions to\nblush as a sign of personal weakness or evidence of social ineptness (internal\nshame). Both forms of shame can lead those who are susceptible to blush to\nengage in a variety of defensive or safety behaviours and avoid social situations in which blushing may occur. Such anxieties and defensive behaviours\ncan be heightened by the perceptions that blushing is beyond their conscious\ncontrol. Furthermore, as a blush begins attention can become more selffocused interfering with eﬀorts at social presentation and producing cognitive\noverload, which adds to anxiety, especially as other behaviours (e.g., speech\nﬂow) are interrupted (Rapee & Heimberg, 1997). As discussed below, these\nconcerns can lead people to seek professional help and there are a range of\npsychological and medical approaches to intervention.",

In this regard it can be said that no one is free from and psychological, psycho-physical and psycho-social disorders from which we can derive that no one mentally healthy. But the concept of mental health defined free from the disorders those are prolonged and panic in nature. As the concept of mental health is subjective in nature, it varies from person to person. Besides free from the disorders, a person should pose some of the other positive characteristics to deal with the society effectively. Marry (1958) stated that, a person can be considered mentally healthy with the following characteristics such as (a) Positive attitudes toward himself/herself; (b) Realization of own potentialities through action; (c); Unification of in personality; (d) Degree of independence of social influences; (e) observations of the world around; and (f) Positive adapts to everyday life. Briefly, it can be said that positive mental health of the person make able to an individual to stand on his own two feet without making undue demands or impositions of others. In this regard the role of happiness in day to day life can make the individual more skilled to fight with different mental disorders. The present article is intended to find out the effects of happiness in day to day life in a social situation to deal with different mental disorders to make the individual mentally healthy and prosperous in life.",

Complaints that human beings are capable of expressing are not so many, there are only a handful, and this work intends to be exhaustive in its exposition. It is possible to complain against third persons. It is also possible to do so against oneself assuming either the intransigent attitude of a father who judges a son who does not fulfill his expectancies, or as a son who resents the paternal demands which he feels he cannot comply. Other kind of complaints include physical symptoms, either isolated (cephalea, dysnea, urticaria) or constituting syndromes or illnesses. Losses suffered are also a source of complaints, whatever the lost object might be (person, situation, material things or a part of oneself). It can be mourned because of its absence, or else by feeling guilty of the real or imaginary damage inflicted or else by feeling indisolubly linked to it with a phantom tie. Other types of complaints are the feeling of dependancy towards something oppressive, be it a substance, such as alcohol, smoking, drugs or overeating, or it may be a person or a situation.

      "abstract": "Fear and anxiety are common in dogs. Separation related disorders, fear-related aggression, and noise phobia are some of the most common problem-related behaviours in dogs. Fear and anxiety cause stress which could lead to chronic stress. Dogs that suffer from fear-related problems are often euthanized or abandoned. Dogs with fear-related aggression could be potentially dangerous to humans since the fear triggers an aggressive response which might cause the dog to bite. Fear is an adaptive response that increases the survival of a species and results in a physical and physiological response that prepares the individual for fight or flight. However, when this behaviour is generalised and/or triggered too easily and/or is expressed intensively, it usually becomes problematic for the dog, humans and society.\r\nFear-related aggression occurs when the dog encounters a problem stimulus which it cannot avoid. Fear-related aggression is often misinterpreted as protective aggression, e.g. that the dog wants to protect its owner. In reality, the dog is frightened and wants to defend itself from danger. Dogs could show signs of fear-related aggression by snarling, snapping or biting.\r\nDogs with noise phobia are commonly afraid of thunder, fireworks and/or gunshots. Fear of noises and thunderstorms tend to escalate, i.e. worsening with each exposure. A dog with a fear of gunshots might eventually become fearful of similar sounds or events associated with the noise (generalised fear). Panting, shaking or flight attempts could be signs of noise phobia.\r\nSeparation-related behaviour occurs when the dog is separated from the owner. It could be caused by a lack of habituation to being alone. Destructive behaviour, vocalisation or hyperactivity are some signs of separation-related disorders.\r\nBehaviour therapy, changes in the environment and medication are common methods for treatment of fear-related aggression, noise phobia and separation-related disorders, the effects of these treatments are discussed.",

      "abstract": "A moral panic is an outbreak or occurrence of a scare or intense concern about a threat or putative threat by agents, deviants, or 'folk devils', who, as a result of their supposed wrongdoing, are said to be responsible for menacing a society's culture, way of life, security, or central values. During moral panics, audiences are sensitized to any and all harms that stipulated deviants or folk devils might cause, and seize upon even flimsy evidence to support the claims. Fear or concern need not grip the entire society to qualify as a moral panic. Micro-and meso-panics – those that overtake and are acted upon by specific communities or by particular social sectors – also qualify as panics. Moral panics tend to be transitory. A particular threat erupts, grows in intensity and magnitude, then declines in strength, and may even evaporate altogether. The moral panic is expressed and conveyed by one or more identifiable sets of actors, audiences or 'stations'.",

On the other hand, the emotional attitude determines the identity. This attitude could be spontaneously occurring, but very often it is culturally conditioned, and purposefully designed. Postulates of national identity can take the form of imperatives like „Love your motherland!” Very often they are formulated in another way that replaces the imperative with allegations expressed by claims in first person (single or plural) or in impersonal form. Such statements are similar and operate as spells. The ambivalent attitude to the ‘own’ contains some negative elements. Their designation may indicate a trauma, frustration caused by some kind of insufficiency (including a lack of heroic deeds), inferiority complex. Trauma and shame can be pushed to the unconscious, but can also be productive as a cohesive element and as search for compensatory actions or verbal structures.",

      "title": "Contamination After Physical or Psychological Violations",
      "abstract": "Abstract Significant feelings of mental contamination, and the associated compulsions, are generated by physical or psychological violation. The effects of significant violations include fear, avoidance, anger, and in many instances a desire to retaliate. The primary contaminant is a person, and anything associated with the violator—people, places, or objects—can generate disturbing feelings of internal dirtiness and a desire to wash away the contamination. Compulsive washing tends to be futile in cases of mental contamination because the site of the dirtiness is inaccessible. In cases of physical violation the precipitating event is clear. For example, the victim recognizes the emergence of feelings of dirtiness and contamination after a sexual assault. Mental contamination is common after sexual assaults and the sense of pollution can persist for years. In cases of psychological violation, however, the link between the event/s and the emergence of mental contamination is obscure and perplexing. Betrayals, humiliation, and degradation can be traumatic even though “no skin is broken. Surges of feelings of mental contamination, are provoked by mental events such as intrusive images, memories, and thoughts, and also by secondary sources of contamination (people or places associated with the violator). Cognitive behavior therapy is the treatment of choice in cases of mental contamination which develop after psychological violation. In cases that develop after a physical violation the cognitive therapy is supplemented by techniques used for treating PTSD. Treated cases are described.",

      "abstract": "Noise is a sound which is unwanted, either because of its effect on humans, its effect on fatigue or multifunctions of physical equipment, or its interference with the perception or detection of other sounds. It is a part of environmental pollution which can, in certain circumstances, reach worrying levels for the population (130 dB cause pain). Unsuitable exposure to noise for even short periods of time is responsible for symptomology involving the hearing organs (hypoacusis) and other parts of the body such as the cardiovascular, muscular and digestive systems via the connection between the central and the autonomous nervous systems. Noise in communal eating areas can be classed as coming from 3 sources: 1) operation of cooking machinery; 2) banging of pans and equipment; 3) voices of both staff and diners. The intensity of noise on these premises varies generally between 60 and 80 dB (discomfort threshold). The Regulations governing this subject are D.Lgs n.277 of 15/8/1991 regarding the protection of employees, D.P.C.M. of 1/3/1991 which establishes the maximum levels of noise both in the home and outside, and the more recent D.P.C.M. of 21/5/1999 referring to noise in public places, which includes restaurants. To contain the exposure to noise in public eating places, we believe that action should be taken at legal levels with stricter limits than the recently passed level of 105 dB, in the building planning departments and also with technological intervention in order to reduce the effects that noise has on the auditive and extra-auditive organs and thus limit possible sublimal messages which certainly do not benefit the psycho-physical well-being of the diners.",

It may also occur following loss or may arise from intrapsychic conflict, as in conflict between inner drives and external demands or between conflicting value systems. Anxiety is a distressing emotion usually associated with bodily discomfort. In contrast to depression, which is a reaction to loss and is oriented toward the past, anxiety is a reaction to threat and is directed toward the future. The threat may involve danger, lack of support or what is unknown. Normal anxiety prepares the individual for a protective response. Low levels of anxiety are helpful in coping with adversity, but high levels cause impairment and can even be disorganizing. Anxiety becomes abnormal when its intensity and duration are disproportionate to the potential for harm, when it occurs in situations known to be harmless, or occurs without any recognizable threat.",

      "title": "Explaining Related Concepts and Vocabulary and Identifying Their Connections",
      "abstract": "In this chapter, concepts such as health, mental health, urban health, stress, environmental stress, and urban stress are fully described. Then, the relationships between these concepts and urban stress are identified through content analysis using MAXQDA software. Stress is a social pollutant, an unpleasant emotional state, an unspecific physiological and psychological response to perceived real and imagined threats and stress factors (environmental, social, and behavioral stimuli) to physical, mental, or social integrity, a mechanism preparing us for any reaction (biochemical, physiological, and behavioral response), and also making us evolve and adapt more to the environment. What it causes and what its effects are not always clear. It can be acute (appears suddenly through an unpredictable threat), or chronic (resulting from exposure to repeated threats). Although it is not harmful in general, exposure to chronic stress endangers our physical, mental, emotional, spiritual, and social health. It is an acute threat to the homeostasis (steady state) of an organism, which helps its physical and mental well-being. In fact, the nervous system alerts the body by increasing the heart rates and releasing some hormones (adrenaline and cortisol) and the body quickly turns to maximize its power. This automatic process is known as the \"fight-or-flight\" reaction or the \"stress response.\" Urban stress is actually the cumulative stress caused by the experience of living in unfavorable conditions of the urban environment and a general term related to the relationship between the urban environment and its impact on human mental health and a reaction to some threats perceived by undesirable urban events such as pollution, high population, extreme temperature, crowding, noise, destroyed landscape, excessive accumulation of solid waste, waste of time in commuting, etc., and if these conditions are beyond the urbanite's tolerance, he will experience urban stress. The city both directly influences mental health and causes stress through social, economic, physical, environmental, housing, transportation, and individual stressors, and this stress reduces mental health. Of course, the city also influences mental health through the reduction of general or physical health, because the areas of health and mental health are largely interdependent. Mental health also affects the city both directly and through stress and public health. As a result, urban stress and physical health can mediate the effects of urbanization on mental health and the effects of mental health on the city. A better understanding of this relationship and the effect of mediators and trying to reduce the negative effects of cities on mental health will greatly help to best take advantage of urban life.",

A victim of wrongdoing may be angry, afraid, hurt and resentful; as a result, the victim may feel violated. Perceived wrongs may also make a victim feel violated. One issue that victims often have difficulty in coming to terms with is why they were wronged. The question has to do with making sense of – that is, finding out the reason for – what happened to them. Those who already have low self-esteem (that is, a misplaced or diminished sense of self-regard, self-confidence and self-respect and an inaccurate perception of themselves as rational and relational human beings) may find it particularly difficult to forgive (Novitz 1998: 311–13) – or may ‘forgive’ all too easily out of a lack of self-respect. With some types of wrongdoing, the victim may feel that the wrongdoer is implicitly communicating that the victim is worthless, a ‘thing’ (not a person) to be abused at will. Being wronged can be a psychologically destructive experience for a person, and can have harmful effects on the lives of others and even on communities.",

Feeling contempt thus implies rejecting others, considering others as unworthy of one’s attention. Contempt is often mixed with other emotions, such as anger, hatred, or socio-moral disgust. Often therefore, the expression of contempt can coincide with feelings of revenge or even attempts to attack the other person. I think contempt is a moral emotion, in that it is often elicited in response to transgressions that are considered as amoral. These include behaviors such as betrayal, theft, (sexual) violence, which go against our moral standards and therefore deserve only contempt. These types of transgressions are too awful to criticize, and therefore can only lead to rejection or exclusion. Although we may feel contempt towards people we hardly know, contempt often develops out of anger, especially when we have been confronted with others or other groups who have not changed their behavior in reaction to our anger. Anger therefore does not seem functional, and contempt emerges as a way of coping with the lack of influence or control we have over the other.",

      "abstract": "It seems that a certain consensus exists to speak about a traumatic situation as an experience which is made up of a threat on the physical or psychological integrity of a person and against which one responds with fear, desperation and intensive horror. Different psychological phenomena are involved with the manner through which a human being confronts his/her past. In particular, the response to traumatic situations, mourning, and blame share their characteristic of being an irreversible living reality related to facts, loss or past impacts and it is necessary to integrate these in one's life in order to advance; these comprise a triangle frequently coexisting and interconnected. Aid for these three situations has, therefore, as common elements, two premises: an active task is required by the person who suffers this situation; this person must, in some form, desire to move ahead. One can not toil in mourning, in a traumatic experience, or in a life of blame if these have a positive symbolic value for this person; for example, mourning as a manner not to treason the dead person by forgetting that person, the reliving a trauma as an attempt to provide some sense to the actions which occurred, or blame as a desire to not forget an error or as a final punishment of this active task; the final objective of this active task is not usually to forget but to integrate in order to live. If a person does not perceive this clearly, this person may not become actively involved in the task to overcome a traumatic situation and to move ahead, nor will that person accept that a person who tries to help questions this person's realities or experiences.",

Psychological stress is fear stress. Some examples are restraint, contact with people, or exposure to novelty. In many different animals, stimulation of the amygdala with an implanted electrode triggers a complex pattern of behavior and autonomic responses that resemble fear in humans. Both previous experience and genetic factors affecting temperament will interact in complex ways to determine how fearful an animal may become when it is handled or transported. Cattle trained and habituated to a squeeze chute may have baseline cortisol levels and be behaviorally calm, whereas extensively reared animals may have elevated cortisol levels in the same squeeze chute. The squeeze chute is perceived as neutral and non-threatening to one animal; to another animal, the novelty of it may trigger intense fear. Novelty is a strong stressor when an animal is suddenly confronted with it. To accurately assess an animal's reaction, a combination of behavioral and physiological measurements will provide the best overall measurement of animal discomfort.",

      "title": "Freedom as Moderator of the Personality-Mood Relationship",
      "abstract": "Abstract The striving for and experience of freedom are of central importance in human life. Our concern here is not freedom as a characteristic of a social (political) system or as a social value, but the experience of external and internal freedom in the natural surroundings of everyday life. There are situations that offer little restraint, in terms of both physical obstacles and social pressures. In such a situation a person experiences external freedom: If one wanted to, one could leave the situation or do something different within the situation without an effort to overcome physical obstacles and/or without being blamed (punished) by social agents. Thus, the concept of external freedom implies both being able and being allowed to do what one wants to do. There are, on the other hand, situations or activities that one can leave or change without acting against one’s personal norms, and feeling guilty. In this case we speak of internal freedom. In this sense, a person, even if experiencing an irresistible impulse to act in a certain way, is internally free to act if the desire is fully compatible with his or her values, that is, if he or she does not have to overcome anticipated feelings of guilt.",

      "title": "Sentiment and Sentimentality in Music",
      "abstract": "A sentiment is an emotion. Sentimentality is counterfeit emotion. Emotions are intentional, evaluative states with aspects that are both mental and bodily. To say that emotions are intentional is to say that they are about something or mentally directed toward something. To say that emotions are evaluative is to say that they appraise objects and events as regards their bearing on the condition of the emotional being. How the object of a given emotion bears on one’s condition determines the emotion’s distinctive core relational theme (Lazarus 1991, 122), the harm or benefit it is supposed to detect. The core relational theme of anger, for example, is threat. The core relational theme of fear is danger. To say that emotions are bodily is to say that they involve action tendencies or changes in action readiness. The angry person will tend to strike out, the fearful person to freeze or to flee. Emotions are normally accompanied by arousal, or at least some intensive change measurable along one or more different axes, including axes of autonomic and electrocortical activity. Emotions may, but need not, involve a distinctive phenomenology. Passions I take to be emotions so intense and deeply rooted that they could not be counterfeit. Passion, therefore, excludes sentimentality. Bertrand Russell says of a major philosopher of the past that “he had many trivial love affairs, which were sensual but not passionate” (1945, 758), a telling remark. Sentimentality and sensuality are not too distant cousins. According to the view I favor, emotions are cognitive, but not necessarily judgmental or propositional. They are best construed as perceptual, and perception is a mode of categorization that extracts information concerning invariants from a fluctuating sensory array. Emotions do not necessarily follow upon on a conscious perceptual experience afforded by one of the special senses. This point has a basis in physiology. All the special sensory input systems project to nuclei of the thalamus before reaching the specialized sensory cortices, and the thalamus is a central component of the limbic system. Olfactory pathways also project to the",

      "abstract": "Abstract Mental contamination that develops after experiencing a psychological or physical violation (e.g., sexual assault) has the following characteristics. The person feels a sense of internal dirtiness, beneath the skin, not localized, evoked, or intensified by images, memories, or thoughts about the violation and/or the violator. The violator is the central, most intense contaminant. The basis of the contamination is obscure and perplexing because it is not obviously linked to common sources of dirtiness, and the human origin of the disorder is not recognized. The feelings of contamination are unique to the affected person. Objects and people can appear to be clean but feel dirty. Washing, even compulsively, is ineffective and it is difficult ever to feel completely clean. Usually there is a moral element in mental contamination.",

Acute stress is essential for survival, enabling an animal to deal with the initiating stressors in a manner that will enhance the animal's chances of survival. However, many animals experience chronic stress — regular and/or continuous exposure to stressors at levels and proximities that the animal is unable to control or alter. Such stressors can lead to physiological and emotional distress and impaired welfare. The dog that is left alone in the home can become trapped in an environment for which it has no coping strategies or, due to circumstances outside its control, may have lost its previous coping strategies. Such dogs suffer daily impairments in welfare.",

      "abstract": "Anxiety, unlike fear, which is strongly object-related, accompanies man all his life. This anxious condition appears especially then, when danger is imminent, also in the case of being severely ill. Anxiety and hope, even in people severely ill, do not exclude each other. Human life for many and perhaps for all is a race with time. The anxiety not being able to realize enough in a given time often is the reason for a busy and restless activity. Man often suffers from anxiety of other human beings. As ever an individual may live, it always owes something to others. Accordingly, the doctor or other helpers never are able to behave totally in the way as the patient expects and the patient cannot act as the helper truly would like it. Man experiences anxiety, however, also then, when he recognizes to remain in debts towards himself and, in the view of religion, towards a task given by God. Yet, man suffers anxiety not only because of his confrontation with death but also with life and the responsibilities which he has to take over when growing up in society. The struggle for existence described by Darwin, a result of anxiety, seems to be lost for the patient knowing he or she is severely ill, and he/she is therefore upset against a destiny which threatens to exclude him/her from the community of healthy people and perhaps soon from the living persons. Anxiety always turns also around the existence in the group.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

      "abstract": "Panic is a condition in which an individual can arrive suddenly when in its environment different stimuli appear, meaning excitatory factors which may cause a reaction to the body, more or less controlled. This can be amplified by another person or by a group that is subject to the same stimuli, usually transforming it in a violent terror. In this case, the judgment of an individual comes to be dominated only by the primary instinct of survival forgetting about others. In the category of stimuli that can cause panic are: fires, earthquakes, impossibility to leave a space, various transportation accidents, an outbreak infection etc. That means that the spaces in which crowded situations appear must be designed so that emergency evacuation, when panic stimuli arise, to occur normally with no injuries or casualties. Such situations can be prevented by sufficient exits properly signposted and calibrated with respect to their maximum capacity and through education. Education is extremely important and must be repeated regularly in order to replace fear with individual judgment. Unfortunately, this is superficially considered by the authorities leaving everything to those who conceive the buildings. Moreover, there are some special buildings that are not taken into account, such as churches, which have only one exit. Evacuation scenarios can be simulated only by specialised software in which certain parameters, such as stampede, the appearance of human or material obstacles, etc., are difficult to enter. This paper proposes some ways of adapting the existing software sin order to meet specific requirements, leading to delays in people evacuation in case of panic stimuli.",

      "abstract": "A. Soundness of mind at the time of committing an offence is complementary to mental maturity as a condition for the criminal capacity of the perpetrator and is thus a condition for the criminality of his act. Accordingly, the perpetrator's mental disorder limits the criminality of his act, although not every such disorder has such radical legal consequences. If the disorder is cognitive , it must be such as to prevent the person from understanding the physical or social meaning of his conduct: if it is volitional , it must be such as to prevent him, at the time of his act, from choosing between performing the act and refraining from doing so. These are symptoms of mental disorder that negatives the criminal capacity of a person, and each of them is a necessary, but not a sufficient, condition. It is essential that this be due to a disease of the mind or an organic defect of reason. The disorder in question is therefore a radical one, and one that is also chronic if not permanent in nature, as opposed to temporary or less deep-rooted conditions such as a disturbed state, a trauma or emotional condition, impulsiveness in certain matters or urges that deviate from the normal in certain areas. B. The following remarks are confined to the absence of criminal capacity on the volitional level, to which we shall refer in short as “volitional insanity’. This is the case where the person at the time of his act did not have a choice between acting or not acting due to a disease affecting his mind. This case is also referred to as the commission of an act as a result of an irresistible morbid impulse.",

      "title": "Physical Activity",
      "abstract": "Physical activity is a significant element in enhancing the population's well-being.[1] Well-being is a condition of feeling good and functioning well, which helps people develop and thrive and control or manage life's negative, painful emotions.[23] Feeling good experiences are the positive emotions that give happiness and life satisfaction.[1] Physical activity improves human health, including mental health and stress tolerance, and thereby experiences pleasant activated feelings of joy and enhances overall well-being.[1] These people exhibit greater productivity, are more socially active, and are economically productive.[2] The World Health Organisation (WHO) has defined physical activity as 'any bodily movement produced by skeletal muscles that require energy expenditure'. It includes all movement accomplished during leisure time, work or transport.[4] Worldwide, physical inactivity and sedentary behaviour for prolonged periods cause several adverse effects on health.[56] Sedentary behaviour is well-defined by the Sedentary Behaviour Research Network as 'any waking behaviour such as sitting or leaning with an energy expenditure of 1.5 metabolic equivalent task (MET) or less'.[7] The report shows that long sedentary times are spent by people around the world, such as Americans spend 7.7 h/day equivalents to 55% of their waking time, Europeans spend 2.7 h a day which is 40% of their leisure time watching television, and Koreans spend 8.3 h of sedentary time.[6] The WHO reports globally, more than a quarter of the world's adult population (1.4 billion adults) are not performing enough physical activity. This is doubled in high-income countries compared to low-income countries.[4] In low-income countries, more physical activity is attributed to the workplace and transport.[8] The prevalence of physical inactivity in South-east Asia is 17%, while in the Americas and the Eastern Mediterranean is about 43%.[9] In Malaysia, one in four adults is physically inactive;[10] 20% of adults are physically inactive in Africa.[11] Rapid urbanisation and economic growth and technological advancement and social changes are related to declining physical activity globally and the incidence of non-communicable diseases (NCDs).[1213] The cultural values also influence physical activity in some places where women, older people and the underprivileged and disabled population do not get enough opportunities to access safe and affordable. Appropriate programs are required to remain people physically fit.[12] Additionally, lack of time, motivation, energy, fear of injury, sedentary work pattern, affordable facilities are common factors that inhibit people from being physically mobile.[14] Physical inactivity causes around 8% of NCDs and deaths.[15] It is reported as the 4th leading risk factor for death.[16] About 5.3 million people die yearly from physical inactivity and a sedentary lifestyles.[16] It is reported by Lee et al. that physical inactivity results in 6%−10% of the significant NCD such as type 2 diabetes mellitus, coronary heart disease, breast and colon cancer and 9% of premature mortality.[17] Worldwide, 7.2% of deaths due to other causes and 7.6% of deaths due to cardiovascular disease are attributable to physical inactivity.[15] Physical inactivity also contributes to obesity, high blood pressure, osteoporosis, lipid disorders, mental health problems and significant NCDs of colon and breast cancer, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. It ultimately leads to early death.[18] Moreover, health-related morbidity affects the population's quality of life and well-being.[16] In addition to this health-related burden, physical inactivity also imposes an enormous financial burden.[16] The attributes causing this financial burden are direct healthcare costs, lost productivity and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs). Data from 142 countries (93·2% of the world's population) showed physical inactivity costs internationally US$ 54 billion/year in direct healthcare in 2013, of which $31·2 billion was paid by the public sector, $12·9 billion by the private sector, and $9·7 billion by households. While lost productivity due to physical inactivity costs INT$ 14 billion related to deaths and lifetime disease burden due to physical inactivity costs 13·4 million DALYs worldwide.[1219] High-income countries bear a more significant financial burden due to healthcare costs (80·8%) and indirect costs (60·4%). In comparison, low-income and middle-income countries bear a large proportion of the disease burden caused by physical inactivity (75·0% of DALYs).[19] Regular physical activity, such as walking, cycling, wheeling or any sports activity, is beneficial. It prevents and treats NCDs such as heart disease, stroke, diabetes and breast and colon cancer.[412] Patients benefit from physical activity to prevent obesity and hypertension and improve mental health, quality of life and well-being.[12] The numerous benefits of health and disease eventually reduce the mortality rate.[5] It is found that physical activity promotes weight loss and prevents weight regaining in overweight and obese people.[20] Performing exercise without any significant weight reduction is also beneficial.[5] Strength exercise is a powerful stimulus to improve and maintain bone mass during aging. Regular practice of multi-component exercise, including aerobic, high impact, and/or weight-bearing training for muscle-strengthening, bone-strengthening and whole-body vibration, can be combined with exercise help to increase or prevent the loss of bone density, especially in post-menopausal women.[2122] Regular physical activity in older adults improves their functional fitness,[23] helps to improve physical functioning and psychological well-being[24] and reverses some chronic diseases, and provides personal ability to live independently.[25] Physical activity by doing regular exercise reduces the cardiovascular risk factor by the reduction in body weight, reduction in the low-density lipoprotein level, total cholesterol, and increase in the high-density lipoprotein level as well as increases in insulin sensitivity and control blood glucose levels. It also improves the vascular wall function and oxygenation to the muscles.[26] Thus, the physical activity effectively prevents and treats high blood pressure, cardiovascular diseases, arthritis, osteoporosis, cerebral diseases, and complications. Physically active people showed higher satisfaction with life.[27] Reports indicated that physically active cancer survivors had fewer adverse effects and mortality from their cancer than inactive participants.[28] In addition to the health benefits, the active population can participate in productivity and economic development. The indirect benefits are less fossil fuel use, less congested and safer roads and reduced air pollution.[12] According to WHO, adults aged 18-64 years should have at least 150–300 min of moderate-intensity aerobic physical activity each week or at least 75–150 min of vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity; or a combination of moderate and vigorous-intensity activity throughout the week.[4] In addition, muscle-strengthening activities involving all major muscle groups should be practiced 2 or more days a week.[4] Moderate activity is similar to walking briskly at 3–4 miles/h. Any activities from occupational or recreational activities such as cycling, household work, yard work, swimming and dancing are considered moderate activities. Approximately five to seven 30-min sessions/week of moderate activity are equal to an intensity of 3–6 METs or about 600–1200 calories expended per week.[26] Vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity includes running, aerobic dancing, heavy yard work, hiking uphill or with a heavy backpack, cycling 10 miles per hour or faster, jumping rope, etc.[29] Awareness of the population is necessary to increase physical activity. Implementing a global action plan and a national plan to increase physical activity can motivate people. Providing facilities and workplace physical activity opportunities would increase physical activity levels. WHO has launched a global action plan to promote physical activity with four objectives and 20 policy actions aimed at reducing physical inactivity in adults and adolescents by 15% by 2030. It recommends more active societies by doing more walking, cycling, sport, active recreation, dance and play.[12] During transport, the use of non-motorised mode by use of cycle, or by walking and more active participation in sports, or passing active time during leisure time is encouraged. Therefore, providing cycling and walking infrastructure, improving road safety and providing the facility for physical activity for the community are necessary.[8] Physical activity has a significant impact on human health and well-being. Moreover, an active population is significantly involved in productivity and economic development. Therefore, it is necessary to increase awareness and motivate people and implement strategies to enhance and maintain the physical activity and well-being of the people.

This Article advocates that law should care more about experiencing selves than remembering selves if and when experiences result in chronic health or stress consequences that either (1) societies care about more than people do (because of externalities, public bads, or public goods) or (2) people also care about, but are unaware of, do not remember, or are unable to act upon (due to self-control problems).

      "title": "The Phenomenon of Aggressive Behavior of Learners in the School Situation.",
      "abstract": "Aggression is an internal process of human being in relationship with his/her self, other persons and the environment. The external manifestations of aggression, whether constructive or destructive, are not the starting point of aggression. Aggression develops from childhood and continues into adulthood. In this regard Chamberlain (2000:1-4) even states that aggression can develop from before birth. Aggression starts within the psychological world of the individual. The way in which the individual interprets his/her perception will elicit an emotional response that will affect the person's decision on what to do with his/her interpretation of the world. What matters is the way it is expressed-either constructive or destructive behaviour. Aggression is expressed in a constructive manner if it is about the survival and personal and healthy growth of the individual, family, group and/or the community. Aggression is expressed in destructive manner if it harms self and/or others and/or the environment (Tesser, 1995:383-418). According to Kruger, Rech and Van Staden (1993:9) aggression can viewed as any type of behaviour that is directed to harm, hurt, inflict pain or destroy another person when this person is motivated to avoid such behaviour. Aggression can also be self-directed-consciously or unconsciously (self-critical, self-harm, verbal threats and assault). Psycho-social factors that contributes towards aggressive behaviour include inability to cope with frustration; uncomfortable livelihood; exposure to aggressive models such as violence in the media and parents with aggressive behaviour; poor socio-economic circumstances especially in urbanized areas; poor family relationships; times of social stress (such as high inflation rate and increasing divorce statistics), and rejection by peers (Pepler & Sedighdeilami, 1998:205-214; Collings, 1994:35-37; Pulkkinen & Ramirez, 1991:69; Kruger, Rech & Van Staden, 1993:9-10). Situational factors can contribute towards aggressive behaviour including competitive sports, physical pain, anxiety, being in a crowed; and air and noise pollution (Smith & Furlong: 1998, 2021-202; Kruger & Van Staden, 1993:10). Biological factors contributing to aggression include constitutional factors (a person's temperament); genetics; hormonal factors; neuro-anatomical factors such as neurotransmission and neuro-logical disturbances (Mooij: 374; Kruger, Rech & Van Staden, 1993: 10-11). The self-determination theory state that the motivational orientation have been linked to how individuals regulate self-esteem in other potentially threatening contexts and social interactions (Hodgens, Koestner, & Duncan, 1996; Hodgins, Liebeskind, & Schartz, 1996; Knee & Zuckerman, 1996, 1998). Further, Deci and Ryan (1991) stated that when self-regulation proceeds according to an unintegrated aspect of the person, as with the ego involvement on controlled behaviour, the experienced emotion will be less flexible, more pressured, and more subjective to defensive reaction that less fully express one's integrated self. Investigators have operational zed self -determination in various ways, including the aspiration that individuals endorse (Kasser & Ryan, 1993, 1996), coercive elements of the social context (Deci, Spiegel, Ryan, Koestner, & Kauffmann, 1982; Ryan, Mims, & Koestner, 1983), self-reported reasons for engaging in various behaviours (Vallerand & Bissonette, 1992; Vallerand, Blais, Briere & Pelletier, 1989), and individual differences in motivational orientations (Deci & Ryan, 1985a; Hodgins, Liebeskind, et al, 1996; Knee & Zuckerman, 1996, 1998). This latter work on motivational orientations evolve from the assumption that people differ in the extent to which they regulate their behaviour based on autonomy and choice, or based on pressure (either real or imagined; Deci & Ryan, 1985a). Same-level or cross--level processes (interaction) may exist. …",

      "abstract": "Potential competing interests: No potential competing interests to declare.Freud (1894) defined \"psychological projection\" as a defense mechanism in which one attributes negative aspects of their personality to others and is thus able to ignore their own flaws and problems.Its inverse form is defined as follows: when a person repeatedly (sometimes angrily) advises another person to ignore or pay no attention to either someone or something, it is usually because the person who advises this is experiencing inverse psychological projection; that is, if this person's needs have been disregarded in the past, their experience will be reflected in their reaction to the person they advise.However, such advice is relevant only when the type of hurt is a very specific case of banal mockery.If a mentally ill person tells somebody they are ugly, the best advice is to ignore them.However, if this person hurts someone in a way that has nothing to do with banal mockery of self-image (e.g., public humiliation, contempt, invasion of privacy, incitement, threatening behavior, discrimination, abuse, sexual or ordinary harassment, violence, annoyance) or if what was said had already hurt the other, then advising them to ignore or pay no attention to that mentally ill person disregards this damage.This defense mechanism can be activated in a person if they have been unable to cope with similar types of hurt in their own past and have been exposed to related mental damage, if their egoism is stimulated by the same matter, or if, due to this stimulation, it is either shameful for them to acknowledge their egoism because stimulated (or vulnerable) egoism is considered socially inferior or difficult for them to contain the other's hurt feelings or bruised egoism.Consequently, they deny the problem's existence and thus advise others to also ignore it due to their will to either stimulate (and unburden) their antagonism to others or to demonstrate their ability to rise above the same issue and \"win\" against it.Moreover, in contrast to classic psychological projection, in which a person attributes negative aspects of their own personality to others when they are unable to deal with these aspects (so they can ignore them), in its inverse form, a person attributes the quality that they would like to but cannot demonstrate/be able to succeed in (which relates to their ability to efficiently manage things or problems that stimulate their own egoism), so they can avoid dealing with these things or problems.In similar scenarios, inverse psychological projection may include saying things such as \"I don't care what you think (or say)/Who cares what people think (or say),\" \"Don't get excited by the background noise,\" I will not stoop to your level,\" \"Don't let them influence you,\" \"Don't give them the satisfaction,\" \"Don't give them a platform,\" \"They aren't worth it,\" or \"What do you expect from him?\" (one must distinguish between \"expected to\" and \"predicted to\" as these two possess different responsibilities).Alternatively, when discussing a television show, one may say, \"Who even watches it?\"and in",

      "abstract": "Our cognitive system has adapted to support goal-directed behaviour within a normal environment. An abnormal environment is one to which we are not optimally adapted but can accommodate through the development of coping strategies. These abnormal environments can be 'exceptional', e.g., polar base, space station, submarine, prison, intensive care unit, isolation ward etc.; 'extreme', marked by more intense environmental stimuli and a real or perceived lack of control over the situation, e.g., surviving at sea in a life-raft, harsh prison camp etc.; or 'tortuous', when specific environmental stimuli are used deliberately against a person in an attempt to undermine his will or resistance. The main factors in an abnormal environment are: psychological (isolation, sensory deprivation, sensory overload, sleep deprivation, temporal disorientation); psychophysiological (thermal, stress positions), and psychosocial (cultural humiliation, sexual degradation). Each single factor may not be considered tortuous, however, if deliberately structured into a systemic cluster may constitute torture under legal definition. The individual experience of extremis can be pathogenic or salutogenic and attempts are being made to capitalise on these positive experiences whilst ameliorating the more negative aspects of living in an abnormal environment.",

      "abstract": "Social trauma, like individual trauma, can be worked through and recovered from. A trauma is something that overwhelms the psyche in a more than momentary way arousing fear or even terror, often a fear of death and a sense that life is not worth living. Trauma interferes with the capacity to symbolise. The traumatised person loses a sense of there being a containing figure, internally or externally. Language gets its possibility and meaning from shared activities and practices. So to lose one's language is to lose a form of life. One aspect of the cultural trauma perpetrated on hunter-gather cultures has been the colonial attempt to obliterate local language speaking, for example in Canada when the policy was to remove native. As with individuals, a cultural traumatic event may be either what used to be called in insurance policy documents an \"Act of God\" or it may be more or less man-made.",

      "abstract": "A big amount of important, \"economically relevant\" information, is buried into unstructured \"narrative\" information resources: This is true, for example, for most of the corporate knowledge documents (memos, policy statements, reports, minutes, etc.), for the news stories, the normative and legal texts, the medical records, many intelligence messages as well as for a huge fraction of the information stored on the Web. In these \"narrative documents,\" or \"narratives,\" the main part of the information content consists in the description of \"events\" that relate the real or intended behavior of some \"actors\" (characters, personages, etc.)—the term \"event\" is taken here in its more general meaning, also covering strictly related notions like fact, action, state, and situation. These actors try to attain a specific result, experience particular situations, manipulate some (concrete or abstract) materials, send or receive messages, buy, sell, deliver, and so forth. Note that in these narratives, the actors or personages are not necessarily human beings; we can have narrative documents concerning, for example, the vicissitudes in the journey of a nuclear submarine (the \"actor,\" \"subject,\" or \"personage\") or the various avatars in the life of a commercial product. Note also that even if a large amount of narrative documents concerns natural language (NL) texts, this is not necessarily true. A photo representing a situation that verbalized could be expressed as \"Three nice girls are lying on the beach\" is not of course an NL text, yet it is still a narrative document.

      "abstract": "Informational and reputational cascades often arise in the presence of four factors: (1) preference falsification; (2) diverse thresholds; (3) social interactions; and (4) group polarization. In the context of animal welfare, cascades have often occurred, and more consequential ones are possible. First: In this domain, preference falsification has run and is running rampant. Those who care about animal welfare, or are inclined to want to say or do something about it, often silence themselves. They know that if they speak or act, they might incur social disapproval or worse. Second: People have different thresholds for disclosing their views or for taking action. With respect to animal welfare, some people really will speak out or act, even if no one else does. Others need someone to follow – but only one. Still others need two, or three, or a hundred, or more. Third: Social interactions are and continue to be crucial to the movement for animal welfare. Who is seeing whom? When? Who is talking to whom? Are visible people speaking and acting in ways that support animal welfare? Are they credible? With whom? Fourth: In many times and places, believers in animal rights, animal welfare, or both have created communities of like-minded people. These communities can be highly effective. They create a commitment to a belief that might have been held tentatively. They make that belief salient, potentially part of people’s identity. They increase confidence and unity.",

The methods of committing: physical violence, which consists in inflicting bodily injuries that can lead to the death of the victim, violation of physical or mental health, damage to his honor and dignity, are considered separately. Psychological violence, which is related to the effect on the psyche of a person through verbal insults or threats, harassment, intimidation, which intentionally causes emotional insecurity, the inability to protect oneself and may cause or is causing damage to mental health; economic violence, which consists in depriving a person of food, clothing and other property or funds to which the victim has a legal right, which can lead to his death, cause a violation of physical or mental health. Traces of domestic violence are considered in a broad sense, namely, traces of struggle: a mess in the room, overturned furniture, broken glass, dishes, scattered clothes, etc. It has been established that the traces of domestic violence can be material and ideal. Ideal traces of domestic violence are formed in the memory of the participants of the criminal event. The types of identified traces are specified in relation to the method of committing the crime. When analyzing the situation of domestic violence, it was established that its structure includes the place and time of the crime, the moral and psychological relations of the subjects of the offense and their environment, the social and psychological environment in which the offender is located and influences his actions, as well as the socio-political situation in the country.",

There are primary or universal emotions (happiness, sadness, fear, anger, surprise, disgust), secondary or social emo- tions (compassion, shame, guilt, contempt, jealousy, envy, pride, admiration) and background emotions (wellbeing, malaise, calm, tension). Emotions are complex programs of actions shaped by evolution. The actions are completed by a cognitive program, but the world of emotions is primarily a world of actions carried out in our body from the facial expressions and body positions to the changes in the viscera and internal milieu. We can consider emotion as a primary value system of the brain, leading certain activations to be selectively reinforced. In clinical interviews we are often led from the line of verbal speech to the line of emotional speech. We use our own emotions or feelings as a way to detect discrepancies or incongruities in the relationship, probably between the channels of verbal, non-verbal and empathic communication. Carl Rogers made an important contribution to psychotherapy with his experience of unconditionally accepting the client, who comes to be heard, without prejudice or judgment. A feeling, an emotion, a reasoning were accepted with the same attention, care and respect. The forms of expression and the exact configuration of stimuli that can induce an emotion are different in different cultures and individuals. But what is striking is the similarity.",

      "abstract": "The conditional connective -ketun in Korean has some restrictions in both the antecedent clause and the consequent clause. In the antecedent clause the event or state denoted by the predicate must be perceptible. There are some exceptions to this restriction. The exceptional cases are where the event or state denotes a personal feeling on the part of the addressee (or addresser, in some cases). From these observations, it is concluded that the antecedent clause must be an event or state which can be directly experi­ enced by the addressee (or, addresser). In the consequent clause, the mood must be imperative, hortative or promissive. When the mood is declara­ tive or interrogative, the modality must be volitionaL These moods or mo­ dality can be characterized as something that can be satisfied by some ac­ tion on the part of the addresser or addressee. The relation between these two restrictions is that the antecedent clause changes the knowledge state of the addresser or addressee based on direct experience of something, and the addresser or addressee sets a goal and a plan for achieving the goaL And the consequent clause is an action included in the plan. This is the basic semantics of the conditional connective -ketuTL I give a more specific reptesentation of this semantics in this paper.",

The torturer through history can be characterized as naive (in his hope that confession or disclosure will be accurate) or as cynical (in his indifference to the inaccuracy that usually follows from the practice), or as self-absorbed (in his need for the torture victim to utter formulas that support the torturer’s worldview) or as sadomasochistic (in his literal brutality, often tempered by the phrase “this hurts me more than it hurts you”). None of these descriptions reflects well on the torturer or the society condoning the practice. Against these risks, periodically, apologists for the practice invoke special emergency conditions (whether spiritual or geopolitical), as though the world had never before seen such conditions.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The introduction describes Someone's structure and explains the term misfit sexuality in relation to common understandings of the term queer. Sexual misfits experience frustration in relation to their sexuality due to a misfit between 1) the physical and social practices that might constitute a sexuality, 2) the language that might be involved in accomplishing those practices or in reflecting on them, and 3) the categories (both practical and theoretical) that structure the social world and provide it with intelligibility. Sexuality is understood to be both one sociological variable that we use to identify ourselves and others, and the effect of a cloud of other sociological variables. Misfits are people who discover that they don't belong to the class that they have been taken (by themselves or by others) to belong to, because it happens that some criteria that nobody had ever mentioned (or would ever think to mention) has not been satisfied, or because they either lack an essential secondary property or possess a disqualifying one. The absence or presence of such a hidden or secondary property may not even be apparent until a certain event or interaction occurs, until a certain context emerges, or until a certain situation arises.",

      "title": "Of Casual and Seriousness",
      "abstract": "Casual is an attribute that denotes not permanent or regular rather it is accidental or random. It means happening by chance, not planned rather incidental e.g., a casual encounter, a casual meeting, a casual visit etc. It is made or done without much care or thought viz., a casual remark, a casual invitation. Thus, the term casual is widely used. In derogatory sense it signifies irresponsibility showing too little concern and interest as well. For example, the company’s casual attitude to office security invites danger. It stands for not careful or thorough i.e., not serious eg., a casual inspection, a casual glance at a book, a casual observer. In case of clothes, a casual short-sleeved shirt is an example of casual wear which is simply an informal dress. Similarly, in the market shoes are displayed with the message :a pair of man’s casuals. Shoes, clothes, etc. designed for informal occasions do not obey dress conduct.Thus, casual wear means relaxation. It disobeys or rebels against the so-called conduct. Here, men and women enjoys free style which differs from so-called smart wear.",

      "title": "Products as Pals: Engaging with Anthropomorphic Products Mitigates the Effects of Social Exclusion",
      "abstract": "Feeling left out has been shown to trigger primal, automatic responses in an attempt to compensate for threats to social belongingness. Such responses typically involve reconnection with other human beings. However, four experiments provide evidence that exposure to or interaction with anthropomorphic consumer products (i.e., products featuring characteristics of being alive through design, interaction, intelligence, responsiveness, and/or personality) can also satisfy (at least partially) social needs, ultimately mitigating previously documented effects of social exclusion. Specifically, interacting with anthropomorphic (vs. non-anthropomorphic) products following social exclusion reduces 1) the need to exaggerate the number of one’s current social connections, 2) the anticipated need to engage with close others in the future, and 3) the willingness to engage in prosocial behavior. These effects are driven by a need for social assurance, rather than positive affect. Moreover, an important boundary condition exists: drawing attention to the fact that an anthropomorphic product is not actually alive (i.e., the product does not provide genuine human interaction) limits its ability to fulfill social needs. Thus, in a time when consumer products are becoming increasingly anthropomorphic in design and function, the results reveal potentially important consequences for human-to-human relationships.",

      "abstract": "There is experimental evidence that the direction of social, intellectual, physical, personality, and emotional development are determined more by events at certain stages than it is earlier or later. These stages have been called “critical periods. ”\r\n This artiecle reviews the evidence and interprets the experimental results for a general theory. Although most of the work reported here makes use of animal subjected, the main concepts can be applied, at least catiously to human development.\r\n The “critical period” concept can be considered to have four major components (Gordon Pryor, 1975).\r\n 1) “Critical periods” are usually assumed to occur prenatally or very soon after birth. This main emphasis is usually placed on early development when many changes are occurring at their most rapid rate.\r\n 2) “Critical periods” are assumed to occur during a relatively short time period in the developmental sequence-perhaps only a few hours, days, or at most weeks or months, depending upon the species and its total life span.\r\n 3) Effective endogenous or exogenous stimulation that occurs during a “critical period” is assumed to have long-lasting consequences on subsequent development.\r\n 4) Such stimulation is assumed to have little or no effect on the parameters in question when it precedes or follows a “critical period.”\r\n Freud had suggested the importance of early experience and pointed toward the existance of critical periods in human personality development.\r\n Though many experiments, it is clear that perinatal dietary restiction can have\r\nrather severe and Ion-lasting effects on subsequent development especially in brain.\r\n Some young birds-ducklings and chicks become attached to any object to which they are long exposed during the critical period, even when their contact is only visual.\r\n The barren environments of all sorts, including large and impersonal infant hospital and traditional orphanages for young children are emotionally and intellectually severely damaging to the child, and blunt the development not only of the human organism but of simpler nonverbal organisms such as rats, mice, dogs, and monkeys.\r\n The concept of critical periods is highly important for human and animal welfare. The dangers and potential benefits for each period of life are known, it should be possible to avoid the former and take advantage of the latter.\r\n The discovery of critical periods immediately focuses attention on the developmental processes which cause them. As these processes become understood, it is increasingly possible to deliberately modify critical periods and their results.",

      "title": "‘Pleasures’,'Pains’ and Animal Welfare: Toward a Natural History of Affect",
      "abstract": "Abstract In hedonic theories of motivation, ‘motivational affective states’ (MASs) are typically seen as adaptations which motivate certain types of behaviour, especially in situations where a flexible or learned response is more adaptive than a rigid or reflexive one. MASs can be negative (eg unpleasant feelings of hunger or pain) or positive (eg pleasant feelings associated with eating and playing). Hedonic theories often portray negative and positive MASs as opposite ends of a one-dimensional scale. We suggest that natural selection has favoured negative and positive affect as separate processes to solve two different types of motivational problems. We propose that negative MASs (eg thirst, fear) evolved in response to ‘need situations’ where the fitness benefit of an action has increased, often because the action is needed to cope with a threat to survival or reproductive success. We propose that these negative MASs develop in response to a change in the body (eg dehydration) or the environment (eg the approach of a predator) which creates the need for action, and that negative MASs can become intense and prolonged if the threat to fitness is high and persistent. We propose that positive MASs evolved in ‘opportunity situations ‘ where an action (eg playing, exploring) has become advantageous because the fitness cost of performing it has declined. We propose that these positive MASs occur during, or as a result of, the performance of types of behaviour which are beneficial for fitness at a variety of times, not only when they are required to meet immediate needs; and that the pleasure inherent in the behaviour motivates the animal to perform it when the cost of so doing is sufficiently low. Some behaviour (eg eating) can be motivated by both positive and negative affect. Other behaviour, such as playing or fleeing from a predator, may be motivated largely by positive or negative affect alone. Our hypothesis needs to be tested, but we suggest that it corresponds well to common human experience. The hypothesis provides a basis for predicting whether an aspect of animal management is likely to cause strong and prolonged negative affect (‘suffering’), or to prevent animals from experiencing certain types of pleasure. This distinction is important for bringing animal welfare assessment into line with ethical concerns.",

It has been defined as ‘overt behaviour with the intention of inflicting damage or other unpleasantness upon another individual’ (Moyer, 1968), and the possibility for aggression exists whenever there is a conflict of interests between two or more individuals. In naturally living species, conflicts arise over the control of resources – principally food, shelter and mates; in most instances a social interaction decides the outcome of a contest, with ritualised displays taking the place of direct physical confrontation. Most contests will be decided quickly, with the ‘loser’ displaying a submissive posture or gesture, and quickly retreating with little harm done. The term ‘agonistic’ is normally used to describe all the features of such an encounter, which may or may not include actual physical aggression.",

      "title": "Peculiarities of behavior of juvenile victims of violent incest",
      "abstract": "The article considers the peculiarities of the behavior of juvenile victims of violent incest. It is indicated that the following features should be taken into account when studying the typology of victims of violent incest: 1) biological and psychological features and types of victims; 2) circumstances that preceded / contributed to the commission of the violent act; 3) the behavior of the victim at the time of the act of violence and after it. Establishing these features will provide an opportunity to more fully and correctly classify juvenile victims of violent incest. The author points out that in the general sense, the types of juvenile victims of sexual crimes do not differ sharply from the general public. At the same time, the typology of such persons is somewhat narrowed due to the frequent dominance of certain features that provoke the criminal offender to commit an illegal act. For example, if a person seeks to commit theft or robbery / robbery, the victim often plays a secondary role, as circumstances that contribute to the offense come to the fore (dark time of day, absence of outsiders, etc.). In the case of violent incest or any other socially dangerous act of a sexual nature, the language focuses on the victim as the \"object of desire.\" That is why the criminal offender usually pays attention to two aspects: the biological characteristics of the victim and the psychological characteristics (behavioral reactions). A study of statistics and jurisprudence concluded that in most cases this type of criminal offense is committed against juveniles who have an attractive appearance and passive behavior (do not make excessive efforts to protect and prevent incest). Attention is drawn to the fact that the provocation of violent incest is inherent in older minors and is due to the desire to prove to their loved ones their adulthood, sexuality and readiness for sexual intercourse. Often such victims seek to feel wanted, but do not understand the real threat of experiencing illegal sexual influence, especially from a close relative.",

      "title": "The Experience of Emotion : an Intentionalist Theory",
      "abstract": "The experience of emotion is a fundamental part of human conscious ness. Think, for example, of how different our conscious lives would be without such experiences as joy, anger, fear, disgust, pity, anxiety, and embarrassment. It is uncontroversial that these experiences typically have an intentional content. Anger, for example, is normally directed at someone or something. One may feel angry at one's stock broker for providing bad advice or angry with the cleaning lady for dropping the vase. But it is not uncontroversial that emotional experiences are always intentional. John Searle, for example, remarks, Many conscious states are not Intentional, e.g., a sudden sense of elation ... (1983, p. 2). Moreover, many animals experience emotions and it is natural to suppose that such emotions lack the sophistication of beliefs or thoughts. When a dog experiences delight in seeing its master after an absence of several days, the suggestion that at least part of the dog's experience of delight is a belief (or thought) that its master has returned home seems to import into the experience something that at best is associated with it and perhaps is not really a state to which the dog is subject at all. And even in the case of human beings, emotional experience often does not seem to involve thought. Consider the experience of disgust, to take one obvious example.' Nor is a salient belief required. One may have a strong fear of spiders and yet not believe that spiders typically pose any risk to humans. But if emotional experiences need not involve beliefs or thoughts, then just how are they intentional?2 Recent theories of consciousness have not devoted as much attention to the",

      "title": "STRESS-REACTIVITY AND STRESS-RESISTANCE AND MENTAL HEALTH OF PERSONALITY",
      "abstract": "Human health, as a biopsychosocial phenomenon, substantially depends on the responsiveness of an organism under certain conditions of activity and existence. Regarding a human being, the following types of responsiveness have been determined: biological or species-level responsiveness; group or constitutional responsiveness; individual physiological responsiveness; individual pathological responsiveness; specific responsiveness; non-specific responsiveness. Stress as the general adaptation syndrome and non-specific responsiveness of an organism significantly affects the physical and mental health of a personality by dint of the fight-or-flight or escape mechanisms. Concurrently, the scope of reaction related to the fight or escape is used to characterize stress responsiveness, which is genetically determined and is strictly individual. Thus, the behavioral mechanism of fight or escape preeminently refers to a constituent of unconditioned-reflex and instinctive activities of the human organism. Furthermore, phylogenetic constituents of the fight or escape mechanism are essentially supplemented by ontogenetic experience, becoming firmly established at the level of conditioned-reflex and instrumental activities. As a result, the main adaptation mechanism of stress responsiveness or mechanism of fight or escape can be viewed as a unique functional combination of inherited and acquired responses (unconditioned-reflex and conditioned-reflex reactions), which will considerably determine somatic and psychic norms as well as pathology of an organism. In its turn, stress responsiveness is tightly connected with the stress resistance of an organism. Indeed, stress resistance is an individual capability of an organism to maintain normal working efficiency under the influence of a certain stressor. Stress resistance can be enhanced with the help of learning; the essence of this learning lies in the conscious control of the activities of particular organs and systems and the behavioral activity of an organism as a whole. In psychology, stress resistance serves as the basis for successful social cooperation of a personality, which is predominantly characterized by emotional stability, as well as a low level of anxiety. Hence, stress resistance as a constituent of mental health in systemic relations with stress responsiveness contributes to the stability of homeostasis indicators with the involvement of morphological and functional reserves of an organism. In general, it is expedient to emphasize the following forms of stress responsiveness – low stress responsiveness (hypo stress responsiveness), adequate stress responsiveness (normal stress responsiveness), and increased stress responsiveness (hyper stress responsiveness). At the same time, there is a probable negative influence of both decreased and increased stress responsiveness on the constituents of mental health of a personality. In a holistic way, stress responsiveness and stress resistance of an organism significantly depend on the particularities of the central nervous system and autonomic nervous system, as well as the specifics of temperament in the corresponding systemic relations. In this respect, the two most important aspects of temperament, such as activity and emotionality (including anxiety) are distinguished. The diagnostics of stress resistance in the functional connection with stress responsiveness, along with morphological and functional reserves of an organism can include the following levels: 1) morphological level; 2) physiological level; 3) hematological level; 4) biochemical level; 5) immunological level; 6) level of the emotional sphere; 7) level of the cognitive sphere; 8) behavioral level. Psychophysiological particularities of active leisure and cognitive-behavioral therapy are aimed at the strengthening of stress resistance of an organism, as well as preservation of mental health of a personality under the corresponding conditions of activity and existence.",

Suffering includes a wide range ofunpleasant emotional states such as fear, boredom, pain, and hunger. Suffering has evolved as a mechanism for avoiding sources ofdanger and threats to fitness. Captive animals often suffer in situations in which they are prevented from doing something that they are highly motivated to do. The “price” an animal is prepared to pay to attain or to escape a situation is an index ofhow the animal “feels” about that situation. Withholding conditions or commodities for which an animal shows “inelastic demand” (i.e., for which it continues to work despite increasing costs) is very likely to cause suffering. In designing environments for animals in zoos, farms, and laboratories, priority should be given to features for which animals show inelastic demand. The care ofanimals can thereby be based on an objective, animal-centered assessment of their needs.",

Threats to the infant's psyche and/or physical survival normally mobilize ruthless aggression directed towards the object that is perceived as dangerous. The threat might be experienced as a direct assault, engulfment, smothering, or abandonment to starve. When the line of development from self-preservative aggression to the libidinalization of aggression progresses to the intensification of sadism, the psychic groundwork is laid for the use of sadism as a solution to neurotic or psychotic conflicts. When the mother's sadism fails to defend her against what she experiences as her child's persecution, she is at risk of relying upon ruthless aggression or its psychic equivalent. The child's wellbeing is then no longer relevant to the mother. The mother's only concern is negating or eliminating any aspect of the child that poses a threat to her survival.",

      "title": "Staging for Success: Preparing Environments for Productive Meetings, Trainings, and Workshops",
      "abstract": "Physical environment and people Physical settings can create cognitive and emotional reactions in people. In fact, many disciplines, including human ecology and environmental psychology, assert that environmental variables have an impact on human behavior. In ecological psychology, for instance, when the quality of the fit between human occupants and the physical environment is high, the people and the place are unified. Research on the restorative effects of the natural environment found that individuals report feeling rejuvenated and energized by the places that they occupy. Additionally, research on creativity suggests that people confined to a “featureless environment” do not perform to potential intellectually and emotionally. Environmental variables that may affect human behavior include the lack or the expansiveness of space; the location, shape, or temperature of a room; the texture and color of the walls and flooring; and the type and arrangement of furniture. Environmental variables may also include the absence or presence of natural lighting, windows with scenic views, and music or sounds that may be calming or distracting. Odors (e.g., the scent of flowers) may also conjure up images or set the mood in a given environment. Strong odors such as garbage, incense, strong perfume, or cologne may be distracting or off-putting. A person’s mood, attention span, and ability to focus may also be affected by color. For example, colors have the power to affect human senses by conveying meaning and presenting an atmosphere of pleasantness. Specifically, the cooler colors (blues, greens, and grays) create more passive participation, or a sense of coldness, while warm colors (such as reds and yellows) or light pastels tend to give a sense of warmth. From an environmental psychology perspective, extreme temperatures can reduce interpersonal attraction and interfere with successful task performance. For example, a study on hot and crowded areas found that participants in a room at normal temperature (72.4°F) reported feeling vigorous and comfortable, whereas individuals assigned to an overheated room (93.5°F) reported feelings of discomfort, fatigue, and sadness. High temperatures are also linked to loss of attention and productivity, and group members tend to be more aggressive when they are hot.",

      "title": "Forgiveness: Integral to a science of close relationships?",
      "abstract": "Paradoxically, fulfillment of our deepest needs occurs in intimate relationships, in which we are also likely to experience emotional injuries. For if there is one certainty in life, it is that romantic partners are not perfect, despite our tendency to idealize them (e.g, Murray, Holmes, & Griffin, 1996); it is a rare person who has never felt wronged, let down, betrayed, or by a relationship partner. In close relationships, we voluntarily make ourselves most vulnerable to another human being by linking the realization of our needs, aspirations, and hopes to the goodwill of our relationship partner (for related ideas, see chap. 17, this volume). Rendering ourselves vulnerable makes possible the profound sense of well-being that can be experienced in close relationships. But at the same time, the imperfection of any partner means that hurt or injury is virtually inevitable, and when it occurs, the hurt is particularly poignant precisely because we have made ourselves vulnerable. In the face of such injury, negative feelings (e.g, anger, resentment, disappointment) are common. Motivation to avoid the source of the harm,",

      "abstract": "Anger is defined as \"the state of emotion experienced as a result of the inability of the individual to express himself in a positive way in the face of the prevention of wishes, needs and plans and injustices\".Anger according to Soykan 2 it is a very natural, universal and human emotional response to unsaturated desires, unintended consequences and unmet expectations.Anger is a normal and anticipated human experience, just like other emotions; he is not an enemy.Anger; Usually, he tells people that something that matters to them is somehow threatened or that their desire to achieve a specific purpose is blocked.It also has a positive structure such as triggering stability and tenacity. 2When we get angry, there are some changes in our bodies.These are; Increases muscle tension, cracking eyebrows, squeaking the teeth, squeaking the teeth, tightening the blades, changing the shape of the arms and body, flushing gasoline (losing color), heart palpitations, tremors, sleep, clogging, twitching, sweating, loss of control, feeling warm, indigestion, feeling cold. 3Anger is an extremely healthy and natural feeling when expressed appropriately.However, if it spirals out of control and becomes destructive, it causes problems in school-business life, personal relationships and overall quality of life (Kokdemir, 2004).The expression of these feelings is learned by imitating parents and other adults in the family through the situations and events that create a sense of anger and resentment in childhood.Anger and resentment are not positive behavior in any situation, again the effect of family and close environment is brought to the child and adolescent.Expressing anger and anger in words is a form of behavior observed from an early age.The language used to express anger contains angry, angry, high-toned words, profanity or sarcastic and sarcastic expressions. 4At the moment of anger, the mouth part shows the desire to head towards the person who is angry, and with the intensity of anger, the jaw extends forward.The reaction of the mouth during the sense of anger, especially the fact that the jaw goes back 1-2 seconds forward can be a precursor to the person becoming aggressive. 5Aggression, which is one of the ways in which anger and anger are expressed; it occurs in the form of swipe, kicking and punching, pushing, shaking, biting, pinching, using hands, arms, legs and other organs of the body, or using a stick or similar vehicle to damage it. 4The emergence of violent behaviour in schools remains an acceptable problem between students and school staff. 6The child, who is incapable of anger control in the school environment, faces many problems.Schools are also an important element in recognizing a sense of anger and gaining the ability to express it in a healthy",

      "abstract": "The phenomenon of birth imposes upon man a relatively long period of helplessness—originally exclusively biological, but eventually social as well. It is at this point that he begins his long social conditioning history. His dependence on other people may lessen and his dependent behavior may change in form, but the class of behavior most generally labeled social behavior remains, and in many ways becomes more firmly controlled by other people. In our complex society the lack of social behavior is unheard of except in the extreme cases of the psychotic and the retarded, and even here there is most often evidence for some minimal social behavior. Living together is of course not restricted to man; animals also display social behavior. The definition of social behavior is then quite simple: It is behavior which varies as a function of other organisms—other organisms may elicit the behavior, set the occasion for it, or reinforce it. Furthermore, the behavior need not occur in the presence of other organisms to be called social—it may be related to other organisms only through stimuli which were once associated with them.",

The stress and discomfort that an individual experiences as an immediate result of noise exposure is compounded by the additional stress that results from lack of sleep, miscommunication, impaired mental functioning and the myriad social and economic consequences of such reductions in the individual's ability to function properly.

      "abstract": "\"Why Didn't She Say Something Sooner?\"Doubt, Denial, Silencing, and the Epistemic Harms of the #MeToo Movement Heather Stewart (bio) \"It may be that the most debilitating postmemories … are those instilled by silence.\" (Susan J. Brison)1 \"Why didn't you say something Sooner?\" has become a familiar refrain—a question frequently leveled at those victims/survivors2 of sexual violation3 who delay their decisions to bring forward testimonies or reports of their experiences until sometime in the future, at times, long after the event(s) transpired. This question (\"why didn't you/she say something sooner?\") is not only a linguistic mechanism for casting doubt on the testimonies of particular victims in isolated situations (i.e., to the person the question is directed at), but, given the regularity with which this question is asked of victims/survivors, has also come to reflect broader, deep-seeded epistemic assumptions about members of particular identity groups (namely, women and especially queer women or women of colour) and their abilities to be credible givers of knowledge more generally. This question—and the epistemic assumptions loaded into it—contributes to the structural and systemic doubting of victims/survivors of sexual violation at both social and political levels. This pervasive doubting of victims/survivors contributes to various forms of epistemic injustice against them4 and, consequently, harms victims/survivors in a variety of ways. While the harms that victims/survivors often experience in the aftermath of sexual violation, and subsequently in deciding whether or not and when to report it, are many and varied—ranging from physical harms to their bodies, to psychological and emotional harms, and interpersonal or social harms—this paper seeks to highlight a distinct type of harm that victims/survivors too often experience when bringing forth (or withholding) testimony of sexual violation, namely, epistemic harm. The role of epistemic harm as a distinct and significant category of harm experienced by victims/survivors of sexual violation (particularly [End Page 68] during the current cultural and political rise of the #MeToo movement) has been undertheorized in the growing scholarly engagement with victims/survivor testimony in the #MeToo movement, and this paper intends to rectify this gap. In what follows, I argue that a particular category of harm—that which is characteristically epistemic in nature—is pervasive among those choosing whether, how, and when to bring forward testimony of sexual violation, particularly as part of a larger movement among victims/survivors, but nevertheless has not been sufficiently analyzed in scholarly examinations of the movement. Moreover, I argue that insofar as the uniquely epistemic harm that results from a variety of oppressive epistemic phenomena (namely, testimonial injustice, gaslighting, and testimonial smothering) are serious and enduring, the nature of this harm and its effects on victims/survivors are worth attending to in their own right. More precisely, I contend that an adequate understanding of the various harms experienced by victims/survivors of sexual violation demands an exploration of this particular category of harm. Doing so helps to elucidate a morally significant dimension of a rapidly growing movement. The paper will proceed as follows. In section I, I will contextualize the philosophical concept of epistemic injustice as it has developed in feminist and social epistemology literatures.5 I will then describe three distinct forms that epistemic injustice can take, all of which are prevalent in the era of the #MeToo movement. In section II, I will draw out the harms of the three types of epistemic injustice detailed in section I. Importantly, I will show how these harms are serious and enduring not only for those victims/survivors who experience them qua individuals, but also for victims/survivors as a group, whose credibility is collectively undermined as doubt pervades at social and political levels. This, I con-tend, also has important social and political consequences, particularly for shaping the backdrop in which these conversations are happening. With analyses of the epistemic phenomena and their related harms in hand, in section III, I examine one recent case, that of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's testimony of sexual violation against then United States Supreme Court nominee (now United States Supreme Court Justice), Brett Kavanaugh.

      "abstract": "Soundness of mind at the time of committing an offence is complementary to mental maturity as a condition for the criminal capacity of the perpetrator and is thus a condition for the criminality of his act. Accordingly, the perpetrator's mental disorder 1 limits the criminality of his act, although not every such disorder has such radical legal consequences. If the disorder is cognitive, it must be such as to prevent the person from understanding the physical or social meaning of his conduct: if it is volitional, it must be such as to prevent him, at the time of his act, from choosing between performing the act and refraining from doing so. These are symptoms of mental disorder that negatives the criminal capacity of a person, and each of them is a necessary, but not a sufficient, condition. It is essential :that this be due to a disease of the mind or an organic defect of reason. The disorder in question is therefore a radical one, and one that is also chronic if not permanent in nature, as opposed to temporary or less deep-rooted conditions such as a disturbed state, a trauma or emotional condition, impulsiveness in certain matters or urges that deviate from the normal in certain areas.",

      "title": "PHYSIOLOGICAL FACTORS AND PERSONALITY IN CHILDREN1",
      "abstract": "One aspect of the study of individual differences in children which we feel is tremendously important is an appraisal of differences in physiological behavior in response to stress. I use the term stress to include any environmental impact or stimulus, either exogenous or endogenous. The running of the roo-yard dash is, therefore, an example of a physical stress. The initial efforts of a parent to condition a 6-or 7-months-old infant's bowel action is also a stress situation for the infant, in this instance what might be called an emotional stress. The effort of the parent to make the growing child conform in his increasing social and physical contacts to a pattern which is acceptable and not too disturbing to the parents is in reality the application of a whole battery of successively applied stresses to which the child reacts, not only in terms of overt behavior but also with greater or lesser degrees of change in various aspects of body function. The infant who is too abruptly weaned reacts to his frustration not only with anxiety, irritability, and hostility; but also very probably with changes in the peristaltic rate of his intestine; in the vascularity of his kidneys and therefore their rate of excretion; in changes in heart rate, blood pressure, perspiration, and in many other ways. The birth of a little brother or sister into the family may create a very important stress situation for a child, as may entrance to school, or having a fight with the little boy down the street. The whole social and emotional adjustment of the child is accomplished through a series of environmental stresses or impacts, and in response to each of these stresses there may be a greater or lesser degree of modification of many of the biochemical and physiological processes of the body; changes which may be momentary or very prolonged in their nature. They are an integral and highly important part of the behavior of the child as a whole organism in his life situation. They cannot be dissociated from other aspects of his behavior. A knowledge of individual differences in this somatic component of stress response is not only essential for an adequate understanding of social behavior, but it is also essential to the medical man who is responsible for maintaining the health and physical effectiveness of the individual. Perhaps the posing of some of the questions which evolve from a consideration of this field will help you in grasping the scope and significance of an understanding of the physiological components of emotion in response to stress.

This latter function of architectural design has strong but modifiable effects on social behaviour and users' mood and productivity and, to some extent, design features also affect health and wellbeing. Too often, however, these important sources of influence are ignored or not recognized, despite repeated demonstrations of these effects. While much remains to be done, research has identified several architectural features that appear to be associated with mood and health. Design characteristics or the way space is structured, presence or absence of windows and illumination all appear to affect people. For some features, the relationship to health is indirect (e.g. small, crowded work spaces may result in stress that may in turn affect health) while for other features the relationship to health is more direct (e.g. eye strain from poor lighting, illness from exposure to fumes).",

This has been called negative magical contagion, an implicit belief in the transmission of essence by physical contact. Alternatively, individuals may avoid a negatively contaminated object because: 1) the object is a strong reminder of the original contagion source (association account); or 2) the act of interacting with the object signals specific information about the self (social communication account). We report that: 1) people often prefer to interact with an entity that they believe is more associated with a negative source rather than an entity that is less associated but has made physical contact with the same negative source; 2) while an associative account requires that contact enhances association, a study of memory for visual pairings of objects indicates that when objects are touching, their associative link (recall) is no greater than when they are in proximity; and 3) subjects continue to show aversion to (prefer to wear gloves to handle) an object that contacted a negative entity even if they are handling the object in order to physically destroy it, hence strongly signaling their rejection of that object. Association and social communication are at best partial accounts for contagion effects.",

      "abstract": "In simple mechanical events, our visual system is able to automatically infer the causal stucture of events and yield causal impressions. Physical cues (especially spatiotemporal features of the display) are found to be the key factors of the causal perception. Here we demonstrate that cues of a completely different domain – the social cues -- also impact the causal perception of physical events: the causally ambiguous events are more likely to be perceived as causal if the faces super-imposed on the objects change from neutral to fearful. This effect has following three major properties: (1) the effect is caused by the social information, because it disappears when the faces are inverted or when the expression-changes are unreasonable; (2) merely the change of basic physical features, such as color and shape, can not influence the causal perception; (3) the social cues are integrated in a temporal window different from physical cues; (4) the social cues impact the perception process rather than the decision process as the impact also appears in the causality-induced illusion. These findings suggest that the visual system also relies on social information to infer the causal structure of the physical world. Meeting abstract presented at VSS 2012",

      "title": "Products as Pals: Engaging with Anthropomorphic Products Mitigates the Effects of Social Exclusion",
      "abstract": "Feeling left out has been shown to trigger primal, automatic responses in an attempt to compensate for threats to social belongingness. Such responses typically involve reconnection with other human beings. However, four experiments provide evidence that exposure to or interaction with anthropomorphic consumer products (i.e., products featuring characteristics of being alive through design, interaction, intelligence, responsiveness, and/or personality) can also satisfy (at least partially) social needs, ultimately mitigating previously documented effects of social exclusion. Specifically, interacting with anthropomorphic (vs. nonanthropomorphic) products following social exclusion reduces (1) the need to exaggerate the number of one’s current social connections, (2) the anticipated need to engage with close others in the future, and (3) the willingness to engage in prosocial behavior. These effects are driven by a need for social assurance, rather than positive affect. Moreover, an important boundary condition exists: drawing attention to the fact that an anthropomorphic product is not actually alive (i.e., the product does not provide genuine human interaction) limits its ability to fulfill social needs. Thus, in a time when consumer products are becoming increasingly anthropomorphic in design and function, the results reveal potentially important consequences for human-to-human relationships.",

      "abstract": "Emotions like embarrassment or remorse are experienced as such because of our perceptions about how current events are affecting our self-esteem or our status as a pillar of the community. This then offers us a third reason why machines do not experience emotions. From the perspective, emotional responses are able to act quickly to interrupt ongoing cognitive activity (fear of a charging bull interrupts our musings on a country walk). This automaticity of emotional response may apply to emotional expression too. Part of the functional value of emotional expression is that, for most of us most of the time, it is an accurate reflection of our internal states and thus can be trusted by an observer. Failures at a cognitive level to recognise all the schemas being activated by an emotional episode may prolong emotional responses. From an evolutionary perspective, emotions probably developed as part of responses by the individual to threats in the environment.",

      "title": "The Peculiar Temporality of Violence: a Source of Perplexity about Social Power",
      "abstract": "Abstract Most national myths of origin begin with some transcendent or sacrificial story of violent revolution, warfare or liberation. This is also true of many origin myths of ethnic, tribal or other forms of social identity. This makes it appear that some act of violence is the cause of their coming into being. This paper argues that this is an artefact of the temporal 'peculiarity' of violence. Violent events, it is argued, are essentially unpredictable even when statistically probable. This means that violence is only 'visible' after the fact, and rarely before and that plausible causal models can rarely be constructed in advance. Violence is always seen in retrospect, then, and where it has caused significant death and destruction, it requires that we begin to make sense of what caused it. Unlike other planned or and emotionally charged social interactions (such as eating, sexuality, ritual) acts of violence interrupt (disrupt, breach, rupture, break, etc.) and terminate parts or all of previous social relations. Since the cause of violence can only be assigned retrospectively, this means that we must (re-)construct the past in a way that allows us to make sense of it. Where some violent event is followed by the eventual emergence of a new identity, the new identity is often explained as having 'originated' in violence. This implies that violence caused the new social identity in some way, and that it functions as a political instrument. But violence can only create a void, and is chaotic. After violence, we require the (re-)telling of the past in a new way. This makes violence appear at the beginning of narratives of origin, but does not imply that violence caused these identities. Since large scale violence leads cultural loss and to large scale social (re)construction, narratives of identity tend to begin at these moments in time. This account of violence seeks, therefore, to undermine the notion that violence is an efficient or final cause of social forms.",

      "abstract": "This article discusses the issues that allow us to say that the psychological consequences after nuclear weapons tests form a typical model of personality. It was characterized by long-term distress, which is manifested mainly by somatic complaints. This model takes on a chronic form. In individuals under conditions of radio-ecological stress, psychological protective mechanisms were violated and states of despair, depression, and confusion arose. Their systems of interpersonal relationships were violated, there was a narrowing of the sphere of vital interests and reduction of adaptive capacity. An analysis of the literature data devoted to the study of the effect of ionizing radiation on the psychological characteristics of the personality as a whole showed that under the influence of adverse environmental factors changes in the personality structure occur and the following personality characteristics appear, such as anxiety, aggression, rigidity, which in turn violate adaptation human life. Damaging factors affect people not so much at once, but for a long time. Some authors believe that mental disorders that occur after an environmental radiation disaster are formed not only due to&nbsp;the direct or indirect action of physical factors, but also as a result of the inclusion of somatopsychic or psychosomatic mechanisms directly related to the impact of the disaster. Key words: adverse environmental factors, anxiety, psycho-emotional stress, socio-psychological tension, depression, environmental consciousness.",

Wandering is a single-minded determination to walk that is unresponsive to persuasion. The behavioural definition distinguishes between wandering with risk and wandering as nuisance, as well as interpreting walking as wandering if the behaviour is to excess, even though there is no risk or disturbance to others. Separation anxiety motivates those with dementia to cling to this other person, or if the person with dementia is removed to another setting in order to give their family respite from the suffocating pressure of being trailed, they will attempt to leave so they may seek the whereabouts of those significant others. A person with dementia may become confused in an attempt to find somebody who or something that is unobtainable because it resides in their past.",

      "abstract": "To summarize, the placebo effect occurs if and only if: 1) the patient is a thinking, experiencing, conscious, belief-holding subject; 2) the patient is a member of a culture; 3) the patient has symptoms; 4) the patient stands in a special relation with others who are recognized by the surrounding culture, and by the medical culture, as expert healers or medical authorities; 5) the patient is administered a treatment for his or her disease or disorder by a medical authority or expert healer; 6) the patient's disorder or disease is changed; 7) the change in the patient's disorder or disease is not caused by the hypothesized characteristic factors of the treatment; 8) the change in the disorder or disease is caused by the incidental factors of the treatment.There are several advantages of this definition over Shapiro's, Grünbaum's, and Brody's. First, it recognizes (with Bootzin and Caspi [2002]) the synergistic, multidimensional, and interpersonal nature of the placebo effect. A placebo is not a static and discrete thing like a sugar pill; it is more like an event than a thing. Moreover, the placebo effect is not, strictly, ‘inside the head’ of the patient. It is a culturally situated and interpersonally constituted event; no one responds to placebos in a social and cultural vacuum. Second, the defini tion preserves the centrality accorded to patients’ beliefs in the placebo effect, while also emphasizing (unlike the other definitions) the role of patient affect and conscious awareness; the placebo effect is made possible by the complex interplay of belief, hope, expectation, and emotions, among other variables. Third, the definition is more explicit than the other definitions in what it rules out as possible placebo responders. Anything that is not a conscious, experiencing, belief-holding and culturally situated subject is not a placebo responder. Fourth, the definition offers a more robust and detailed account of what Grünbaum sparingly calls patients’ ‘life processes’ and what Brody sparingly calls ‘healing context’.",

      "abstract": "The author is a professionally trained mathematician, physicist and engineer. His view of health and medicine is similar to his past experience on designing a physical object, such as a building structure or a working machine, which he calls an “object”. The object’s strength or its expected lifespan is similar to the health conditions and longevity of a human being based on the following three key factors: (1) The original strength of the object’s material which is similar to the genetic factors of a human body. (2) The engineering design and site construction of this object are similar to the fundamental influential causes, including lifestyle details, life-long habits, and environmental factors, on the human health. Among those external causes, if the author has to pick up one category which has the most influence above of all that is the “food”. (3) The object endures different operational problems due to external forces or impacts which are similar to various diseases suffered by humans. After the object experiences external forces or impacts, we use some structural reinforcements to fix the building’s damaged cracks or replace the malfunctioned part of the machine. These engineering actions are similar to the “medical treatments” doctors provide patients. The medical treatments, including medication interventions (oral drugs or biochemical injections), necessary surgeries, or certain organ transplants are similar to the engineering repair of the damaged object. This article emphasizes the relationship between causes and results such as symptoms of diseases. It particularly addresses the inter-relationship of 5 selected diseases: cancers, cardiovascular diseases (CVD), chronic kidney diseases (CKD), diabetic retinopathy (DR), and type 2 diabetes (T2D), where the most important cause for most diseases is “food”. This food category in his study contains 25 defined elements include input data of food are collected via the developed iPhone APP. There are 5 elements for “Food Quantity”: breakfast amount, lunch amount, dinner amount, amount of between-meals snacks and fruits, and the average daily food consumption amount. In addition, there are 20 selected elements for “Food Quality” (see Figure 1). The combined Food score is the average value of both food quantity score and food quality score.",

      "title": "Influence of Spirituality on Quality of Life among Adults",
      "abstract": "The English word 'spirit' is derived from the Latin word 'spiritus' which means air, life or courage. Referring to this concept it may be said that spirituality is a way to discover the meaning of our life and to live with a faith that provides courage to face adverse circumstances. It is a subjective and elusive phenomenon that enables people to find out the reason of their existence. Many people confuse spirituality with religiosity but spirituality is a broader, overarching domain that may include religiosity, but religiosity is not a necessary element of spirituality (Cooper- Effa, Blount, Kaslow, Rothenberg, & Eckman, 2001 ; Estanek, 2006). Religion refers to the means and methods (i.e., rituals or prescribed behaviors) of the search that receive validation and support from within an identifiable group of people. According to Koenig, McCullough and Larson (2001) is the personal quest for understanding answers to ultimate questions about life, about meaning, and about relationship to the sacred or transcendent, which may (or may not) lead to or arise from the development of religious rituals and the formation of community. It may be said that spirituality is a set of beliefs and practices that can result in a life changing path that makes a person's life meaningful, purposeful. Spirituality has always been viewed as an important factor in realizing an adequate quality of life. Spirituality has been regarded as something that contributes to human flourishing, something that increase the quality of life. For instance Levin(2001) pointed out that spirituality engenders our emotions, thoughts, and beliefs that alleviate distress. Kass (1996) is one of the opinion that tapping one's spiritual core can boast self concept.It is difficult to point out that the term 'quality of life' is used by whom but the term got some references at 9th World Congress of Sociology held at Uppsala in the year 1978 (Szalai,1980;p.7).Quality of Life covers wider aspects of one's life like family, physical health, psychological health, social wellbeing, work etc. Quality of life is the feeling of overall life satisfaction, as determined by the mentally alert individual whose life is being evaluated (Meeberg, 1993, p. 37). The individual's subjective psychological outlook in the presence or absence of physiological and functional burden determines the individual's perceived quality of life (Burckhart & Anderson, 2003; Murdaugh, 1997). Quality of Life refers to a subjective evaluation which is embedded in a cultural, social and environmental context.Purpose of the studyThe present study was designed to assess the spirituality and quality of life of adults.Objectives of the study* To assess the quality of life of high and low spiritual groups;* To determine whether level of spirituality affects Quality of Life.Hypotheses of the study* There exists no significant difference between the quality of life of high and low spiritual groups.* There will be no significant effect of level of spirituality on Quality of Life.MethodParticipantsThe participants of this study was consisted of 60 adults selected from Aligarh city. The adult included the sample were in the age range of 35 to 45 years. The selection of the subjects was based on purposive sampling technique.InstrumentsDaily Spiritual Experiences Scale: It was constructed by Lynn G. Underwood & Jeanne A. Teresi was used. It is consist of 16 items to be rated on 6 point Likert scale ranging from many times a day, to never or almost never. The minimum and maximum scores that can be obtained on item 1 to 14 are 14 and 85 respectively.World Health Organization QOL Instrument: The scale developed by WHOQOL Group was administered.

In medicine, trauma means a physical injury caused by impact, force, or object penetrating the skin. In psychology, psychological trauma refers to an emotional or psychological injury, usually resulting from an extremely stressful or life‐threatening situation. It is common to differentiate between man‐made trauma or disasters and natural disasters. Man‐made is further differentiated between trauma resulting from accidents or unintended damage, loss and breakdown of systems, and trauma resulting from the ultimate betrayal as in sexual abuse and violence against children, and the intentional infliction of severe pain and systematic destruction of human mind and dignity as in torture. As will become clear, intentions, meanings, and understanding are important elements in the context of psychological trauma.

      "abstract": "For humans, annoying noise is any sound that ‘‘disturbs, displeases, troubles, or irritates.’’ In humans, the experience of annoyance is a metric, obtained by self-reporting. In animals, however, biologists can only measure behavioral reactions or physiological events. Based on such measures, three classes of negative reactions to noise have been identified. The first is aversion caused by relatively automatic physical reactions, such as the startle. Unequivocal measures of aversion include learned avoidance, behavioral suppression, and irritability. The second can best be described as motivation to eliminate interference with function. Noise masking is an example of interference with function, and the response can be quantified by work animals are willing to do to overcome the masking noise. Finally, animals can become more defensive in the presence of noise. This change in psychological state is measured by increased levels of vigilance or arousal, increased activity, species-typical defensive behaviors, or attacks on the noise source. Although humans typically empathize most with the first reaction, aversion, interference with function or perpetual defensiveness have similar, if not greater, impact in the long-term. Predictions of impact on both humans and animals will improve with accurate measurements of these biologically meaningful responses to annoying noise.",

      "title": "Science of Odor as a Potential Health Issue",
      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Historically, unpleasant odors have been considered warning signs or indicators of potential risks to human health but not necessarily direct triggers of health effects. However, citizen complaints to public health agencies suggest that odors may not simply serve as a warning of potential risks but that odor sensations themselves may cause health symptoms. Malodors emitted from large animal production facilities and wastewater treatment plants, for example, elicit complaints of eye, nose, and throat irritation, headache, nausea, diarrhea, hoarseness, sore throat, cough, chest tightness, nasal congestion, palpitations, shortness of breath, stress, drowsiness, and alterations in mood. There are at least three mechanisms by which ambient odors may produce health symptoms. First, symptoms can be induced by exposure to odorants (compounds with odor properties) at levels that also cause irritation or other toxicological effects. That is, irritation—rather than the odor—is the cause of the health symptoms, and odor (the sensation) simply serves as an exposure marker. Second, health symptoms from odorants at nonirritant concentrations can be due to innate (genetically coded) or learned aversions. Third, symptoms may be due to a copollutant (such as endotoxin) that is part of an odorant mixture. Objective biomarkers of health symptoms must be obtained, however, to determine if health complaints constitute health effects. One industry that is receiving much attention, worldwide, related to this subject is concentrated animal production agriculture. Sustainability of this industry will likely necessitate the development of new technologies to mitigate odorous aerial emissions. Examples of such “environmentally superior technologies” (EST) developed under the initiative sponsored through agreements between the Attorney General of North Carolina and Smithfield Foods and Premium Standard Farms are described.",

      "abstract": "There are, or very much appear to be, a number of things in the universe with the following characteristics: they are private to any person who is aware of them in a certain way; they seem very possibly to exist only if someone is aware of them in a certain way; they are not literally constituents of states of consciousness; they are not composed of atoms and molecules but may have some physical characteristics such as shape, spatial location, and color; and they are commonly referred to as something mental. Anything that more or less satisfies these conditions I call a secondary mental entity. Secondary mental entities fall into three moderately distinct subcategories. They are (i) sensations proper such as pains, tickles, and itches; (2) emotions proper such as anger, fear, and exhilaration; and (3) perceptionrelated entities such as sense data, images, and afterimages. Those of the third category are obviously more theory-dependent notions than those of the other two; and my calling the members of all three categories entities should be taken initially as only a convenient way of speaking and not as an endorsement or denial of any particular theory as to their nature or existence. In the empiricist tradition in the philosophy of mind, secondary mental entities have usually been taken to be the very essence, or at least paradigmatic, of the realm of the mental while states of consciousness have been largely ignored. (Or, perhaps it would be more nearly accurate to say that many have supposed that states of consciousness can be exhaustively analyzed by secondary mental entities.) For this lamentable state of affairs there are very good historical and very poor philosophical reasons; or so at least I have argued in detail elsewhere.'

      "abstract": "An understanding of behavior is important in any consideration of poultry welfare. Behavior is a good indicator of states of suffering such as fear, frustration, and pain. It might also be possible to use social interactions as indicators of welfare. The possibility of using \"luxury\" behavior, such as play and exploratory behavior, as an indicator of positive emotional states, requires investigation. Important welfare consequences arise from the fact that some behavior may be so strongly motivated as to constitute a \"need\". A behavioral need will arise in the case of behavior, such as nesting, that is controlled largely by internal factors, because these factors will be present no matter what type of environment is provided. Behavior triggered largely by external stimuli, such as responses to predators, will not give rise to a need if the external factors can be removed from the environment. Dustbathing is an example of behavior controlled by complex interactions between internal and external factors; the extent to which this constitutes a need is still being debated. If a behavioral need arises, then it is important that the environment provided allows it to be performed without damage to the performer or other birds. It should also be remembered that birds may need to perform behavior, including appetitive as well as consummatory elements, although the functional consequences of these are no longer required for survival. Finally, the performance of certain behavior leads to an increase in health or physical condition that improves welfare later in life.",

How well things go for someone depends on whether, and to what extent, the things that happen in her life are good or bad for her. A theory of well‐being purports to tell us how to identify the things in a person's life that are basically good or bad for her – good or bad for her in their own right, and not merely on account of causing things that are good or bad for her (as money does), indicating such things (as the results of a blood test might), having such things as parts (as the person's entire life might), or being otherwise related to such things. Roughly speaking, an objective theory of well‐being is one that claims that something can be basically good for a person even if she has no favorable (or “pro‐”) attitude toward it or basically bad for her even if she has no disfavorable (or “con‐”) attitude toward it. Examples of objective theories include theories on which knowledge, moral virtue, or the exercise of distinctively human capacities is a basic good.",

These ensure against nervous breakdown, but are not synonymous with modern education, which views the problems of man as he was or may become, not his reactions as he is. Life is a process of slow adjustment, and must be accepted as it is. If elemental biological facts are not faced squarely serious personal difficulty arises. Conflict to the point of mental depression can be so met as to preserve sound personal judgment on public questions. Individual conscious processes are not so essential to adjustment as is believed: decision is made from well grounded feeling, often not from reason which can be logically detailed. An outstanding example is Abraham Lincoln, whom science cannot explain by his heredity or early experiences. Successful life implies consciousness of the reality of environment, and avoids the visions of intemperate idealism. The student is not taught to know himself, to estimate the present, and to intelligently adjust to immediate circumstances.

      "title": "Sensory States and Sensory Objects",
      "abstract": "Philosophers of Mind often characterize experiences (or sensations) as functional states of an organism. Experiential states-whether somatic states, like having a toothache, or perceptual states, like hallucinating a dagger, are functionally defined in terms of their typical occasions and manifestations (see [4], [14], [16]). Having a toothache is that state which is customarily brought about by damaged or decaying teeth, and which typically results in howls, winces, pain reports, and the like. Being perceptually aware of a dagger is that state characteristically induced in normal observers by retinal irradiation caused by daggers under normal lighting conditions. And so on. That's one way to talk about experience. A well known alternative is the analysis, which embraces a distinction between the act or state of experiencing and the entity which is directly experienced; items such as pains, itches, visual sense-impressions and afterimages are the usual examples of objects with which organisms are, on this view, en rapport during the appropriate experiences. Act-object theories foster well known puzzles: What precisely is the ontological status of sensory objects (whether pains or sense-data)? Do such entities exist when unsensed, or do they just spring into existence concomitant with an appropriate act of experiencing? are they located? How does our knowledge of sensory objects relate to our knowledge of ordinary physical objects? Alternatives to act-object theories, such as the functionalist account, generate fewer metaphysical problems. When the dentist, probing around in my mouth, asks Where exactly is the pain?, we need not construe him as inquiring after the whereabouts of a certain entity, an ache or pain. To have a toothache is to be in a certain experiential state-a state characteristically brought about by damaged dental tissue. When the dentist finds the right tooth-thus sending me through the ceiling-he need not be thought of as having found the place wherein resides a pain; he has rather found the portion of my body causally responsible for my being in the state in question. On such an approach, the phenomenon of",

      "title": "Living through trauma: to bear the unbearable, to speak the unspeakable",
      "abstract": "A traumatic situation can be both cataclysmic and disorganising, while putting the whole existence of the individual to the test. Every trauma causes either minor or major rifts in the psyche, thus putting a strain on the patient’s present, past and future. Specifically, when the traumatic experience remains without adequate mentalization, in an instinctive form, it can severely affect the patient, both psychologically and socially. In this paper, we discuss the dual dimension of the traumatic experience. Firstly, since the psyche cannot elaborate the traumatic event or situation psychologically, only minor symbolic or mental representations are available, and the traumatic content cannot find its place in the patient’s psychic history. Since the trauma cannot be worked through psychologically, it usually comprises a massive experience of deadly anxieties, mixed with somatic and sensorial memories. Secondly, the consequences of the trauma have a social dimension. Individuals may feel disconnected and disengaged from their social existence and identity, alone and unprotected, as trauma can lead to them questioning their social identity. The unearthing of the previous psychic traumas explains why the therapy of traumatised patients demands in-depth, individual therapeutic work. Trauma therefore attacks in a dual manner, setting out to test all the aspects of the individual’s functioning. The therapeutic challenges for working with traumatised children and adolescents are considerable, as the clinical vignettes illustrate.",

      "abstract": "Both sexes suffer the same stresses in the same professional conditions, and there is not a great deal of difference between men and women in the ways each responds. For the purpose of this outline we are only interested in systems in which the person is operating within a totally hostile, unsurvivable environment, while armoured against it by machinery and equipment. Stress may be regarded as having two sources: that caused by (internal) personal predisposition; and that caused by surrounding conditions and circumstances. A human being functions best under stress. Too little and one becomes comatose. Too much and one panics and either makes gross, possibly fatal, errors, or capitulates and hands over to one's Maker. The way in which the human operator functions has a number of electrical analogies. Under stress, which is always present with work-load, influences intrude which are similar to 'noise'. These may result from other people around and about-from system, structural and mechanical failures occuring simultaneously-from within oneself, through fear and anxiety. The authors focus on human beings subjected to high and low static pressures in air or water and the measurement of stress in these circumstances. (13 pages)",

      "abstract": "Everybody is familiar with the symptoms of gastrointestinal stress; in Swedish we are talking about ‘ont i magen’, i.e. abdominal pain as a general expression of anxiety, ‘tappa aptiten’, i.e. loose appetite due to unpleasant feelings and ‘tentamensdiarré, i.e. examination diarrhoea as an expression of the preexamination stress. Since 100s of years man has been characterized as melancholic or choleric, representing a bad or good bile flow, respectively (18). We also talk about the well being after a good dinner including the use of aphrodisiacs to wake up emotions of love. It is very probable that all these old expressions can be related to sensations, which are primitive and possibly already generated in our mind in infancy, when we were fed by our mothers in close relationship with a life almost exclusively consisting of feeding, close warmness of our mother's body, the wordless dialogue to her and sleep (12, 13, 25, 30).It is said that it is impossible for the infant to separate the feelings from bodysensations and obviously cannot express the feelings verbally. It is thus not surprising that early psychological stress results in feeding and sleeping disturbances (10, 23). It is also natural that symptoms from the gastrointestinal tract might be dominating during depression or stress-situations during the early age period of life as well as later on (8, 9).",

      "abstract": "We have long recognized the impact that pain, stress, and distress can have on the welfare of laboratory animals, or for that matter, any animal. Pain and stress can cause distress, and the biologic effects can compromise experimental results (Moberg 1999). For these reasons, we are continually striving to control and ameliorate the effects of pain and stress on laboratory animals. Neither pain nor stress—a part of an animal's life, as they are ours— can ever be totally eliminated. Pain normally serves as a protective function to warn of impending danger and is therefore adaptive. Animals have evolved appropriate biologic strategies to assist them in coping with stress. Thus, pain and stress are not inherently bad for an animal, unless these biologic strategies fail to protect the animal from stress or the biologic cost of coping takes too great a toll on the animal. Then the animal experiences distress and its welfare is threatened. The question is, when does an animal cross over from nonthreatening stress to distress?",

      "abstract": "In all the sciences of human action, account must be taken of processes and phenomena which are devoid of subjective meaning, in the role of stimuli, results, favoring or hindering circumstances. Social action, which includes both failure to act and passive acquiescence, may be oriented to the past, present, or expected future behavior of others. Thus it may be motivated by revenge for a past attack, defense against present, or measures of defense against future aggression. Social action is not identical either with the similar actions of many persons or with every action influenced by other persons. Thus, if at the beginning of a shower a number of people on the street put up their umbrellas at the same time, this would not ordinarily be a case of action mutually oriented to that of each other. Purely affectual behavior also stands on the borderline of what can be considered \"meaningfully\" oriented, and often it, too, goes over the line.",

      "abstract": "Abstract If we have suffered or expect to suffer some wilful injury from a man, or if he is in any way offensive to us, we dislike him; and dislike easily rises into hatred. Such feelings, if experienced in a moderate degree, are not clearly expressed by any movement of the body or features, excepting perhaps by a certain gravity of behaviour, or by some ill-temper. Few individuals, however, can long reflect about a hated person, without feeling and exhibiting signs of indignation or rage. But if the offending person be quite insignificant, we experience merely disdain or contempt. If, on the other hand, he is all-powerful, then hatred passes into terror, as when a slave thinks about a cruel master, or a savage about a bloodthirsty malignant deity. Most of our emotions are so closely connected with their expression, that they hardly exist if the body remains passive – the nature of the expression depending in chief part on the nature of the actions which have been habitually performed under this particular state of the mind. A man, for instance, may know that his life is in the extremest peril, and may strongly desire to save it, yet may exclaim as did Louis XVI, when surrounded by a fierce mob, ‘Am I afraid? feel my pulse.’ So a man may intensely hate another, hut until his bodily frame is affected he cannot be said to be enraged.",

      "abstract": "&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Drug (chemical) dependency (the excessive, maladaptive, or addictive use of drugs for no medical purposes&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;despite social, psychological, and physical problems that may arise from such use) is a widespread phenomenon. He (or she) loses freedom of choice. Because of a deep emotional and physical need of addicts to get a drug, their basic activity is inclined to supply &amp;amp;ldquo;chosen&amp;amp;rdquo; substance. Repeating use of substance and its effects, affect their health and interpersonal&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;relationships. Addict denies that. His (or her) possibility to recognize it is limited or ruined. Incorrect pattern of life persists.&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;Cognition of real facts about substance evidently does not protect enough from addiction. In this work effectiveness of a&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;specific, emotional approach in the therapy of addiction has been analyzed. Dependent is faced with another emotion,&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;supposing competitive to those of consuming &amp;amp;ldquo;chosen&amp;amp;rdquo; substance it is. It is expected that strong emotion could activate&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;available, but unattended cognitive contents. Experimental confirmation of working hypothesis is based on emotional&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;approach to alcohol-dependents. They have been faced with an emotional (literal and /or painted) message of anonym child in the connection with children&amp;#039;s heavy firsthand experiences of alcoholism in the family. Facing consequences, marks and products of dependence (firsthand experienced children&amp;#039;s desperation), experiencing strong enough emotional answer, empathy with other child, alcoholic recognizes desperation of his own related. Faced those experiences, he recognizes their own parental role in their family as negative role. Skilled psychiatrist can use that empathy as significant therapeutic factor. This empathy makes dependent able to overcome fear of changes and face the necessity to change their pattern of life. Most of them, without any further explanations have been turned into insight of addiction and oriented toward the therapy and rehabilitation. Results encourage practicing physician to apply this approach, first of all in the initiation of the therapy (realizing contacts, insight into disease) and later in the psychotherapy of any kind of chemical dependence. The key task of the therapist could be to find out specific, strong enough emotion that could be in certain case competitive to those of pleasure connected to the misuse of substance and a strong challenge to initiate cognitive processes and to change executive behaviour.&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;",

      "title": "Xenophobia",
      "abstract": "Abstract Xenophobia is a concept that has not received a great deal of attention in the psychological literature. According to the Oxford English Dictionary , the word consists of two parts: xeno (referring to “guest, stranger, person that looks different, foreigner”) and phobia (“fear, horror or aversion”). Although there has been little research or writing focusing directly on xenophobia, as a concept it raises three important issues that are relevant for research on prejudice and which have received a good deal of attention in the literature. First, prejudice does not necessarily involve negative attitudes towards others (e.g., they are dirty or untrustworthy). Simply perceiving a person as foreign, alien, or strange is sufficient to produce aversion or a preference for reduced contact. Second, xenophobia highlights the fact that prejudice against others involves both cognitive and emotional elements: It involves not only viewing other groups as different along some socially important dimension, but also having an aversive emotional reaction towards that difference. Third, prejudice is often studied within the context of intergroup relations or as attitudes held towards specific social groups; however, prejudice can also involve an aversion to difference per se . Xenophobia highlights the fact that sometimes people show dislike for others simply when they appear different to one's own “kind.” This form of prejudice is anchored in a love of or preference for people who are similar to one's self and an aversion to anyone who differs from one's self. In what follows I will review research and theory that elucidates each of these three central components of xenophobia, therefore providing some grounding for a term that has itself received little empirical investigation.",

      "title": "Ethological strategies for defence in animals and humans: Their role in some psychiatric disorders",
      "abstract": "Ethological strategies for defence in animals and humans are expressed as either aggression or flight behaviour. Aggression is employed by animals during intraspecific competition for resources, mate, territory and acquiring and maintaining social status. It also disperses individuals throughout the biotope. Flight behaviour is used to avoid a source of danger or harm, has both dynamic and static forms, is phylogenetically very old and takes precedence over all other activities including social behaviour. Animals exposed to inescapable threats or attacks exhibit a characteristic defensive strategy, arrested flight, which consists of gaze‐avoidance or cut‐offs, cryptic postures such as immobility and covert surveillance of their surroundings. Arrested flight also occurs in social encounters when submission fails to reduce attacks, and in prey animals when escape from a predator is hampered. Ethological studies show that during interviews, depressed patients exhibit a pattern of non‐verbal behaviour having all the hallmarks of arrested flight. Cut‐off behaviour, which seeks to reduce the input of flight‐evoking stimuli is especially evident in these patients but takes an extreme form, i.e. eye closure, in the gaze‐profiles of paranoid patients. It is proposed that cut‐offs always denote the presence of incipient flight and that arrested flight is a ‘last measure’ defensive strategy in response to inescapable proximal threat. It can arise in humans whenever their escape routes are hampered and characterizes the behaviour of patients suffering from depression. As in animals, different pathways may lead to arrested flight in humans. In humans, defensive mechanisms also operate at the mental level through putative ego defences, the psychological function of which is to preserve self‐esteem by hindering the access of disturbing emotional material into awareness. It is suggested that they function ethologically as mental cut‐offs analogous to the behavioural cut‐offs in animals.",

A mechanism known in psychoanalytic theory as displacement consists in the moving of genital affects from a primary object or function to a secondary one. When displaced associations become attached with sufficient tenacity to the secondary object, the latter may assume the functions of the first and may eventually become a welcome substitute for the primary one in fulfilling certain emotional needs of the organism. Such substitutes are utilized in the unconsciousness of sleep or unconsciously in the waking state.

      "abstract": "Emotion is at times foregrounded by psychonarration and manifested in utterances; more frequently its presence is indicated by somatic indices: by embodied responses and deliberate gestures. This chapter defines 'affect', somatic sensations that function at a preconscious level, and continues by exploring how medieval emotion is written on bodies, thus revealing interior emotional states. The cardiocentric model, in which emotion is understood as focused on the heart, is outlined; affect theory is utilised to unpack how medieval writers understood physical manifestations of emotion as central to contemporary theoretical formulations of the role of will in emotion, as both preconscious and yet bound up in complex cognitive interactive processes. Characters faint, change colour or fall silent, behaviours which register different kinds of feeling as in play. Turning pale, for example, can express fear or anger: precisely which emotion is at stake is crucial for the status of the chivalric male figure; trembling can be equally ambiguous. Certain behaviours – laughing, weeping – fall between the involuntary and deliberate: women can weep on cue, it is suggested, and laughter rarely expresses happiness, but rather triumph. Bodies can also express emotion through deliberate behaviour in the form of gesture: kissing, kneeling, leading by the hand and smiling all indicate different kinds of emotion that is both felt and publicly performed. The strategic deployment of emotive indicia could trump the 'natural' movements of the humours and the spirits within the body, an understanding that problematises the connections between affect, will and motivation.",

      "title": "Canine stress in a nutshell — why does it occur, how can it be recognised, and what can be done to alleviate it?",
      "abstract": "Every item that an animal encounters, whether animate or inanimate, is a stimulus. If an animal has had the opportunity to learn to remain relaxed in the presence of that stimulus (to habituate) the stimulus will be one that, for that specific animal, maintains a state of emotional neutrality. Alternatively, if the stimulus initiates any form of emotional response (whether positive or negative in its nature), the stimulus becomes a stressor. As the majority of domestic dogs live in close proximity to human owners in a socially and physically rich and diverse environment, exposure to stressors is an inevitable part of the domestic dog's life. However, the impact of these stressors can be severely detrimental to both the emotional and physical welfare of the dog. These welfare infringements can place considerable constraints on the affected dog's behavioural repertoire and its capacity to behave in a manner that is consistent with an owner's and the general public's expectations. Such failures to meet behavioural expectations is a common factor in requests for the relinquishment and euthanasia of dogs. A previous article provided a general discussion on stress in companion animals; this article examines the prevalence, recognition, avoidance and resolution of stress in dogs.",

Both ICD-10 and DSM-IV identify three main classes of phobias: specific phobias, social phobia, and agoraphobia. The latter two are often referred to as complex phobias. In specific phobias, the fear is limited to one or more well-de- fined classes of objects or situations: e.g., certain animals, aspects of the natural environment (heights, storms), specific situations (lifts, airplanes) or blood/injuries. Social phobia is characterized by fear of one or more social situations, while agoraphobia is defined by fear of leaving home or of places or situations from which escape may be difficult, including shops, crowds, and public places, or fear of travelling (alone) in trains, buses, or planes. The emphasis in this paper will be on specific phobias and social phobia, since agoraphobia is discussed in another article in this supplement (1).",

      "title": "Hostile, Sexual, and Other Social Behaviour Patterns of the Spice Finch (Lonchura Punctulata) in Captivity",
      "abstract": "Three main groups of social reactions, commonly observed in captive Spice Finches, are the main subjects of this paper. The first group comprises a number of patterns reflecting the Spice Finch's highly gregarious nature and often helping to maintain flock integration: Call Notes, Tail-flicking (a ritualized locomotory intention movement), clumping (roosting or sitting absolutely side by side), and social preening. The Spice Finch's general social behaviour suggests that the gregariousness of the species is due to some motivation partially independent of any other possibly activated tendencies. The same may be of the marked restlessness shown in the early mornings throughout the year. The second group contains many hostile activities : attack, escape, and patterns obviously produced by a simultaneous conflict or combination of attack and escape motivations. Among these last, several stretch postures are particularly interesting : the fact that each of them may frequently occur just before attack, just before escape and in numerous intermediate situations indicates that they are all ambivalent locomotory intention movements similar to one another in every respect except orientation. Another pattern resulting from simultaneously activated attack and escape tendencies, the Ruffle, is a ritualized display. This pattern bears some physical resemblance to friendly social preening invitation and it is tentatively suggested that it helps to avert attack by means of this resemblance. Despite the occasional frequency of Ruffling, and the rarer appearance of certain vocal patterns, Spice Finch hostile behaviour is much less ritualized than that of many other species. This paucity of ritualization, with the accompanying sombreness of plumage and weakness of voice, is probably correlated with the extreme gregariousness - which has probably reduced the need for behaviour patterns conspicuous over long distances. The third group, much the most heterogeneous, comprises sexual activities and other activities more or less closely associated with sexual performances. One such pattern, the masculine Jingle (reminiscent of, but functionally unlike, the true or advertising song of other passerines), is also common in non-sexual situations, and must, again, have some largely independent motivation. Typical and atypical behaviour before, during, and after copulation itself is described in some detail. The pre-copulatory sequence of patterns is almost always elaborate, including unritualized ambivalent postures and movements, ritualized displays, and (possibly) one conventional displacement activity. Another striking pre-copulatory performance, playing with nest-material, seems to result from a type of spark-over or re-routing of motivation very different from the spark-over responsible for conventional displacement activities. This pre-copulatory nest-building is not produced by a surplus of motivation (as would be the case in conventional conflict or thwarting), but apparently, instead, by an insufficiency of sexual motivation, too weak to be expressed in overt sexual acts. The theoretical advantages of such an arrangement are very great. The actual copulation is quick and simple, but there are violent post-copulatory performances. The whole series of patterns before, during, and after copulation can be understood as the result, in both sexes, of simultaneously activated attack, escape, and sexual tendencies of varying strengths, with, in the male, an added simultaneous Jingling tendency.",

It has its own linguistic status and its own lexical base (lexis of destruction). This category and its lexical stock occupy a significant place in the general classification of lexemes of the Russian and Serbian languages. The terms ?destruction? and ?destructiveness? almost always refer to negative, destructive actions, processes or phenomena. The main characteristics of destruction in the broadest sense include: change, deformation, disintegration of something; structural changes under the impact of various forces (physical, mechanical, spontaneous) or humans. The result of destruction is usually the destruction of something (partial or complete). The semantic field of destructiveness contains verbs at its core, and the peripheral part consists of nouns, adjectives, adverbs and other terminological vocabulary with destructive semantics. The central unit of such a verb-centric field is the verb destroy, which forms the semantic basis of many other lexemes in this category.",

      "abstract": "Attachment was discussed as metaphor and as process. In any segment of the life span, attachment labels a complex of an individual’s response patterns controlled by cues and consequences from the appearance and behaviors of another. Any response (e.g., orienting, smiling, even crying) cued by, or differential (preference) responding to, that person can index attachment directly; disorganization patterns and/or concomitant emotion effected by interference with those cued-response systems can index attachment indirectly. Behavioral indicators of attachments of children to others are surveyed, with emphasis on crying cued by a mother’s departures, separations, or absences. These might be understood as outcomes of routine discriminated-operant conditionings effected by that mother’s responding to her infant’s crying. Such cued crying has often been an index of a baby’s attachment to its mother. In a conditioning frame, discriminated responding explains drastic diminutions of cued responses denoting attachment in an attachment figure’s absence, and their marked reoccurrence on that figure’s reappearance; and a concept of inner structure underlying attachment that endures in the absence of the attachment figure is gratuitous. Some risks in using single (or very few) attachment indices are explored.",

If it is one of these things it will more likely than not be a mental something or other; but I do not wish to exclude the possibility that it might be something physical, such as looking stern when he makes a dire threat and means it, or perhaps an increase in the pulse rate. So while I will mostly talk about the possibility that meaning is a mental phenomenon, my remarks will generally apply equally well to the possibility that it is something physical.",

      "title": "Human Suffering as a Challenge for the Meaning of Life",
      "abstract": "When people suffer they always suffer as a whole human being. The emotional, cognitive and spiritual suffering of human beings cannot be completely separated from all other kinds of suffering, such as from harmful natural, ecological, political, economic and social conditions. In reality they interact with each other and influence each other. Human beings do not only suffer from somatic illnesses, physical pain, and the lack of decent opportunities to satisfy their basic vital, social and emotional needs. They also suffer when they are not able to experience and grasp any meaning of life even if such suffering is not quite as obvious as most forms of physical, social and emotional suffering. Suffering from the lack for the sense of the meaning of life is a special form of emotional, cognitive, and spiritual suffering. Although all human beings share the same basic human need for some meaning of life, the fulfilment of this need is highly individual and personal. Although all forms of human suffering can be a challenge to the meaning of life, the personal conditions of suffering usually are a stronger challenge for the meaning of life. Among the personal conditions of human suffering, the Grenzsituationen cannot be cancelled or raised at all, but only accepted and coped with as existential aspects of the conditio humana. According to Karl Jaspers these are: death, suffering, struggling, guilt, and failing. The challenge for human beings to cope with these Grenzsituationen is a way to move from the mere Being-there to true human Existence. 1",

      "title": "Anger and its Management",
      "abstract": "Everybody feels anger from time to time. People have been documented feeling anger since biblical times when God was considered angry. Babies even exhibit signs that are interpreted as anger, such as crying or screaming. Anger is not in any way unique to people. Animals also have the ability to feel and express anger. In our personal lives we get angry over at least one thing on almost a daily basis, whether it is on thejob, with a spouse or loved one, or perhaps with a figure of authority. Anger is a healthy emotion when it is expressed appropriately. When it is not, it can have devastating effects. Anger is at the root of many personal and social problems, e.g. child abuse, domestic violence, physical and verbal abuse and community violence etc. Problematic interpersonal relations may also disrupt employment activities because of the interference of anger on workplace performance. Anger can destroy relationships, obstruct problem solving skills, and increase social withdrawal. Anger also affects our physical health. For example, it can tax our immune system; contribute to headaches, migraines, severe gastrointestinal symptoms, hypertension, and coronary artery disease. Anger is a healthy and valid emotion. But many of us are taught not to express or show our anger. There's no doubt about it: we live in an angry society. Signs that anger abounds are all over the place. There is desk rage, road rage, spousal abuse, sports rage and most recently spam rage. Anger is a worldwide phenomenon and referrals to anger management programs have exploded since. Present paper attempt to explore anger and its remedial aspects in a theoretical context.",

      "abstract": "Individuals avoid objects that have been in physical contact with morally offensive or disgusting entities. This has been called negative magical contagion, an implicit belief in the transmission of essence by physical contact. Alternatively, individuals may avoid a negatively contaminated object because: 1) the object is a strong reminder of the original contagion source (association account); or 2) the act of interacting with the object signals specific information about the self (social communication account). We report that: 1) people often prefer to interact with an entity that they believe is more associated with a negative source rather than an entity that is less associated but has made physical contact with the same negative source; 2) while an associative account requires that contact enhances association, a study of memory for visual pairings of objects indicates that when objects are touching, their associative link (recall) is no greater than when they are in proximity; and 3) subjects continue to show aversion to (prefer to wear gloves to handle) an object that contacted a negative entity even if they are handling the object in order to physically destroy it, hence strongly signaling their rejection of that object. Association and social communication are at best partial accounts for contagion effects.",

      "title": "A COMPARATIVE STUDY OF ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT OF HIGH AND LOW ADJUSTMENT LEVEL STUDENTS",
      "abstract": "Human situation is a constant one. New conditions and problems are constantly setting the individual right from his infancy to his deathbed, and he is invariably engaged in trying to find a satisfactory and pleasurable solution to them by employing his intelligence and other gifts of the mind and body. In other words, life is the name of unceasing process, the process of adjustment. “Adjustment is the process by which a living organism maintains a balance between its needs and the circumstances that influence the satisfaction of these needs” accordingly, the process of adjustment has two primary or main elements: one, the needs of the living organism; and two the conditions of circumstances influencing these needs. These needs can be biogenic, Originating in the society, personal or community, or arising from any other conceivable source. On the other hand, circumstances influencing these needs also can be either inside individual or outside him. Factors within the individuals that influence these needs are his physical and mental states, capacity, attitudes interests, etc. Three Elements in Adjustment An analysis of the process of adjustment of the processes of adjustment will reveal the presence of three main elements: - Motive: The very process of adjustment in the living being is set in motion by the presence within him of some motive or need or requirement. - Thwarting Condition: When the environment does not present any features that tend to become obstacles in the fulfillment of these needs, then the adjustment in natural, facile and effortless, and does not problem in result. However, if circumstances create obstacle in the path of such fulfillment, then the process of adjustment progresses further. -  Varied Responses :  Once the fulfillment of a need has obstructed, individual indulges in various actions, which are a reaction to the obstacle. Such a reaction can be normal just as much as it can be abnormal. -  Solution: Because of these reactions and responses, the individual achieves a degree of adjustment with the circumstances. The problem of adjustment in there by solved. - Motive and adjustment :  Generally speaking, the process of adjustment can be set in motion by any motive.  For example, our physical needs are constantly being manifesting in the form of adjective behavior patterns. However, from our point of view, these needs do not have much importance, for life, itself ceases in the organism, thus obviating all further adjustment activity. Need of study : - present time all people are salves of their problem in presently situations and his determinative life goals. Present time all people have set their life goals to earn a lot of money. In Past time all human being decided his life goal “mocha”. The persons do efforts to gain a lot of money in any situation or from any work .All situation have balanced human behaviors; this work’s main factor is adjustment level. Based on previous research finding conclusion the well adjustable persons have conducted their work very smoothly, and all decisions taken were correct.  From This concepts question arises. What does high adjustment level students achieved on high academic achievement?   Adjustment works normally in every circumstance of human life. Similarly, adjustments on learning achievement would work normally, considering how logical this fact is this study has done. Statement of the problem : - “A comparative study of academic achievement of high and low adjustment level students”",

      "title": "27 Styles in Eating Disorders",
      "abstract": "Defense and coping are important for the perception of reality and for dealing with internal conflicts and with everyday problems. How do we react to unwanted events, to unacceptable wishes, to threatening situations and feelings, and how can we deal with problems without explicit system of coping and defense mechanisms? Defensive operations are-first of all -protective processes that exert control over the interaction between the internal and external world. Social and cultural effects are always inter­ twined with incompatible ideas. Whether we consider defense mechan­ isms to be functions of the mind (like memory or consciousness) or adopt a dynamic energy concept of defense or conceive of it as part of the ego organization, socialization constitutes one of the most import determinants for the development of defense mechanisms and defense organization. Specifically, defenses have been accorded a central role in the currently prominent and intrinsically important category of eating disorders. Eating disorders occur at the rate of 1000: 1 in women and men, respectively. Consequently, we have to look at gender issues. In the literature, defense and coping are typically discussed without reference to gender. In the classical description of defense mechanisms (Freud, 1936), they are viewed as an attempt to repress incompatible idea ... which has come into distressing opposition with one's ego. Haan (1963) described coping processes as actions by the ego that serve to coordinate the person's social, moral, and cognitive structures depending on the situation (cf. Gitzinger, 1988). Gender issues, however, were not expli­ citly taken into account by Haan either.",

      "title": "Joyful by nature: approaches to investigate the evolution and function of joy in non‐human animals",
      "abstract": "The nature and evolution of positive emotion is a major question remaining unanswered in science and philosophy. The study of feelings and emotions in humans and animals is dominated by discussion of affective states that have negative valence. Given the clinical and social significance of negative affect, such as depression, it is unsurprising that these emotions have received more attention from scientists. Compared to negative emotions, such as fear that leads to fleeing or avoidance, positive emotions are less likely to result in specific, identifiable, behaviours being expressed by an animal. This makes it particularly challenging to quantify and study positive affect. However, bursts of intense positive emotion (joy) are more likely to be accompanied by externally visible markers, like vocalisations or movement patterns, which make it more amenable to scientific study and more resilient to concerns about anthropomorphism. We define joy as intense, brief, and event-driven (i.e. a response to something), which permits investigation into how animals react to a variety of situations that would provoke joy in humans. This means that behavioural correlates of joy are measurable, either through newly discovered 'laughter' vocalisations, increases in play behaviour, or reactions to cognitive bias tests that can be used across species. There are a range of potential situations that cause joy in humans that have not been studied in other animals, such as whether animals feel joy on sunny days, when they accomplish a difficult feat, or when they are reunited with a familiar companion after a prolonged absence. Observations of species-specific calls and play behaviour can be combined with biometric markers and reactions to ambiguous stimuli in order to enable comparisons of affect between phylogenetically distant taxonomic groups. Identifying positive affect is also important for animal welfare because knowledge of positive emotional states would allow us to monitor animal well-being better. Additionally, measuring if phylogenetically and ecologically distant animals play more, laugh more, or act more optimistically after certain kinds of experiences will also provide insight into the mechanisms underlying the evolution of joy and other positive emotions, and potentially even into the evolution of consciousness.",

It is impossible to find someone who has never experienced a sense of fear. Anxiety, worry, joy, amazement, anger, sadness, etc. are the same emotionally inseparable manifestations of our spiritual life. Fear is a familiar feeling for everyone. It affects us more than it seems. It is an emotion that has a significant impact on sensory-cognitive processes, a person’s behavior. Strong fearcreates a \"cognitive tunnel\" effect, ie, a person's cognition, moral norms, thinking, and freedom of choice are severely limited. In addition, fear restricts a person's freedom of behavior. The article seeks to elaborate on the origins of fear and the individual feelings that arise as aresult of the onset or expectation of real or imagined insurmountable situations. From the perspective of modern psychology, fear is not always a negative emotional state, although while most experienced situations are provided with a negative color, its positive aspects have also been considered.",

In the later course of life people encounter circumstances that frustrate, humiliate, or grieve them, and these, too, may conceivably distort their personalities. It is convenient to apply the term personal stresses to all such experiences and circumstances that may have a more or less permanently adverse effect on a person's behavior. The term is necessarily a little vague in denotation because of the heterogeneity of the experiences and circumstances, but it is employed in a sense analogous to the use of stress in physics; it disregards the person's reaction to the experience or circumstances, which, on the same analogy, would be termed a strain.

      "title": "Wear and Tear - Mechanical",
      "abstract": "The focus of this chapter is on the long term wear and tear, or aging, of the mechanical subsystem of a spacecraft. The mechanical subsystem is herein considered to be the primary support structure (as in a skeleton or exoskeleton) upon which all other spacecraft systems rest, and the associated mechanisms. Mechanisms are devices which have some component that moves at least once, in response to some type of passive or active control system. For the structure, aging may proceed as a gradual degradation of mechanical properties and/or function, possibly leading to complete structural failure over an extended period of time. However, over the 50 years of the Space Age such failures appear to be unusual. In contrast, failures for mechanisms are much more frequent and may have a very serious effect on mission performance. Just as on Earth, all moving devices are subject to normal (and possibly accelerated) degradation from mechanical wear due to loss or breakdown of lubricant, misalignment, temperature cycling effects, improper design/selection of materials, fatigue, and a variety of other effects. In space, such environmental factors as severe temperature swings (possibly 100's of degrees C while going in and out of direct solar exposure), hard vacuum, micrometeoroids, wear from operation in a dusty or contaminated environment, and materials degradation from radiation can be much worse. In addition, there are some ground handling issues such as humidity, long term storage, and ground transport which may be of concern. This chapter addresses the elements of the mechanical subsystem subject to wear, and identifies possible causes. The potential impact of such degradation is addressed, albeit with the recognition that the impact of such wear often depends on when it occurs and on what specific components. Most structural elements of the mechanical system typically are conservatively designed (often to a safety factor of greater than approximately 1.25 on yield for unmanned spacecraft) but do not have backup structure due to the added mass this would impose, and also due to the fact that structural elements can be accurately modeled mathematically and in test. Critical mechanisms or devices may have backups, or alternate work-arounds, since characterization of these systems in a 1g environment is less accurate than structure, and repair in-space is often impossible.",

      "abstract": "Man cannot adapt himself to the complicated environment only with the physical equilibrium created through the physiological or biological processes of growth. However, it is possible for him to adapt himself well to the environment, when the psychological equilibrium be formed on the basis of biological equilibrium. Man acts in various ways in order to maintain such equilibrium. Personality develops itself into a new form through adjustment to the environment, and also through creating a new environment. Human needs should be met adequately to achieve the desirable adaptation to the environment through the continuos processes of control and creation for adjustment. When human needs not be met or met to excess, an emotional instability would result, that is the cause of maladjustment. Psychological mechanism is used to overcome emotional needs and tensions, while anatomical mechanism isused to protect the organization of human body from maladjustment. Especially psychological mechanism appears differently according to the individual; as it were, it appears as the from of mechanisms, of escape, defense, and aggressiveness. Among these there are those accepted socially and those rejected socially. The Mechanisms accepted socially lead to the low level of personality development. Therefore, guidance programs should be made so that pupils may not take the unacceptable mehcanisms.\r\n The following methods are recommended to guide pupils in terms of adjustment mechanism:\r\n 1. To eliminate factors for frustration through controlling conditions of envioronments.\r\n 2. To give the opportunities to evaluate himself, so that he may know whether or not behaviors to meet his needs be acceptable sociallly.\r\n 3. To train perseverance in case the pupil be frustrated psychologically.\r\n 4. To foster ability to determine the adequate standard of psychological needs.",

      "abstract": "One of the major concerns of this book is with those properties of people which are intertwined with their sociality, yet are irreducible to it. These properties make for personal identity and their emergence is the subject of this chapter and the next. Introspectively, we are all constantly aware of the main property upon which this emergent process depends. As human beings we know that we live a rich inner life: that we are in continuous communion with ourselves and that we engage in a continual running commentary with the events going on around us. We are aware of how our inner lives monitor our responses to external situations in which we find ourselves and indeed modify some of the circumstances to which we willingly expose ourselves, be these natural, practical or social. For example, it is doubtful if there is a (normal) human being who is unaware of an internal dialogue which silently voices sentiments like, ‘Isn't he ever going to stop talking?’, ‘Careful, that truck's pulling out’, or, ‘I can't face that again.’ Moreover, we all also know that these are not just idle commentaries.",

      "abstract": "Every individual experience a variety of different emotions during a lifetime. This can range from feelings of happiness, anger, love, jealously, pity, sadness, agony, hate and others. Emotion is what provides individuals with a sense of being alive. They are a response to life’s experiences and situations that we encounter through a combination of feelings, thoughts, and action. They constitute towards human behavior and to a certain extent ethical behavior is based on emotion (Goleman, 1995). Human emotion can be separated into two categories including positive emotion and negative emotion that is further accompanied by both physiological and psychological changes. Positive emotions help us to develop joy, interest, gratitude, love in which the person always feel good and remains active with physiological and psychological state of mind. However, when we have negative vibes around then the physiological and psychological state of mind can lead to changes in body gestures, facial expressions, movement of the muscles. In addition, non-voluntary reactions like changes in heat rate, increased pulse rate, high blood pressure and perspiration. The effects of negative emotions always weaken your body’s immune system and give you stress, anxious, or upset and lead to demotivation. The demotivation factor will take you loneliness, frustration, anger, emptiness, fear etc. So, one of the best ways to live life positively is to control our emotions by learning and developing Emotional Intelligence in our life.",

      "title": "[The challenges of the ethics of personalism to clinical toxicology].",
      "abstract": "The fields of philosophical anthropology and the ethics of personalism overlap in the area of many difficult personal situations involving clinical toxicology. These therapeutic situations need an integral, multidimensional, and personal approach for both the patient and the toxicologist. This means that man is treated not only as a physical (biological) being but also there is an appreciation for the mental sphere, which includes rational, emotional, and spiritual elements while not forgetting that the human person is also part of the human community. Studying such an individual's personal decision as suicide, we must realize that it's not just physiological or biochemical poisons but also includes the poisoning of the psyche, as well as poisoning relationships with loved ones (family), poisoning social relations (in school or the workplace) and poisoning the spirit, in other words, there is no meaning in life itself, nor the meaning of God's existence, nor the meaning of faith, hope and love. Not only is there a greater \"variety of poisons\" than before, they are much more extensive and deep. For example, we can name environmental pollution, industrial poisons, chemical waste, genetic modification, powerful medications, or even the toxic social environment of evil ideas, malicious manipulation of the human mind (destructive religious sects). In approaching the challenges of clinical toxicology, the doctor must not only be a specialist in chemistry, biochemistry and pharmacology. What then is of future of toxicology because of this human dimension (anthropological, ethical and spiritual) of this teaching? As today marks the occasion of the 45th anniversary of the Clinic of Toxicology CM UJ, should we shape the ethos of young doctors who want to deal with toxicology seriously?",

      "title": "Seven Modalities of Silence",
      "abstract": "Abstract Silence is analysed in seven concealed modalities: the unthinkable, the unspeakable/unsayable, the ineffable, the inarticulable, the unnoticeable, the unknowable, and the unconceptualizable. The unthinkable mainly refers to unacceptable or highly unlikely occurences. The unspeakable is considered too repulsive or outrageous to voice. It both overlaps with and differs from the unsayable inasmuch as the latter can signify something that cannot be said because there is no possibility of either saying or naming it. The ineffable often relates to sacred or divine qualities, or approached through Derrida’s notion of différance. The inarticulable can follow from a deficiency of linguistic expression or be identified in psychoanalysis as repression, blockage, or trauma. The first four modalities concern the ways in which silence intervenes in and manages human expressiveness. The sixth and seventh relate to silences at the very limits of epistemological or ontological reach. The unknowable pertains to a fundamental lack of information, while the unconceptualizable refers to the unavailability of an intellectual and cultural apparatus through which certain kinds of knowledge can be processed. The fifth—the unnoticeable—is an outlier both to the first four and to the last two. It shares with the former the presence of epistemological constraints on conveying knowledge. It shares with the latter the presence of circumstances that sever the accessibility of human agency to evidence or knowledge. They are reflected in Bourdieu’s phrase ‘it goes without saying because it comes without saying’.",

      "title": "Phobia",
      "abstract": "The concept of “phobia” suggests something more than “fear,” conveying instead an intensely anxious reaction to a specific stimulus that verges on the excessive. The term was first recorded in the post‐classical Latin formulation “hydrophobia,” which designated rabies through its sufferers' typical display of fear in proximity to water. This supplied the model for later formations in English, which occurred in fairly limited instances during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries before appearing in abundance from the nineteenth century onward. In particular, it has been observed that “the last three decades of the nineteenth century were phobia's belle époque ” (Trotter 2004: 463). Whereas fear is an instinctual part of our brain physiology, a life‐preserving process rooted in the amygdala's function in processing negative emotions, a sufferer of phobia “experiences a marked, persistent, and excessive or unreasonable fear when in the presence of, or when anticipating an encounter with, the specific object or situation” (APA 1994: 444). In an almost Gothic moment of possession, phobia invades and engulfs the body, infiltrating the mind and disrupting normal mental associations – a process acutely captured in William James' description of the response of an agoraphobic, who “is seized with palpitation and terror at the sight of any open place or broad street […] He trembles, his knees bend, he may even faint at the idea” (1890: ii. 421). Over a quarter of a century later, Sigmund Freud's Introductory Lectures on Psychoanalysis (1916) pointed out the disproportion between the triviality of stimulus and the immensity of response in the phobic sufferer.",

In turn, they provide another reflection upon the illness situation, so that it, too, is once more re-figured … Because it is always reflected through social realms, and because the reflection of these realms, one against the other, is the way in which individuals display their worth and competence, then being ill is not a specific state, but an inflection of the whole of the person's being.(Radley, 1999a, pp. 19–22)",

It was characterized by long-term distress, which is manifested mainly by somatic complaints. This model takes on a chronic form. In individuals under conditions of radio-ecological stress, psychological protective mechanisms were violated and states of despair, depression, and confusion arose. Their systems of interpersonal relationships were violated, there was a narrowing of the sphere of vital interests and reduction of adaptive capacity. An analysis of the literature data devoted to the study of the effect of ionizing radiation on the psychological characteristics of the personality as a whole showed that under the influence of adverse environmental factors changes in the personality structure occur and the following personality characteristics appear, such as anxiety, aggression, rigidity, which in turn violate adaptation human life. Damaging factors affect people not so much at once, but for a long time. Some authors believe that mental disorders that occur after an environmental radiation disaster are formed not only due to the direct or indirect action of physical factors, but also as a result of the inclusion of somatopsychic or psychosomatic mechanisms directly related to the impact of the disaster.

      "title": "The taste of the sound or the sound of the taste? How sounding packaging influence food perception",
      "abstract": "One of the most common multisensory experiences in everyday life is eating. The flavour of a food is defined, in human brain, by a unique combination of taste, aroma, consistency, temperature, sounds and visual aspects. In this context, all the sensory properties of a product, i.e. not just the taste properties, influence our testing experience, as well as our tasting experiences can alter the perception of the other sensory properties. But even if some senses such as sight and taste have been deeply examined in this situation, other senses such as hearing still represents a quite unexplored potential in the current scientific research. The influence of auditory aspects on foods and drinks might take place at different stages of the food experience. In fact, auditory aspects typically considered as primarily perceived when we are consuming food (i.e. prime-coincident sounds such as first bite, or late-coincident sounds such as the mastication sound) have been proved affecting instead the food intake process even since the very first approach to food itself (i.e. anticipatory sounds such as the packaging sound) or after the food intake (i.e. post-prandial sounds such as those produced clearing the table). A first experimental test to explore the relation between consumption sound due to the food packaging and taste-perceived food qualities will be spread in this research presentation, in order to investigate this sound- taste connection, excluding the other senses. The first results of a test conducted on yogurt pots and jars will be presented. Three widely commercialized yogurt pots and jars characterized by a similar cylindrical meta-shape, but differing in materials (glass, clay and polypropylene, respectively) were selected as case studies. Thirty subjects mixed between experts in sensory analysis and naive took part to the test. Each participant was asked to taste a spoon of yogurt under three different conditions, i.e. taking it from each one of the three packaging. Both the yogurt and the spoon used for the tasting were the same in the three conditions, and the food was submitted always at the same temperature. The test was unfolded in random order and each pot was hidden in a box in order to exclude the visual component. The pots were filled with a standardized little quantity of food, making the subject produce some noise with the spoon to the containers' sides to collect the yogurt from the pots. Before and after each test, subjects were asked to prepare themselves to the taste by eating a piece of cracker and drinking a sip of water. After each taste, a questionnaire was administrated to the participants, asking them to evaluate on a 1 to 9-points Likert scale the tasted yogurts on the following items: sweetness, sourness, tastiness, thickness, genuineness, calorificness, craftsmanship and expensiveness. Median and interquartile ranges of the collected data were calculated, comparing the test unfolded with each yogurt pot. A first comparison on each attribute obtained with the three pots showed that little but significant differences can be observed in the evaluation of each item in relation with the sound variation. For example, yogurt seems to be perceived as sweeter when contained into the glass jar, rather than into the plastic or clay pots. Furthermore, the product is perceived also as more expensive when it is contained in glass or clay-sounding jars. Finally, clay-sounds seem to positively affect on craftsmanship and genuineness perception. A subsequent global comparison on the results of all the attributes obtained with the three pots confirmed how the sounds produced by spoons rubbing against the different jars affect on food perception by consumers. Finally, it can be assumed that both taste and quality perception can be influenced by packaging sounds. For this reason, several other studies can be hypothesized in future in order to further investigate these or other synaesthesia between sound and taste. The present experimental investigation and methodology shows how specific packaging sounds can affect differently on the overall food product perception. This finding entails cognitive nutrition as a support for designers dealing with the development of food packaging and food products: the methodology supports food stakeholders during the materials choice, the design phase and the product finalising. In fact, designers must be familiar with all available options if they wish to choose the right materials for his product early on in the design process; above all, they must be able to analyse whether or not the materials suit their product. Sound properties of a product (linked with gestures and product shapes, temperature, texture, colour and weight) are one of the invisible aspects of design that were proved being able to change the product perception, as well as to contribute to characterizing the user experience of a product that anticipates the consumers' desires, involving them in an all-around sensory experience.",

      "abstract": "D efinition. By the phrase are gathered together any and all expressions of attitude and opinion which have a predictive character, or represent a readiness to act on the assumption of some probability. There is a blending or linkage between various kinds of predictive assumptions, which makes almost interchangeable the terms used to describe them. Predictive assumptions include expectant attitudes, gestures (significant incipient acts), prejudices, curses, hypotheses, prognoses, reputations, stereotypes, epithets, conceptions of role, definitions of the situation, myths. Let us suggest further the common denominators of these states of mind. Analysis. It would seem that one of the earliest, because inevitable, effects of those modes of mentation which we call imagination, objectification, self-consciousness, foresight, etc., must have been to produce in human beings reactions to their own (or others' communicated) definitions of situations. Men responded to their own ideas or images of the projected future. These reactions would, of course, take the form of positive (accelerative) or negative (avoidance) responses-both attitudes and overt behaviorsaccording as the prospect predicted seemed desirable or undesirable; and the processes of evaluation and reaction toward their own (or others') expectations or curses would be a factor in the fulfillment or nonfulfillment thereof. For present purposes, it was realized that the significant points for distinctions and classifications are whether the predictive assumption is (i) in opposition to, or (2) in accordance with, the wishes of those who are to do the responding. An epithet always has its opposite. A reputation for doing something can always be rephrased as avoidance of something else. A prediction can be couched in negative or positive terms. The actual responses and results may similarly be described negatively or positively,' depending upon the emphasis in one's attention at the time. In either case behavior has occurred. Negative and positive are verbalized relativities. On the biophysical level (the unconscious) there is no negative or positive.2",

      "title": "Aesthetic regulation of objectionable representations.: A semiotic approach to memorials and religious architectural space.",
      "abstract": "Whenever a material object is selected to represent a physically absent, but emotionally present referent, such as a religious figure or a deceased relative, we have a complex representation situation that involves what we could tentatively label “transgressive cognitive acts”. A transgressive cognitive act is here meant to involve a part that is experienced as present, and as having an effect, but not evidenced from a rationalist or scientific perspective on existence. Sometimes, the complexity of this type of representation is such that argumentation beside the theological, e.g. aesthetic, comes to stand as vicarious to theological or existential opinions about the matter. The semiotics of such vicarious representation have to consider a “leaking” communication model where one part in the trinity - of the sender, the receiver or the referent - escape a coherent or evidenced definition (God can be all three, depending on type of communication). The fact that empirically non-existing referents have been recognized and theorized in semiotics (Eco; Sonesson; and others) does not explain why certain cases of absent semiotic agents, linked to religious belief, or to sense of presence in grief of a deceased person, may give rise to such extreme degree of emotion or sense of existence.Departing from a narrated episode written by J M Coetzee, about the controversy brought up by a crucifix, turning into a quarrel about aesthetic preferences, this paper discusses a series of designed or spontaneously created spatial representations of physically absent, but indirectly and emotionally present referents, as they appear in memorials, cemeteries and funeral chapels. In public acts of memorialisation, the physical objects that represent the deceased – like gravestones or memorial objects placed at sites representing the dead – are often strictly regulated, differently in different cultures. When for instance they appear at unexpected places in the urban environment, or with unfamiliar looks, memorials and their material culture can become highly controversial or be regarded as objectionable.These materialisations with a relation to religion, or existential belief, may give rise to arguments where the aesthetic aspect is the last chance to state a principle order in the cultural scheme in which they are debated. Such arguments are actualised in the current debate about post-secular societies, where it is for instance stated (Habermas) that both religious and secular mentalities must be open to a complementary learning if we are to balance shared citizenship and cultural difference in the post-secular society. It is an objective of this paper to show that the recognition of a semiotics that involves the paradoxical presence of emotionally strong, but fundamentally absent parts in communication can contribute to the aesthetics of physically present, but existentially debated objects, as well as to the discussion about the confronting as well as conjoining elements of regulation of these issues in society.

      "abstract": "Some patients struggle with the acceptance of, connection to, or identification with a good object who provides a containment-symbolization function. This is manifested as a standoff, a resistance, and a denial of the good object and, therefore, of the symbolization process that is part of healthy development. This is usually due to troubled family histories and a destructive projective identification process. The ego defensively blocks acknowledgment of any symbolizing capacity within the self and within the maternal object out of envy, fear of rejection, and dread of persecution. Destruction of symbolization and the experience of goodness within the self or in the object provides an artificial respite from the threat of annihilation, yet quickly brings on even greater levels of internal chaos and anxiety. Case material is used to illustrate these points.",

      "title": "Drooping genes v/s dancing genes",
      "abstract": "Exploring avenues for stimulating and harnessing the tremendous self-healing potential of the human genome, is one of the hot spot areas in current research. A prime candidate for illness is a person whose life is devoid of love or of any level of human warmth. Add to this, unresolved or deeply consuming emotional, psychological or spiritual stress along with a disempowering belief system-you have a perfect recipe for creating disease. When a person feels that he or she has no choice in the matters of his or her own life, their emotional response can lead to the development of a disease. The violation of a person's choice, often, is teeming with hostility, fear, anger and rage. 'The Lost Soul Syndrome', when a person is in 'Existential Vacuum', where suffering is accompanied by the absence or loss of meaning in one's life, could be a significant contributor to illness. This is primarily because, a life sans meaning, more often than not, leads to despair, depression and worthlessness. This implies that the physical body is strongly affected when one's state of mind and emotions are full of suffering, stemming from feelings of emptiness.[1] Life is a learning experience. By redirecting our focus, we bring about a new course of events into focus while releasing an existing course of events that may not serve us any longer. Nowhere this is more significant than where our genes are concerned. Of late, geneticists have begun to address the DNA (NOT the Brain) as our Bio-computer. It can be hypothesized that, in order to set the \"bioenergy system\" right, it is vital to access the source of electromagnetic malfunction in our genetic code. To facilitate this, it is essential to employ special sounds and intention.[2] According to Dr. Valerie Hunt, the author of \"Infinite mind: Science of the Human vibrations of consciousness\", the mind actually exists at the dimension of electromagnetic fields, rather than residing in the brain. Natalie Dobrova believes that, an individual's system comprising organs, has its own electromagnetic rhythm. Disruption in this cellular symphony signifies disease.[3] DNA is regarded as the master blue print for our biology. Vedas state that \"In the beginning was Brahman with whom was the WORD\". A parallel for this can be found in The New Testament where John states \"In the beginning was the WORD.\" A reference in Genesis 1:3 reads \"And God said, Let there be light: And there was light.\" All these point to the potential of light (electromagnetic waves) and sound (electromagnetic waves) on DNA and their EXPRESSION.[2] Horowitz, the author of \"DNA: Pirates of the sacred spiral\", states that the research carried out by neurophysiologists has clearly shown the following: \"One-third of the sensory-cortex area of the brain is fully devoted to the oral cavity, tongue, lips and speech.\" This implies that bioacoustic waves (oral frequency emissions- spoken or sung) have tremendous impact over life and vibrating genes which in turn influence total wellness of individuals and probably affect evolution of the species too.[2] Dr. Jeremy Norby, a French anthropologist, conducted detailed studies on Healing techniques of Shamans in the Amazon forests, has also authored the book \"The Cosmic serpent: DNA and the Origins of Knowledge\". He compared DNA or genetic code to books, which can be read, written or REWRITTEN (Reprogrammed). Now comes the important piece of the puzzle – the significance of 'Junk DNA' – parts of the DNA called \"Introns\" which are regarded as noncoding genetic sequences, in contrast to \"Exons\" that have identifiable coding functions in protein building through transcription. It is also interesting to note the presence of \"Jumping DNA\" or \"transposons\" in the supposedly useless 97% of junk DNA.[2] It is proposed that these mysterious junk DNA have some important function since mother Nature never does anything dumb. Horowitz hastens to add that, according to three Nobel laureates in medicine, the primary function of DNA lies not in protein synthesis (less than 3%) but in the reception and transmission of electromagnetic energy (more than 90%) functioning in the realm of bioelectric (light) and bioacoustic (sound) signaling.[2] A Russian research team of geneticists and linguists have scientifically documented the ability of sound and light to heal DNA. The research carried out by Russian scientists Peter Gariaev and Vladimir Poponin, showed that DNA has a special ability to attract photons causing them to slide along the helical molecule of DNA instead of along a linear pathway. This implies that DNA has the amazing capacity to bend or wrap light around itself! Recent studies by Dr. Rao and his team[4] showed that DNA undergoes helical change from normal B-DNA conformation to Z-DNA in Alzheimer's disease and this alters gene orientation and function. Thus DNA helicity alters depending on brain function and stress. Iona Miller and Richard Miller, genetic researchers,[2] conclude that it may be possible to activate DNA through conscious linguistic expressions (sounds-words; intentions-thoughts…forms of electromagnetic energy) to modify the human bioenergy fields, which in turn can affect anatomy and physiology of the human body. Psychologist Ernest Rossi effectively explores the revolutionary implications of newer discoveries in genetics and neuroscience, in the every day life of humans, for health and healing.[5] In his groundbreaking book \"The Psychobiology of Gene Expression\", he examines with fresh eyes, the tremendous application potential of consciously motivated behavior, subjective states of mind and our PERCEPTION of choice and free will in regulating gene expression to optimize health. Neuroscientists Gage and Kemperman[6] opine that a vital component of medical treatment is the regeneration of damaged/dysfunct neural networks. They also believe that conscious regulation of cognitive or environmental stimuli, changes in our physical activities may be part of doctor's prescription in future, besides or substituting drugs. The emerging field of epigenetics[6] has amassed mind boggling evidence to show that consciously chosen positive beliefs, feelings and spiritual practices influence our health by modulating gene expression. When we consciously intervene to send epigenetic signals to our cells, these signals can reduce stress and positively impact the synthesis of life-enhancing hormones such as DHEA and many more. We are now beginning to be aware of and appreciate, as a community, the impact of our thoughts and emotions on our genes. It is now being increasingly recognized that our body is sensitive enough to receive a signal from external environment and turn it into a sequence of electromagnetic or chemical commands for our genes. One such breakthrough experimental finding has been that, without interfering with the mouse's DNA, a small nutritional change in the pregnant mouse could have a dramatic impact on the gene expression of off – spring.[6] Bruce Lipton, author of the best selling book, \"The Biology of Belief\" showed that, the environment operating through the cell membrane, modulated the behavior and physiology of the cell, switching the genes on and off. He firmly believes that our beliefs affect the expression of our genes.[7] Extending Lipton's work, researchers at the Institute of HeartMath in California revealed that human emotions, desires and intentions can bring about measurable molecular changes in the DNA. Rewriting our 'Life Scripts' may have the power to turn on or turn off the eloquence of our genes which will have a huge impact on the quality of our lives per se. By redefining our reality, we can choose to reshape our lives.",

      "title": "Pride, Shame, and Group Identification",
      "abstract": "Self-conscious emotions such as shame and pride are emotions that typically focus on the self of the person who feels them. In other words, the intentional object of these emotions is assumed to be the subject that experiences them. Many reasons speak in its favor and yet this account seems to leave a question open: how to cash out those cases in which one genuinely feels ashamed or proud of what someone else does? This paper contends that such cases do not necessarily challenge the idea that shame and pride are about the emoting subject. Rather, we claim that some of the most paradigmatic scenarios of shame and pride induced by others can be accommodated by taking seriously the consideration that, in such cases, the subject “group-identifies” with the other. This is the idea that, in feeling these forms of shame or pride, the subject is conceiving of herself as a member of the same group as the subject acting shamefully or in an admirable way. In other words, these peculiar emotive responses are elicited in the subject insofar as, and to the extent that, she is (or sees herself as being) a member of a group – the group to which those who act shamefully or admirably also belong. By looking into the way in which the notion of group identification can allow for an account of hetero-induced shame and pride, this paper attempts to achieve a sort of mutual enlightenment that brings to light not only an important and generally neglected form of self-conscious emotions, but also relevant features of group identification. In particular, it generates evidence for the idea that group identification is a psychological process that the subject does not have to carry out intentionally in the sense that it is not necessarily triggered by the subject’s conative states like desires or intentions.",

      "abstract": "Querulousnes is no uniform psychiatric phenomenon and no disease entity. Causes and occasions are of the most various types, difficult to compare between persons, often moulded by the currents of the day, inherited ways of thinking, experiences and environment. Querulants are personalities, who, after colliding with the legal system and having had their own claims dismissed, suffer from an often chief and irremediable feeling of being victim of an injustice. They cannot understand that, what is in due form valid can, when, scrutinized with the greatest sense of justice and practical common sense, impress upon someone as injustice. The submission to the unattainable, the parting from hopes, expectations and claims do not materialize. The step by step stiffening readiness for action can be confined to the lawsuit matter, it comes however about, that it extends to further spheres of life. Escalations occur in particular then, when the authorities course of action, courts of justice and opponents are felt as tyrants or mortal threat. A person deriving a meaning from his entire life or events, which he interprets for himself, makes his relations to the community and Law fragile [90]. Are presented within the framework of differential diagnostic distinctions, manifestations of querulous behaviour among abnormal personalities, neurotic disorders and schizophrenic psychoses under psychiatric aspects. Brought into sharper focus are the psychogenic psychoses, which became manifest in the USA, GUS and scandinavian countries in connection with serious querulous evolutions. Hints to decision of the supreme court and forensic psychiatric expert opinion conclude the article.",

      "title": "A Review of Research on Stress among Youth in Hong Kong",
      "abstract": "IntroductionSeveral authors have remarked on difficulty of reaching a precise definition of (1, 2). Generally, it is accepted that occurs when an individual perceives that environmental demands tax or exceed his or her adaptive capacity (3). Stress is a subjective experience that may or may not correspond to behavioral, cognitive, physiological, and/or emotional responses (4). Hans Hugo Bruno Selye (1907-1982), endocrinologist, is considered 'the father of stress,' as he is one who popularized concept of stress. He defined as the nonspecific response of body to any demand, whether it is caused by, or results in, pleasant or unpleasant conditions (5). Originally, response was shown to be useful for system (from a medical perspective), and for person to adapt to changes; however, a tendency to emphasize its dangers has finally prevailed, so that its original function is often forgotten (6). Today, is normally understood as something negative, as a condition to overcome; however, it is difficult to imagine a condition free of any tension. Indeed, as Selye clearly states: is not something to be avoided. Indeed, it cannot be avoided, since just staying alive creates some demand for life-maintaining energy. Even when man is asleep, his heart, respiratory apparatus, digestive tract, nervous system, and other organs must continue to function. Complete freedom from can be expected only after death (7).Stress in adolescenceExisting literature examines several types of stressors that children and adolescents may experience, like personal illness (8), pain (9), parental or family conflict (10), family economic burden (11), parental divorce (12), peer (13, 14), adoption (15, 16), academic (17), and sexual abuse (18). Arnett (19) examined what elements of adolescent storm and stress are most recurrent in writings of psychoanalysts, anthropologists, and contemporary scholars, and identified three of them: 1) conflict with parents, due to adolescents' tendency to resist authority; 2) mood disruption, given that youth tend to be more volatile (referring to both frequency and intensity) emotionally than either children and adults, and; 3) risk behavior, meaning that adolescents tend to be more norm-breaking, or even more antisocial than children and adults, and such behaviors may potentially harm themselves and others.Byrne, Davenport and Mazanov (20) surveyed 1,039 Australian youth aged 13-18 years to examine nature of adolescent stressors. Ten factors emerged: 1) Stress of Home Life: family conflict, parental control, and lack of trust within home situation; 2) Stress of School Performance: school performance, disinterest in school education, and difficulty in keeping up; 3) Stress of School Attendance: difficulty to go to school and attend regularly; 4) Stress of Romantic Relationships: due to difficulty in establishing and maintaining romantic relationships; 5) Stress of Peer Pressure: difficulty within peer group, feeling judged by peers; 6) Stress of Teacher Interaction: difficulty in interaction with teachers; 7) Stress of Future Uncertainty: worries about future and feeling pressure from future goals; 8) Stress of School/Leisure Conflict: tension between school obligations and desire for more free time for leisure and other activities; 9) Stress of Financial pressure: need to find money for buying what one needs/wants; and 10) Stress of Emerging Adult Responsibility: difficulty due to having to take on new responsibilities when growing older. Interestingly, in each case girls reported significantly higher levels of stressor exposure than boys, which is consistent with previous literature.Results from a large study among 7,915 first-year tertiary education students from Hong Kong (11.4% aged 18 or below and 86.4% aged 19-24 years) showed that local students are more likely to suffer from stress, as well as anxiety and depression, than international and local general population, and their peer group (21). …",

      "abstract": "The Argument Pain has important biomedical socioanthropological, semiotic, and other facets. In this contribution pain and the experssion of pain are looked at from the perspective of evolutionary biology, utilizing, among others, cross-cultural data from field work in Melanesia. No other being cares for sick and suffering conspecifics in the way humans do. Notwithstanding aggression and neglect, common in all cultures, human societies can be characterized as empathic, comforting, and promoting the health and well-being of their members. One important stimulus triggering this caring response in others is the expression of pain. The nonverbal channel of communication, particularly certain universal — i.e., culture-independent facial expressions, gestures, and body postures, convey much of the message from the painstricken person to the group. These behaviors signal the person's physical and psychical pain, sadness, grief, and despair in ways very similar to the signs given by infants and small children: the body loses tonus and sinks or drops to the ground, the gestures are those of helplessness. Pain and grief may be so strong that control is lost not only over the body's posture but also over the mind's awareness. In such cases the afflicted person may carry out actions endangering himself or others. In general, these behavior patterns resemble those of infants in situations of distress and danger, and it is not surprising that the response of the members of the group is basically parental: taking care, assisting and consoling. Perceptive and behavioral patterns which developed in the course of avian and mammalian phylogeny to serve the well-being of the young have proven, as was shown by Eibl-Eibesfeldt (1989), to be powerful building blocks for actions in other spheres of human interaction. Love is one such field, the reactions to a conspecific suffering pain is another.",

      "title": "Effect of Intervention Programme on Different Stressors in Lawyers",
      "abstract": "Stress is derived from the Latin word Stringere which means to draw tight. Stress is a dynamic condition in which an individual is confronted with an opportunity, demand or resource related to what the individual desires and for which the outcome is perceived to be both uncertain and important (Cooper Ritchie, Broghammer, Coffin, Sorosky and Buller, 2002). Stress has been a focus of study in medical science where it has been defined as a perturbation of the body's homeostasis. This demand on mind-body occurs when it tries to cope with incessant changes in life.Of all the stressors working in an individual's life, job stress is one of the leading causes of stress. In the organizational context, stress has been found to be experienced by employees during job insecurity, performance expectations, technology changes, and personal and family problems. Hans Selye first introduced the concept of stress in to the life science in 1936. He defined stress as force, pressure, or strain exerted upon a material object or person which resist these forces and attempt to maintain its original state. Stress is ubiquitous in our society. It has become an integral part of everyday living. Steers (1981) indicate that, stress has become an important topic for study of organisational behaviour for several reasons. 1. Stress has harmful psychological and physiological effects on employees, 2. Stress is a major cause of employee turnover and absenteeism, 3. Stress experienced by one employee can affect the safety of other employees, 4. By controlling dysfunctional stress, individual and organisation can be managed more effectively.Occupational stress is an increasingly important occupational health problem and a significant cause of economic loss. Occupational stress may produce both overt psychological and physiologic disabilities. There have been many studies on the relationship between job stress and job satisfaction and these studies generally indicate that job stress and satisfaction are inversly related (Beehr, Walsh & Taber, 1976; Cotton ,Dollard & de Jonge, 2002;hawe,tuck ,Manthie ,Adair & Moore 2000; Heslop, Smith Metcalfe, Macleod & Hart, 2002; Lu, Shiau & Cooper , 1997; Manivannan, Saravanaraj & Sumathi,2007; richardsen & Burke, 1991 ; Sullivan & Bhagat, 1992; Ulleberg & Rundmo, 1997).Sheena, Cary, Sue, Ian, Paul and Clare (2005) studies in UK found that there are some occupations that are reporting worse than average scores on each of the factors such as physical health, psychological well-being, andjob satisfaction. Stress is inevitable in the practice of law (Sharma, Verma, Verma & Malhotra, 2010). As lawyers experience increased workplace stress, their relationships with colleagues becomes more strained. Many studies over the past two decades show that lawyers in the United States suffer poor physical health and significant levels of mental illness, especially depression, alcoholism and drug abuse, as well as high rates of divorce and suicidal ideation (Benjamin, Kaszniak, Sales and Shanfield, 1986).While life and work for many today seem more stressful than in past times, specific characteristics of practicing law seem to accentuate stress levels. The lawyer must balance empathy with objective detachment and enjoy confrontation. But even for the toughest of lawyers, stress, at some point or another, becomes an issue. Lawyer's stress is a heavily studied subject. With the long hours, pressure and intensity of the job, lawyers and other professionals experience, in some cases, serious anxiety.The anxiety worsens as lawyers are pressured to make partner, move ahead, save clients and be constantly updating their knowledge of the law.The present study is an attempt to investigate the level of stress experienced by the lawyers in Himachal Pradesh. The study aims to ascertain the level of stress and coping strategies adopted by the lawyers in order to strengthen the crisis of stagnation and growing job dissatisfaction. …",

      "title": "The rotten apple in the barrel has a bug in it: how the analogy of parasitic infection may shed light on the causes of & solutions to recent financial scandals",
      "abstract": "Time and time again, corporate scandals (lately in the banking sector) remind us of the frailty of human standards and values: ethical conduct is unreliable. The authors have personal experience, drawn from consultancy and research, of the troubling ease with which groups of employees can subvert and expose to existential risk otherwise sound organisations. Daily, occasional and actions under stress may each and all demonstrate forms of behaviour at substantial odds from what individuals would tolerate, enable or support. These individuals are not necessarily behaving irrationally, nor motivated solely by personal gain: and yet their actions are greedy. They put at risk the stability of the overall organisation for the promise of an easier (but unregulated, unsafe or unpalatable) workload, reward or task list.\r\nIn this sense, then, a biological analogy would be of a parasitical infection that drains energy from a host, reducing its ability to remain healthy or, as some real-world parasites do, changing the behaviour of the host such that it is persuaded that unconventional actions are natural, intuitive. The very conditions of work may have a profound influence here: “This dysfunctional perspective is reinforced by contemporary corporate monoculture where employees live in a bubble, log obscene hours, and vacation with their co-workers. As a consequence giant corporations are dogmatically insular with their own warped code of ethics and worldview” (Burnett 2011).\r\nThis paper will seek to shed light on the mechanisms by which teams in organisations come to undertake behaviours which out at risk the sustainability and security of the whole. Here, then, for example, the socially-responsible aspirations and benchmarks of financial institutions are compromised. Supposed to build long-term shareholder value by taking into strategic account the need for engagement and transparency about the company, how it creates value for its stakeholders, how it manages risk and contributes to society – all of these can be undermined by rogue traders (Cf. Nick Leeson, Enron, Parmalat ,NorthernRock, Madoff, LIBOR, the London Whale, RBS, Co-op, RBS GRG). As an American author helpfully puts it: “parasitic accountants […] have subverted America's entrepreneurial spirit and jeopardized the common good” (Burnett 2011).",

      "abstract": "Frequently causal models are established which, although they can show many factors, their connections are all linear.But what sense can have for a general practitioner the inexpressive formula that tells him separately the cause and the conditions, even if the conditions (for example the social ones) can be of immeasurably greater importance than \"the cause\"?Biopsychosocial causality emphasizes the importance of the transforming mutual influence of the different inter-acting \"causal\" factors, and points out the irrelevance of considering a \"determining condition\".Disease (bacterial, parasitic, cancer, vascular, autoimmune, etc.) is an ecosystem and many of its components are interactions in a community: emergency, growth, dissemination, regression, and resistance.Cause and effect constantly change place; from the psychosocial to the biological, and vice versa.The epidemiological cause-effect relationship is a process of displacement or transaction from an incomplete material to a more complete one; from a manifest material to another latent one.In epidemiology, when we try to estimate the effect of a possible cause, it is not taken into account that the confusion depends on how the variables interact in the individuals.There are no noncommunicable diseases and communicable diseases, there are no organic and functional diseases, there are no biological, psychological and social diseases separated from each other.In this model the doctor-patient relationship is a part of the skein or \"tangle\" of causes and effects.Biopsychosocial causes give rise to scenarios that behave like the arguments of \"television series films\": the characters, which are interconnected directly or tangentially with each other, get into the next mess or muddle before leaving the latter, this means that there are several storylines at the same time (two or three at least), where several causal stories are interwoven, and also all of them have moments of knots, or entanglements , or skeins, or mess, noise, jumble, confusion, disorder, which partly overlap for each character, and where there is no final outcome.And what does the general practitioner need to know in this knot, or tangle of causes of health and disease?He must find \"the system that defines the problem\", the set of relevant variables affected by the problem.",

      "abstract": "Discusses two psychopathological phenomena of the Malay culture, Amok and Lattah. Amok refers to the horrific, unexpected, murderous attack in the tropical rest of the kampong (village). Lattah refers to the note gaie in the daily contact between a family and its household staff. It is contended that study of these psychic abnormalities is of great interest because of their specific nature and symptoms (showing some characteristic qualities of the Malay race) and because a deeper insight into those psychic aberrations of primitive people, having a less complicated psychic structure, is of great value to the study of the psychoses of cultured races. Amok is considered an acute, mostly infectious delirium, while the peculiar psychic nature of the Malay is responsible for the symptoms which render this syndrome entirely different from similar ones in Europe. The symptoms of Lattah are described as in consequence of a fright or some other sudden emotion; the startled patient screams, after which she repeats everything that is said, called out or done in front of her (echolally and echopraxis); besides she does everything she is told to do, including actions entirely adverse to her habits and inclinations (automatism by command). These compulsory symptoms can be kept up as long as one wishes by using the element of fright again and again; they disappear as soon as the patient is spoken to quietly and soothed.

For one thing, thinking about affect can change what counts as material and what material might do. I am using word material in psychoanalytic sense to mean the patient's words and behaviour as a whole, in so far as they offer a sort of raw material for interpretations and constructions.1 Affect is part of what an analyst or critic considers in order to build a convincing interpretation (of a lived scene, of a literary or cultural text): one sign that I am performing a good reading or interpreting well is if this reading helps me to understand why I feel a certain way, or why a text makes me feel this way. This is especially case if a feeling is counterintuitive or perverse in sense that it undermines or is simply outside of what I recognize to be my own desires or wishes. Affects or feelings fit psychoanalytic bill perfectly when they are felt to be, as Laplanche and Pontalis put it, somewhat alien ... as far as conscious subject is concerned (246); when they are considered incommensurate with [a subject's] conscious motives (246), they become material for analysis, symptomatic of unconscious wishes, for example, or structures.",

If we have suffered or expect to suffer some willful injury from a man, or if he is in any way offensive to us, we dislike him; and dislike easily rises into hatred. Such feelings, if experienced in a moderate degree, are not clearly expressed by any movement of the body or features, excepting perhaps by a certain gravity of behavior, or by some ill temper. Few individuals, however, can long reflect about a hated person, without feeling and exhibiting signs of indignation or rage. But if the offending person be quite insignificant, we experience merely disdain or contempt. If, on the other hand, he is all-powerful, then hatred passes into terror, as when a slave thinks about a cruel master, or a savage about a bloodthirsty malignant deity. Most of our emotions are so closely connected with their expression, that they hardly exist if the body remains passive the nature of the expression depending in chief part on the nature of the actions which have been habitually performed under this particular state of the mind. A man, for instance, may know that his life is in the extremist peril, and may strongly desire to save it, yet may exclaim as did Louis XVI, when surrounded by a fierce mob, ‘Am I afraid? feel my pulse.’ So a man may intensely hate another, but until his bodily frame is affected he cannot be said to be enraged.",

In some languages the word for ‘shame’ and the word for ‘wound’ are the same. A wound exposes and can thereby advertise vulnerabilty and a cause for shame. Hiding or covering may seek to guard against wounding, humiliating exposure. Shame is self-evidently an important human emotion. Insofar as animals are innocent of shame, experience of it is a mark of humanity. Much human behaviour is influenced by fear of shame and embarrassment. Living in the face and eyes, shame is very close to the experienced self. Self-image and self-esteem are heavily determined by one's susceptibility to shame. Experience of shame is impossible without a sense of individuation, without a sense of discreteness from the world and of being an object in the eyes of another. Study of shame sensitivity therefore offers many clues to an individual's or a culture's behaviour, sense of identity and relationship to the environment.",

      "abstract": "Humans work, rest and play in immensely varied extreme environments. The term 'extreme' typically refers to insufficiency or excess of one or more stressors, such as thermal energy or gravity. Individuals' behavioural and physiological capacity to endure and enjoy such environments varies immensely. Adverse effects of acute exposure to these environments are readily identifiable (e.g. heat stroke or bone fracture), whereas adverse effects of chronic exposure (e.g. stress fractures or osteoporosis) may be as important but much less discernable. Modern societies have increasingly sought to protect people from such stressors and, in that way, minimise their adverse effects. Regulations are thus established, and advice is provided on what is 'acceptable' exposure. Examples include work/rest cycles in the heat, hydration regimes, rates of ascent to and duration of stay at altitude and diving depth. While usually valuable and well intentioned, it is important to realise the breadth and importance of limitations associated with such guidelines. Regulations and advisories leave less room for self-determination, learning and perhaps adaptation. Regulations based on stress (e.g. work/rest cycles relative to WBGT) are more practical but less direct than those based on strain (e.g. core temperature), but even the latter can be substantively limited (e.g. by lack of criterion validation and allowance for behavioural regulation in the research on which they are based). Extreme Physiology & Medicine is publishing a series of reviews aimed at critically examining the issues involved with self- versus regulation-controlled human movement acutely and chronically in extreme environments. These papers, arising from a research symposium in 2013, are about the impact of people engaging in such environments and the effect of rules and guidelines on their safety, enjoyment, autonomy and productivity. The reviews will cover occupational heat stress, sporting heat stress, hydration, diving, extreme loading, chronic unloading and high altitude. Ramifications include factors such as health and safety, productivity, enjoyment and autonomy, acute and chronic protection and optimising adaptation.",

When it is expressed and becomes kinetic or active, one may designate it as behavior, an objective concept. To evaluate properly the endocrine glands as active causes or even as precursors of personality change, it is necessary to understand the mechanisms involved in any diseasepersonality relationship. These are the structural, the functional and the psychogenic. The most fundamental aspect of structure is the constitutional make-up of the individual.

      "abstract": "For radical behaviorists, talk about ―private events‖ could be about any of four things: (a) private behavioral events, (b) physiology, (c) dispositions, or (d) explanatory fictions. Talk about private events as behavioral engages the influence of feelings, sensations, and covert operant behavior. Analyses based on private behavioral events allow radical behaviorists to understand how those events contribute to contingencies controlling subsequent operant behavior, whether verbal or nonverbal. Talk about private events in physiological terms risks confounding explanatory categories. Although physiology necessarily participates in behavioral events, physiological events are not the same type as behavioral events, public or private. Rather, an organism's physiology is a material cause. To portray physiology as an autonomous, initiating cause, as traditional psychology often does, creates a variety of explanatory problems. Talk about private events as dispositions does not reflect anything literally private. Rather, dispositional talk reflects the probability of behavior engendered by contingencies. Dispositional talk is about effects, instead of causes or intervening variables as traditional psychology often portrays them. Finally, some talk ostensibly about private events is little more than an appeal to explanatory fictions. This talk, common in traditional psychology, owes its strength to the everyday social reinforcement inherent in ―folk psychology.‖ The talk represents a surrender to mentalism and methodological behaviorism, notwithstanding any claims that it is ―theoretical.‖",

      "title": "Pre-Reflective Self-Awareness in Psychotic Disorders",
      "abstract": "Disorders of the self figure prominently in psychotic experiences. Subjects de­scribe that “alien” thoughts are inserted in their mind by foreign powers, can sometimes hear their thoughts aloud or describe complex voices interacting with each other. Such experiences can be conceptualized in the framework of a Philosophical Anthropology, which suggests that human experience is characterized by centric and excentric positionality: subjects experience their environment centered around their enlived body and at the same time can reflect upon their place in a shared lifeworld from an excentric point of view. Pre-reflective self awareness has been suggested to ensure that subjects can identify their own thoughts or actions as belonging to themselves, even when they reflect upon them from an excentric point of view. This pre-reflective self awareness appears to be impaired during psychotic experiences, when subjects no longer identify thoughts in their own stream of consciousness as belonging to themselves and instead attribute them to an outside agent. Among several potential causes, it is suggested that such impairments can be due to discrimi­natory or traumatic experiences, which affect the enlived (centric) position of a person and make her feel encircled and deeply threatened by aversive powers. As a consequence, the afflicted individual may fundamentally distance herself from her current centric position in a hostile environment, at the price of experiencing her own thoughts or actions as alien. Philosophical Anthropology may thus help to explain how social exclusion, discrimination and traumatization can promote psychotic experiences and why social support is of primary importance for any treatment of psychosis.",

Unless we think of animals as 'machines' and/or profit from their treatment as mere means to our ends, we are inclined to feel that there are certain things it is 'not right' to do with respect to other animals.

Animal experiments also demonstrate the devastating effects of stressful unpredictabilities. The clinical relevance of the Uncertainty Principle is that all therapy (Greek—<i>therapeien</i>, service) is effective only insofar as it increases the recipient's confidence as to his physical well-being, alleviates his concerns about his interpersonal securities and fosters comforting theophilosophic beliefs.",

      "title": "Balance and Falls among Older People",
      "abstract": "An increasing body of clinical and basic research acknowledges the functional decline of sensory and integrative systems in older adults and associates impairments in these systems with an increase in falls. The risk of falls underscores the importance of the of the older adult to be able to receive and integrate sensory information and to take appropriate action to avoid falling. BALANCE, THE SIXTH SENSE What does a complaint of feeling off-balance mean? The complaint could refer to an unwanted interaction of prescribed or over-the-counter medications and herbal remedies, an underlying cardiovascular problem, or age-related or disease-related declines in the balance system. Balance instability is a marker of fall risk and frailty. Balance is the ability of the person to remain in equilibrium and to orient to gravity, the support surface, and to objects in the environment when performing routine activities of daily living (Newton, 2002). Balance could also be described as the to maintain one's lifestyle without falling. Balance is needed when standing or sitting still and when moving in the environment. Anticipatory balance responses precede movements such as raising the arm up to comb one's hair, reaching for an object on a high shelf, or putting dishes in the dishwasher. Older adults with balance dysfunction due to age-related declines or other problems might hold on to the sink in order to perform these routine tasks. Holding on to an object or a person to avoid falling may be a good strategy, providing the object or person is stable. Compensatory balance responses occur in reaction to an external event such as being pushed or tripping over an obstacle. Compensatory balance responses are automatic, occur within 90 milliseconds, and help the individual maintain or regain balance following the perturbing event. The three most important sensory systems responsible for good balance are the visual system, the vestibular system (involving the inner ear), and the somatosensory system (a complex collection of sensors that transmit information about the state of the body and its immediate environment). For example, the somatosensory receptors located in the legs and feet provide information about the condition of the support surface-slippery floor, high pile rug. Receptors (called proprioceptors because they respond to stimuli within an organism) located in the neck and trunk provide information about the alignment of the back and head. Vision provides information about the location and dimension of objects in the environment and the condition of the support surface and lighting. The vestibular receptors in the inner ear provide information about the position of the person in space-moving, turning, and tilting. Many age-related changes that affect balance occur gradually, permitting older adults to compensate until they reach a critical point that results in balance instability. These age-related changes include a decrease in the sensitivity of the sensory receptors that monitor information, a slowing of the nervous system capabilities, and muscle weakness due to inactivity. Gradual declines in these systems also occur with disease. For example, peripheral diabetic neuropathy in patients with Alzheimer's disease increases the risk of falls. Older adults tend to place greater reliance on the visual system to compensate for age or disease-related reductions in the vestibular or somatosensory system, even when visual information is misleading. Relying on one sensory system is problematic; adults over the age of 65 with visual impairments are at least three times more likely than unimpaired adults to have difficulty with mobility, for example in walking, going outside, and performing routine daily activities (Maino, 1996). Wearing bifocal or trifocal or progressive lenses affects the capability to detect environmental hazards by impairing contrast sensitivity and depth perception. …",

      "abstract": "VIOLENT events form very important parts of those marital or cohabiting relationships in which they occur. 1They usually take place after a build-up and take on an identity of their own which is intense and memorable because of the type and level of activity involved and because of the meanings they have for each partner.Such events may assume an importance that not only dominates the daily lives of both abuser and abused but also forms a crucial part in the formation of subsequent violent events and in the continuing development of the couple's overall relationship.As such it is important to have a better understanding of this dynamic process, including information about the event itself, the circumstances surrounding it, the meanings and motives involved and the changes that occur over time.Gaining a more thorough understanding requires an examination of at least three important facets of the violent event: its concrete nature, its dynamic development and its location within the wider social context.The nature of the event includes the major elements of which it is composed, such as sources of conflict, arguments, physical attack, injuries, time, location and the reactions of third parties.Dynamic development includes the unfolding of the event from the beginning to the end.In a wider sense, it also includes the unfolding of the process through which the violent relationship progresses over time from the emergence of the violence through its continuation and, for some, its eventual termination either through escape from the abuser or cessation of his violent behaviour.Locating this dynamic process in its wider social context involves relating it to the structure of the relationships between men and women in marriage, the family, the economy and the socio-legal system.This context provides the backdrop against which the motivations of the participants and the meanings attached to the event, as well as the responses of third parties, can best be understood and explained.The primary purpose of this paper is to examine in some detail the concrete nature of violent events that occur between men and women living in a marital or cohabiting relationship and to examine changes that occur in this event throughout the relationship.

      "abstract": "Migration is perhaps best understood as a sociodemographic context that can increase vulnerability to both mental health problems and emotional crisis. Crisis can be understood as a specific moment of psychological upset that the individual experiences as beyond his or her capacity to cope with effectively. Migrants in crisis, from this perspective, are different from native born individuals on two major fronts. One has to do with the degree to which migration constitutes a stressor, and the other the degree to which culture and migration impact the stress process A contextual process model of acculturative stress will be presented as a means of making sense of migrants in crisis. Specifically, a crisis occurs with a sort of accumulation of stressors, that are appraised to constitute a grave danger to individual or collective well-being, and, in turn, the evaluation that the individual or collectivity does not have the necessary resources-psychological, social, and material—to mitigate the deleterious effects of the event or situation. Migrants may be more susceptible to crisis precisely because they have access to fewer social and material resources and because their psychological resources-particularly coping styles—may not be consistent with what is normative in the host culture. Effective response at both the clinical and institutional levels requires appreciation of the complexity of the issue without falling prey to cultural reductionism.",

He is unconscious, without heartbeats and breath, and with a flat-line electroencephalogram. NDE may include some of the following elements: Out of the body experiences or separation of consciousness from the physical body, increase in sensory perception and intense emotions, travel into or through a tunnel, encounter with a brilliant light and mystical beings, deceased relatives or friends, a sense of alteration in time and space, visualization of unworldly realms and a special knowledge, encounter with a barrier or boundary, and a return to the body, either voluntary or involuntary. The fact that children NDE are similar to adult NDE is an evidence that these experiences are real and not due to pre-existing beliefs, cultural influences or previous experiences in the present life. The characteristics of NDE are similar worldwide. No evidence supports the physiological, psychological, neurochemical, and neuroanatomical hypothesis proposed to explain the NDE. Multifactorial models, based on the combination of all of them (brain anoxia or hypoxia, release of serotonin, endorphins and ketamine-like compounds) have also been proposed. Although physiological, psychological, and socio-cultural factors could interact in the NDE, the hypothesis proposed consist essentially in unsupported speculations about what might be happening during the NDE.",

      "abstract": "This chapter explores how self-disgust may manifest as part of the experience of self-harm. In its primary form, disgust implies a set of behavioural and physiological rejection responses against contamination or incorporation of contaminant material. It involves a sudden arousal of feelings, physiological changes, and action impulses that aim to prevent the threatening object from crossing the body boundary or from spreading within it. People who self-harm are, prior to the act, either in a state of high arousal, in which overwhelming anger, anxiety, or a mixture of unidentifiable emotions is typically experienced, or they are depersonalised. Feeling out of control involves an experience of a lack of autonomy and agency over one's internal states. The self-harm act \"catches\" emotions that were previously felt to be \"untameable\" and amorphous; the wound, scar, and/or blood become a representation of the experience that can be attended to, contemplated, and something that the individual can act upon.",

According to Selye’s GAS, there are generally three stages in the human body’s reaction to extreme stress. First, the alarm reaction, in which the body stirs up its defense mechanisms—the glands, hormones, and nervous system—into action; second, the adaptation stage, when the body fights back (e.g., the arteries can harden when the heart is under pressure); and third, the exhaustion stage, when the body’s defenses seem to be unable to cope, and the individual becomes seriously ill and may dieSelye concludes that the best way to survive and thrive is to adapt and respond in positive ways to the stress of life.",

      "title": "Probleme und Konzepte der Lithium-Forschung aus psychologischer Sicht",
      "abstract": "In psychological lithium research one is not only confronted with diverging findings, very heterogenous objects and methods, but also completely different theoretical frames of reference. Three concepts can be distinguished: lithium is considered as a chemical substance leading to biochemical changes which are responsible 1) for the disappearance or non-manifestation of the affective psychosis, 2) for physiological changes, and 3) for changes of so-called normal psychological functions. Within the context of lithium induced effects on normal psychological functions different scientific aims can be distinguished: either the relevance of psychic effects for the performance of daily activities is considered; or special indications such as aggressiveness are searched for; or normal psychic functions are examined as a model for psychotic processes. Most authors have investigated psychic effects of lithium as single phenomena not related to each other, nor to unchanged normal psychological functions. It is, however, rather unlikely that psychotropic drug effects would not develop their own dynamics, influencing other psychic functions. From a psychological point of view three conceptual possibilities may be distinguished: 1) Lithium induced direct effects on psychotic symptoms interfere with other psychotic symptoms or with non-psychotic processes. 2) Lithium-induced direct effects on normal psychic functions during the free interval of patients or in normal volunteers interfere with other psychic functions. 3) Lithium-induced effects on normal psychic functions are related to the prophylactic response (prophylactic relationship). The prophylactic relationship can be interpreted in three ways according to the chosen protocol: 1) Predictors can be obtained for the prophylactic response. 2) Psychological changes acting as condition for lithium prophylaxis may be found. 3) Factors relevant for the etiology of the psychosis may be elucidated. Such etiological factors might be found for instance within the concept of the \"typus melancholicus\" of Tellenbach. Independent of the actual findings of empirical studies a theoretical question always arises, i.e. whether psychotic phenomena should be conceived as something categorically different from normal psychological phenomena. This question cannot be answered empirically, because in every description this question is always implicitly decided. And this decision determines the possible methodological approaches towards single phenomena or complex models. If psychopathological phenomena are conceived as something which is not categorically different from normal psychic processes, then, these phenomena can only be specifications of phenomena known within general psychology. It must, then, be possible to describe them by general psychological theories, though with those specifications distinguishing the psychopathological from the non-pathological phenomena. Thus, the typus melancholicus and the depression would then be conceived as specifications of normal psychic processes. A conditional relationship between primary personality and psychosis would, then, be possible from a theoretical point of view, because a conditional relationship requires a general substantial concept connecting condition and what is conditioned.",

      "title": "The Experiences, Opinions, and Attitudes of Yoruba Repatriates of the Former Eastern (Iboland) Region as Aspects of the Pre-Crisis Interethnic Contacts and Relations in Nigeria",
      "abstract": "One important element in the definition and understanding of the dynamics of interethnic or intergroup relations generally is the attitude which prevails among the particular ethnic groups who are in a contact situation. Attitude formation is a function of the experiences acquired and the opinions formed by the parties to the social contact. For the latter two by their nature are a necessary precondition of the former. Put another way, experience in a social situation and the judgement arrived at as being true and derivable from that experience either intellectually or otherwise (for this essentially is what constitutes opinion) must take place before attitude occurs. Attitude essentially is an acquired, or learned, and established tendency of an individual to react toward or against something or somebody. It does not, we must warn, refer to any one specific act or response of an individual, but is an abstraction from a large number of consistent, related acts or responses of the person to an object or people (Green 1954, p. 336). An attitude may be characteristic of a person (and as such relate to the given person) or to other persons or to social groups or to society. It may even be social in the sense that is characteristic of a homogeneous group of persons. The place of attitude in intergroup dynamics cannot be overemphasised. For it determines whether or not group members accept one another and a condition of harmony, integration, intergroup wholesome or unwholesome competition or rivalry exist among them. It also determines whether a condition of stability or instability obtains in the overall society in which the contacting groups are active participants in the socioeconomic lives. A group characterised by favourable attitudes toward another group would most probably accept the members of that group. And if acceptance is achieved, an important milestone is reached in the harmonious relations between the groups and in a condition of stability characterised by a minimum of antagonism. And man, it is said, functions fully, effectively under a condition of stability when his potentials are maximised and are fully released or expressed and utilised because of the existing security.",

      "abstract": "Social Pressure Teresa Brennan 1. Preamble: It has become habitual to think of the social as immaterial or unphysical, as something which does not enter into or physically affect the body. Despite the strong evidence of psychosomatic disorders, or the logical deductions that follow from the facts that words and images are physical entities as well as conveyors of meaning, social theory continues to think the relation between the physical and the social in terms where either the biological may (some claim) or may not determine the social, but where the social does not have material effects on the body. In other words, the only alternative to sociobiology, 1 which misconceives and reduces the relation at issue to one of biological determination, appears to be a social without physical materiality. The theory of social physicality I have developed 2 is premised on the notion that the opposition between the social and the biological is itself misconceived to the extent that it conjures up an idea of the social as immaterial, as lacking matter and/or energy. 3 The opposition between the social and the biological was built into sociology’s foundations: Durkheim for instance, as Giddens has it, is concerned with “the specific characteristics of the class of phenomena which may be delimited as ‘social’ and thereby separated from other categories such the ‘biological’ and ‘psychological’” (Giddens 1971, 86). But while I agree that the social is specific to itself and independent of biology, and that it also exists independently of personal psychology, the social as I will define an aspect of it here (which we will call “social pressure”) is nonetheless physical. Moreover it is not that the biological determines the social. It is rather that the physicality of the social enters into [End Page 257] and even determines biology, and for that matter, the environment. It follows that human organisms will have physical differences consequent on their different “socializations.” 4 In this essay I will elaborate on the theory of social physicality in relation to aging. We are all familiar with the discrepancies between those who age “well” and those who do not, between an apparent retardation of aging and its untimely acceleration. Such discrepancies suggest that a social level impinges on the biological level. At the same time, the fact of aging seems to legitimate the distinction between the social and the biological for the very reason that while some of us age poorly and some well, we all ultimately age. The thing that varies (how we age) is not the same as the thing that is varied (the fact of aging). The fact of aging is presented to us as a biological fact. But my point will be that the social variations or accelerations and retardations in how we age, while biological in their effects, have to have a material existence that involves something more than somatic biology. The nature of that material existence, I will suggest here, is physical. Thus it may be that the “social” which affects the body can be understood in terms of physics (this is what social physicality is about); while the body of course belongs to biology. In other words, what I am suggesting is that we reflect on the appositeness of the distinction between the biological and the physical in rethinking an issue which otherwise remains intractable. If I am right in this approach, it would be more correct to say not that a critical dimension of the social is biological, but that it is physical, a force that interacts with and affects the biological body. The distinction between the physical and the biological, while frequently collapsed in the humanities and social sciences, is long-standing. 5 But the distinction is needed in the social sciences. Apart from its use in explaining changes in the organism that are not consequent solely on biological developments, the distinction is necessary if one is to resolve a paradox: as Ingold points out, “biology” is meant to be about the increasing differentiation of forms, and how organisms grow in distinctiveness (1990, 214). I add that socialization by contrast is about how these organisms conform to common [End Page 258] modes of behavior and...",

In this context, ‘to tolerate’ generally means to endure, suffer or put up with a person, activity, idea or organization of which or whom one does not really approve. One can ‘put up with’ an item both when one can and cannot do anything about it. For example, one can ‘put up with’ the excesses of a ruler whose behaviour one has no power to amend. Equally, one can ‘put up with’ the excesses of a child even where one has no need to do so. In the second case, one has control; in the first, one does not. Both cases could be advanced as instances of ‘tolerance’. But cases of the first sort (powerlessness) I shall label as instances of ‘acquiescence’ or ‘sufferance’ or ‘endurance’, since it is obvious that acquiescence typically flows from powerlessness. I shall label cases of the second sort (powerfulness) as instances of tolerance. It is clear in any event that these two types of case are distinct, and, for the purposes of this discussion, at least, differential labelling is essential. In this context, an agent will be said to ‘tolerate’ an item where the item is disliked or disapproved and is yet voluntarily endured. On this definition it is plain that tolerance requires some form of self-restraint by the tolerator.",

      "abstract": "If a hungry, thirsty, itchy person eats some food, or drinks some water, or intentionally scratches an itch, this is individual action. That is, it is the intentional behaviour of an ordinary individual human person; other human beings are not necessarily involved. If a person takes a walk down the road by herself for exercise, or eats an ice cream for pleasure, or takes a shower on a hot day, this is also individual action. Such action is not action in cooperation with, or necessarily directed at, other individuals. On the other hand, if an individual kicks or throws a football to a teammate in the course of a game of football, or puts a motion forward at a committee meeting, then this is social action. Most human action is in fact at some level, or to some extent, or in some sense, social action. Even these actions of eating, drinking, eating ice cream, individually walking down the road, or having a shower typically presuppose social forms or objects, such as farms, ice cream parlours, cups, roads, and shower rooms. But the de facto presupposition of social forms does not of itself vitiate the distinction between individual and social action. More generally, the sociality of most human action does not vitiate the distinction; it merely serves to illustrate the need to develop a more elaborate set of distinctions in this area. There is nothing to be gained from insisting that no actions are individual and/or that all actions are social, just because it might in fact be that all the actions of human beings connect in some way, however indirectly, with the actions of other human beings and with social forms and social objects.",

      "title": "Consciousness of body: Private and public.",
      "abstract": "A self-report instrument yielded two separate factors: private body consciousness (awareness of internal sensations) and public body consciousness (awareness of observable aspects of body). For each factor, norms, test-retest reliability data, and correlations with other personality measures are presented. An experiment on reaction to ingestion of caffeine revealed that only subjects high in private body consciousness or high in both private body consciousness and private selfconsciousness were stimulated by caffeine; individual differences in public body consciousness and in private self-consciousness alone had no impact. These findings have implications for biofeedback, false physiological feedback, and excitation transfer. When we attend to ourselves, what do we observe? Though there may be various answers to this question, one is to classify the diverse components of the self into private and public aspects. The private aspects can be observed only by the experiencing person: thoughts, images, memories, motives, and feelings—all concerning oneself. The public aspects can be observed by anyone else: appearance, manners, and style of behavior. People differ considerably in the extent to which they attend to the private aspects of themselves, and there are marked individual differences in consciousness of the public or social aspects of oneself. These two dispositions, private and public self-consciousness, are measured by the Self-Consciousness Inventory (Fenigstein, Scheier, & Buss, 1975). Among the highest loading items on the Private Self-Consciousness Scale are, I reflect about myself a lot, I'm generally attentive to my inner feelings, and I'm alert to changes in my mood. Among the highest loading items on the Public Self-Conscious",

Studies of prisoners reveal a variety of negative impacts including physiological (headaches, heart palpitations), cognitive (impaired concentration, memory loss), perceptual (hallucinations, paranoia), emotional (depression, anxiety), and motor (lethargy, apathy). This constellation of symptoms is sometimes described as solitary confinement psychosis. It is argued that in addition a variety of positive effects accompany successful adaptation to harsh circumstances. These include clarity of thought, heightened feelings of personal accomplishment, and enhanced status among other prisoners. Not all prisoners are destroyed by prolonged aloneness and there are lessons to be learned from the resilient few. The virtues of solitude include reflection, freedom from the constraints of society, and creativity. But even those who survive (or thrive) are diminished as human beings because the denial of company strikes at the essence of personhood. We need the mirroring effects of others to be fully human.",

      "abstract": "(International Seminar on Making of Gandhi, 10-12 March 2011, Shivaji Univ. Kolhapur) Abstinence is a voluntary act of restraint from indulging in bodily activities that are widely experienced as giving pleasure. Most frequently, the term refers to Sexual abstinence or abstention from alcohol or food. The practice can arise from religious prohibitions or practical considerations. Abstinence has diverse forms. Commonly it refers to a temporary or partial abstinence from food, as in fasting. Because the regimen is intended to be a conscious act, freely chosen to enhance life, abstinence is sometimes distinguished from the psychological mechanism of repression. The latter is an unconscious state, having unhealthy consequences. Freud termed the channeling of sexual energies into other more culturally or socially acceptable activities through “sublimation”. Abstinence may also arise from an ascetic element, present in most faiths, or from a subjective need for spiritual discipline. In its religious context, abstinence is meant to elevate the believer beyond the normal life",

      "title": "Perspective on Ethics: The Elephant in the Room",
      "abstract": "While the field of bioethics is increasingly equated with medicine and healthcare, the purview of bioethics actually includes human interaction with all things biological—whether those interactions are with other humans, other sentient and non-sentient entities, even the very earth itself, since it is, after all, one of those necessary conditions for the very possibility of our existence. Much like our cohorts in medicine and healthcare, those of us currently laboring in the field of bioethics pay lip-service to the importance of developing at least a biopsychosocial—if not also environmental —perspective when addressing problems or issues. But when advocating for such an “all-things-considered” perspective we, again like our cohorts in medicine and healthcare, tend to ignore the material conditions, the biological, psychological, social and the environmental, that actually spawn and/or aggravate the complex, chronically occurring, and broadly (though often subtly) interconnected problems or issues we address. This leads to a myopia, it prevents us from being able to helping to identify the broadest range of possible solutions to the problems we focus on, or in some cases the consequences of our proposed solutions. A case in point: bioethicists continue to stress the importance of autonomy while, at the same time, we fail to point out how basic economic and political arrangements actually set the framework for any meaningful understanding of autonomy to occur. Take, for example, the increasing availability of insurance-subsidized IVF in the US, a nation where the official poverty rate in 2009 was 14.3 percent (20.7% for children under 18 years of age), and where the percentage of people without health insurance coverage increased from 15.4 percent to 16.7 percent over the same period.1 What does autonomy effectively mean for the couple seeking IVF? For the child in poverty? For the person without health insurance? They all live in the same country, under much the same social or political arrangements, arrangements that have helped to create and now perpetuate the ability of some to fulfill not only their basic needs, along with their wants and desires. Yet at the same time, many of their basic needs will go unmet. Loosely paraphrasing John Dewey, we might ask how a country that hoists the banner of the ideal, autonomy in this instance, can march in the direction of continual disregard concerning not only such basic inequities, but also such pressing issues as overpopulation, pollution on a global scale, global warming, the likely extinction of various flora and fauna. All of these things drastically impinge on the longterm robust autonomy of all for what might be the very short-term benefit of a select few.2 Autonomy has rightly become the backbone of discussions in bioethics in the US. But we might now initiate meaningful discussion about what that autonomy means and how best to secure it. This would move us past the thought that autonomy is an abstract ideal, and towards the idea that it can reveal a reality lived, not just by some, but every biologically, psychologically, socially and environmentally situated self.",

      "abstract": "When social movement scholars write about protest, they typically reference protest events occurring in public spaces. These events encompass various types of protest activities such as marches, rallies, demonstrations, pickets, strikes, and vigils, which may occur as stand‐alone activities or in various combinations thereof, such as marching to the site of a rally or demonstration. Inasmuch as such events are often sponsored and organized by an anchoring social movement or coalition of movements, there is little question but that the analysis of protest events is fundamental to understanding aspects of the dynamics and operation of social movements. Yet, it is argued in this entry that the tendency to treat protest and protest events as parallel terms for the same phenomena constricts our understanding of protest in a number of ways. First, most protest events function as the public face of an existing movement or as the upsurge of an underlying animating sentiment pool. Much like the metaphoric tip of an iceberg, protest events generally signify a broader and deeper base of organizational and/or corresponding cognitive and affective support or sentimentality, which are too often overlooked. Second, a research focus on protest events also implies that protest which doesn't congeal into public, collective, embodied protest events rarely merits analytic attention. Thus, by yoking protest to protest events, as if they are the same, the broader character and multidimensionality of protest is glossed over and misconstrued.",

      "title": "Learned helplessness",
      "abstract": "Helplessness is a state in which nothing a person opts to do affects what is happening. It is the quitting or the give up response that follows the conviction that whatever a person does doesn't matter.[1] Learned helplessness (LH) was initially used to label the failure of certain laboratory animals to escape or avoid shock, despite giving an opportunity, subsequent to earlier exposure to unavoidable shock.[23] Now, the term has been applied to the failure of human beings to pursue, utilize, or acquire adaptive instrumental responses. It is observed in a depressed person who seems to have given up hope that effective voluntary control over important environmental events is possible.[4] People suffering from LH accept that bad things will take place and they will have little control over them.[5] Those who are exposed to complex problems for an extended period learn that responses and events are unconnected. Learning attained in this situation weakens imminent learning and leads to inactivity. Consequently, they will be unsuccessful to resolve any concern even if there is a possible solution for the concern.[6] The LH hypothesis has been reformulated as the old hypothesis does not distinguish between the outcomes that are uncontrollable for all the people and those uncontrollable only for some (universal vs. personal helplessness). It does not explain when helplessness is general or specific; chronic or acute. Reformulation states that the helplessness is attributed to a cause by people. The cause can be stable or unstable, global or specific, and internal or external.[7] Helplessness may be considered as a consequence of early socialization experiences. More specifically, the rigidity and negativism emphasized in our family systems are likely to affect the child's development of competence. A number of sociocultural features may also play their part. Hence, it is essential to explore the role of socialization as it relates to the development of child's helplessness.[6] Children who had history of abuse and neglect during their childhood and adolescence can develop a state of LH. Consequences of emotional abuse may be repeated abnormal or disrupted attachment development and the sufferer blames him/herself for the abuse, leading to LH, emotional distress, and excessively inactive behavior. Psychological abuse is often combined with other forms of abuse.[8] Children who have experienced chronic neglect are likely to have attribution models which conceptualize themselves as powerless and of low value. Neglected children are less likely to know that they are being neglected or to know that something can be done about it.[910] The capacity to cope, and thrive, subsequent to an adverse experience is often stated as resilience. A number of protective and supportive factors may contribute to an abused or neglected child's resilience. These include positive attachment, self-esteem, intelligence, emotion regulation, humor, and independence.[11] LH may be observed in the elderly, due to repeated exposure to events perceived beyond their control eventually display cognitive, motivational, and affective deficits of helplessness. The loss of self-esteem may also occur if the individual believes that he/she is personally accountable for the situations.[12] Other effects of elder abuse may include feelings such as separation, guilt, shame, fear, anxiety, and rejection.[13] The LH model gives the impression that instrumental coping behavior is the most adaptive response to threat on every occasion. Nonetheless, adaptive escape/avoidance responses are not always available for some kinds of aversive events. This is of some clinical and behavioral guidance interest to the dentists.[1415] Learned Helplessness and Dental Practice The theory of LH provides an understanding of certain noncompliant behavior observed in some of the dental patients. Patients experience a loss of self-esteem due to the feeling of helplessness and victimization, or suspicion and doubt of what the oral health-care provider says or does that can lead to communication failure.[16] History of childhood and adult trauma related to various types of abuse and neglect appears to be significantly associated with high dental fear although multiple factors play a key role. Various degrees of helplessness, powerlessness, and incidents of lack of control during dental treatments were reported. Fears of being trapped in the dental chair, claustrophobia, being unable to breathe, and feeling of chocking or severe gagging that interferes with dental treatments were reported.[17] The noise created by dental operatory can induce LH, increase arousal, alter the choice of task approach, and decrease the attention of the dental patients.[18] Dental practitioners and their auxiliaries can play distinct role in facilitating to prevent or reverse the effects of helplessness in their patients. The practitioners can enhance the perceived control of their patients, by providing them with choices that are probable and practical, which will enhance their success experience. They also need to promote autonomy and self-sufficiency in their patients, and to discard the penchant to do everything for the patients, those age/skill appropriate tasks that can be individually accomplished. Dental staff members can use these guidelines to improve the quality of their communication with their patients and can be influential in preventing or reducing the behavioral discrepancies associated with LH.[12] We have a crucial role in identifying this state of LH in our dental patients, including children, adolescents, adults, elderly, or those with special health-care needs and guide them consequently in a dental situation. Otherwise, they may continue to suffer the pain and discomfort if any, without complaining, that may lead to long term consequences.",

The senses’ respective representational modes, styles, and structures differ very strongly from each other. (2) The Layering thesis. A single sensory representation usually has more than one content; the perceptual state represents one object or property by representing a more primitive or less ambitious one. Though this “layering” is ubiquitous, its structure and range differs dramatically as between sense modalities, and in some modalities it works unexpectedly: for example, nearly all tactual representation derives from representation of conditions of or in the subject’s own skin, meaning that touch represents, e.g., the texture of a physical object by, and only by, representing stress within the skin; also the tactual layering is remarkably fine-grained and rich. (3) Aspect perception. Besides the intrinsic interest of “perceiving as”—even popular appeal, what with joke ambiguous figures such as the duck-rabbit and the old/young woman—it remains especially mysterious. Nearly all work on it has concerned vision only. But it is crucial for understanding auditory representation, which is one thing that distinguishes hearing from the other senses. Further, the auditory case greatly reinforces the idea that perceiving-as depends on expectations, it severely damages what we had thought was the best further approach to understanding aspect perception, in terms of attention.",

      "abstract": "Thanks to the scientist Paul Ekman we are now able to assess the type of influence that our non-verbal behaviour has on other people: we can now judge the ability of people to send non-verbal signals and know how to interpret them. We recognize that information provided by words in some cases is contradicted and refuted by the non-verbal expressions that accompany it, and that, when one cannot use words, information can be communicated through non-verbal signs. The emotions are states of mind associated with physiological and psychophysiological changes, with internal or external stimuli, or with natural or learned behaviour. They are associated with mood, temperament, personality and disposition, and motivation. In most cases, lies can be detected because of signs of hidden emotions; the more intense and varied the emotions are, the more likely it is that a lie is unintentionally betrayed. The facial expressions and body language can reveal deep emotions: the presence of a specific emotional state is indicated by a shaky voice, an alteration of tone, a sunny smile, or a furrowed brow. Unlike ordinary expressions and gestures, it is difficult to hide micro-expressions and micro-gestures. Micro-expressions express the seven universal emotions: disgust, anger, fear, sadness, happiness, surprise, and contempt. In 1990 Paul Ekman expanded this list of basic emotions, including a range of positive and negative emotions, not all encoded in facial muscles. These emotions are amusement, contempt, embarrassment, excitement, guilt, pride, relief, satisfaction, pleasure, and shame. Micro-gestures are hard to conceal too, because every little movement is like a word that has a different meaning according to the use made of it in a ‘sentence’. Therefore, in order to analyze a gesture correctly one should keep in mind the context in which it is expressed.",

However, considerations involving the causal completeness of physics and the apparent non-reducibility of mental phenomena to physical phenomena have challenged these assumptions. In the case of mental events (such as someone’s thinking about Vienna), one proposal has been simply to identify not ‘types’ (or classes) of mental events with types of physical events, but merely individual ‘token’ mental events with token physical ones, one by one (your and my thinking about Vienna may be ‘realized’ by different type physical states). The role of mental properties (such as ‘being about Vienna’) in causation is more problematic. Properties are widely thought to have three features that seem to render them causally irrelevant: (1) they are ‘multiply-realizable’ (they can be realized in an indefinite variety of substances); (2) many of them seem not to supervene on neurophysiological properties (differences in mental properties do not always depend merely on differences in neurophysiological ones, but upon relations people bear to things outside their skin); and (3) many of them (for example, ‘being painful’) seem inherently ‘subjective’ in a way that no objective physical properties seem to be.

      "title": "Psychoanalytic theory of anxiety: proposals for reconsideration",
      "abstract": "In psychoanalysis, affect and anxiety have often been used interchangeably; therefore, a brief review of Sigmund Freud's theory of affect can serve as a starting point for a consideration of anxiety and its role, especially as described in Inhibitions, Symptoms and Anxiety. The emphasis on the ego and the various ways it fends off forbidden impulses put the focus on anxiety, since in its signal function it indicated impending danger whether libidinal or aggressive in nature. It is important to remember that pain, fear, and anxiety, and especially anticipatory anxiety, are warning systems that inform us of danger or threat to bodily integrity; these systems are protective and are essential not only for survival, but also for the maintenance of health. Anxiety is elicited by less predictable threats, or by those that are physically or psychologically more distant. Thus anxiety is a more long-lasting state of apprehension.",

      "title": "General Well-Being of Students and Professionals in the Field of Performing Arts in Relation to Gender and Experience",
      "abstract": "Well-being is the state of being happy, healthy and prosperous. Well-being or welfare is a general term for the condition of an individual or group, for example their social, economic. Psychological, spiritual or medical state: high well being means that, in some sense, the individual’s or group’s experience is positive while low well- being is associated with negative happenings. Well-being is equated with the experience of pleasure and the absence of pain over time. The less psychological pain an individual is experiencing the more he or she is going to expenence well-being. When someone is experiencing positive well-being they are also experiencing a few other things. It involves a sense of self-fulfilment, which is the feeling of being happy and one is doing something that fully uses your abilities and talents. The feeling of having a purpose in life and connection with others are also contributors to the idea of well-being when people feel as though they have a purpose in the world they feel like they belong. They feel like they matter and it goes back to be idea that we were created for and by a purpose. Mental Health Week in 2015 has drawn attention to a new evidence-based research study that focuses on workers in the entertainment industry. The report found that entertainment industry workers are at a higher risk of experiencing a mental health problem than the rest of the general population. Because of the lifestyle and the hours that people in the entertainment industry actually work, their ability to access mental health services suffers. There is significant difference in the general well-being among male and female students in the field of performing arts. It means that the general well-being of male students is better than that of female students in the field of performing arts. It implies that there is greater negativity, anxiety and frustration among the female students. There is greater stress, depression and competitiveness amongst them affecting their general well being.",

      "abstract": "Pain, fear and anxiety are intimately linked in the brain and body, anatomically, chemically and as a function of survival. It is not surprising therefore that many behavioural problems caused by pain manifest as fear and anxiety, including separation problems; sound sensitivities; pacing and panting; and avoidance of previously accepted places to walk and/or sleep. The clues that indicate a clinical cause of a behavioural problem are often not specific to pain and further investigation or clinical assessment is often needed to identify pain as a likely cause. This article illustrates these principles by two cases of anxiety caused by pain.

      "title": "The Semantics of -ketun in Korean",
      "abstract": "The conditional connective -ketun in Korean has some restrictions in both the antecedent clause and the consequent clause. In the antecedent clause the event or state denoted by the predicate must be perceptible. There are some exceptions to this restriction. The exceptional cases are where the event or state denotes a personal feeling on the part of the addressee (or addresser, in some cases). From these observations, it is concluded that the antecedent clause must be an event or state which can be directly experienced by the addressee (or, addresser). In the consequent clause, the mood must be imperative, hortative or promissive. When the mood is declarative or interrogative, the modality must be volitional. These moods or modality can be characterized as something that can be satisfied by some action on the part of the addresser or addressee. The relation between these two restrictions is that the antecedent clause changes the knowledge state of the addresser or addressee based on direct experience of something, and the addresser or addressee sets a goal and a plan for achieving the goal. And the consequent clause is an action included in the plan. This is the basic semantics of the conditional connective -ketun. I give a more specific representation of this semantics in this paper.",

Less familiar are the reports following close brushes with death of experiences that are partially or entirely unpleasant, frightening, or frankly hellish. While little is known about the antecedents or aftereffects of these distressing experiences, there appear to be three distinct types, involving (1) phenomenology similar to peaceful near-death experiences but interpreted as unpleasant, (2) a sense of nonexistence or eternal void, or (3) graphic hellish landscapes and entities. While the first type may eventually convert to a typical peaceful experience, the relationship of all three types to prototypical near-death experiences merits further study. The effect of the distressing experience in the lives of individuals deserves exploration, as the psychological impact may be profound and long-lasting.",

      "title": "Explaining Variation in Individual Aging, Its Sources, and Consequences: A Comprehensive Conceptual Model of Human Aging",
      "abstract": "We define aging as a characteristic deterioration in one (or more) observable attributes of an organism that typically occurs during later life. With this narrow functional definition, we gain the freedom to separate aging from other processes of age-related change (e.g., maturation, growth, illness, terminal decline). We introduce a structural model that distinguishes between (1) the phenomenon of aging, (2) the subjective experience of aging, (3) sources of aging, and (4) consequences of aging. A core focus of the model is on the role of buffering mechanisms of biological repair and personal adaptation that regulate the relations between sources of aging, aging proper, and its consequences. The quality and level of functioning of these buffering mechanisms also varies across the life span, which directly affects the sources of aging, resulting in either resilience against or accelerated aging, and thus can be considered to be a major source of the variation in aging processes among different individuals. External factors comprising attributes of the physical environment and sociocultural characteristics are considered as contexts in which aging occurs. These contextual factors are assumed to feed into the various components of the model. Our model provides an interdisciplinary account of human aging, its sources and consequences, and also its subjective experience, by integrating biological, psychological, lifestyle, and sociocultural factors, and by specifying their interrelations and interactions. The model provides a comprehensive understanding of individual human aging, its underlying processes, and modulating factors. It allows for the derivation of empirically testable hypotheses, and it helps practitioners to identify elements that lend themselves to targeted intervention efforts aimed at increasing the resilience of individuals against aging and buffering its negative consequences.",

The victim is not simply reduced to impotence, helplessness, but to a state of ever-greater dependency on his or her torturer. We have to distinguish between informed and deliberate conversion of a detainee’s political convictions, through a kind of hard bargaining that appeals to the detainee’s rationality; inducing a detainee to betray his or her convictions and his or her community and bringing that about by deceit and deception; and inducing a detainee to betray his or her convictions and his or her community by the deliberate destruction of the detainee’s identity and sanity.",

Recently, we have been considering these experiences as outbreak conditions, and have done phenomenological analysis of the experiences themselves with the following results. We found that patients have experienced 1.) \"shame\", and following that, and from the phenomenological consideration of the experience of \"shame\", we have observed 2.) \"alienation\" occurring in each patients, leading to \"isolation.\" In \"isolation\", the patient is driven to despair due to existential anxiety, and as the ultimate in despair, the patient shows the attitude of 3.) \"One wishing to be oneself in despair.\" (Kierkegaard, S.), or \"haughtiness\" which is the attitude of \"a person who understands himself or herself to be a free design, and considers others as 'existence-others' reached through this design.\" (Sartre, J. P.) Here, the patient shows \"consumption\" as a symptom in either of the forms of surfeit (bulimia) or the consumption of one's own body (anorexia): wasting. 4.) These are defined as \"conspicuous consumption\" (Veblen, T. B.). 5.) Conspicuous consumption has been analyzed as a primitive form of exchange by Mauss, M., and has been mentioned repeatedly in the intellectual lineage of Bataille, G., Baudrillard, J., et al. This action is concerned with the acquisition of social status in order to save one's own face, and shows what forms the depth-psychological base stratum in the \"class system\" of human beings, as well as illuminating the \"social functions of dignity and class distribution.\" We have discovered a continuous course from the psychogenic experiences occurring at the onset and previously considered trifling and therefore ignored, proceeding to the symptoms and to the structure of the symptoms. In particular, by using a phenomenological analysis of shame and symptom structure, we show a new hypothesis about the structure of symptoms which is completely different from those created according to various previous opinions.

Consequently, otherwise normal reactions become overcharged with energy and result in anti-social modes of response, or else less adequate responses are utilized to relieve the tension state. The fault lies in the type of behavior utilized rather than in any fundamental physio-organic disorder.

A useful definition of aggression seems to be the following one: Aggression is any physical contact, direct or indirect, by which another person is hurt. 3. We observe five different forms of aggression: 3.1 Aggression by chance, without any aim, happening out of awkwardness and motoric clumsiness. This kind of aggression becomes rarer during the second year. 3.2 Manipulating one another, as shaking arm or leg of another child, pulling his hair, tapping his body and so on, giving the impression of the aggressor exploring his partner. This kind of aggression also becomes rarer during the second year. 3.3 Robbery of objects, i.e. toys being in the hands of another; the reaction of the victim is increasing during the second year. 3.4 Aggression in order to control the group and to establish leadership in connection with the development of a group hierarchy. 3.5 Pathologic Aggression, observed on a child of the group with brain dysfunction. The child overthrows others from behind, climbs on them and bites them in the ear, the neck or the cheek. 4.

      "abstract": "In the relevant circumstance of both relatively high burden or cost to others and low prospective gain for themselves, people have a prima facie duty to die sooner rather than later. This duty is a personal moral duty, not a \"societal\" duty, and thus, it in no way implies that others may demand that it be exercised. It is literally a duty to let death come, not a more general duty to die that encompasses active measures to ensure death. A person can owe this duty not only to close family and loved ones when they are heavily burdened, but in the right circumstances also to more distant persons, even to \"society\"; the fundamental reason is fairness to others in the society or insurance pool, given one's own evaluative preferences about trade-offs involving expensive, low-chance-of-benefit care. This personal moral duty to die does not extend to incompetent patients, at least not in any literal sense. The duty to die also does not jeopardize the marital vow, \"for better or worse, in sickness and in health\"; the creative and mutual relationship envisioned in a marital promise does not bar people from ever coming to think that they may be obligated to accept death because of effects on a spouse. Finally, although this duty is rooted in sensitivity to considerations of quality of life, it need not threaten the \"special\" value of individual life and lifesaving.",

Of interest to researchers is that this person can have what seems to be a perfectly normal health, both mentally and physically. The loss of meaning of life is a hidden killer; it is like a worm eating the apple from within. A total loss of meaning always signifies a major life crisis or even a life coming soon to its end, but most often meaning of life is only partially lost. This partial loss is really much more tricky than a total loss because people set up mental defenses that hinder them from noticing the loss. After a while, the lack of meaning of life will be materialized in poor quality of life, mental and somatic symptoms, including depression or pain, and reduced ability to function sexually, socially, and in work. When carefully examined in the holistic clinic, most patients evidence a problem with their meaning of life; so, in this area much work can be done, greatly benefiting the patients.",

      "abstract": "Personality is a difficult concept to define: it is ex­tremely hard to encapsulate what makes a person ‘who they are’ in general terms. Personality is typically thought of as the set of characteristics which make us think, feel, and act in our own unique way. Personality is pervasive; people tend to behave in similar ways throughout life and across differing social and inter­personal contexts. The characteristics of personality, called traits, are a set of common features which are observed in variable degrees in different people. Traits provide a useful structure in which to describe a per­sonality: Box 31.1 shows some common personality traits. Some traits may be perceived as an asset to the individual, while others are more of a nuisance. We all have a little more or a little less of any given trait. The word ‘temperament’ rather than personality is used to describe the behavioural characteristics dis­played by young children. This is because our person­ality takes time to develop; it is shaped by a multitude of environmental, biological, and factors which interact throughout early life. By our late teens or early twenties, the majority of individuals have the set of traits which define the personality we will have for the rest of our lives. Having an understanding of an individual’s per­sonality helps clinicians to predict their patients’ re­sponse to illness and its treatment. The majority of us have some less favourable aspects to our personality, but we work around them and/ or have more prominent favourable traits that allow us to get on with our lives. For a minority of people, their less favourable traits are so prominent that they cause problems for themselves or for those around them. It is these people who we think of as having a personality disorder. It is extremely difficult to draw a line between normal personality and personality disorder, so this simple pragmatic approach is helpful in clinical practice. People with a personality disorder may: … ● have difficulties with social situations and relationships; ● have difficulties controlling their feelings and/ or behaviour; ● react in unusual ways to illness or to treatment; ● behave in unusual ways when mentally ill; ● have more extreme or unusual reactions to stressful events; ● behave in ways that are detrimental to themselves or others ● be more prone to developing other types of mental disorder.",

In malignant trauma, cure is not attainable because the core of traumatic experience remains in part untouched by symbolic expressions, leaving a person with a sense of inarticulateness and isolation. Malignant trauma is the result of five interrelated experiences of loss: (a) shock associated with the loss of the expectation of help; (b) loss of control over the integrity of one's body; (c) loss in the belief that the other is obliged to respond to a cry; (d) loss of trust associated with the experience of betrayal; and (e) loss of an other's commitment to recognize, respect, and respond to one's desires and needs. These losses defy symbolization because symbolization is contingent upon constitutional biological structures and experiences of an obliged, trustworthy, and faithful other.",

The expression is used interchangeably with the term, grief; which is descriptive in essence, often articulated as a series of psychological, physical, behavioural and emotional responses. Grief is also used more broadly than bereavement, incorporating other losses an individual may experience over a lifespan (Zisook & Shear, 2009). It cannot be disputed both terms appear with some inconsistency within literature; however this editorial will refer to bereavement as an emotional state experienced after a death and grief as a process.\n\nThe emotional and sometimes physical pain experienced after a death will be different for everybody; with no correct formulae on how to feel or what to do once a loss is experienced. Although similar responses will occur amongst individuals, no two experiences will be exactly the same, so comparisons are futile as factors such as personality, mental health, coping skills, support systems, the nature of the relationship with the deceased person, the experience of illness, how the disease progressed and time frames will all play a contributing role (Australian Centre for Grief and Bereavement, 2015).",

Anxiety involves subjective feelings (e.g., worry and a sense of threat), physiological responses (e.g., tachycardia and hypercortisolemia), and behavioral responses (e.g., avoidance and withdrawal). Anxiety and fear share many subjective and physiological characteristics, and there is much debate about how best to distinguish them. Fear, as characterized by Walter Cannon in the 1920s, is generally viewed as a reaction to danger, whereas anxiety is a feeling of fear that is out of proportion to any real threat.

As such, an ultimate goal of personality research must be to identify the relatively static biological variables that determine the superficial factor structure evident in behaviour and other measures. This is not to deny the importance of the environment in controlling personality. But, to produce consistent long-term effects, environmental influences must be mediated by, and instantiated in, biological systems. Biology can also be viewed as more fundamental in that environmental events (such as an impact to the front of the head) have permanent effects on personality not in relation to the external parameters of the event (such as the force of impact) but rather in relation to the precise extent of change the event induces in the brain.",

      "title": "Debts of Good Will and Interpersonal Justice",
      "abstract": "A debt of good will (utang na loob in Filipino) is incurred when a person becomes the beneficiary of significant assistance or favor given by another. Usually, the beneficiary is in acute need of the assistance given or favor granted. This provides an opportunity for the giving of help to serve as a vehicle for the expression of sympathy or concern. The debt could then be appreciated as one of good will because, by catering to another person's pressing need, the benefactor is able to express positive dispositions towards the beneficiary. It is not merely the receipt of the assistance or favor that puts the recipient in a position of indebtedness. The indebtedness is created by the benefactor's kagandahang loob (good will). An act can be considered to convey kagandahang loob only if it is done out of kusang loob (roughly, free will); and can only be considered to have been done out of kusang loob if the agent (1) is not acting under external compulsion, (2) is motivated by positive feelings (e.g. charity, love or sympathy) towards the beneficiary, and (3) is not motivated by the anticipation of reward. These conditions entail debt-of-goodwill relationships where the benefactor has no right to demand reciprocity but the beneficiary has a \"self-imposed\" obligation to repay kagandahang loob with kagandahang loob. Debts of good will are about some forms of justice. But we should not reduce all talk about debts of good will to talk about justice.",

      "abstract": "Abstract An asymmetry effect is known to exist in the estimation of interpersonal distance, depending on whether the point of reference for the estimation is the subject (‘How far are the others from you?’) or the others How far are you from the others?). It looks as though, through the effect of a self‐centring schema, subjects feel that others occupy their own space more than they occupy the space of others. A self‐centring schema has also been found in many other processes involving judgment or comparison of oneself and others. It is generally interpreted as a sign of the affirmation and defence of personal identity. The three experiments reported here attempt to relate the asymmetries in the distances perceived between persons represented on a map to the following three areas in which one's sense of personal or group identity is involved: (1) in the perception of one's own specificity with respect to others (or of the specificity of the group to which one belongs with respect to other groups) (experiment 1), (2) in one's ability to put oneself in the place of others (exocentrism) (experiment 2). and (3) in the individuation of oneself by others (experiment 3). The results of these three experiments lead us to believe that it is indeed the processes of identification and affirmation of personal and group identity ‐ along with the underlying categorization processes — that are the source of the asymmetries observed in interpersonal distance estimation. The consistency of the data obtained in different situations also validates the technique used for estimating interpersonal distance.",

      "title": "Semantic and discourse constraints on Chinese Bei-passives",
      "abstract": "The semantic function of the ? bei passive sentence has been characterized in various ways. It has been claimed by some scholars that its primary function is to indicate that the referent of the subject, the speaker or the hearer is adversely affected by the action, event or state represented in the sentence. It has also been claimed that the construction can sometimes be used neutrally, without any adversity implications. It has further been claimed that it can sometimes be used with positive implications. But little attempt has been made in the past to show exactly when the construction acquires which of these three implications (i.e., adversative, neutral, and positive). This paper attempts to answer that question. It proposes that the semantic/discourse function of the bei-passive sentence is to indicate that the referent of the subject, the speaker (or the person whose point of view (s)he is representing) or the hearer receives a major impact which is above a certain threshold from the action, event, or state represented in the sentence. The impact can be either direct, as is the case with high-impact verbs (e.g., ? da ‘hit’, ?? kaichu ‘fire’), indirect (as is the case with low or no impact verbs such as ?? kanjian ‘see’, ? hen ‘hate’), or both. It shows that a generalization that is based on ‘EITHER a major direct impact OR a major indirect impact’ does not work. It proposes that the semantic/discourse function of the bei-passive sentence is to indicate that the SUM of the direct and indirect impacts that the referent of the subject, the speaker (or the person whose point of view (s)he is representing) or the hearer receives is at or above the threshold for a major impact.",

This research uses case studies, qualitative phenomenological studies, descriptive qualitative, normative law, cross-sectional and case reports taken from articles published from 2016 to 2020.Results and analysis: researchers found 6 articles that were appropriate and met the inclusion criteria for describing ideas when delusions occur in schizophrenic patients, namely having a magical item or tool, having supernatural powers or abilities, experiencing possession or being possessed by a creature, having a high position, feeling frightened by a creature, feeling empty or hollow in the heart, feeling hurt or physically harmed, fasting or certain rituals, feeling like receiving magic/witchcraft from other people, meeting supernatural beings, thinking that other people feel jealous/envy, feeling like they are going to be killed , feels physically disabled/damaged, claims to be God and is controlled by God. As for the aggressive ideas that arise, such as injuring other people, injuring themselves or having suicidal ideas when their delusions occur, even schizophrenic patients when delusions occur in the form of delusions of being chased have ideas about killing because they feel excessively suspicious and feel like they are being chased.

To investigate this, we recorded eye movements while participants were explicitly instructed to avoid looking at one of two objects in a scene (either a person or a non-social object). The results showed that, while participants could follow these instructions, they still made errors (especially on the first saccade). Crucially, there were about twice as many erroneous looks towards the person than there were towards the other object. This indicates that it is hard to suppress the prioritization of social information during scene viewing, with implications for how quickly and automatically this information is perceived and attended to.",

      "abstract": "Emergency personnel, like all workers, carry out their duties within an environment composed of a set of discrete elements. First, there is the emergency itself. Whether a forest fire in France, a tornado in the American Midwest, or a mining disaster in Russia, the emergency imposes certain exigencies upon the responders. Second, a social structure exists with specific social units, rules, and forms of association. An emergency response, therefore, takes place within a context of prescribed behaviors, expectations, and value judgments that are sometimes in conflict with each other. Third, there is a technology that must be understood in order to accomplish group goals. If the technology itself is implicated in the emergency, the entire emergency environment may be impacted. Clearly, a breakdown in any of these elements could result in worker injury and might heighten responder stress. This paper discusses how emergency workers not only get injured but may come to experience burn‐out, post‐traumatic stress syndrome, or impaired work and family relationships, even though their normal work setting (the emergency) is expected to be ‘abnormal’. The authors suggest areas in each of the three environmental elements that deserve further inquiry.",

      "title": "Pavlov + Skinner = Premack",
      "abstract": "Behavior is a sequence of actions. Premackian conditioning occurs when one of those actions permits an animal to engage in more biologically potent positive responses—reinforcement—or forces them to engage in less positive (or negative) responses —punishment. Signals of the transition from one class of actions to another focus the instrumental responses in the first class and inform the contingent responses in the second class. The signals may be innate (USs) or learned (sign-learning); excitatory (leading to more positive actions) or inhibitory (leading to less positive actions). The potency of an action has phylogenetic origins, but may be conditioned by proximity to more potent responses, such as consummation of a reinforcer. With practice instrumental responses may take on increased strength, and in some cases become motivationally autonomous—become habits. Stimuli or responses that signal the availability of more positive actions may become incentive motivators that animals will approach. Discriminative stimuli do not have intrinsic value as reinforcers, but only the value derived from the responses that they release. These forces bend an animal’s trajectory through its stimulus-action-time context into a path that leads more directly to positive actions. The association of actions (conditioned responses, operants, and observing responses) with actions of different potency (ultimately unconditioned responses or consummatory behavior) is the primary association in Premackian conditioning. All other types of conditioning may be interpreted as instances of such Premackian conditioning.",

A curse expresses a wish for misfortune to someone, or more specifically a wish for something unpleasant or violent to happen to a person/group, up to a death wish. Similar to insults and threats, curses contain a negative emotional value and realise a form of verbal violence, as the speech act hints at a harmful event in the future: pending harm is invoked. Jews, Israelis, as well as the State of Israel or Zionism can all be targets of an antisemitic curse.",

      "abstract": "Health is not merely an absence of disease or infirmity but a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being [1].What then is a 'dis-ease' and what is a considered to be a state of complete physical, social and mental well-being?Being 'healthy' is often based on a statistical norm of 'normalcy' -the basis for most diagnostic tests.Health care as a biopsychosocial model is going through a transformation as shown in Table I.In the newer model, causes, development and outcomes of an illness are not looked at in isolation but are determined by physiology, biochemistry and their interaction with psychological, social and cultural factors.Human being is not merely a physical reality but a continuum of consciousness or awareness with the physical body at one end of this awareness spectrum.In complex systems, the whole is more than the sum of its components expressing properties not seen or predicted from the individual components [2].Many of the behavioral health factors such as freedom from physical and emotional pain, freedom from selfishness, increased adaptability, and creativity define health to a complementary and alternative or CAM practitioner [3] and are consistent with a Lorenz attractor pattern, attractors that balance entropy and provide dynamic order out of chaos.There is thus a need for a more meaningful unifying explanation for health and disease in order to better understand the role of interventions in various health care modalities.

      "title": "Ethics Askew: A Case Study Of Ethics In An Educational Environment",
      "abstract": "For a formal definition of ethics, Webster’s New World Dictionary (1995) defines the term as “the study of standards of conduct and moral judgment”. Ethics is important to individuals because we are concerned with what leaders do and who they are—their conduct and character. “Conduct” is a word that implies behavior. Behavior can change under differing circumstances. For instance, in a “low key”, unstressed situation, most individuals tend to be civil and polite; however, the introduction of stress factored into a scenario can totally change the dynamics of the situation, as well as the ability of those involved to “cope”. Stress can cause individuals to become hostile, rebellious, and oftentimes uncompromising. Stress introduced into a situation can also cause individuals to become unethical. For example, take natural disasters such as Hurricane Katrina in 2005 whereby individuals were under tremendous stress of discomfort from not having a clean environment in which to live, as well as conditions of hunger and thirst from lack of food and fresh water. Most of us have witnessed the television footage of the “looting” that occurred from these conditions. Or take the civil unrest that occurred in the streets of Los Angeles after the verdict of 1992 when police officers were acquitted of the beating of an African American named Rodney King. Again, anger and stress caused looting and violence to erupt in the streets. While these are “extreme” situations, the question arises as to how individuals cope with stress in an atmosphere where civility is taught and encouraged. For instance, consider a classroom situation where an assignment to produce an outcome is given with few rules, and the members of the group are from other classes, possibly even in other states. The means of communication for these individuals are e-mail, a relatively new virtual reality website, similar to face book, or telephone should one choose to use that method. This type of situation would most likely exist in a graduate program and in fact, did. This paper is a case study of just that type of situation.",

Particularly interesting is the manner in which the body protects itself against injurious foreign substances. The epithelial lined body cavities have more or less specialized methods of protection. The stomach, for instance, by vomiting emits food that is spoiled, and many drugs that are irritating or disagreeable to the taste, and sometimes even rejects substances that are thought to be nauseating or noxious even though they are not. The excessive salivation when nausea occurs probably tends to dilute the offensive material, or to protect the walls of the mucous membrane.

Hence the idea that rare acts, like rare objects and rare metals and gases, exist which are distinct and have particular psychological, cognitive, emotional, and social psychological effects. Human activities in general are not satisfied with the banality induced by repetition and the perfect knowledge that frequent acts bring, but they are guided more by a desire for innovation or progress, in other words, by a more or less chaotic tendency toward types of rare actions at a given moment. In many cases, the rare act can be considered as the goal of frequent acts, as something that gives them meaning and which, by transcending each of them, proves to be invaluable in moments of doubt, fatigue, and despondency.",

The first one is that life comes from God and is his gift, his image, his mark. God is the only owner of life; therefore this is an unthinkable reality, which is removed from the power of any man. Traditional analyses of death and dying acknowledge, at least implicitly, that decisions about health care take place in the context of relationships, social interdependence, and social obligations. However, bioethics through the middle of the twentieth century still concentrated attention on individual decisions and guarantees of autonomy. Christian teaching has traditionally opposed active causation of death, even for suffering, terminally ill patients. At the same time, death need not be opposed absolutely. The death of a very elderly or ill person may be accepted as appropriate, and measures to prolong life may be refused. To determine the moral character of decisions to use or refuse means, the context must be examined. For one thing, a means that is virtually useless or very dangerous in one era of medical practice may improve in efficacy as time goes on. Similarly, what is not tolerable or effective for one patient may be reasonable and useful for another. Moreover, the patient considering the acceptance of death must sometimes take into account the common good, for which he or she may still have a responsibility.",

Whether he asks for counsel and information regarding his everyday needs or, far beyond any practical considerations, strives for insight, whether his concern is with the first or the last questions, he does only what he cannot leave undone. He can inquire into things ; he can question himself ; he can direct his questions to others or be interrogated by them ; he can run away from perplexing situations or turn his inquisitiveness to the uncovering of problems. In so doing, he only demonstrates and fulfills a basic mode of human existence. When he attempts to evade painful questions, to withdraw from « re-sponsibility », questions follow and pursue him even into sleep. They emerge from his past ; they threaten him from the future ; they haunt him in the present. Questions themselves never disappear, because questioning never ceases. Although particular questions can be transmitted to others and accepted by them as their own, the act of questioning cannot be taught. Nor does it require a teacher. The first question arises early in the life of every healthy child, from the very roots of its existence. We are able to ask single questions because we are questioning beings at our very core.

      "abstract": "There are three lines of approach to the study of the function of cortin the vital hormone of the adrenal cortex; one, through the effects of deprivation, a second through the effects of replacement in deficient subjects, and the third through the action of cortin in normal subjects. The most striking results occur when there is a deficiency of the hormone. In experimental adrenal insufficiency symptoms develop which indicate marked changes in the functions of many tissues of the body. Animals with both adrenals removed not only become fatigued easily when they undertake exercise, but they show a disinclination for exercise. Loss of appetite appears sooner or later, with or without vomiting, and there may be hemorrhages from the mueosa of the alimentary canal or elsewhere. As the animals become worse, they lose interest in their surroundings, finally passing into a state of inertia which verges upon coma or they become easily irritated and may appear irrational (wandering about aimlessly from one place to another without being satisfied anywhere), finally passing into coma, from which they are roused with difficulty. Just preceding or alternating with coma, twitching, heightened motor activity, and even convulsions sometimes occur. The blood urea rises and the blood sugar may fall. Although the changes seem to be coming on gradually, collapse may occur suddenly. In addition to the symptoms described for animals, in man other symptoms evident are pain in the legs, back or abdomen; insomnia and mental depression; poor judgment; failure of memory and lack of cooperation. With the administration of cortin the symptoms tend to disappear in the reverse order of their appearance; coma being replaced by heightened muscular irritability, as shown by increased motor activity, aimless movements, twitching and marked myotatic response to stimuli.",

      "abstract": "We often talk of man as a being capable of making alternative choices i.e. of having the power to choose between alternative courses of action particularly after careful deliberation. We also notice that at times a man abandon a course of action say a religion for another. We are also found of blaming or praising people, punishing or rewarding people, discouraging or encouraging people. At other time, laws are enacted that may urge people to take certain actions and forbid them to take other actions. Whenever any and, or all of these things are done, the underlined assumption is that man has freedom of the will. On the other hand, it could sometime be argued that a man who does things in a certain way could not have done otherwise. At times the observation could be that certain persons behave in ways and manners dictated by orientation background, their economic beliefs or their religious upbringing. We also notice the element of environmental influences in people's behaviour. This state of affairs sometime make us to wonder whether we are really free moral agents or whether our actions are not after all determined by forces and circumstances beyond our control. In this paper while it is recognized that human actions could be determined, the paper submits that man has the free will to choose the course of the action he likes and he, at the same time bears responsibility for all his actions.African Journal of Cross-Cultural psychology and sport facilitation (AJCPSF) Vol. 9 2007: pp. 26-36",

      "title": "Antecedentes psicológicos del consecuencialismo intransigente",
      "abstract": "People make moral decisions with a focus either on the morality of their actions (for example, killing one person) or on the value of the consequences of such actions (for example, saving the lives of five people). The first type of morality is called ?deontological?, the second type is called ?consequentialist?.\r\nDeontological morality can take extreme, uncompromising forms when the decision maker is unwilling to violate a particular norm irrespective of the consequences of such a violation. Research (Baron & Spranca, 1997; Tetlock, 2003) on ?protected? or ?sacred? values has characterized these uncompromising forms of deontological morality as irrational. For example, the prohibition against killing innocent people under any circumstances might block the sacrifice of one victim in order to save many lives. In the studies on sacred or protected values, consequentialism is the rational standard of comparison against which deontological decisions are compared.\r\nIn this thesis we suggest that consequentialist moral decisions can also take uncompromising forms that can be as irrational as uncompromising deontological decisions. Consequentialist decision makers have limited access to information when forecasting the outcomes of their decisions. When calculating the payoff of a course of action, decision makers should make a precise estimate of the actual moral and physical costs of the chosen action as well as a precise estimate of the probability of the actual occurrence of the intended goal.\r\nPsychological distance gives rise to an abstract representation of actions that makes goals more prominent and can help us ignore the actions? immediate harmful effects.\r\nOur main hypothesis is that psychological distance promotes a mindset in which decision makers are less prone to make such precise estimates of the cost of the action and probability of the goal. In this way, consequentialist decisions become riskier and crueler. In other words, psychological distance should be a main predictor of uncompromising consequentialism.\r\nWe tested and confirmed this hypothesis through seven experiments. In Experiments 1, 2 and 4, psychological distance increased the choices of riskier, potentially ineffective consequentialist courses of action. In Experiments 3, 5 and 6 participants were willing to subscribe alternative, radical ?solutions? that seriously challenged strong moral normative intuitions (for example, the prohibition against killing your loved ones) in pursuit of an extremely abstract, absurdly idealized, object of endeavor (to restore justice in the world). Finally, Experiment 7 confirmed an additional important effect of an abstract mindset: decision makers? higher moral certitude and satisfaction.\r\nIn our view, these findings will help us to understand (add to our understanding of) the dynamics of moral decision-making in those settings in which authorities and experts make decisions. While some professional advice recommends that decision-makers maintain distance from their emotions, our findings suggest that psychological distance can prompt potentially cruel and ineffective decisions that ignore the key costs of some consequentialist courses of action.\r\n?",

      "abstract": "Human love can be either a passion of the sensible appetite or an act of the will. This second type of love, insofar as it is preceeded by a choice, is also called dilectio . This in turn may be of two types: love of possession (or of a thing), and love of communion (or of a person). By its very nature, the love of a thing is directed to the love of a person, and when this order is upset, certain aberrations make their appearance: either things are loved as if they were persons, or persons as if they were things, or finally persons are loved as persons but without wishing to do anything for them.\r\nThe three requirements for love are: good, likeness, and knowledge. The Good refers to the object of love, which is always some good, either a substance (person) or an adjective (thing). Likeness refers to the subject of love, and is either perfect (person) or imperfect (thing). Knowledge has to do with the relation subject-object, because nothing is loved if it is not first known.\r\nThe four principal effects of love are: union, mutual indwelling, extasis and zeal. Union, to a certain extent anterior to love, is also an effect of love, and the union is real to the extent to which it is possible: «two lovers wish to become one». The mutual indwelling is that by which the lover is in the loved one by knowledge and by desire and in the same way the loved one in the lover, so that each one can say: «I live, rather it is not I, but the other that lives in me». Extasis, or going outside oneself, is due to the fact that the lover is outside himself and lives in the loved one. And finally, zeal is a movement in defence of love, by which everything that threatens love is rejected.\r\nHuman love in the strict sense is the love between man and woman, and is a mixture of the love of a person and the love of a thing, because it refers not only to the souls but also to the bodies, and presupposes the characteristic of exclusiveness that is typical of the love of a thing. But it is also the love of a person and implies by its nature a constancy or endurance until death.",

      "title": "[The comparison of human reflex and instinct behaviour (author's transl)].",
      "abstract": "On the basis of characteristics of the exteroceptive reflexes and of the instincts it was shown that instinct behaviour developed from reflex characteristics (local characteristic of the stimuli, pos. and neg. taxis, habituation, conditioning). Most similarities are found between reflex and avoidance instinct behaviour (instincts for excretion, thermoregulation, body care, pain avoidance and safety). Except the safety instinct, all others react on stimuli, characterised by the localisation of the receptors. In the safety instinct the structure of the stimulus becomes important, together with the growing importance of the third dimension. This instinct shows also for the first time a variability of the threshold with spontaneous remaining low for some time after stimulation of the system. Inverse the gain instincts (nutrition, sex and social instinct). Here the threshold falls spontaneously, when stimuli are lacking and raises, when stimuli are found. The spontaneous motor expression of the lowering of the threshold is the appetite behaviour. It means seeking stimuli, which will be gained by elements of the initial and terminal success behaviour. The successfull nutritional and sexual behaviour is stopped by success inhibition, whereas the social instinct remains in the terminal success behaviour with group dynamic hierarchy, with imitating and helping behaviour. Overchanging of the gain instincts provokes avoidance behaviour with constant threshold. The neural systems of most reflexes lie distributed in the spinal cord and brainstem, the ones of the instincts in the limbic part of the brain, the nutrition and sex instinct with a hypothalamic pacemaker. Simultaneous activation of two or many instinct motivation systems result, not comparable with the direct reflex interaction, in interactions on the level of the global interaction, in interactions on the level of the global integration (summation, mixture, synthesis, rest, oscillation, intention) which projects the activity patterns via the motor cortex to the peripheral neurons. There it is completed by the reflexes. The hormonal and vegetative projection instead go directly to the end organs. The motivation is responsible for the subjective experience, the dominating integration with its motor projection for the instinct behaviour.",

A state might close a bridge, for example, based on evidence it is unstable. Evidence affects moral and legal matters, such as how we may permissibly treat people. Killing another person is usually legally and morally prohibited, for instance, but can be rendered permissible by compelling evidence that the person is an immediate serious threat to others. More mundanely, we might permissibly avoid a person, based on evidence they mistreat people. In addition to justifying beliefs, it also causes belief. It can be difficult to suspend judgement in the face of compelling evidence. Evidence plays significant roles in interpersonal relationships, including assigning blame and resolving disputes. It is paramount in law, science, journalism, and medical practice; it structures scholarly pursuits, such as historical investigation. More prosaically, evidence is how humans, higher animals, and (perhaps) robots navigate their environment. It is indispensable to thought. What kinds of things can be evidence? Candidates include facts, propositions, assertions, beliefs, knowledge, objects, states of affairs, and phenomenological experiences (§1). Pieces of evidence stand in intricate webs, with the overall epistemic force of a body of evidence depending on many interlocking factors (§2). Evidence can be undermined or reinforced by other evidence, and differing background knowledge licenses different inferences from a given piece of evidence. Evidence affects the justification of belief and other doxastic attitudes in various ways, and also influences epistemic practices, character, and institutions (§3).",

Definition 2 restricts ‘habit’ to a type of *learned behaviour; it is a special case of definition 1, but is stated separately because this is what ‘habit’ commonly means in the contemporary learning literature. In the early learning literature, ‘habit’ was also occasionally used to denote a learned act in general, but this is now unacceptable. Habits comprise a substantial chunk of our behavioural repertoire, often to a larger degree than we tend to concede. Driving a car becomes a habit, but so is also eating junk food, or delivering the same seminar for the ninth time.",

      "abstract": "When looking at other people, we can readily tell how attentive (or distracted) they are. Some cues to this are fairly obvious (as when someone stares intensely at you), but others seem more subtle. For example, increased cognitive load or emotional arousal causes one's pupils to dilate. This phenomenon is frequently employed as a physiological measure of arousal, in studies of pupillometry. Here, in contrast, we employ it as a stimulus for social perception. Might the human visual system be naturally and automatically engaging in \"unconscious pupillometry\"? We demonstrate that faces rendered invisible (through continuous flash suppression) enter awareness faster when their pupils are dilated. This cannot be explained by appeal to differential contrast, differential attractiveness, or spatial attentional biases, and the effect vanishes when the identical stimuli are presented in socially meaningless ways (e.g., as shirt buttons or facial moles). These results demonstrate that pupil dilation is prioritized in visual processing even outside the focus of conscious awareness, in a form of unconscious \"attentional contagion.\" (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved).",

The body that 'Stays' (S) in front of the object and performs activities.These three types of the intimate relationship between bodies and objects, i.e., T, TL-P, and TL-S, were used as the main sensing conditions to develop the Presence Stickers sensor module.We affixed 8 Presence Stickers on 9 objects in six spaces and finally, the life pattern can be analyzed and the sensors provide the customized intelligent application function for the elderly.",

      "title": "Stories That are Ready to Break",
      "abstract": "When illness is protracted, when there is no chance of return to the person one once was, or when there is no hope of being \"normal,\" a person's very sense of self is lived in a special way through the body. Personal identity becomes intimately tied to the pain, uncertainty, and stigma that come with an affl icted body. What might it mean to be healed when a cure is only a distant possibility or no possibility at all? The inevitable poverty of biomedical responses to this question has a great deal to do with why narrative is so irresistible. Stories, told or acted, offer healing possibilities that reach far beyond the purview of biomedicine. They can help transform identity, interpret the meaning of the past and even provide images of possible futures. This narrative potential has spawned a wealth of scholarship on the relation of narrative, illness, and personal identity. (See, e.g., Bülow & Hydén, 2003; Becker, 1997; Brockmeier, 2002; Cain, 1991; Charon & Montello, 2002; Frank, 1995; Garro, 2000; Good & Good, 1994; Greenhalgh & Hurwitz, 1998; Hydén, 1997; Kleinman, 1988; Medved & Brockmeier, 2004; Monks, 2000; Morris, 1998.) But stories have insidious potential as well, closing down possibilities, cloaking power in the name of \"stating the facts,\" preventing the very changes that might lead to healing. The very form of stories may oppress, forcing a meaning that denies or overrides a chaotic or inarticulate personal experience. Kirmayer, for example, contends that the coherence that is part of a well-told tale can distance the sufferer from her experience of suffering. Stories can be vehicles for ideology making, especially when coconstructed with powerful physicians, producing texts that are, from the patient's point of view, experience distant. Metaphors and \"fragmentary stories, narrative strands\" may be more revealing than a fi nely wrought narrative (Kirmayer 2000, p. 171). Unni Wikan (2000) also objects that sometimes stories present life in an overly coherent way and cannot necessarily be called upon when facing an unpredictable illness. It may even be that silences or half-told tales disclose more about what it is like to be fl attened by a serious and unexpected illness, to \"fall out of one's life,\" as Gadamer (1996, p. 42) puts it.",

Other accounts involve the experiencer obtaining knowledge by other means, without the assistance of a non-human supernatural being. While some cases involve deceased relatives, the most significant factor in others might be the soul’s perceptions of the body from a vantage point outside it, seeing or travelling to other realms, having a panoramic life review, encountering the soul of a person not previously known to have died, having prophetic visions, or more generalized impressions of universal understanding and/or union. In all these senses, NDEs can be seen as revelatory experiences, with profound information being conveyed to the individual through ostensibly mystical or ‘religious’ experiences.",

While primary emotions require a self to experience the state (Lewis and Michalson, 1983), self-conscious emotions require a self both to produce the state and then to experience it. For example, a loud noise may put me in a state of fright. But to experience this state, I need to be aware of my state of fright. To be in a state of shame I must compare my action against some standard, either my own or someone else's. My failure, relative to the standard, results in a state of shame. Once in the state, I may or may not experience it. To experience it depends on whether I focus my attention on my state. Again, this requires consciousness. Others have suggested that the state of shame can be produced in a more automatic fashion, one that does not require objective self-awareness.

Were the social dangers posed by these transactions really a matter for concern, surely the attempt should first be made to understand the conditions that foster them. For unless interest in obscenity is assumed to be innate, a trait of human nature, there should be an explanation for it in the variable conditions (the repressions—or, perhaps, on the other hand, the creative impulses) that impinge on the more authentic and so non-prurient traits of human nature.

      "title": "[The Importance of Body Image in Clinical Practice].",
      "abstract": "The concept of body image has been applied in various disciplines, including neurology, clinical psychology, psychopathology, behavioral science, and nursing (Cash, 2004; Rhoten, 2017). Meleau-Ponty (1962) identified the body as the subject of perception and considered the body not as an object but as an embodied subject that lives in the world. \"Body image\" refers to an individual's body, which generates a sensory message through contact with the environment during internal physiological operations and establishes a preliminary mental understanding of the body (Schilder, 1970). Body image is also affected by the external environment. As Plato remarked, \"We are bound to our bodies like an oyster is to its shell.\" Indeed, our life experiences are integrally influenced by the body we happen to live in (Cash, 2004). Because body image is formed primarily by individuals interacting with others, Schilder (1970) called body image a social entity. People desire to keep their body image intact and unaffected by changes, damage, or losses in terms of function or body parts. Any change is perceived as a threat and thus induces anxiety and fear (Rochlin, 1973). In caring for a patient facing body-image changes, a nurse may help the patient using her in-depth knowledge of the potential impacts of this change on the body, mind, social relationships, bodily functions, self-concept, and self-esteem (Roberts, 1978). Under what circumstances do individuals experience body image change? The most common clinical conditions of body image change are: perceiving sensational change (physical discomfort/signs and symptoms), receiving medical treatments/procedures (receiving blood transfusions, injections, punctures), receiving nursing interventions/ procedures (enema, urethral catheterization) pain, taking medications (moon face), experiencing amputation/dysfunction or alteration/disfigurement, becoming pregnant or undergoing labor, acquiring physical diseases or injuries (cancer, HIV/AIDS, skin diseases, burns), and experiencing role failure (Cash, 2004; Rhoten, 2017; Roberts, 1978). Therefore, when a patient complains to a nurse about physical discomforts, it is necessary to understand that the patient is experiencing body image change and will benefit from timely and effective assistance to overcome and accept this change. Body image change is an important issue that should continue to be better understood and addressed in the field of nursing. This article provides a rich account of body image discourse that may be used as a reference in clinical nursing care, education, and research.身體意象於臨床的重要性.「身體意象」概念已被各種學科所應用，包括神經學、臨床心理學、精神病理學、行為科學、以及護理學（Cash, 2004; Rhoten, 2017）。Meleau-Ponty（1962）將身體視為知覺的主體（the subject of perception），認為我們的身體不是一個客體，而是生活於世界中一個體現的主體（an embodied subject），所以，人都是經由我們身體來知覺世界，也因而能生活於世界中。而身體意象是指一個人的身體，經由身體內在生理運作與環境接觸後產生知覺訊息，在腦中建立起對自己身體的一種初步認識的結果（Schilder, 1970）。身體意象也受外在環境所影響，如同柏拉圖評論「我們的身體像牡蠣一樣被它的外殼所束縛」，我們的生活經驗完全受到我們身體所處環境的影響（Cash, 2004），這些多變的身體意象，它的形成主要是個人與其他人的互動，因此，Schilder（1970）稱身體意象是一個社會整體（social entity）。人都希望保持身體意象的完整，不要有改變、損壞，不要失去功能或身體的部分。任何改變都是一種威脅，會引起焦慮和害怕（Rochlin, 1973）。當護理人員照顧一位經歷身體意象改變（body image change）的病人時，若能深入了解身體意象的改變會帶給病人身、心及社會面的衝擊，而致影響其身體功能、自我看法以及身為一個人的自尊，才是一位對病人有幫助的護理人員（Roberts, 1978）。然何種情況下，個體會經驗身體意象改變？臨床上最常見的情況就如，當病人抱怨著身體感覺的改變（身體不適／徵象和症狀）、接受醫療措施（抽血、打針、穿刺等)或護理措施（灌腸、導尿等）、疼痛、服用藥物（月亮臉）、截肢／功能喪失或改變、缺陷、或懷孕和生產，罹患疾病或損傷（癌症、愛滋病、皮膚病或燒傷等）以及角色功能的喪失等（Cash, 2004; Rhoten, 2017; Roberts, 1978）比比皆是。因此當病人向護理人員主訴身體不適時，要能理解此時病人正經歷身體意象改變之衝擊，而要如何適時地、有效地協助病人克服並接受身體意象改變，是一門有待護理界繼續學習的一大課題。本期刊提供豐富的身體意象論述，可提供臨床實務照護、教學以及研究之參考。.",

The contribution to the overall sound environment is a question not only of the way in which the ventilation system itself functions, but also a question of the prominence of other contemporary sound sources such as speech, equipment, machines, and external noises. Hazardous effects due to ventilation noise are most prominent in offices, hospitals, control rooms, classrooms, conference rooms, and other types of silent areas. The effects evoked by ventilation noise have also been found to be related to the type of activity being conducted. Annoyance and performance thus not only seemed to be linked to the physical character of exposure, i.e., noise level, frequency characteristics, and length of exposure, but also mental and manual activity, complexity, and monotony of the work. The effects can be described in terms of annoyance, discomfort, and fatigue, with consequences on performance and increased mental load. The silent areas where ventilation noise may be most frequently experienced are often synonymous with areas and activities most sensitive to the exposure.",

The complexes constellated in one's psyche direct his/her perception and apperception of the world. Destiny and Fate are two words which relate to important situations in life. Destiny gives us the sense of something to be achieved, while Fate has the sense of some tragedy that occurred to us. We may say that if someone can connect to the archetypal background of what happens to him, he/she will be in contact with the structures of the psyche which guides human life; therefore, one may find meaning in what has happened (what can be seen as salvation). However, if one does not relate to the totality of the psyche and is blocked in the negative aspects of the event, he/she will be isolated from psyche's creative potential and, therefore, will relate to it as fate (what can be seen as damnation).",

In thinking about environments for older people, attention is too often given the physical aspects, to the exclusion of the psychological aspects. Objects and people may be in the physical environment of a person of any age without affecting him.

      "title": "Introduction",
      "abstract": "Informally, an event is something that has happened, is happening, or is expected to happen. In philosophy, an event can refer to a material phenomenon where some object changed its property, or a mental phenomenon like the occurrence of an emotion or thought. In the past decade, many different communities have defined concepts, technologies, and systems that relate to events, and they cover wide ranged areas in Computer Science including languages, databases, and communication systems [Voisard and Ziekow, 2011]. In this book, we consider events as real-world occurrences that unfold over space and time; they are observable occurrences of some phenomena that have either been explicitly recorded (e.g., \"the ad hoc committee meeting occurred at 3pm on Thursday,\" as recorded by a person), or can be computed (\"John entered room 303 through the west door\" based on the computation from motion detection and face recognition routines). Typically, given a collection of events, one would want to know things like: \"What happened in this event? When and where? Who was involved and how? How did it happen? What other events is this event related to and how? Who detected and reported it? What is the evidence that the event actually occurred? Does this event lead to any consequences? How do people (and machines) react to this event?\" Questions like these are important in a wide variety of domains. Surveillance applications [Tian et al., 2008a] consider events like entries into and exits from a monitored space, intrusion in a prohibited regions and so on. RFID based tracking applications [Welbourne et al., 2008] consider \"movement events\" of objects from one place to another. Research projects on lifelogging such as the MyLifeBits project [Gemmell et al., 2006] from Microsoft records personal events of an individual, including the images and videos collected by the individual to capture their personal experience of events. Another class of applications, called experiential applications, focus on event-based access to live streaming multimedia information [Gupta et al., 2004]. In this case, a user might want to gain access to the live feed of a meeting when a specified event occurs. In each case, the ultimate goal of the system is to allow a user to access, search, explore, correlate, annotate, and get insight from a web of events and all their associated data.",

Just as the law sees a lawbreaker deviating from legal norms, the psychiatrist , views his patient to be deviant with respect to some ideal pattern which may be left unvoiced or inexplicit. My object is not to question the propriety of such professional judgments but to determine what might be called their social basis and to call attention to certain consequences that follow.",

Disasters disrupt progress and destroy developmental efforts, often pushing nations back several decades in their quest for progress. Thus, efficient management of disasters rather than mere response to their occurrence has received increased attention, both within India and abroad. 1 The Oxford Dictionary of English Etymology defines a disaster as a \"sudden or great calamity.\" Similarly, the Collins Dictionary describes disaster as \"an occurrence that causes great distress or destruction.\" The United Nations defines disaster as \"the occurrence of sudden or major misfortune which disrupts the basic fabric and normal functioning of the society or community.\" 2 A disaster is a sudden, calamitous event that seriously disrupts the functioning of a community or society and causes human, material, and economic or environmental losses that exceed the community's or society's ability to cope using its own resources.",

In the “objectivist” sense, suffering is roughly synonymous with calamity or misfortune. In this sense, the precise meaning of suffering remains partly to be filled in, because what counts as calamity or misfortune is somewhat vague and partly subject to dispute. But often enough, calamity is unmistakable. One is murdered; one’s relatives are massacred; one’s house of a lifetime is swept away by a flood; one loses one’s job and is turned onto the street; one is malnourished; one contracts a debilitating disease. Sometimes suffering simply designates the experience of such objective calamities, withoutreferring to the psychological state of the people concerned.",

The final category involves physical characteristics that compromise bodily appearance or functioning. Whether voluntarily or involuntarily acquired, abominations of the body can be regarded as a form of deviance. Like the other types of stigma, undesirable physical characteristics isolate some individuals, disqualifying them from “full social acceptance” (p. 1). Everything about the stigmatized person is interpreted in light of the negative trait, so that interaction with the non‐stigmatized is often awkward and uncertain. Tension is manifest in people's tendency to avoid eye contact, make guarded references to the stigma, or avoid everyday words that suddenly become taboo; it leads both parties to consider avoiding or withdrawing from encounters.",

Affective forces, such as sexist or racist abuse hurled at bodies online or in the street, are entangled with more recognisable, codified emotions (fear, shame, hate). Affect conceptualises feelings as relational rather than as discrete states of being inhering in separately bounded bodies. Affect displaces reason/emotion, mind/body, self/other binaries and offers alternative – and more affirmative – explanations of how and why sensation and feeling matter. Affect studies have a long philosophical history, reaching back to Spinoza's interest in the capacities of bodies and how bodies can affect and be affected. Sad and joyful affects are implicated in reducing or expanding embodied capacities.",

Spiritual terrorism is the most extreme form of spiritual abuse and may cause serious mental health problems. Those people who have not been spiritually terrorized have not necessarily been spared from spiritual abuse and therefore may still be in need of competent, spiritual counseling. Spiritual abuse, which may be active or passive, can best be conceptualized on a continuum from terroristic to zero abuse. Severity is determined by intensity, age of onset, duration, and individual reaction. The underlying issue in all forms of abuse is control.",

Appropriate interventions differ for each aspect of the body: for the body as social symbol, programs such as Look Good ... Feel Better or image centers; for the body's sensations and symptoms, information about what to expect and about symptom prevention and management; for the existential body, active listening to fears and concerns and providing assistance as needed.",

The question is not an obvious one, for security is not typically thought to be a quality of vision, or of the other senses.

The conventional view of security is that it subsists in a 'political relation ... between the individual and the political community' to provide minimum conditions of physical safety and the protection of law.1 Such a view belies a very long history of conceptual uncertainty not simply about who is to be secured from whom, or the structure of mechanisms for providing security, but over the moral and even spiritual value of security itself.",

      "abstract": "Living systems tend to maintain in equilibrium variables associated with their continued existence. Environ mental conditions which force these variables beyond their normal ranges produce stress within the system. Feedback mechanisms then seek to restore equilibrium. Stress arises from overloads or underloads of energy and information, as well as from inputs which have threatening implications. The process of adapting to stress depends partly on the nature of the stress-producing agent and partly on the mechanisms available to the system. Exposure to heat, for example, involves dilation of blood vessels, reduction of body activity, and sweating to reduce body heat. At the same time, the system undergoes neurophysiological and endocrine changes which are found in many other types of stress. When the system is subjected to extreme environmental conditions for an extended period of time, adaptive responses may become increasingly costly. A possible outcome is one of the \"dis eases of adaptation\" described by Selye. Eventually, adap tive mechanisms may fail and the system may collapse. The stress encountered by most individuals arises from the symbolic, rather than the physical, aspects of their environ ment. Among the exceptions are groups such as antarctic explorers, mountain-climbers, prisoners of war, and crews of space vehicles. Although problems arise under these condi tions, most studies of men under stress reveal a remarkable capacity for adaptation to extreme environments.",

These were originally part of a hardwired, phylogenetically adapted, nonverbal information system for implicitly conveying information about these states both among and within individual members of the species. A classification system provides two major functional classes of emotions, (1) those serving as Appetitive Wishes toward objects, and (2) those serving as Beliefs about the status of fulfillment of those and other significant wishes. Thus, emotions such as Anger and Fear indicate a wish to attack or escape from some object or situation, while Love and Surprise indicate wishes to care about or explore an object or situation. Emotional wishes, like their somatic brethren, require Consummatory Acts for their fulfillment. The result of these acts are emotions such Anxiety and Depression, which indicate Beliefs that the relevant wishes will be hard or impossible to satisfy, or Contentment and Elation, which function as Beliefs that the wishes have been or are being fulfilled. Together, emotional wishes and beliefs form a comprehensive wish-belief information feedback system with manifold causal consequences.",

      "title": "Basic Behavioral Processes Involved in Procrastination",
      "abstract": "Procrastination involves an irrational putting off of engaging in a course of action, in spite of expecting to be worse off for the delay. I suggest that to understand the processes underlying procrastination one should examine its relation to several behavioral procedures that have been studied in humans and other animals. For example, in delay discounting, smaller rewards that come sooner are often preferred over larger rewards that come later. In the context of delay discounting, procrastination can be viewed as the preference for an immediate competing activity over the delay to work on a required task. Another process similar to procrastination can be seen in free operant, temporal avoidance (or Sidman avoidance) in which an animal will receive a shock (a deadline not met) if an interval passes without a specified response (task completion). Once animals learn about the interval, they often procrastinate by waiting until the interval has almost passed before responding. Finally, research with animals suggests that the persistence of procrastination may involve a form of negative reinforcement associated with the sudden decline in anxiety or fear (relief) when the task is completed prior to the deadline. Research with animals suggests that the mechanisms responsible for human procrastination may involve systems that derive from several procedures known to produce similar behavior animals.",

Psychology of social influence is by no means the only domain where the experience of the rapid emotional dynamics could be of importance. The emotion of fear launches reactions aimed at stopping all current actions and at the same time increasing cautiousness toward external surroundings – standing, or running away. Because in most cases fear appears when the subject feels endangered, these kinds of reaction are usually adequate. A see-saw goes up and down, and this sudden change of opposite directions is in its nature. In the experimental research of emotion dynamics, it is nearly always assumed that an emotion appears, quickly reaches its peak intensity, and then gradually subsides.",

Deeply routed in the demands of the natural world, the ability to assert oneself represents a critical solution to any individual's need for self-preservation, defence of its interests or resource competition. Examples of aggression are found throughout the entire animal kingdom, regardless of its bearer's specific neural or cognitive faculties, phylogenetic origins or sociobiological circumstances.

      "abstract": "Humility is a psychological characteristic marked by a balanced, accurate \nself-concept and pronounced focus on other people rather than oneself \n(Tangney, 2000). We propose that humility is characterized by five hallmarks, \nor observable markers: (a) a secure and accepting self-identity; (b) freedom \nfrom distortion about one’s strengths and weaknesses; (c) openness to new \ninformation about oneself and the world; (d) high focus on others relative to \nthe self; and (e) a belief that other people are equally worthy (Chancellor & \nLyubomirsky, 2013). Each hallmark must be present, but none is individually sufficient for a person to be humble. These hallmarks thus both define \nhumility and differentiate it from what it is not. In particular, the opposite of \nhumility is high self-focus, including an excessively positive (e.g., narcissism \nor arrogance) or negative (e.g., depression or low self-esteem) self-view. Further, under this hallmarks-based definition, humility can be distinguished from \nmodesty. Although humble people are frequently modest, they may sometimes \nbehave immodestly when speaking frankly about their genuine strengths and \naccomplishments. Additionally, narcissistic individuals may behave outwardly \nmodestly for self-presentational purposes while maintaining an inwardly inflated \nself-worth. As such, humility is neither merely the absence of arrogance nor the \npresence of modesty.",

Stress is the priceless poison for human life in the universe. It can disturb any one's physical, mental, emotional and behavioral balance. Stress can damage different parts of human body from muscles from tissues organs and blood vessels. It can speed up pulse rate and respiration. It can raise blood pressure and body temperature. It can also interfere with the body metabolism, digestion, appetite, sleep, sexuality and even fertilityIndian scholars viewed the phenomenon of stress from various perspectives ranging from stimulus oriented responses and psychodynamic point of view. A comprehensive description of certain concepts which relate closely the modem concepts of stress can be found in traditional texts like Charak Sumlita..Yoga sutrar and Bhagavat Gita.

It is interesting note that the body - mind relationship, characteristic of modem stress studies, The holistic ancient Indian view of stress and management of stress are obtaining currency at international levels.Yoga is an ancient art that is defined as the union of the soul with God (Anand, 2000). It is a path of personal spiritual development that utilizes meditation bring enlightenment, self-realization, and, ultimately, the attainment of God and bliss (p. 109). Originally, the ultimate goal of yoga was called Samadhi, or self-realization (Iyengar, 2001).The word meditate comes from the Latin word meditari, which means, to think or reflect upon (Bonadonna, 2003). It is defined as simple mind-body technique that allows you gain unique state of restful awareness or alertness. Mindfulness meditation is the more difficult of the two (Bonadonna, 2003). It is defined as attempting awareness of the whole perceptual field. More than 2 million Americans have learned meditation over the past years (Bonadonna, 2003). Recent studies and evidence have demonstrated that such yoga practices are effective in reducing stress.Smith et al.,(2007) reported that Yoga was found be as effective as relaxation in reducing stress, anxiety and improving health status on seven domains of the SF-36. Yoga was more effective than relaxation in improving mental health.James et al.

Results show that There was significant improvement for the meditation group compared both the relaxation control and the wait-list groups.Hartfiel et al.

      "title": "What does it mean to be humane?",
      "abstract": "JAVMA, Vol 240, No. 5, March 1, 2012 C and misunderstanding often occur when two people attempt to communicate using different languages. More commonly, confusion arises when two people attempt to communicate using the same language but attach different meanings to the same terms. A good example is the term humane, particularly as it relates to whether the care we provide as veterinarians is humane. The term humane encompasses the best qualities of humankind, including kindness, tenderness, empathy, and compassion. Although all of these behaviors exist to some extent in various animals, animals cannot act in a humane fashion (that is, animal behavior is not judged as humane or inhumane), whereas humans can act in a humane fashion toward other humans and animals. Behavior that is inhumane is lacking in compassion for the suffering of humans and animals; synonyms of inhumanity include unkindness and cruelty. Thus, a veterinarian or animal owner who deliberately chooses to disregard available means to reduce injury or illness in an animal under his or her care could be thought of as inhumane or, in some circumstances, cruel. The definition of cruelty encompasses actions that are inhumane and without pity. The definition of pity encompasses having compassion for the suffering, distress, or troubles of another. Whether an act is cruel depends not only on the act itself, but also on the intent of the act. In my opinion, cruelty involves acts and motivations limited to people. The term welfare signifies a state of being or doing well. The concept of animal welfare has traditionally been founded on the premise that humans have an obligation to act humanely toward animals. In my experience, animal welfare problems are more likely to encompass acts of omission rather than commission (ie, deliberate acts of cruelty). The term compassion is derived from Latin and literally means to suffer with. Thus, compassion encompasses feelings, but more is involved with compassion than simply emotions. According to several modern English dictionaries, two complementary human qualities must be combined to be compassionate. First, we must have empathetic awareness of the suffering, distress, or troubles of another living being. Second, we must have an empathetic desire to help correct the problem. Empathy is the projection of our own thoughts and feelings onto the thoughts and feelings of What does it mean to be humane?",

      "abstract": "The use of gadgets that are not wise and proportional has caused a person's social, mental, and medical problems. Phubbing and smombies are one of the impacts of this problem. Phubbing stands for phone snubbing which refers to the behavior of people who are more focused on using gadgets than interacting with people or the environment around them. Smombie is a person who constantly uses a smartphone, cellphone, or gadget while walking. Or pedestrians who focus on their cellphones without paying attention to their surroundings. While Nomophobia refers to \"anxiety about not having access to cell phones or cell phone services. Human behavior is essentially a process of individual interaction with the environment as a biological manifestation that he is a living being. The behavior of someone who is exposed to phubbing, smombie, or nomophobia is the result of a response to the behavior of those who have been in the habit of using smartphones since childhood. Phubbing, smombie, and nomophobia greatly affect the life of everyone who experiences it such as safety, mental health, social interaction with other people, a person can be affected by this excessive use of cellphones.",

      "abstract": "THE INCREASING INTEREST of psychoanalysts in history and of historians in psychoanalysis stems from a mutual need. The former have found it necessary to give greater attention to social and historical influences on the development of personality, while the latter are seeking a better understanding of irrational and unconscious influences on individual and group behavior in history.' On both sides the difficulties are formidable, most psychoanalysts knowing too little history and most historians too little psychoanalysis. Biographers have a special handicap: the subject is dead or, if alive, usually inaccessible to analysis. Material for analysis may be found in his writings, in his recorded speeches and conversations, and in the observations of others; yet this evidence will never suffice, for the primal experiences that produce the basic character traits occur in the earliest years of life and are hidden from the subject himself by repression and other mechanisms of defense. Often they can be uncovered only after months and years of careful work by the subject interacting with a skilled analyst. Another obstacle for the historian is skepticism2-a tendency to regard",

      "title": "EMOTIONS IN THE ORGANIZATIONAL ENVIRONMENT",
      "abstract": "At the heart of any workplace behavior (and not only), there are always one or more emotions (pleasant/unpleasant, partially controllable/uncontrollable, aware/ unconscious, useful/useless/harmful, intense/less intense, predictable/unpredictable, expressed/ repressed, observable/ unobservable, explained/ unexplained, rational/ irrational, and so on). Emotions are the foundation of a complex and mysterious mechanism of action and behavior. Emotions are triggered by certain things, people, events, situations, processes, results, interactions and so on, and are informed by a variety of endogenous (biological) and exogenous factors, and also by the intellectual potential of each individual. Emotions lie at the intersection of rationality, body (physical) and soul (spirit), thought, reason, logic, compassion, autonomy and action/behavior, individual and environment. This article undertakes to define emotions and identify their impact on the organizational environment, with emphasis on emotional climate and managing emotions. Moreover, we will focus on human behavior/action, rather than on the evolution of the nervous system or the cortex in particular. Work itself should not be a source of suffering. It is obvious that certain emotions cause bad moods, unnecessary and even harmful ones, conditions that should be considered, even if they have a situational and subjective character. Some managers think that the decision-maker fulfills his/her duties by strictly conforming to the law and to the agreement clauses and by meeting his/her obligations in a timely and exacting manner. Others believe that a good leader, in addition to observing the applicable rules and regulation, must be honest also to his colleagues and collaborators and sympathetic to the needs, ideas and emotions of those who are interested in the optimal operation of the company. Managers must remain alert to events, people and behaviors that can trigger harmful emotions within the organization. Employees should be encouraged to express their emotions in order to avoid tense situations. Even though tensions may occur, they must be managed effectively because, as we all know, avoiding a war does not mean peace, just as avoiding unnecessary inconveniences does not always equal pleasure. The improvement of emotional behavior represents a competitive edge in business activities for any organization. The main target of this undertaking is to provide a certain perspective on emotion; to be more specific, we are concerned with discovering the circumstances and causes that trigger off emotions in organizational environments. Theoretical approaches conveyed in this article may be perceived as a call to mindfulness and to the managers\\\\\\' awareness as to the importance of improving the emotional climate of the workplace.",

      "title": "Suicide Intent, Lethality and Life Stresses in SuicideAttempters with Axis I Disorders.",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION:\r\n“Life is a stage with one entrance but many exits”\r\nWill Durant (1954).\r\nSuicide is a psychiatric issue by itself and is also associated with other\r\nPsychiatric illnesses. Though fatal outcomes in suicidal attempts are not seen in\r\nHospitals in our set up, other factors of rescue do play a part in hospital\r\nAttendance.\r\nSuicidal acts with non-fatal outcome are labeled suicide attempts,\r\nAttempted suicides, Parasuicide, or acts of deliberate self harm. These terms are\r\nUsed to describe behaviors, through which people inflict acute harm upon\r\nThemselves with a non fatal outcome. These behaviors are some how linked to,\r\nBut do not result in death.\r\nAccording to WHO/EURO multi-centre study on Para suicide, it is\r\nDefined as An act with non fatal outcome in which an individual deliberately\r\nInitiates a non habitual behavior, that without intervention from others will\r\nCause self harm, (or) deliberately ingests a substance in excess of the prescribed\r\n(or) generally recognized dosage, and which is aimed at realizing changes that\r\nThe person desires via the actual (or) expected physical consequences.\r\nHence, non- fatal suicidal attempts can have different motivations,\r\nVarying from an intention to die or a cry for help. These attempts may be well\r\nPrepared or carried out impulsively. The degree of lethality and the degree of\r\nMedical seriousness thus depend upon intention, preparation, knowledge and\r\nExpectations of the method chosen and sometimes upon coincidental factors,\r\nSuch as intervention from others.\r\nRisk and protective factors are associated with suicidal behaviors in\r\nYoung females, including stressful life events, mental disorders and hormonal\r\nFactors. Risk and protective factors suggest potential pathogenic mechanisms\r\nAnd indicate the need for efficient method to reach these people at risk.\r\nAs per the WHO statistics, in the year 2000, approximately one million\r\nPeople died from suicide: a mortality rate of 16 per 100,000, or one\r\nDeath every 40 seconds. In the last 45 years suicide rates have increased by 60%\r\nWorldwide.\r\nSuicide is now among the three leading causes of death among those aged 15-\r\n44 years (both sexes); these figures do not include suicide attempts up to 20\r\nTimes more frequent than completed suicides. Suicide worldwide is estimated to\r\nRepresent 1.8% of the total global burden of disease in 1998, and 2.4% in\r\nCountries with market and former socialist economies in 2020. Although\r\nTraditionally suicide rates have been highest among the male elderly, rates\r\nAmong young people have been increasing to such an extent that they are now\r\nThe group at highest risk in a third of countries, in both developed and\r\nDeveloping countries.\r\nEttlingers (1964) in his review reports, 1-2% of those who attempt suicide\r\nEventually complete suicide annually. For every single successful suicidal\r\nAttempt 5-10 persons attempt but do not succeed.\r\nMental disorders (particularly depression and substance abuse) are\r\nAssociated with more than 90% of all cases of suicide; however, suicide results\r\nFrom many complex sociocultural factors and is more likely to occur\r\nParticularly during periods of socioeconomic, family and individual crisis\r\nSituations (e.g. Loss of a loved one, employment, honor).\r\nThough there were observations about suicide and suicidal\r\nBehavior in ancient times, the studies on attempted suicide and suicide have\r\nGained impetus in the recent past. Such studies have lent credence to the theory\r\nThat the suicidal state appears to a large extent, a potentially recognizable and\r\nPreventable one.\r\nDue to expansion of the problem of attempted suicide, major research\r\nEffort has been directed towards investigation on the characteristics of people\r\nWho attempt suicide and is given a high priority in suicide prevention. At risk\r\nPopulation for suicide and attempted suicide is a group which has to be\r\nIdentified and intervened to prevent death from this eminently preventable\r\nCause.\r\nThe aim is not only to achieve a fall in rate of suicide but also to\r\nRestore the individual’s mental health, the sources of emotional sustenance,\r\nWhich is necessary for survival and to maintain the dignity of human life.",

In other words, they mark when they are likely to attack another member of the same species, and are likely to win if they do attack. Such a situation occurs, as Hediger (13) pointed out, in connection with territoriality but it also occurs in other kinds of social systems. Frequent, vigorous marking occurs at times when there is reason to infer that the animal is motivated to aggression. The effects of marks and marking upon other individuals are poorly understood. Many species mark with more than one source of scent in response to one stimulus or set of stimuli.",

      "title": "Inference 2: causation",
      "abstract": "The study of cause and effect forms the basis for most human interaction. The repetitive investigation of actions and their consequences can be readily seen in children's behaviour. Adult behaviour may be more complex but essentially involves identical principles. When we speak to someone for the first time, an initial impression is formed. If the conversation proceeds, the impression (hypothesis) is tested and refined through evaluating actions (what we say) and their consequences (the reaction or reply this provokes). If an unknown factor is present (e.g. the other person is preoccupied with something else), the relationship between cause and effect may be misinterpreted resulting in a false impression (e.g. that they are rude or unfriendly). The process can be seen as a repeated series of experiments, albeit unconscious. All of us are therefore involved in active cause–effect research for most of our waking lives. However the inferences (whether true or false) derived from these day-to-day experiments apply only to ourselves. Science and philosophy on the other hand seek to uncover truths that are generalizable beyond the individual. Because of this, their experiments require greater scrutiny. Research may be divided into that which is observational (describing what is there) and that which is analytic (explaining why it is there). Deducing cause and effect relationships is central to analytic research. The ‘result’ of any given experiment is indisputable. What is open to interpretation is what caused that result. As discussed in Chapter 12, a series of questions have to be asked. What is the likelihood of it having occurred by chance? Was it caused by problems in the design of the study (bias), by the influence of a different factor to that hypothesised (confounding), or by a cause–effect relationship in the opposite direction to that anticipated (‘reverse’ causality)? If the anticipated cause–effect relationship is supported, what precise cause and effect were being measured in the study under consideration and how might other factors contribute to this? And what are the implications of the findings? The focus for critiquing a research report (apart from allegations of deliberate falsification) strictly speaking should not be the reported ‘Results’ but the ‘Discussion and Conclusions’—the inferences (particularly regarding cause and effect) which can be drawn from the results and therefore the generalisability of findings beyond the experimental situation.",

      "abstract": "All animals regularly encounter events that recruit attention and a vigilant posture because the stimuli share some features with similar events encountered in the past. Some animals typically approach these discrepant events, whereas others typically avoid them. This fact became a fundamental principle for Schneirla,1 who spent much of his career trying to understand ap proach-avoidant behavior in ani mals. There are at least three differ ent questions one can ask about these complementary reactions to unfamiliar events. One line of inquiry seeks to de termine, within or between species, which events consistently elicit ap proach and which avoidance. The sight of the mother usually provokes the former in mammalian infants; the sight of an unfamiliar adult typi cally provokes an initial avoidance. A second question asks about inter specific differences in approach or avoidance to the same class of events. One-year-old macaque monkeys avoid, at least initially, an unfamiliar monkey of the same age, whereas 3-year-old children (roughly comparable to 1-year-old monkeys because the macaque grows at a rate three times that of the human) more often approach an un familiar peer. Finally, one can ask about intraspecific differences in the tendency to approach or to avoid",

An individual who is satisfied with his or her life may also feel a fulfillment of needs for his or her life as a whole. In essence, satisfaction is a subjective assessment of the quality of one's experience. Because it is inherently an evaluation, judgments of satisfaction could be subjective and involve a large cognitive component.

      "abstract": "Anger is defined as \"the state of emotion experienced as a result of the inability of the individual to express himself in a positive way in the face of the prevention of wishes, needs and plans and injustices\".Anger according to Soykan 2 it is a very natural, universal and human emotional response to unsaturated desires, unintended consequences and unmet expectations.Anger is a normal and anticipated human experience, just like other emotions; he is not an enemy.Anger; Usually, he tells people that something that matters to them is somehow threatened or that their desire to achieve a specific purpose is blocked.It also has a positive structure such as triggering stability and tenacity. 2When we get angry, there are some changes in our bodies.These are; Increases muscle tension, cracking eyebrows, squeaking the teeth, squeaking the teeth, tightening the blades, changing the shape of the arms and body, flushing gasoline (losing color), heart palpitations, tremors, sleep, clogging, twitching, sweating, loss of control, feeling warm, indigestion, feeling cold. 3Anger is an extremely healthy and natural feeling when expressed appropriately.However, if it spirals out of control and becomes destructive, it causes problems in school-business life, personal relationships and overall quality of life (Kokdemir, 2004).The expression of these feelings is learned by imitating parents and other adults in the family through the situations and events that create a sense of anger and resentment in childhood.Anger and resentment are not positive behavior in any situation, again the effect of family and close environment is brought to the child and adolescent.Expressing anger and anger in words is a form of behavior observed from an early age.The language used to express anger contains angry, angry, high-toned words, profanity or sarcastic and sarcastic expressions. 4At the moment of anger, the mouth part shows the desire to head towards the person who is angry, and with the intensity of anger, the jaw extends forward.The reaction of the mouth during the sense of anger, especially the fact that the jaw goes back 1-2 seconds forward can be a precursor to the person becoming aggressive. 5Aggression, which is one of the ways in which anger and anger are expressed; it occurs in the form of swipe, kicking and punching, pushing, shaking, biting, pinching, using hands, arms, legs and other organs of the body, or using a stick or similar vehicle to damage it. 4The emergence of violent behaviour in schools remains an acceptable problem between students and school staff. 6The child, who is incapable of anger control in the school environment, faces many problems.Schools are also an important element in recognizing a sense of anger and gaining the ability to express it in a healthy",

      "title": "Synchrony and sympathy: Social entrainment with music compared to a metronome.",
      "abstract": "We synchronize movements with other individuals in our everyday life (e.g., when shaking hands), in sports (e.g., rowing), or on dancefloors. Especially this last kind of social entrainment can lead to states of pleasure and ecstasy. In some situations, we even unintentionally mirror another person's gestures or movements, for example, when we are walking with another person and the phase of our steps becomes aligned with the other person's steps. Depending on the relationship we have with this person, such a situation can be awkward or pleasant. All of these examples show that movement synchronization and social bonding are tightly linked. In the current study, we examined affiliation and pro-social behavior following a synchronous or asynchronous interpersonal tapping task with music or a metronome.Interpersonal Coordination and MusicInterpersonal coordination-be it behavior matching, such as mimicry, or interactional synchrony, such as simultaneous rhythmic movements (Bernieri & Rosenthal, 1991)-is a fundamental way to form socioemotional connections. Behavioral mimicry describes the mirroring of another person's gestures, postures, or other movements (e.g., speech gestures, foot shaking; for a review, see Chartrand & Lakin, 2013). Factors that increase the tendency to mimic the behavior of another person include pro-social attitudes (Leighton, Bird, Orsini, & Heyes, 2010), being in a good mood (Likowski et al., 2011), and the likability (Stel et al., 2010) or the goal to get along with this person (Lakin & Chartrand, 2003). In turn, being mimicked can positively affect feelings of liking toward the mimicker (Chartrand & Bargh, 1999), feelings of interpersonal closeness (Ashton-James, van Baaren, Chartrand, Decety, & Karremans, 2007), and pro-social behavior in adults (van Baaren, Holland, Kawakami, & van Knippenberg, 2004) and infants (Carpenter, Uebel, & Tomasello, 2013).In contrast to behavioral mimicry that usually includes a time lag of a few seconds, interactional synchrony describes movements that are temporally matched. The social entrainment model of McGrath and Kelly (1986, as cited in Clayton, Sager, & Will, 2004, p. 10) makes the assumption that many human behaviors are oscillatory or rhythmical. The model proposes that the oscillations or rhythms are created endogenously, that the endogenous oscillations or rhythms can become aligned in phase and frequency within an individual and between individuals, and that the temporal patterns of an individual or a group of individuals can become entrained to an external timekeeper. A variety of research suggests that the interpersonal synchronization of movements, such as walking, pendulum-swinging, chair-rocking, body-swaying, or finger-tapping, promotes affiliation and pro-social orientation (Demos, Chaffin, Begosh, Daniels, & Marsh, 2012; Hove & Risen, 2009; Marsh, Richardson, & Schmidt, 2009; Reddish, Fischer, & Bulbulia, 2013; Valdesolo & Desteno, 2011; Wiltermuth & Heath, 2009). By using a moving visual timekeeper, Hove and Risen (2009) showed that the degree of synchrony between the participants' and the experimenters' finger-taps was positively related to how much participants liked the experimenter. Such effects may even be stronger when moving together while listening to music: When rocking in a chair with a partner, the degree of synchronization with music is positively correlated with the feeling of interpersonal connectedness (Demos et al., 2012).Listening to music has a strong emotional component and, similarly to social bonding, engages the endogenous opioid system (Tarr, Launay, & Dunbar, 2014). Related to this, Tarr, Launay, and Dunbar (2016) showed that pain thresholds increased after synchronously dancing (i.e., identical movements while listening to the same music) in groups of four. The authors link this effect to the release of endorphins. In contrast, partial synchrony (i. …",

      "title": "PHILOSOPHY, ADVERTISING MYTHS AND MANAGEMENT",
      "abstract": "Being concerned with current matters, ordinary man is used to have a regular approach on life, by means of efficiency oriented skills. Carried out by worries and hopes, he does not allow himself to breed the taste for speculation. Usually, his horizon of questions regarding man and life is often mistaken for the sphere of immediate needs – in what concerns its level, contents and solutions. Raising questions – when it happens and inasmuch as it happens – appears attached to unusual events (either good or bad) and, most of the time, just inasmuch as these require a certain effort in order to be integrated into what is called habits. Ordinary judgement is in terms of action and utility. The meaning of life is neither obsession, nor a release of passion, since physical and soul energies are oriented towards goals that do not allow somebody to appeal to reflection. Playing with abstract arguments is frightening, distracts from those acts that are experienced as obligations, and this is why it will be avoided, as much as possible. Self preservation instinct works well enough. Man has the taste for relativity; daily activities witness for the weaknesses of humanity and the powers of hazard, shaping his wisdom; life is intuitively taken as a value, and it is worth living even if there are no strong meanings; thus, life is above all ideas describing it. Daily life receives a immediate link between theory and practice, between knowledge and action; we live under the impulse of satisfying needs; this is why choosing goals and means cannot be endlessly suspended in order to make room for deliberative reflection; one makes appeal to already given knowledge and value instruments that have a certified efficiency. This is why daily subjective life oscillates between decisions founded on momentary, passing and inconsistent reasons and decisions determined by rigid grounds, although they seldom conceptually clarified (tradition, habits). Ordinary consciousness behaves like a receptacle: the knowledge of reality – taken as a mirroring of reality by thought and senses – remains at the stage of noticing and uncritical description of some empiric correlations, of factual observations, of some modes of external phenomenal manifestation. Realism that is based on the “logic of senses” combines with the concern for normative aspect of life and action. “Common sense – says Lucian Blaga – is due to some ideas acquired by human spirit in time, by means of living together with the others.

      "abstract": "Information as thought and memory considers where human-generated information originates and where it typically finds usage. At a micro level, information in the head is the energy in collections of synapses that are concurrently activated. At a more practical scale, as Voice1 (mental) argues, information in the head is the set of concepts and relationships active at a given time interval. This condition may arise through introspection and reflection on concepts or events recalled from memory, or it may arise through external stimuli acquired by our perceptual system. The most common sense of information in the head is the mental state that results from an interpretation of an external stimulus, whether from the ambient environment or an information artifact upon which we have focused our perceptual system. An extreme variation on Voice1 claims that everything external to the human mind is data or signals but information only exists within the human mind. The various notions of information as thought and memory are considered here in three general classes, information as what we know (cognition that tends to be associated with prefrontal brain activity), information as how we know, and information as what we feel (emotions and intuitions that tend to be associated with the amygdala).",

Usually, the ‘self’ in question is the individual person, but the concept has also been applied to corporate bodies held to possess a unitary identity. What constitutes the self’s ‘real nature’ is the key variable generating the many conceptions of self-realization. These can be grouped broadly into two types: (1) the ‘collectivist’, in which the self-realizing lifestyle, being either the same for all or specific to a person or subgroup of people, is ultimately definable only in the context, and perhaps with reference to the common purposes, of a collective social body; (2) the ‘individualist’, in which a person’s self-realization has no necessary connection with the ends of a particular community. As an ethic, self-realization can be proposed as the means to achieve a life identified as good by some criterion independent of the self-realizing process, or held to be that which actually defines the good. Its critics typically argue that human nature is such that any equation of ‘self-realization’ and ‘goodness’ is implausible or undesirable.",

      "abstract": "Whether at a coffee shop, in a waiting room, or riding the bus, people frequently observe the other people around them. Yet they often fail to realize how much other people engage in the same behavior, and that they, therefore, also are being observed. Because it is logically impossible that people, on average, are the subjects of observation more than they are objects of it, the belief that one watches others more than one is watched is an illusion. Several studies show that people incorrectly believe that they observe others more than other people observe them. We call this mistaken belief the \"invisibility cloak illusion.\" People believe that they observe others more than do other people and that they are generally observed less than are others (Studies 1-3, 5, 6). The illusion persists both among strangers in the same vicinity (Study 2) and among friends interacting with one another (Study 3), and it cannot be explained away as yet another general better-than-average bias nor is it the result of believing one has more thoughts, in general, than do other people (Studies 2-3). The illusion is supported by a failure to catch others watching oneself (Studies 1b, 4) and it is manifest in the specific contents of people's thoughts about one another (Studies 5 and 6). Finally, rendering a feature of one's appearance salient to oneself fails to interrupt the illusion despite increasing one's belief that others are paying more attention specifically to that salient feature (Study 6).

We cannot promote mental health in the same sense as we might an object or a personality not even in the same way that we might, in the interests of physical health, a diet or a set of exercises or even a life-style. The factors that contribute to the mental health of an individual or a society are too subtle, too tenuous; and the means by which they are achieved, on purpose or accidentally, are too diffused and too deeply enmeshed in our social roots to be easily affected by direct action. Even indirect action in this area is complex. Professionals in mental health might well decide that its interests would be served if, for example, more mentally handicapped people were shown in TV dramas to be leading comparatively normal lives, or if those who have nervous breakdowns were dealt with more sympathetically; they might think it better for characters to be shown coping with their problems mainly on their own or in their families, rather than invariably calling in a doctor. It might be thought a step forward, in our fragmented society, if there were more positive images of people living successfully on their own, rather than so often finding fulfillment only in a happy-ever-after partnership; it might help if someone with an alcohol problem were seen to tackle it successfully, rather than being portrayed only as a drunken lout. We could devise endless ways in which the media might further the cause of mental health; but there would be no obvious means by which we could induce editors and producers of programs to fall in with our wishes.",

Abstract: Since the beginning of humanity, the man has been exposed to many factors that put in risk the health, and, in consequence, perceptible scars are left in our bodies by some illness or an accidental event. These scars are reflected in the lack of somebody members, a deformity, or even the absence of mental processes, disrupting the autonomy of these individuals to do their daily activities. The people are scared about the differences, because historically they have misconceptions about the disabilities, ideas commonly spread by the predominant social system. The social State, subject to the rule of law makes an imposition in the way we talk, think, and attend the disability and the disabled people, surpassing the ancient conceptions of Greece about their value or importance in the world.

Even though the way common people set-up their own judgment is based on their own interpretation tracks, surely different from expert criteria, we cannot label their approach as irrational. Over time, through an evolutionary process, people have decided what is safe and what is dangerous; this personal awareness was not based on the science but on experiences, images, feelings and emotions. Most of the time, neither social nor economical conditions can prevent people to feel an epidemic risk in the same way as it was felt during the plague of 1350.

Through psychoanalysis it is possible to observe widely the subject as a whole, not focusing on the presence of organic or genetic disorders, Ansermet (2003) addresses this problem by stating that “We cannot see the subject only as someone who manifests an organic or mental defect, according to the logic of disability”. The systems that compose and organize the environment, according to Bronfenbrenner (1996), are constituted by the fitting of concentric structures called microsystem, what presents itself as the most active and direct contact environments, such as family, school or social work relationships; mesosystem referring to two or more environments of active social participation; exosystem, understood as environments that influence events that take place in the immediate environment of social relationship; and macrosystem, which comprise, in addition to the behavior of individuals, the connections between other people, the nature of bonds and the direct or indirect influence on the developing individual in the contexts in which they live and act actively.\nThe use of psychoanalysis as a tool to decipher possible mental disorders has become essential, since it is intrinsically linked to the biological look for the diagnosis of a patient. Autism, attention deficit disorder, depression and hyperactivity (ADHD), among other diseases that can be diagnosed during childhood or late they are psychosocial disorders that have their diagnoses complemented by psychoanalysis.\nIn this way, it is possible to perceive the challenges that psychoanalysis faces in terms of complementing the diagnosis of mental disorders in children, as well as the importance of psychosomatic studies in the elaboration of an accurate diagnosis that can be applied to children and their pathologists.",

      "title": "Making sense of safety: Figure 1",
      "abstract": "Beyond injury prevention\n\nThe concept of “safety” can have many different meanings. The Concise Oxford Dictionary defines it as “freedom from danger and risks”, while the Merriam-Webster Dictionary describes safety as “the condition of being safe from undergoing or causing hurt, injury, or loss”. According to etymologist Douglas Harper, the word safe first came into use in the English language around 1280, derived from the Old French sauf , which in turn stemmed from the Latin salvus , meaning “uninjured, healthy, safe”. The Latin word is related to the concepts of salus (“good health”), saluber (“healthful”), and solidus (“solid”), all derived from the Proto-Indo-European base word solwos , meaning “whole”.1 Thus, at its root, the concept of safety revolves around wholeness and health.\n\nInjury prevention researchers have defined safety as “a state or situation characterised by adequate control of physical, material, or moral threats”, which “contributes to a perception of being sheltered from danger” (Andersson and Svanstrom, as quoted in Welander et al , page 122). Safety is commonly viewed through the lens of specific injury domains: for some researchers in the injury prevention field, safety has come to mean the prevention of crime and violence; for others, a reduction in motor vehicle deaths or a feeling of being out of danger rather than being in a positive state of human growth and development.3\n\nDue to the multitude of views on the definition of safety, a collaborative effort was launched in 1996 by two World Health Organisation (WHO) Collaborating Centers on Safety Promotion and Injury Prevention, sponsored by the Ministry of Health, Quebec, Canada, and Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden, to develop international consensus on the conceptual and operational aspects of safety and safety promotion.2 A document was published in 1998 entitled Safety and Safety Promotion: Conceptual …",

      "title": "What is the Emotional Plague? A Brief Introduction",
      "abstract": "What Is the Emotional Plague? A plague implies a highly contagious disease that can become epidemic (rapidly widespread) or pandemic (an epidemic throughout many countries). The Black Death, a fourteenth century plague, connotes an epidemic characterized by the person’s skin turning black; Bubonic Plague by the sufferer developing buboes or swellings. So the emotional plague is characterized by infectious, destructive emotional reactions, and like other plagues may be crippling and deadly. The emotional plague is driven by an intolerance of spontaneous life, emotions, and pleasure (Reich 1949, pages 248-280). Wilhelm Reich’s colleague, Dr. Elsworth Baker, stated, “We can say that to the degree that an individual tries to tear down other people or control their lives, he is functioning as a plague character” (Baker 1967, page 154). Someone afflicted with the emotional plague just cannot leave someone else alone. Where does the energy for this reaction come from? This destructive behavior starts with just one person who is a catalyst. That afflicted individual is compelled to stifle or destroy those people or things in the environment that stir up unbearable feelings. These feelings include unfulfilled longings and desires that in turn result in intolerable anxiety, frustration and eventually murderous rage toward those who stir them up. This compulsion to destroy, serving as an emotional defense for that individual, is the essence of the emotional plague. When one person’s irrational intolerance and destructiveness incite others to act destructively, we know for certain we are dealing with the emotional plague. Unfortunately, the potential for that",

Humans use symbols that relate to in-group psychology, loyalty, power, and remembrance. Such symbols often have a strong emotional charge, and may lead to overvalued or mistaken beliefs and magical thinking. Graves, flags, and the Christian Eucharist are examples. Some symbols are private and personal. Some symbols are unrecognized and exert their influence through unconscious processes. Other human symbols relate to the new function of language and do not have the same emotional power. Some evidence is presented that symbols work by an ‘as if’ mechanism, using some of the same neural circuits that the thing symbolized uses. People can think in symbols, for example, a sentence can use the word dog without either the speaker or the listener having a mental image of a dog.",

      "title": "Qualia",
      "abstract": "In contemporary discussions in the philosophy of mind, the terms quale and qualia (plural) are most commonly used to denote features of our conscious mental states such as the throbbing pain of my headache, the warmth I feel when I hold my hands over the fire, or the greenish character of my visual experience when I look at the tree outside my window (or stare hard at something red and then close my eyes). To use the now-standard locution introduced by Thomas Nagel, a subject’s mental state has qualia (or, equivalently, phenomenal properties) just in case there is something it is like for the subject to be in that state, and there are phenomenal similarities and differences among a subject’s mental states (that is, similarities and differences in their qualia) just in case there are similarities and differences in what it is like for that subject to be in those states. Qualia, in this sense, can be more or less specific: the state I am in at the moment can be an example of a migraine, a headache, a pain and, even more generally, a bodily sensation. And a mental state can have a distinctive phenomenal property, or quale, even if its subject cannot pick it out in terms any more descriptive than ‘I’m now feeling something funny’, or ‘I’ve never had an experience quite like this’. Sometimes the terms ‘quale’ and ‘qualia’ have been used more restrictively, to denote properties of mental states that are irreducibly nonphysical. ‘Qualia’ has also been used to denote ‘sense-data’, that is, image-like elements of perceptual experiences whose properties are directly and infallibly accessible to the subject of those experiences (and thus provide ‘data’ for our theories of the world). Indeed, C. I. Lewis, who is generally thought to have introduced the term, used ‘qualia’ in this way, and many others (e.g. Dennett 1988: 229) have understood ‘qualia’ to denote properties that are ‘ineffable, intrinsic, private, and directly or immediately apprehensible in consciousness’. Thus philosophical disputes about qualia have often taken the form of disputes about whether qualia exist, rather than about what sorts of properties qualia could be. But most philosophers now use these terms more neutrally, as characterized above - and attempt to argue that qualia must have (or can lack) these further metaphysical and epistemological characteristics. Perhaps the most contentious dispute about qualia is whether they can have a place in the physical world; whether, that is, they could be identical with physical, functional or otherwise natural properties, or must rather be regarded as irreducibly nonphysical features of our mental states. There are also significant epistemological questions about qualia - in particular, how we come to have knowledge of the phenomenal properties of our own mental states, whether our beliefs about these properties can be taken to be infallible, or at least to have some kind of special authority not possessed by our beliefs about the world outside our minds, and whether, and if so, how, we could have such knowledge of the mental states of others. In addition, it has traditionally been routine to distinguish ‘qualitative’ states such as sensations and perceptual experiences from purely representational (or intentional) states such as beliefs, thoughts and preferences, but this distinction is now under challenge. Thus another important question about qualia is how extensive they are in our mental lives: whether they are possessed by all our conscious mental states, including thoughts, beliefs, intentions and preferences, or merely some, such as sensations and perceptions.",

Some of the biological pathways to heterogeneity in health status are quite obvious. Dominance, or Type A behaviour, or hyper-reactivity, or personality generally, has a significant genetic component. The biological pathways through which environmental and social factors have their effects may be found in the ways in which humans and other primates respond to stress. The demonstration of linkages at the cellular level between the nervous and other body systems obviously provides an important link in the chain from social environments to biological effects. A slightly different perspective on the same issue is introduced in a recent review of the relationship between \"Control and Health\". The human personality studies indicate that turning one's anger inward is even more harmful to one's health than letting it out. So humans, like monkeys, baboons, rats, and dogs, may respond to a stressful environment that they cannot control with physiological changes that are harmful to their health.",

Since house structures have many components which are readily excited by noise and which can be coupled, they respond as complex vibrating systems. These dynamic responses are significant because they affect the environment of the observers inside the house. The nature of this noise induced house excitation problem is illustrated in Fig. 1. A person inside the house can sense the impingement of noise on the external surfaces of the house by means of the following phenomena: noise transmitted through the structure from outside to inside (see Refs. 1-6); the vibrations of the primary components of the building such as the floors, walls and windows (see Refs. 2,3,7 and 8); the rattling of objects such as dishes, ornaments and shelves which are set",

The desire to live healthy has been common to all living creatures ever since the first unicellular organism has evolved on the planet earth. The desire itself is the cause vital which leads to a successful evolutionary progress into more structurally and functionally developed multicellular organism. The importance of individual variations in health and disease is a unique principle described hundreds of years ago as every individual is different from another and hence should be considered as a different entity, as many variations are there in the universe, all sorts of variations are seen in the human being. The concept of Prakriti in Ayurveda also believes in distinctiveness of individuals. Stress can be defined as 'difficulty that creates anxiety or emotional tension. It is a state of emotional or mental strain or suspense, such as anxiety, tension, jitters, or nervousness. Stress can result from any thinking or scenario that makes you upset, nervous, or furious. What one individual finds stressful may not be the same for another. If someone is anxious, and that stress is not managed, it might have serious consequences.Top of Form",

The hearing impaired person (or: the person who has a hearing deficiency) shares this deficiency with her surrounding, she also lives this experience deep within herself. Deafness brings together several disciplines, based on the biological, as well as, social and pedagogical approaches (aspects). This deficiency, which is often resented by others and is initially misunderstood, rubs off on the person who is affected and risks of demoralizing and discouraging her. Strengthening of the ego and personality development of the deaf as a whole autonomous person increases her self confidence and helps her build a solid identity. However, the question often asked: what is the identity of a deaf person? Hearing, deaf or bicultural? What is her future? Before getting any recognition from others, the deaf person needs to know herself. This return to oneself requires her to have knowledge of her own abilities, cultural background and an important feeling of security (a place among his people). The motivation for a better future is a prerequisite for a healthy and balanced development, both from the relational and mental domain. Under what conditions does the deaf person live? Is it framed, loved, recognized? Is it informed, directed, monitored? What image does she have of her own body? What factors from an early age are put into play? What image does she have of herself or what image do we reflect on her? Why? The type of equipment offered, cochlear implants or conventional hearing aid, do they play a role? In this study several factors are being explored; they deal with the problems and issues of the deaf person, the experiences of the person as having a hearing deficiency, the nature and severity of the condition that affects the person and also how this person perceives her own image, consequently her identity and her future.",

Human body, often, encounter traumatic insults at various stages before and after the death due to certain accidental or intentional acts of homicide or suicide or sometimes due to certain taphonomic factors. Beside establishing biological identity of unknown human remains, anthropologists are routinely involved in reconstruction of death scenes by understanding and interpreting the traumatic/taphonomic lesions imprinted to the recovered human remains. Each type of trauma imprints unique signatures as the mechanism of production of injuries is different with respect to force, angle, direction, tool used, morphology of bone etc. Traumatic injuries caused either during life time (ante-mortem) or just before the death (peri-mortem) can be related to events or circumstances surrounding death whereas post-mortem traumatic signatures may reflect the taphonomic damages or destructions of human remains. Trauma analysis is required to explain various facts like timing of trauma, cause and mechanism of trauma and circumstances around time of death and hence identification of the deceased. The information presented in this review article will provide proper understanding and ability to interpret the skeletal injuries for determining the mechanism and timing of bone trauma required in medicolegal death investigations. Traumatic injuries on the frontal bone, femurs and clavicles corroborated the heinous treatment of Ajnala victims before their death, the comprehensive trauma analysis was not possible due to badly damaged and fragmented nature of retrieved human remains consequent upon their non-scientific exhumation by some amateur archaeologists. Thus, safe and expert-mediated excavation of human remains found in forensic contexts becomes essential to reveal their traumatic history (if any) prior to death.",

The suffering always stems from powerlessness, it feels unbearable. It arises whenever the pain destroys the individual’s capacities of resistance, when he loses control and feels his existence defeated. It implies a threatened identity and feeling for the worst. On the other hand when the individual chooses to integrate the pain or when he accepts it, then the part of suffering becomes often marginal, it is the price to be paid for an experience of another kind. Undergone pain is always destructive, deliberate or accepted pain a frequent ingredient in a strong and happy experience. Mots cles Douleur Souffrance Hypnose Sport Scarification",

These behaviours give evidence to the explicit hypothesis of the other as distinct from the self, and also as the source of intentionalities and abilities (needs, desires, plans, rationality). From these meanings, listening implies thinking. We can then represent it either in terms of procedures (how to create, obtain, establish, maintain, optimize, show the accurate attitude) – these procedures then become techniques, tools or methods – or in terms of process (what do we feel through such psychic moves ?) The processes develop in a temporality which provides their slow elaboration and maturation in obeying a more biological than mechanical future, whereas the procedures are more elaborate, rational, technical, modelized and segmented, thus more spatialized. The former are ways of acting, the latter are ways of existing. Of course these forms of representation seem heterogeneous, translating very different ways of seeing the world and very different philosophies. They can even claim to be antagonistic, which roughly corresponds to the classical distinction between Homo faber and Homo sapiens. The former is, at least partly, a matter for comprehension, in our acceptation of Dilthey’s terms, whereas the latter is a matter for explanation. The subtle intelligibility of the notion of listening is linked to the distinction between, as well as the contrasted articulation of the two heterogeneous readings.",

      "abstract": "Joint attention is an everyday phenomenon in which two or more individuals attend to an object, event process or property in the presence of each other, such that their attention to that object is to some degree intertwined with the other's attention to it. This paper argues that joint attention has the normative role of enabling subjects to coordinate their actions in a way that would contribute to the rational execution of a joint action in accordance with a prior shared plan or shared intention. This understanding of the normative function of joint attention underpins a particular understanding of the nature of joint attention: what I shall call Rich Relationalism. Rich Relationalism argues for the view that joint attention acts as an epistemically significant interface between the world, other people, and their background plans and concepts. It understands joint attention as an object-dependent, conceptually structured, token experiential state that is shared by two (or more) people. It can be contrasted with non-relational (i.e., Representational or Enactivist) accounts of joint attention on the one hand, and Lean Relationalist accounts on the other (such as John Campbell's influential account).",

This chapter considers experimenter “attributes” that are still more situationally determined. That is, the degree of warmth an experimenter shows one subject may be correlated with the degree of warmth he shows other subjects. But whether he “accidentally” encounters a subject with whom he has had prior social contact seems less likely to be an enduring attribute and more purely situational. The distinction is, nevertheless, arbitrary. Experimenters who are acquainted with a subject may differ in associated personality characteristics which make them more likely to be acquainted with other subjects as well. The effects of prior acquaintanceship thus may be due not simply to the prior contact as such, but to correlated variables as well.",

When an entity has moral status, I may not act toward it in any way I please, disregarding its well-being, preferences, or continued existence. I owe some moral obligations to that entity itself. As a moral agent, I must care to some degree about what it wants or needs, or simply what it is; this imposes some limitations on how I may act toward it. This is importantly different from having obligations in relation to some entity (e.g., my neighbor's house) that are actually owed to some other entity (i.e., my neighbor). It is the being to whom duties are owed that has moral status. Moral status is also importantly different from moral goodness; persons' intentional conformity to moral principles might be one of the characteristics that enhances their moral status, relative to persons who routinely act immorally and to beings who are incapable of moral action, but being worthy of consideration in others' moral reasoning is quite distinct conceptually from acting morally oneself.",

      "abstract": "Emotions words with many meanings can describe experiences in everyone's life. Emotion is also a state that is suggested to every individual in a high level of interaction in something, since they are born individuals have an emotional foundation as if people's emotions can change the way they see the world and interpret the actions of others. Emotions can also be understood from a person's facial expressions and can also be from the tone of his speech, which also has a different tempo and rhythm. Therefore the identification of human emotions is helpful in the field of human interaction. Lots of variety in emotions. Anger emotions, happy emotions, sad emotions, and others, but humans are more specific about the angry emotion. Speaker emotion recognition is the act of trying to recognize human emotions and the affective state of speech. This takes advantage of the fact that sound is often underlying through tone. emotions are the key to emotional health. Excessive emotions that are too strong or persist for too long can make a person unstable, one of which is the ability to stabilize emotions is the ability to entertain and relax through entertainment or silence.",

      "title": "Conflict: A Catalyst for Institutional Change",
      "abstract": "Introduction Conflict, simply defined, is a state of disharmony between incompatible or opposing persons, ideas, or interests. When asked to close their eyes and envision a recent conflict, most people will experience a disheartening feeling. They may notice physical or emotional signs of distress (e.g., palpitations, rapid breathing, sweaty palms, shaking, tearing, etc.). Therefore they tend to assign a negative connotation to conflict as a general concept. They view conflict as something to be avoided at all costs. But conflict is natural, and even when one acquires the skills to deal with it more effectively it continues to exist (ESR, 1998). It surrounds us on a daily basis, and while it might make us feel stressed, frustrated, angry, scared, or confused, it can offer new and positive opportunities for change, learning, and growth. same holds true for conflicts of interest and/or commitment within an organization. Again, by simple definition, a conflict of interest and/or commitment exists when there is a state of disharmony between one's responsibilities as an employee/member of a specific institution/ organization and an outside entity. Both the American Association of Medical Colleges (AAMC) and the American Association of Universities (AAU) have adopted this definition: The term individual conflict of interest in science refers to situations in which financial considerations may compromise, or have the appearance of compromising, an investigator's professional judgment in conducting or reporting (Broccolo & Klanica, 2006). Yet, dealing effectively with the conflict of interest situation can also lead to positive opportunities for change, learning, and growth. In essence, a potential conflict of interest or commitment is not inherently a bad thing. Often it means there is good work happening that will contribute to generalizable knowledge and benefit society. External or extramural financial interests often drive the research in ways that internal funding alone cannot by providing a direction to research that will result in the largest possible positive impact on society. Kalichman and Macrina (2001) state that conflicts encountered through the scientific profession are to be expected, it is how they are handled that can lead to untoward, inappropriate, or bad outcomes. Therefore, there is no shame in having external financial relationships, whether as an individual or an institution as a whole. shame is in allowing those relationships to potentially bias the work, create false presumptions and distort decision-making, or in hiding the fact that they exist in the first place. Maintaining even minimal standards of research integrity is dependent upon protecting and preserving not only the integrity of the science, but that of the researcher and the institution. There is also a fundamental obligation to preserve and sustain the public trust. public trust is a fragile thing and once shattered it is almost impossible to repair (Schaller-Demers, 2006). Bradley (2005) says there is a concern that an escalating climate of secrecy and economic competition is contributing to the public's loss of confidence in the integrity of science and scientists, if not an actual deterioration in the quality of the science. If one accepts that public trust is what drives public funding, it may be logical to assume that once public trust is eroded, public funding will erode as well (Cohen, 2002). Broccolo and Klanica (2006) state that instances of research misconduct can be motivated by the types of financial and associational (non-financial) interests that give rise to potential conflicts of interest and that the media and the public cannot distinguish the difference between actual conflict and perceptions of conflict. That is why perception and appearances are so important. Hiding is never the answer, because upon close examination, it may be determined that an actual conflict of interest doesn't even exist. …",

      "title": "Psychotherapy through Art in a Negro Child",
      "abstract": "Children approach life with zest. Driven by instinctual impulses which demand release in motor activity, they are continuously attempting to understand and master the world they live in. To do so they make endless experiments involving the physical, social, and emotional realities which confront them. The specific nature and patterning of these experiments are normally determined by psychobiological levels of maturation. Direct experimentation however, inevitably meets with limitations for the child in his constant striving to live out his impulses. The natural laws of the physical world and the prohibitions of culture force him to supplement his direct approach to life with fantasy, where no problem is too difficult to solve, no forbidden sexual or aggressive impulse impossible to experience either in direct or symbolic form. Schilder1 has stated that symbols appear when the experimentation process belonging to a specific maturation level has been interrupted by danger or threat. The symbolic act or fantasy thus simultaneously serves the dual purpose of fulfillment and protection. That is, fulfillment of an instinctual impulse in a safe form which serves as protection from the danger and threats imposed by the environment. The manifold problems of sexuality in childhood express themselves very often in symbolic rather than direct form, inasmuch as direct experimentation as an approach to these problems is culturally forbidden. Regardless of the primary nature of the problem being dealt with, however, the symbolic fantasy is normally not an aim in itself.",

      "title": "USING GENERAL SEMANTICS TO MANAGE 'EMOTIONS'",
      "abstract": "AS KORZYBSKI SUGGESTED do when analyzing a term, my first step in addressing the title topic was to consult a dictionary for definitions of emotion. (1) From Webster's 9th Collegiate (1987): Emotion: 1 a: obs: DISTURBANCE b: EXCITEMENT a: Affective aspect of consciousness; b: a state of c: psychic and physical reaction (as anger or fear) subjectively experienced as strong and physiologically involving changes that prepare the body for immediate vigorous action. Okay, how is affective defined? Affect: the conscious subjective aspect of an considered apart from bodily changes. And feeling as most directly related to emotion? 2 a: an emotional state or reaction b pl: susceptibility to impression Under syn find: FEELING denotes any partly mental, partly physical response marked by pleasure, pain, attraction, or repulsion.... My conclusions: old terminology, such as the term emotion itself and its concomitant definitions, exposes an elementalistic muddle. (2) Also, as evidenced in the going around in circles aspect of the above definitions, seem to be have reached the unspeakable level of undefined terms. Somehow know what we're intending to say, but can't quite say it. In Science and Sanity, I found relatively few indexed uses of emotion. On page 23, pointing out how to apply non-elementalism (3) when considering psycho-logical reactions, Korzybski advised that we must ... deliberately ascribe 'emotional' factors to any 'intellectual' manifestation, and 'intellectual' factors to any 'emotional' occurrence. On page 26, recognizing levels of abstracting, he noted Empirically, there is a difference between an 'emotion' which becomes 'rationalized' and 'emotions' invoked or produced by 'ideas.' On page 481: Through wrong evaluation ['is' of identity] are using the lower [thalamic] center too much and cannot 'think' properly. are 'over-emotional'; get easily confused, worried, terrorized, or discouraged; or else become absolutists, dogmatists. Again on page 481, noting the unspeakable aspect I mentioned above: We teach silence on the objective level in general, which is a most impressive 'emotional' education So, in considering Using General Semantics to Manage 'Emotions,' had best not get too concerned with any definition of emotion, lest our discussion become confusing and dogmatic. Rather, let's flag emotion as problematic by using the extensional safety device of single quotes: 'emotion.' Also the extensional hyphen, as in thoughts-feelings and intellect-emotion. Further, can replace these terms with the non-elementalistic term evaluation, which includes sensations-feelings-thoughts-behavior-environment, etc.; in other words, an organism-as-a-whole-in-an-environment evaluational reaction (e.r.). (4) So, for me, our topic here is better phrased as Using General Semantics to Manage Evaluations. And what does managing evaluations refer to? I favor the phrase, effective self-management, the details of which are unique for each individual. For our purposes here, I suggest such goals as maintaining a relatively even keel when facing life's vicissitudes; maintaining meaningful relationships; contributing in positive ways to the larger community; having one or more deep interests to which time and effort is directed (could be work and/or hobbies, family, pets, etc.)--the details to be determined person-by-person. How to use general semantics to manage evaluations? Apply general semantics principles and techniques moment-to-moment! Study; consult the structural differential you have hanging on a wall (ahem); practice, practice, practice; etc., and again. Below you will find some examples of how you can do such applying and practicing; ways that I have found helpful both for my psychotherapy clients and myself. Recognize that any evaluation involves multiple causes associated with multiple effects, associated with multiple causes, etc. …",

      "title": "Depression: Discrete or Continuous?",
      "abstract": "Elucidating the true structure of depression is necessary if we are to advance our understanding and treatment options. Central to the issue of structure is whether depression represents discrete types or occurs on a continuum. Nature almost universally operates on the basis of continuums, whereas human perception favors discrete categories. This reality might be formalized into a 'continuum principle': natural phenomena tend to occur on a continuum, and any instance of hypothesized discreteness requires unassailable proof. Research evidence for discrete types falls far short of this standard, with most evidence supporting a continuum. However, quantitative variation can yield qualitative differences as an emergent property, fostering the appearance of discreteness. Depression as a continuum is best characterized by duration and severity dimensions, with the latter understood in terms of depressive inhibition. In the absence of some degree of cognitive, emotional, social, and physical inhibition, depression should not be diagnosed. Combining the dimensions of duration and severity provides an optimal way to characterize the quantitative and related qualitative aspects of depression and to describe the overall degree of dysfunction. The presence of other symptom types occurs when anxiety, hypomanic/manic, psychotic, and personality continuums interface with the depression continuum.",

Prolonged bodily pain, if not amounting to an agony, generally leads to the same state of mind. If we expect to suffer, we are anxious; if we have no hope of relief, we despair. The words for closely related feelings can be confusing. In the next paragraph Darwin uses the term grief (which the dictionary says is sorrow or anguish in response to a loss) as a general term for two more specific emotions: distress and sadness. W each have suggested that the term distress be used for what Darwin describes as the violent and almost frantic movements of grief.

      "abstract": "Health and/or illness (physical, mental) are not random states that manifest themselves at the level of the human body, the expression of all lived experiences. A person's life cannot be understood only in the context of knowing life events, but also in the context of deciphering the relationships, circumstances, events in which they occurred. Traumatic experiences lived from the first years of life determine a particular path of the one who experiences them. These produce, most or time, true \"psychological chasms\" and tend to be \"filled\" with those experiences that produce immediately and, at first impression, the well-being lost following the interference with the traumatic event. Even today, there are two biased views about how addictive behaviors are inserted into people's lives. The first, and most common, view is that a person who has become addicted has made bad choices and, as a result, bears full responsibility for what is happening to them now. The second view regards addictive behavior as a disease, and therefore the disease requires drug treatment. Both perspectives exclude the human element from the dependency equation. Identifying each person's particular developmental niche provides a first step toward understanding, healing and cultivating individual and community resilience for mental health. This article presents on the one hand, a synthesis of some current perspectives regarding the understanding of the trauma-addiction dyad and, on the other hand, proposes some ways to increase individual resilience to preserve and strengthen mental health in the context of family, social and community.",

      "title": "Self-Transcendence",
      "abstract": "Abstract Self-transcendence is the process by which a person becomes aware of their participation in something greater than their individual self. The conscious realization of participation in something beyond yourself, such as union with nature, humanity, or God, evokes positive emotions, particularly joy and awe, which are often combined with attitudes of humility and reverence. The cultivation of self-transcendence provides a coherent perspective on living that promotes physical, mental, and spiritual well-being. If we accept that virtue involves respect for the dignity of others and not just one’s individual self, then the cultivation of self-transcendence is essential to all aspects of virtue. In this chapter, we provide several lines of empirical evidence about human nature, ecological systems, well-being, and virtue that provide a solid foundation to guide clinical practice in promoting health. Prospective studies indicate that the cultivation of self-transcendence and well-being involves the dynamic interplay of three processes: the awakening of plasticity (i.e., being able and willing to change); virtue (i.e., having intuitive insight into what is good for a person’s self and others); and creative functioning (i.e., being innovative, purposeful and responsible so that our habits are congruent with our goals and values). The cultivation of self-transcendence by these three processes describes the essential features of the path to a life that is healthy, happy, and good. We describe evidence-based practices that are effective in motivating people to create opportunities for their own well-being and that of others by cultivating self-transcendence.",

      "abstract": "It is argued that a link prevails between the phenomenology of externality present in classical liberal theory and the state of mind known as schizophrenia. To escape the social reality of possessive individualism, especially the conception of consequences, ends, habits, routine, the schizophrenic individual ‘withdraws’ or regresses into a psychic universe that contains a dimension unrelated to the consciousness and values of externality: the pursuit of wealth and things, the calculated regard of the other as an instrument for enriching the self. The schizophrenic is incapable of adapting his ‘ego’ to the necessities of the social environment; he cannot defend himself in ‘conventional’ or ‘normal’ ways from the demands of living in a social milieu where the expectations and judgments of others impose intolerable pressures on consciousness. Instead the individual undergoing the painful process of withdrawal constructs a set of psychic defenses that from the standpoint of the external world appear to be ‘strange’, ‘odd’, ‘bizarre’, or ‘demented’. The ‘mode of Being’ of the schizophrenic has nothing in common with the life‐style of the acquisitive, status‐conscious society. Some consideration is given to the political implications and meaning of the schizophrenic's withdrawal.",

In a second study, 72 children in grades 1, 3, and 5 in an impoverished inner-city black community were interviewed on their conceptions of and values about nature. The preliminary findings from these studies provide evidence for several overarching ways in which children reason about the natural environment: (1) homocentric reasoning, in which an appeal is made to the child's understanding of how the action of one person or ;roup harms the physical welfare of others, or infringes on others' rights: the natural environment acts as an intermediary; (2) intrinsic values and rights reasoning, which highlights the idea that the natural environment has a moral standing at least partly independent of its value as a human commodity; (3) relational reasoning, which consists of framing the relationship with animals in a homocentric way such that animals serve human psychological needs; and (4) conceptions of harmony with nature that follow syllogistic reasoning. The findings build on children's obligatory and discretionary moral judgments and respond to two different questions on moral theory: What does morally right action consist of? and, What does it mean to be a morally good person?

      "abstract": "Willingly or not, humans, when in co-presence, continuously inform one another about their intentions, interests, feelings and ideas by means of visible bodily action. For example, it is through the orientation of the body and, especially, through the orientation of the eyes, that information is provided about the direction and nature of a person's attention. How people arrange their bodies and how they orient them and place them in relation to each other or to features in the environment, provides important information about how they are engaged with one another and about the nature of their intentions and attitudes. Activities in which objects in the environment are being manipulated, modified or rearranged, are indispensable for grasping a person's aims and goals and interests. Of equal importance, however, are actions that are seen to be purely expressive. Here we find those configurations of action in the face and body that appear as displays of feeling and emotion, as well as actions that often play a central role in the accomplishment of important moments in social interaction. Greeting, showing gratitude or affection, challenge, threat, submission, compliance, all are accomplished through a range of different expressive actions.",

      "abstract": "One of the most effective means of adaptation is to learn what will happen next. Learning about the causal structure of the environment allows organisms to predict future events and, if necessary, to modify their behavior in an anticipatory fashion. This learning requires a sen sitivity to the dependency of one event (the target) on another event (the signal). When the signal ap pears, the target may be more likely (positive), less likely (negative), or no more or less likely (neutral). It is usual to mathematize the stimulus dependent change in the probability of the target as a contingency (i.e., the probability of the target given the signal minus the probability of the target given no signal). An animal cannot provide a ver bal judgment, so how do we know that it has learned that one event is contingent upon another? In Pav lovian conditioning, what is called the conditioned stimulus (CS) is a signal for a target event important to the animal, such as food, which is called the unconditioned stimu lus (US). In the presence of the CS, the emergence of an anticipatory response, called the conditioned re sponse (CR), demonstrates the ani mal has learned the positive contin gency between the CS and the US.

      "abstract": "The conception about the ability to symbolize in patients with somatic diseases can be enriched if we consider different levels of symbolization. Based on this, in this paper it is postulated that there are somatizations that only indicate an excess, others that mimic a stimulus or an imaginary scene and others that symbolize an affective situation and complex links in conflict. To address them, it is proposed to study the relationship between perception, mark and representation, taking into account the relationship between the world, the body and the other.Like a banner on the street congratulating a graduation or announcing a private event, the process of condensation of the body, the world and the other is fixed on the skin or on an organ and exposed to all as a mark that can be perceived forever. Everything works as if that mark has been registered separately from the one that promotes words and language, has replaced it to face certain realities and has been linked to an innervation, an organ, a chemical reaction or a genetic expression. The person and the body of the analyst must allow themselves to be involved in that private event through a particular transference that must be understood and interpreted through analytical acts and a more active attitude than the traditional one, without losing sight of the most consistent knowledge of his theory and practice.",

(1) When an adult identifies with an infant or a child and directs appropriate emotional availability, the affect of dependence and attachment that the adult recognizes in the child is called amae (the prototype of the word). (2) When an adult has little empathy with the dependency or attachment shown by the child, the adult negatively perceives that the child is \"amaeru-ing.\" Experiencing such discommunications, the child begins to test adults to see if they have empathy with him or her. In other words, he or she begins to formulate certain psychological functions linked with amae such as reading other people's expressions—hitomishiri (stranger anxiety) or enryo (hesitation or reserve). (3) When the child is good at actively manipulating the emotions of adults and creates such a state of affect as to satisfy his or her dependence or attachment, he or she is said to be an amaeru-ing child. (4) When the child, although he or she is actually dependent on or loved by adults, denies the fact and behaves innocently or defiantly, the child is said to be in a state of amae. The usage of the word amae described above can be observed in exactly the same manner in interactions between adults.",

Beside measuring physiological variables an aid to assess the emotional states is the analysis of expressive behaviour of an individual respecting the relating context. Especially developed in mammals, which live in obligatory social i.e. in stable permanent social communities, are facial expression and gesture. Also horses display a differentiated expressive behaviour, which can be observed and analysed by humans. Moreover it could be demonstrated, that in situations of stress the display shown by horses (gesture, facial expression, posture) correlate with corresponding physiological reactions. Thus the expressive behaviour is suitable to assess the emotional states of horses depending on the situation.",

All power of fancy over reason is a degree of insanity; but while this power is such as we can controul and repress, it is not visible to others, nor considered as any depravation of the mental faculties: it is not pronounced madness but when it comes ungovernable, and apparently influences speech or action.*",

The degree of contact between the isolated subject and his environment, especially his observers, must be defined in terms of distances, times, limitations of visual, auditory, and kinesthetic inputs, means available to the subject for structuring his isolated existence, and especially his ability or inability to terminate isolation when he wishes. Communication of any kind counteracts the effects of isolation, and when subjects know they are being observed they do not feel truly isolated. If communication or feedback to the subject is distorted, the situation becomes more stressful, and profound feelings of anger and anxiety can be produced. Experimentation in this field yields new data on individual differences, reveals the generally felt need of people for a structured environment, and is of importance in military medicine.",

      "abstract": "The environmental crisis in human dignity lies not just in the overuse, the misuse, and the decay of physical settings, but far more significantly in how we conceive of the individual in relation to any such setting. In the design and organization of physical settings, the human properties of the individual are ignored, oversimplified, or implicitly assumed, because of the influence of such socioenvironmental values as scientific‐technological progress, urbanism, pseudoprogress (novelty and change), and the value placed on an ever increasing acceleration of technological change. Spaces and places are improperly designed not only in physical terms; designs overlook human needs for privacy, territoriality, freedom of choice, etc., and the conceiving of the individual as a simple “machine man.” Unintended consequences are often ignored and no attempt is made to evaluate just how well the setting actually works. The danger is that the person will adjust and at the price of a continuing erosion of the properties that make him distinctively human. It is imperative that as behavioral scientists turn to the systematic study of man/environment problems they recognize the need to maintain the contextual reality and integrity of any such problem as it evolves, develops, and becomes modified in the time framework of a complex society.",

However, perhaps the most widely researched phenomenon that goes by this label involves an other-oriented emotional state that is congruent with the perceived welfare of another person. The feelings associated with empathy include sympathy, tenderness, and warmth toward the other person. Other variations of empathic emotions have been investigated too, including empathic joy, empathic embarrassment, and empathic anger. The term altruism has also been used as a label for a broad range of phenomena, including any type of helping behavior, personality traits associated with helpful persons, and biological influences that spur protection of genetically related others. However, a particularly fruitful research tradition has focused on altruism as a motivational state with the ultimate goal of protecting or promoting the welfare of a valued other. For example, the empathy–altruism hypothesis claims that empathy (construed as an other-oriented emotional state) evokes altruism (construed as a motivational state). Empathy and altruism, regardless of how they are construed, have important consequences for understanding human behavior in general, and for understanding social relationships and well-being in particular.",

In the article the labels on the X-axis of Figure 1 \"Remove Variance\" and \"Preserve Variance\" should be switched.] Symbolic material objects such as art or certain artifacts (e.g., fine pottery, jewelry) share one common element: The combination of generating an expression, and the materialization of this expression in the object. This explains why people place a much greater value on handmade over machine-made objects, and originals over duplicates. We show that this mechanism occurs when a material object's symbolic property is salient and when the creator (artist or craftsman) is perceived to have agency control over the 1-to-1 materialized expression in the object. Coactivation of these 2 factors causes the object to be perceived as having high value because it is seen as the embodied representation of the creator's unique personal expression. In 6 experiments, subjects rated objects in various object categories, which varied on the type of object property (symbolic, functional, aesthetic), the production procedure (handmade, machine-made, analog, digital) and the origin of the symbolic information (person or software). The studies showed that the proposed mechanism applies to symbolic, but not to functional or aesthetic material objects. Furthermore, they show that this specific form of symbolic object valuation could not be explained by various other related psychological theories (e.g., uniqueness, scarcity, physical touching, creative performance). Our research provides a universal framework that identifies a core mechanism for explaining judgments of value for one of our most uniquely human symbolic object categories.",

The most classifying and best classified of these properties are, of course, those which are overtly designated to function as signs of distinction or marks of infamy, stigmata, especially the names and titles expressing class membership whose intersection defines social identity at any given time—the name of a nation, a region, an ethnic group, a family name, the name of an occupation, an educational qualification, honorific titles and so on. Those who classify themselves or others, by appropriating or classifying practices or properties that are classified and classifying, cannot be unaware that, through distinctive objects or practices in which their ‘powers’ are expressed and which, being appropriated by and appropriate to classes, classify those who appropriate them, they classify themselves in the eyes of other classifying (but also classifiable) subjects, endowed with classificatory schemes analogous to those which enable them more or less adequately to anticipate their own classification.",

      "abstract": "We propose that a state of psychological predeath precedes death by suicide, and that this phenomenon results from the undermining of subjectively experienced contingency and thus of agency (i.e., the death of agency). A consequence of the death of agency is not the dulling of awareness overall, but rather, specifically of one's subjective sense of existence (i.e., the feeling of subjective existence), highly consistent with the phenomenology of Côtard delusion (the fixed belief that one is already dead), and of neighboring clinical entities. The suspension of one's specific sense of existence but not of experience more generally is a haunting juxtaposition, one reason that the death of agency is psychologically painful, uncannily and indescribably so. A sense of deadness inheres in the death of agency; because aggression is in general psychologically more feasible against lifeless than against living things, feeling dead facilitates suicidal capacity, the remnant aspect of an otherwise obliterated sense of agency, enabling the delimited agency to kill. The foregoing together produce suicidal intent, because they stimulate all of the inputs to planned action, namely, opportunity, urgency, ability, planning, and probability. The death of agency, howling and incomprehensible psychological pain, suicidal capability, and suicidal intent combine, with death by suicide as a possible result. Implications, limitations, and future directions for research are presented. We also note several clinical implications of our work, including with regard to a collection of clinically serious suicidal presentations (e.g., Côtard delusion) that cluster at the severe end of an underlying spectrum of suicide-related psychopathology.

      "abstract": "The difference between normal fear and abnormal would seem at first sight to be apparent. Even in normal fear there is considerable evidence to suggest that the outer danger is commonly reacted to excessively only because it resonates, as it were, with one operating inside us. As regards manifestations, the essential difference between the phenomenon of normal fear and the symptoms of morbid anxiety is that whereas in fear practically all the mental and physical symptoms described are present in a related or comparable degree, in morbid anxiety, on the other hand, any one or more of these symptoms may stand out in striking disproportion to the others. The illnesses which arise from fear, normal and abnormal—and it is doubtful whether any, even accidents, can be excluded— may be divided into those connected with its mental and those connected with its physical manifestations. Anxiety hysteria may develop into the more typical form of hysteria called conversion hysteria.",

Beyond feelings, people who speak of FOMO also speak of it as a behavior, most often as a compulsivity (related to what I characterize as conspicuous sociality) and as an illness to be remedied. And although FOMO is often seen as a recent phenomenon, I argue it is a continuation of a centuries-old concern and discourse about media-prompted envy and anxiety (i.e., “keeping up with the Joneses” and neurasthenia).",

Just as a part of one's body feels numb when it manifestly fails to incur the ordinary sensory consequences of transactions at the surface of the skin, so an individual feels emotional absence when her affective condition manifestly fails to vary in predictable ways as she navigates her surroundings. Experiences of emotional absence, such as feeling numb with shock or grief, feeling unamused, or feeling fearless, are not simply flat or neutral states of awareness, but can bear psychological and epistemic significance for the agent.",

      "title": "Love and its objects",
      "abstract": "Love is commonly reckoned to be one emotion among many. But how many emotions we think there are depends on what account we adopt of the necessary and sufficient conditions for something to be an emotion. If we think that emotions are simply our awareness of the physiological changes produced in us by our perception of certain sorts of objects, then we can try to count the different sorts of objects that are capable of causing these bodily sensations in us: for example, frightening objects, extraordinary objects, delightful ones. Or we can try to count emotions by distinguishing the different patterns of these physiological changes that certain sorts of objects and situations produce in us: in sorrow, irregular heart beats combined with weeping and trembling, for instance. However, if the view adopted is the one that we shall employ here, an emotional state consists in abnormal bodily changes caused by the agent's evaluation or appraisal of some object or situation that the agent believes to be of concern to him or her. Distinguishing such states from each other, and hence counting them, will require us to distinguish the different kinds of evaluations and appraisals embedded in them – evaluations, for example, of situations as being inexplicably strange or embarrassing or pathetic or pitiful or appealing. Since not all societies make these same sorts of evaluations, some emotions named and recognized in one society can be nameless and unfamiliar in another. Thus the German Schadenfreude, or malicious glee, is a response that is familiar outside Germany but perhaps not common enough in some societies for it to be classified by their members as an ordinary emotion.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Animals are usually considered to lack the status of autonomous agents. Nevertheless, they do appear to make ostensible choices. This article considers whether, and how, I should respect animals' choices. I propose a concept of volitionality which can be respected if, and insofar as, doing so is in the best interests of the animal. Applying that concept, I (we) will argue that an animals' choices be respected when the relevant human decision maker's capacities to decide are potentially challenged or compromised. For example, it will be best to respect the animals' choice when the human decision maker: (1) lacks accurate knowledge of the animal's subjective experiences; (2) does not know what will lead to desirable experiences or allow for the avoidance of undesirable ones; (3) is biased; (4) is less aware of the animal's specific situation; (5) cannot appreciate all elements comprehensively, including considering any (content‐neutral) value to the animal being allowed to make and implement a choice, such as where a lack of control or liberty would be unpleasant or where an animal would usefully learn from the process of choice‐making; and (6) when the animal's choice is achievable. This additionally suggests that we may often beneficially choose to set up situations that empower animals to make better choices.",

      "abstract": "Cardiac surgery: a complex system Heart surgery has much in common with other high technology systems in which performance and outcomes depend on multifaceted interactions of individual, technical and organizational factors. In addition, our specialty often functions as a chaotic/emergent system since the initial circumstances vary in patients with the same medical condition resulting in uncertainty and lack of predictability [1]. Complexity: The American Heritage Dictionary defines complex and complicated as “things whose parts are so interconnected or interwoven as to make the whole perplexing”. If we add rarity and small numbers to complexity, the results is a distinctiveness that explains many aspects of our profession and specialty such as variability with institutional differences in outcomes; inconsistency of results in treating rare diseases and uncertainty on any inference about results of complex rare lesions [2]. A system is a set of interdependent elements that are interacting, or working together, to accomplish a common goal. All systems, at the “atomic” level, consist of individuals, activities, connections, and pathways with the following characteristics, qualities or peculiarities in complex systems: • Heterogeneity of the parties (diverse nature and multiple); • Cause-and-effect relationships may be nonlinear and obvious only in retrospect; • Richness of interaction between them (including their contradictory character); • Multidimensional and multi-referential; • Many variables commonly present; • Provide information that by itself reveals the extent of its complexity; • Under an apparent simplicity, they often hide the true dynamics of these processes and interactions between its parts • Vulnerability — Are influenced by factors and surprising circumstances that may affect, cause, or facilitate a change in behavior and expected results, altering all or changed significantly “Complex business generates complex services.

      "abstract": "<strong class=\"journal-contentHeaderColor\">Abstract.</strong> In the context of natural hazard risk quantification and modeling of hazard interactions, some &nbsp;literature separates &ldquo;Level I&rdquo; (or occurrence) interactions from &ldquo;Level II&rdquo; (or consequence) interactions. The Level I interactions occur inherently due to the nature of the hazards, independently of the presence of physical assets. In such cases, one hazard event triggers or modifies the occurrence of another (e.g., heavy rain and flooding; liquefaction and landslides triggered by an earthquake), thus creating a dependency between the features characterizing such hazard events. They differ from Level II interactions, which instead occur through impacts/consequences on physical assets/components and systems (e.g., accumulation of physical damage or social impacts due to earthquake sequences, landslides due to the earthquake-induced collapse of a retaining structure). Multi-hazard Life Cycle Consequence (LCCon) analysis aims to quantify the consequences (e.g., repair costs, downtime, casualty rates) throughout a system&rsquo;s service life and should account for both Level I and II interactions. The available literature generally considers Level I interactions &ndash; the focus of this study &ndash; mainly defining relevant taxonomies, often qualitatively, without providing a computational framework to simulate a sequence of hazard events incorporating the identified interrelations among them. This paper addresses this gap, proposing modeling approaches associated with different types of Level I interactions. It describes a simulation-based method for generating multi-hazard event sets (i.e., a sequence of hazard events and associated features throughout the system&rsquo;s life cycle) based on the theory of competing Poisson processes. The proposed approach incorporates the different types of interactions in a sequential Monte Carlo sampling method. The method outputs multi-hazard event sets that can be integrated into LCCon frameworks to quantify interacting hazard consequences. An application incorporating several hazard interactions is presented to illustrate the potential of the proposed method.",

      "title": "Degradation of (moral) values in the context of the ego ideal and the ideal ego",
      "abstract": "All conclusions about some psychological characteristics or content must derive from relations of social, or better yet, epochal changes and structure they create. General agreement - admittedly biased and without access to a constant fact which is not close to any transitional movements - that the times are unstable - does not end with a precise understanding of how much would that instability reflect on the formation of a stable character. It could be said that this particular level of structuration, which connects 'the external' and 'the internal', is consistently absent in most theories. This especially applies to our central self, our consciousness, the authoritative part of us that sets standards and has been wrongly equated with universal truths, general principles and something that is considered to be common to all people. All complexity of formation of the super­ego, as the lastly formed instance that is also responsible for the sense of duty or the sense of moral obligation, has always been a result of the current form of structuration and has always been realized, more or less, as a distorted memory of certain, quite determined, events that a subject was overwhelmed with. If we listen to our own tendencies toward instability, we will not fall into the trap which is often present when describing ourselves, i.e. the belief that we have 'a real self', common to all human beings, whose requests are more important than requests of all others. However, outside of dynamic psychology, it would be difficult to understand how Lacan's 'split entity' could ever have 'a real self' whose requests are, especially concerning morality, more important than all other requests. Human nature has most easily been introduced into the norm by those ideals that had insisted on denial, and are located in the ego ideal. When 'ideals' moved, usually behind a screen of freedom and urge for individualization, the pleasure returned to nature in the form of ego ideals that knew the answer to the question, 'What is good for a man's life?' It is, as a reality principle, located in egocentric context, but no longer as an individual excess, but rather as a general, universal truth. Individualism, as the supreme value, has allowed different people to keep different views on what is a good life. While the ego ideal extolled people to make a compromise in which, of course, they had to forgo nature for the sake of culture, ideal ego approves all bypasses of the law if it is good for the subject. It could almost be said that the system of ego ideal, which is valued less and less, makes values as they are. There is no degradation whatsoever because cancelling of differences and boundaries leads to uniformity where the difference between the right and wrong is reduced to personal good. 'An inner voice' that dictates duties to the subject and indicates where good and evil are in opposition as pure or impure, was suspended. Ideal ego is not an ally of the law because it does not care for the subject's well-being. Unlike it, the ego ideal was giving satisfaction by its realization. No matter how strange it might seem, the highest value in a man (moral values) is most deeply associated with the lowest, with his pure nature. Therefore, it is difficult, if not impossible, to answer the question, 'What is my true self?' to a man who wonders what it is human nature. For psychoanalysis, it is hard to accept that naive 'clear understanding of self' and own values, which starts from Plato. And that was particularly difficult when, instead of compensated narcissism in the ego ideal, he continued his life in the ideal ego.",

      "abstract": "After a selection from the remarks made by students about their preferen-ces towards writing in the I-mode, the YOU-mode or the ONE-mode, I propose two hypotheses: 1. There is a certain connection between the degree of self-experience and self-responsibility (primary existence) and the choice to speak or write in the I-, YOU- or ΟΝΕ-mode, but apparently it also holds that the choice of one of those modes restricts or elaborates the space a person has to express himself. More generally stated: There is a certain interaction between the way of existence of a speaker or writer and the way of self-denomination in his utterances. 2. There is a certain connection between the degree to which a speaker or writer a) has knowledge about himself and wants to be responsible for his feelings, thoughts and acts; b) guards or unveils his intimacy towards a hearer or reader; c) wants to be involved in or responsible for a process or activity outside his body; and the way he denominates himself or the outside process or activity in his utterances. I give some examples of ways of linguistic alienation, and propose an arrangement of the degrees of alienation in the same way as is done in language for local distances: HERE THERE YONDER SOMEWHERE NOWHERE I I, as a.. YOU ONE NONE (self) (increasing self-separation) (self-ignoring) (self-eliminating) I expect that children with a very sensitive linguistic intuition, draw conclusions about the reliability of adults from the way they use alienation codes; that human beings are or become strangers to one another, or are more attached as friends and lovers by using alienation codes or direct human language; that relational, social and economic victims advertise themselves as potential victims by the way they use alienation codes and do not recognize their potential oppressors by the way they use alienation codes. The main field of linguistic study as human linguistics lies in making clear what the differences are between direct human language and alienation codes.",

Emotions are intentional states, and have propositional objects in the sense that what the emotion is about, of, for, at, or to can in principle be specified prepositionally. 3. Some emotions have typical physiological concomitants, some of which are to some degree felt; and people are sometimes inclined to identify the feeling of the emotion with the feeling of these changes. 4. Typically an emotion depends on the subject believing some state of affairs to obtain (for example, A would not fear this spider if he didn't believe it likely that the spider is harmful); but this is not always so: Sometimes we experience an emotion despite not believing its propositional content. 5. Some emotions beget dispositions to kinds of actions; so references to such emotions are often a powerful way of explaining actions.",

      "abstract": "There are a number of ways in which a person can share the guilt of another's wrongdoing. He might advise it, command it or consent to it. He might provoke it, praise it, flatter the wrongdoer, or conceal the wrong. He might stay silent when there is a clear duty to denounce the wrong or its perpetrator; or he might positively defend the wrong done. Finally, he might actively participate or co-operate in the wrongdoing. These various activities, apart from co-operation, typically occur before or after the commission of the wrong itself, only provocation being essentially before the fact. As such they fall into the categories of seduction or comfort, seduction being essentially pre-commission and comfort post-commission. In seduction (mutatis mutandis for comfort), the seducer typically leads another into doing wrong who has not definitely made up his mind. He does not assist in the commission, but he leads to its occurring. If the principal (as I will call the one who commits the wrong) has made up his mind, actions which might otherwise amount to seduction are best characterized as amounting to scandal, since they do not lead to wrong but reinforce the principal in his wrongful intent or provide to third parties a bad example since they connote approval of the principal's action. Closely related to the concept of seduction is that of solicitation, though perhaps these are best thought of as two aspects of the same kind of activity.",

It is a matter of experience that the sense of understanding other people's actions draws continually on familiar and subjective elements by which we attribute to others states of mind, desire, motive and purpose that we can recognise in ourselves, or feel we could. They help to make these other people's actions intelligible. We impute understanding of the purpose or feelings of the actors to them. It is often implicit and intrinsic in the verbs or words we use to describe human behaviour (e.g. ‘announce’, ‘give’, ‘feed’, ‘welcome’, ‘answer’, ‘punish’). This is generally so in the description of human behaviour, whatever the writer and his purpose – novelist, historian, anthropologist, journalist, psychologist or philosopher. Description and interpretation of human behaviour are often bound together. Wholly objective descriptions of human behaviour (and ‘pure’ descriptions of social actions a fortiori) are very hard to provide. We do not register human behaviour in a simple objective fashion but we continually seek to recognise and translate it as we perceive it into terms of understanding if we can. We do this without thinking in everyday life; many words we use to think or speak about human behaviour imply such understanding willy-nilly. But it is also a matter of everyday experience that we sometimes find other people's actions hard to understand.

      "abstract": "Several viewpoints existed as to what is considered a fall. These viewpoints were developed based on the aspect of an individual’s involvement in a fall situation, knowledge level about falls, among other factors. A broad definition of a fall that has been widely accepted is “an event whereby an individual comes to rest on the ground or another lower level with or without a loss of consciousness” [1]. When referring to falls in more of a research typesetting, the researcher may have considered a fall, “an unexpected event in which the participants come to rest on the ground, floor, or lower level” [1]. Another proposed definition of a fall wasa “sudden unintentional change in position causing an individual to land at a lower level, on an object, the floor, or the ground, other than as a consequence of sudden onset of paralysis, epileptic seizure, or overwhelming external force” [1].",

      "title": "\"Making time: killing time\"",
      "abstract": "Time as an external phenomenon—chronological time—is often contrasted theoretically with psychological or subjective time: behind this is the idea that there exist two or more different types of time. Making time is a depressive-position activity, necessitating acknowledgement of the other's separateness and significance to oneself and of one's role in the existence and well-being of the other person. To make time is, ultimately, an act of love. There are expressions of killing time that are not necessarily symptoms of borderline states but that also signify disavowal of object need. The borderline personality kills time to keep apart from objects. Time is omnipresent and a central human preoccupation. Varying definitions of time arise as a consequence of cultural and psychological influences reflecting subjective and social perspectives. Narcissism spares him the pains of needing, loving, and hating, even if the price may be lifelong suffering.",

      "abstract": "The conversational background to our lives is strange in that we cannot turn it around into an object of thought, to be explained like all else in our world in terms of either rules, theories or models. Its strangeness, it is argued, arises out of the fact that all actions by human beings involved with others in a social group are, as Bakhtin (1986, 1990) claims, dialogically or responsively linked in some way, both to previous, already executed actions, and to anticipated, next possible actions. Or, as Searle (1992) has argued: all utterances within conversations are necessarily related to each other, internally; they have shared intentionality. Within situations with shared intentionality, it is as if the situation itself is an ethically active, living entity that, as much as the others around us, requires our respect. Thus, like the others around us, `it' also can exert a formative influence upon what we do within it. Some of the consequences of this extraordinary circumstance for psychology are explored in the article.",

      "title": "Human Primitive Behavior",
      "abstract": "In dangerous, strenuous, or life-threatening situations, some behavioral patterns may occur that do not belong to the \"normal\" spectrum of human behavior. Among these are what is referred to here as \" sedimentation\" (which may result in the finding of a feeble person or a deceased in topographically low-lying sections of buildings), as well as the phenomena of hiding and covering and undressing (a well-known phenomenon related to fatal hypothermia), and other behavioral elements of minor relevance like confusion, fumbling, and screaming. These behavioral peculiarities may lead to dubious findings at a death scene and may be mistaken for signs of a preceding crime by the unwary. Sometimes, circumstantial findings seem to indicate that a fight or a violent or sexual offense took place. However, a more thorough analysis of the scene often shows that the whole situation had been created by the deceased himself or herself prior to death without any third-party involvement. The aforementioned behavioral elements are termed \" primitive\" here because at least some of them, like covering and hiding, seem to originate from early developmental stages of human instinctive behavior as a reaction pattern in response to danger and stress that also can be observed in animals. These behavioral patterns have their origin in phylogenetically old, autonomous parts of the brain. A good knowledge of the elements and patterns of human primitive behavior and the associated ways of acting is most helpful to all those involved in the death investigation because it often helps in the correct interpretation of curious death scene scenarios that otherwise would remain obscure or even enigmatic. Also, search and rescue teams will benefit from taking these behavioral patterns into consideration because they enable the development of improved search strategies for seeking missing persons.",

Crowd turbulence Unanticipated and unintended irregular motion of individuals into different directions due to strong and rapidly changing forces in crowds of extreme density. Emergence Spontaneous establishment of a qualitatively new behavior through non-linear interactions of many objects or subjects. Evolutionary optimization Gradual optimization based on the effect of frequently repeated randommutations and selection processes based on some success function (“fitness”). Faster-is-slower effect This term reflects the observation that certain processes (in evacuation situations, production, traffic dynamics, or logistics) take more time if performed at high speed. In other words, waiting can often help to coordinate the activities of several competing units and to speed up the average progress. Freezing-by-heating effect Noise-induced blockage effect caused by the breakdown of direction-segregated walking patterns (typically two or more “lanes” characterized by a uniform direction of motion). “Noise” means frequent variations of the walking direction due to nervousness or impatience in the crowd, e. g. also frequent overtaking maneuvers in dense, slowly moving crowds. Panic Breakdown of ordered, cooperative behavior of individuals due to anxious reactions to a certain event. Often, panic is characterized by attempted escape of many individuals from a real or perceived threat in situations of a perceived struggle for survival, which may end up in trampling or crushing of people in a crowd. Self-organization Spontaneous organization (i. e. formation of ordered patterns) not induced by initial or boundary conditions, by regulations or constraints. Self-organization is a result of non-linear interactions between many objects or subjects, and it often causes different kinds of spatio-temporal patterns of motion.

      "abstract": "AI needs a formal functional theory of emotions to represent in computer programs our knowledge of emotions. In the theory we propose, emotions are a special class of Intentional states with structural components and properties similar to thos e of the traditional somatic appetites of thirst, hunger, and sex. These were originally part of a hardwired, phylogenetically adapted, nonverbal feedback system for implicitly conveying information about these states both among and within individual members of the species. A classification system provides two major functional classes of emotions, (1) those serving as Appetitive Wishes toward objects, and (2) those serving as Beliefs about the status of fulfillment of those and other significant wishes. Thus, emotions such as Anger or Fear indicate a wish to attack or escape from some object or situation, while Love or Surprise indicate wishes to care about or explore an object or situation. Emotional wishes, like their somatic brethren, require Consummatory Acts for their fulfillment. The result of these acts are emotions such Anxiety or Depression, which indicate Beliefs that the relevant wishes will be hard or impossible to satisfy, or Contentment or Elation , which function as Beliefs that the wishes have been or are being fulfilled. Together, emotional wishes and beliefs form a comprehensive wish-belief information feedback system with manifold causal consequences. Potential applications include agent-oriented problem solving, animation, and human-computer interaction.",

Status is both achieved and ascribed, and the degree to which one or the other contributes more draws the thin line between the real and apparent. To achieve means \"to carry out successfully (accomplish);\" \"to get or attain as a result of exertion (reach),\" or \"to attain a desired end or aim (to become successful).\"2 To ascribe, on the other hand, comes from the restored spelling of the Middle English ascrive, etymologically derives from the Old French. ascrivre, \"to attribute, inscribe,\" and the Latin ascribere \"to write in, to add to in a writing,\" from ad- \"to\" + scribere \"to write.\"3 To ascribe is to refer to a supposed cause, source, or author, and \"suggests an inferring of cause, quality or authorship\" as in the case of \"forged paintings formerly ascribed to masters.\"4 Achievement rightfully bestows an earned \"headship,\" implied in its etymology from the Old.French. achever \"to finish,\" from the phrase à chef (venir) \"at an end, finished,\" the Vulgate Latin *accapare, from the Latin ad caput (venire). Literally, both the Old.French and Latin phrases mean \"to come to a head,\" from the Latin caput \"head.\"5 Ascription is flattery at best; but worse when self-generated and perpetuated. Are vicarious experiences that become \"personal accomplishments,\" casual visits and observations that become \"further training and fellowships,\" comments and editing (even supervisory positions) that metamorphose into \"research and co-authorships\" any different from the fictitious medals of a dictator? Awards beget awards. Those who are thus preceded by reputation may loom \"larger than life.\" Do such giants stand on feet of clay? Our circles are a microcosm of the nation and world around us.

Et tu? _________________________ The first meeting of the Asia Pacific Association of Medical Journal Editors (APAME) was held in Seoul, the Republic of Korea last May 4-5, 2008 co-hosted by the World Health Organization Western Pacific Regional Office.6 APAME's vision, it was agreed, would be to promote health care through the dissemination of quality health information in the Asia Pacific Region. The association also established the following aims: To upgrade publishing standards of health journals and books, paper-based or electronic; To develop an aggregated indexing system for health articles published in the Asia Pacific Region; and To enhance optimal access to health articles. The development of the Western Pacific Region Index Medicus (WPRIM) and the Global Health Library (GHL) are much-needed efforts to ensure the dissemination of and universal access to reliable health information essential to health development. These efforts will level the playing field for authors, editors, peer reviewers, publishers and subscribers in developing countries, elevating loco-regional research and publishing to the global arena. Following our continued compliance with established standards, we anticipate inclusion of the Philipp J Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg in the WPRIM. Through its President Gil M. Vicente, and the Board of Trustees, our Society blazes new trails to lead us beyond the confines of self-directed concerns toward new horizons of hope for our various publics, present and future. Efforts aimed at health-promotion and disease-prevention, side by side with involvement in ecological and environmental concerns may prove to be as, or even more important, than the equally quixotic pursuit of cutting-edge diagnostic and therapeutic advances. What use are these when they are beyond the reach of most? \"When the time of our particular sunset comes, our 'thing,' our accomplishment, won't matter a great deal. But the clarity and concern with which we have loved others will speak with vitality of the great gift of life we have been to each other.\"7 &nbsp",

For instance, if one is able to write one's own name, but unable to fill out a job application because he or she does not understand the words 'previous' or 'experience', is that person considered literate or illiterate? How much reading and writing ability must one possess before one can be considered literate? Questions such as this gave birth to the term functional literacy. Functional Literacy refers to one's ability to use language skills to cope with every day demands (IL Y, 1990). In other words, if one's ability to read and write is so limited that it prevents him or her from functioning in society, e.g. purchasing goods, reading a bus schedule or following instructions on a medicine bottle, then that person is by definition, functionally illiterate.

      "title": "Reply to “a non-paternalistic value theory for occupational therapy: a response to Dige”",
      "abstract": "Sandman makes it sound as if I am the one who defends a contentious theory whereas the alternatives, i.e. hedonistic or desire-fulfilment theories, are more uncontroversial or “minimal”. I fail to see this because I find it much more straightforward to say that certain elements of a human life, e.g. accomplishment, personal relationships, and understanding, have a direct or intrinsic value and therefore are something that it is good to enjoy or desire whereas others, e.g. monotony, isolation, and confusion, have a direct or intrinsic disvalue and therefore are something that is not worth enjoying or desiring. It is not entirely clear whether Sandman wants to challenge the view that activity is intrinsically better than passivity or the view that specific types of activities (e.g. those involving personal relationships, understanding, and accomplishment) are objectively better than others in the sense that they constitute genuine, intrinsic values. The first point is easily misunderstood. The claim that activity is intrinsically good does not imply an ideal of hyperactivity and extreme sports. Sandman’s examples of rather monotonous and mindless activities (playing Tetris and “ordering, reordering and ordering again a set of differently coloured pens”) are interesting only if they more or less take up all the person’s time. Most of us use a considerable amount of time on activities like that (for better or worse). It becomes a professional (OT) challenge only if the person seems incapable of enjoying or desiring anything else and I have a hard time imagining a responsible occupational therapist who would accept a life of total passivity (taking part in no challenging or social or self-involving activities whatsoever) as a possible ideal life. The second point is a matter of considerable philosophical controversy and it would be overly ambitious to try to settle it definitively. Hence, apart from what I have said in the original article, I will just offer an example for consideration. Imagine a child in an elementary school who exclaims: “But I do not want to come to understand maths or grammar or anything else at all and I do not want to interact with you teachers and the other children and I do not want to make school work my own accomplishment!” That would certainly be a pedagogic challenge but I think it would take a lot more than this to make it a challenge to our belief in these values. On the contrary, it would simply be unprofessional if the schoolteachers reassessed their mission and value commitments to the effect that they gave up on teaching maths to those who did not want it, allowed the antisocial children to be left alone, and so on. Quite another but very important consideration is that we sometimes have to settle for something short of the ideal. Imagine for example that the child suffers from social phobia and gets extremely anxious when",

In this way, his outlook may vary radically, not only at different periods of his life, but from day to day, even from one hour to the next. It is a function of so many variables: age, experiences, present environment, current reading, current physical state are some of them. As for the ways of life that may thus present themselves at different times as each uniquely satisfactory, there can be no doubt about their variety and opposition.

The first is the distinguishing mark of the human being as a sensible or natural being; the second is the distinguishing mark of the human being as a rational being endowed with freedom. The man of principles, from whom one knows what to expect, not from his instinct, for example, but from his will, has a character. – Therefore in the Characteristic one can, without tautology, divide what belongs to a human being's faculty of desire (what is practical) into what is characteristic in a) his natural aptitude or natural predisposition, b) his temperament or sensibility, and c) his character purely and simply, or way of thinking. – The first two predispositions indicate what can be made of the human being; the last (moral) predisposition indicates what he is prepared to make of himself.",

      "abstract": "Social psychologists invented the concept of prosocial behavior to characterize a range of voluntary actions that benefit the welfare of others. Because prosocial behavior is socially defined, its specific nature may differ across societies or by situations. For example, the widespread norm, “Thou shall not kill,” does not apply on the battlefield where killing may be rewarded with praise and medals. Prosocial behavior is consistent with social norms and provides a convenient antonym for antisocial behavior, or non‐normative behaviors such as crime and most forms of aggression. Helping is a prosocial subtype and refers to any behavior that has positive consequences for another. The helper's motivation may be altruistic or egoistic. Altruism is a special form of helping. The altruist is motivated by the ultimate goal of improving another's well‐being regardless of possible personal costs. Although the altruist may garner rewards in the act of helping, this does not preclude the altruistic intent. In contrast, egoistic responses are self‐serving and motivated by the desire to improve one's own welfare. The connection between altruism and prosocial behavior varies. Prosocial behavior will not always be altruistically motivated, and altruistic motivation will not always generate prosocial behavior (Batson 1991).",

      "abstract": "In general, codes that have been designed to safeguard the welfare of animals emphasize the importance of providing an environment that will ensure good health and a normal physiological and physical state, that is, they emphasize the animals' physical needs. If mental needs are mentioned, they are always relegated to secondary importance. The argument is put forward here that animal welfare is dependent solely on the cognitive needs of the animals concerned. In general, if these cognitive needs are met, they will protect the animals' physical needs. It is contended that in the few cases in which they do not safeguard the physical needs, it does not matter from a welfare point of view. The human example is given of being ill. It is argued that welfare is only adversely affected when a person feels ill, knows that he or she is ill, or even thinks that he or she is ill, all of which processes are cognitive ones. The implications for welfare of animals possessing certain cognitive abilities are discussed. For example, the extent to which animals are aware of their internal state while performing behavior known to be indicative of so-called states of suffering, such as fear, frustration, and pain, will determine how much they are actually suffering. With careful experimentation it may be possible to determine how negative they feel these states to be. Similarly, the extent to which animals think about items or events absent from their immediate environment will determine how frustrated they are in the absence of the real item or event but in the presence of the cognitive representation.",

      "abstract": "(1872), the nonverbal 'language of the emotions' has been a vital research area. In fact, emotions and attitudes are mainly expressed by the use of the nonverbal channel. These functions are not as easily expressed by means of the verbal language. Eibl-Eibesfeldt 1970:462 states that To communicate emotions we do not necessarily require language even today, because our innate expressive behaviour repertoire is quite sufficient. The verbal language, in contrast, has its main function in communicating events and thoughts, i.e. the referential function. One of the characteristics of human verbal language is that it allows the communication of events outside the immediate context of the 'here and now'. Emotions are evoked by some sort of stimulus. Emotions typically occur in social situations, where humans interact and/or react on stimuli. In social interaction, 'body language' (facial expression, gestures, posture, touching etc.) and vocal signs (tone quality, prosody, cries, laughter etc.) are important means of communication for humans as well as for other social species. One example of the inferiority of the verbal channel in communicating emotions is that when the verbal content conflicts with the nonverbal message the verbal message is ignored, and people trust the nonverbal signal (see",

      "title": "A Plea for Pity",
      "abstract": "A Plea for Pity Robert H. Kimball Introduction Does the ability to feel pity toward the unfortunate represent one of humanity's better instincts, on par with the capacity for love, compassion, and forgiveness? Or is pity actually one of our morally baser emotions, like jealousy, envy, or hatred, because pity can include contempt for its object and an attitude of morally reprehensible superiority on the part of the pitier? Surprisingly, there is little philosophical consensus on this issue, with informed opinion nearly equally divided. That the same emotion can elicit such contrary evaluations shows how elusive a clear understanding of pity can be. Furthermore, is there something wrong—either logically or morally—with attempting to arouse the emotion of pity in others when they do not already feel it themselves (or do not feel it as intensely as we want them to)? Should appeals to pity be rejected because any emotion is inimical to clear thinking or simply irrelevant to the justification of action? Or is there something particularly morally reprehensible about trying to manipulate another's emotions and actions specifically on the basis of pity? Alternatively, at least in some cases could an exhortation to pity be an acceptable, even desirable, aspect of moral education or an often-necessary reminder to care about the misfortunes of others and not just to pursue our own self-interests? Surprisingly, opinion (at least in the informal fallacy tradition) is remarkably unanimous about the undesirability of appealing to pity. But I think their reasons can be improved upon. Traditional analyses of appeal to pity do not seriously analyze the emotion being appealed to, and most treatments of pity as an emotion do not address its use in rhetorical manipulation. I claim that what is wrong with appeal to pity can be satisfactorily understood only if pity itself is adequately understood. I propose to proceed by combining these two questions: what is wrong with pity? and what is wrong with appeal to pity? [End Page 301] In answering the second question, the textbook tradition of informal fallacy analysis holds that when a speaker attempts to arouse pity in an audience in order to induce an action, this situation should be interpreted not under the rubric of nonlogical causal influence, manipulation, or rhetorical persuasion but rather as belonging to the domain of (informal) logic, and in particular as a failed attempt at argument in which a descriptive premise that A pities B does not entail the normative conclusion that B deserves A's help (or that A should help B). Thus in the informal fallacy tradition, experiencing the emotion of pity is never a valid justification for action.2 I believe this rigid reason/emotion distinction has little basis in our actual belief-forming and decision-making practices. Nor do I believe that emotion should be excluded from reasoning, since our emotions are often informative and are sometimes more reliable guides to action than argument. In Appeal to Pity, Douglas Walton (1997) presents a nuanced and considerably more subtle alternative to the textbook tradition, in which he evaluates epistemically the effect of the emotional state of pity on practical reasoning. Analyzing such cases as charitable appeals (e.g., for starving people and disaster victims, arguments for hardship exemptions from general rules, and alleged atrocities), he emphasizes especially the particularizing nature of pity and the way it overrides universal principles, especially of justice. Under Walton's epistemic evaluation of pity, it emerges as a reason-clouding emotion under certain conditions. Furthermore, he shows how the occurrence of pity is susceptible to manipulation; he emphasizes especially cases in which pity is not actually deserved or justified but is manipulatively made to seem so. But Walton looks at a very small slice of the landscape of pity and what might be problematic about it. So in order to evaluate pity fully—not just epistemically but also as a moral emotion and its role in a fully flourishing life—we need to expand our concept of pity. In fact, pity is a very difficult and complex emotion to analyze (Solomon 1993). Definition of \"pity\" In pitying someone, such as a homeless person, a starving child, or a mutilated...",

Posture, physiologically speaking, is the<i>active</i>maintenance of an animal's station in its environment. It is a manifestation of muscular activity sustained largely by proprioceptive reflexes in accordance with inherited nervous patterns, modified by social customs and personal approbations or taboos. It connotes resistance to external forces, such as air currents and gravity. Position, on the other hand, is imposed on a part, and the station is maintained by<i>passive</i>factors. It connotes relaxation and rest. In bed, when one puts one's hands over one's head the arms lie inertly on the pillow. They have position, not posture, because they are not muscularly active but at rest. Pain may arise from the position imposed on a part if the position is long or frequently maintained. For example, there may be pain in the region of the internal lateral ligament",

      "abstract": "The social inferiority of an elderly person stems from his physical inferiority--actual or alleged but always possible. And yet this \"inferior\" body is paradoxically hypertrophic: at first it masks the person, then takes up its space until it negates it. Hence, an elderly person is not only a body but a lonely body. In his relations with other people, his body becomes a receiver, a receptacle and a source of communication. Social violence underlies relations with elderly people: such violence may be deceptive, widespread and continuous or, on the other hand, manifest, episodic and conspicuous. In the first case it may be a way of assigning subalternate roles to them in relation to the efficiency expected of them or a way of mythologizing their condition as one of pseudo-happiness. In the second case is generally relates to assaults, thefts, bag-snatching, etc. In any case, however, communication with them entails violence: their body perceives this and reacts to it. This is why their body's language is violent: their body cries out, it is stunned and it is acted upon (even--and unavoidably--in relations with a therapist).",

      "abstract": "Virtuous violence theory proposes that the perpetrator intends to harm or kill in order to constitute a social relationship to make it correspond with a prescriptive model of what the relationship ought to be – what it must be made to be. For our purposes, a social relationship consists of complementarity between the actions of the participants: each participant’s actions fit previous actions by the other and presuppose “fitting” actions by the other(s), such that the actions of each are incomplete without the congruent action by the other(s). That is, the acts of each are part of a whole that none of them can bring off alone. We encompass in the terms “act” and “actions” not simply the morphology of movements, but also, crucially, the participant’s intentions, moral judgments, and motives (often consciously experienced as emotions). Furthermore, each participant implicitly or explicitly aims to induce completion of her acts: she intends to motivationally evoke and morally invoke the congruent actions that will complete or dynamically sustain the jointly constructed pattern. That is, a participant expects the other(s) to do their part, in the predictive sense, in the hopeful sense, and in the evaluative sense of judging the others’ actions according to how well they complete the intended gestalt.

      "title": "XL. More about the Vocabulary of Psychology",
      "abstract": "In the English language there ate several synonyms that have come into use for the way people feel as a result of activity or even on the contemplation of activity. They are, for example, fatigue, tiredness, weariness, exhaustion, jadedness, droopiness, and the state of being fagged or flagged. In all of these words a state is being referred to. And, of course, there are the adverbial and adjectival and verbal forms of these words when process is being expressed. When processes are referred to, they generally pertain to processes of restricted parts of the body so that we can say they are subpersonalistic. Customarily, the word psychological is the term used to describe behavior of the organism-as-a-whole. Here again, by some, reference is only to what is experienced and according to custom is also called mental. It would seem that in cases where the term psycl-rological is customarily used, a preferable term would be personalistic. This would include both the mental and the overr. This usage would provide a less biased taxonomy (or classification) of matters to be dealt wich. Body process as such would be srrbpersonalistic. If appropriate vocabularies were set up for the various items of concern, then no one need be confused regarding the class under discussion-the context is certain and one knows which is genus and which is species. This policy has never been consistently carried out, and it is undeniable that confusion or inconsistency reigns. The purpose of the present introductory remarks is two-fold: (a) to introduce the subject of fatigue and (b) in so doing avoid perpetuating the deficiencies just pointed out. For some reason, our of all these words, the noun, fatigue has come to be the most generic, including even the nonbiological systems and substances outside the body. Since the word fatigue was first used to describe the human condition, it would seem reasonable that psychology, the discipline which defines itself as the science of the behavior of humans, would restrict the term fatigue to describing the state of the human organism as a person, rather than to describing the function or condition of parts of it as such. Unfortunately, this policy has not been followed. All this means that a great deal of variance exists in what is actually meant when the word fatigue is used. Some workers in the area have called for a clarification, supposing that some agreement in terminology on a rational basis could eventuate. Surely it is nor too much to expect this, because the optimal progress of human understanding in general and in science in particular is dependent upon the adoption of clear means of verbal communication. A revision and sharpening of vocabulary would not restrict research nor build science in some partisan way. Bartley and Chute (1947) have suggested that the term fatigue be used to label the class of phenomena that we call human feelings and self-evaluations.",

Although all three kinds of social kinds are mind‐dependent, this does not make them ontologically subjective or preclude them from being natural kinds.

Such representation has significant antecedents in both parental representations (Freud, 1910; Rizzuto, 1979) and other affectively significant early objects and obtains from them prevailing emotional characteristics, which inevitably contribute to the dynamic organization of the relational or rejecting experiences the subject has with his/her personally conceived divinity.In this paper I offer a clinical example from a completed analysis to illustrate the patient’s libidinal and defensive and, at times, organizing use of the divinity during the course of his treatment.",

      "abstract": "The basis of any research and first of all – scientific one, is rightly considered to be the process of clarification, formation and further use of the conceptual and terminological apparatus adopted in a particular field of knowledge. The concept is one of the forms of thinking, the result of generalization of the essential features of the object of reality. A word or phrase that means a clearly defined special concept of any field of science, technology, art, social life, etc is a term. Thus, the conceptual and terminological apparatus, as a set of concepts and terms in a particular field, is a means of expressing thoughts, views, decisions that are formed in the course of human mental activity associated with the study of processes and phenomena occurring internally and externally in the environment or any objects of existing reality.Therefore, in the course of scientific research on any topic, as a rule, there is a clarification of the conceptual and terminological apparatus, in order to ensure more complete disclosure of the results of such research. Processes related to public administration are no exception, in particular in the field of functioning of the organizational and legal mechanism for ensuring the security of diplomatic facilities in Ukraine in crisis situations.The study of the processes of functioning mechanisms of public administration in various spheres of public relations is a fairly common subject of scientific research at present. Therefore, the conceptual and terminological apparatus used by scientists is also quite developed. However, it should be noted that depending on the research topic, the authors use their own understanding of certain terms. In view of this, there is a need to clarify the terminology adopted in the field of security of diplomatic missions and consular posts accredited in Ukraine.The article reveals the content of the main terminological concepts used in the study of the organizational and legal mechanism for ensuring the security of diplomatic facilities in Ukraine in crisis situations. A generalized list of the main conventional needs of diplomatic facilities in the host country related to their security is given. The functional model of mechanisms of state management of system of maintenance of safety of objects of diplomatic appointment, including in the conditions of crisis situations is offered.",

Reasons for acting are conscious rational beliefs that can make some otherwise irrational actions, rationa/.1 The belief that having one’s right arm cut off will save one’s life is a reason for having one’s arm cut off. In the discussion of irrational desires, several of these kinds of beliefs were mentioned. Beliefs that one’s action will decrease one’s own or anyone else’s chances of dying, of suffering pain, or of losing some ability, freedom, or pleasure count as reasons. These beliefs are reasons because they can sometimes make acting to achieve the object of an irrational desire rational.

      "abstract": "The pleasure to offer has no connection with richness or welfare, it occurs when you realize that your neighbor is more afflicted than you, that you are more blessed by God or you want to be at peace with yourself by helping others in order to thank or to seek real help, of divine, superfluous nature. Although pleasure does not interfere with need, it brings about a good feeling, while the need seems to be embodied in our nature as we cannot live without it and now and then we make them merge to combine feelings with reason. Offering is an act without expectation for reward, although the benefits occur after a while, being both material (reward) and especially immaterial, a service or a gesture of gratefulness. We offer when we love, we give because we need to establish moral and social values for our peers to perceive the approach, understanding, tolerance and solidarity.",

      "abstract": "This paper explores why direct observation of our own species behaviour is so little done in psychology and other social sciences.The very familiarity and the richness of our cultural understanding of our behaviour is paradoxically an impediment, since that understanding is couched in the language of an active participant in social interactions.That language acknowledges and communicates the subjective states of ourselves and others but it is not couched in the language of a scientist, who is an outsider, a passive observer, who does not use the terms of his subjects and does not study their subjectivity since it is not publically observable and cannot be agreed upon in the usual scientific way of demonstrating a phenomenon for anyone to observe.A major function of our rich everyday knowledge is to help us be successful social participants.That type of practical knowledge is not necessarily useful for a detached science.Other impediments include • our moral distaste at viewing our fellow human beings as objects without subjectivity • initial observations can seem banal and uninformatively familiar • direct observation is time consuming and expensive • specific research hypotheses seem lacking Two traditional ethological ways of describing behaviours -by morphology and by consequence.A disciplined seriously playful approach is advocated for the early stages of research, trying to find useful behaviour categories to measure.One aid to this is to look for natural divisions in the phenomena studied and quotes the Plooij's work comparing children's behaviour either side of regression (rapid development) periods in early development.",

      "abstract": "A riot is an unruly collective act of violence that is temporary, discontinuous from everyday routines, and results in damage to persons or property of either the participants or targets of the collective actor. Although most social scientists have an intuitive sense of what constitutes a riot, the edges of the definition are fuzzy and it can be difficult to determine whether or not some events are actually riots. For example, it is agreed that a riot is a collective act. That is, more than one individual must be involved and at least minimally coordinate action in order for a riot to occur. Two people acting together, however, would not constitute a riot, even though it is a collective act of violence. Thus, the lower limit for participation, damage, and duration to define a riot is difficult to establish and has led many sociologists to analyze events more ambiguously referred to as civil disorders or collective violence. For most, however, unless there are at least 30–50 people involved, the events last more than a few moments, and there is action that could result in property damage or injury requiring medical attention, a riot has not occurred.",

      "abstract": "The emotional states such as feelings and emotions are not easy to assess by objective methods in animals as well as in humans. Beside measuring physiological variables an aid to assess the emotional states is the analysis of expressive behaviour of an individual respecting the relating context. Especially developed in mammals, which live in obligatory social i.e. in stable permanent social communities, are facial expression and gesture. Also horses display a differentiated expressive behaviour, which can be observed and analysed by humans. Moreover it could be demonstrated, that in situations of stress the display shown by horses (gesture, facial expression, posture) correlate with corresponding physiological reactions. Thus the expressive behaviour is suitable to assess the emotional states of horses depending on the situation.",

Yin/yang describe the polar eects or impacts of phenomena. When viewing any one phenomenon (or comparing two phenomena), yin/yang describe the opposing qualities inherent in it; for example, winter and summer would be the yin/yang, respectively, of the year. Yin• /yang are mutually rooted. Yin/yang are not adversarial, but are complementary qualities in a gestalt. at is to say, the yin aspect and the yang aspect of any one phenomenon will, when put together,form the entire phenomenon, with the combination being more than each component part. Yin/yang is a philosophy of duality. is is the reason why the Chinese term has no \"and\" between yin/yang-the term always expresses the two parts making up the one. In the example above, winter plus summer makes up the whole year. Yin• /yang mutually transform each other-e maximum eect of one quality will be followed by the transition toward the opposing quality. In other words, once the maximum yang aspect has manifest, such as the long days of summer, this will be followed by the transition toward the yin aspect, with the shortening of the days as winter approaches. Yin• /yang mutually wax and wane-e yin/yang aspects are in dynamic equilibrium. As one aspect declines, the other increases to an equal degree. For example, in the cycle of the year, the long days of summer gradually shorten and the nights gradually lengthen as winter approaches. roughout the process, however, the length of each day is a constant 24 hours (the equilibrium), and it is only the relative length of light and darkness that changes (the dynamic).",

      "title": "What is an emotion? An introduction to the study of emotions",
      "abstract": "Human emotions are hypothetic constructs based on psychological and physiological data. According to the psychoevolutionnist theories, all emotions derive from a set of discrete basic emotions, common to human and animals, genetically determined. Basic emotions are thus considered as physiological processes based on specific neuronal circuits. On the contrary, for appraisal and social theories, emotions are psychological processes resulting from the cognitive appraisal of the stimulus-event for the well-being and objectives of the subject, and are of social origin. They develop during life, especially in childhood, from interactions between the individual and his environement. According to the appraisal or constructivist theories, no sharp distinction is to be made between emotions and other manifestations of the affective life. Emotions require the global functioning of the brain, even if more specialized regions are involved. They play a fundamental role in the development of the child's psychological and social life. They mediate the subject's response to the stimulus-event, allowing more appropriate reactions than fixed instinctive ones. Nevertheless, the adaptative function of every emotion or their every component can be questioned. Emotional disturbances are major consequences of psychiatric or neurological disorders. The link between the results of neuropsychological studies of emotions based on the recognition of emotional facal expression according to the basic emotion theory, and the emotional disturbances experienced in daily life is highly questionable on account of the high complexity of human affective life.",

      "abstract": "Fulfilment of existential needs has been a top priority for human since its inception. Success in achieving this is conditioned by several different factors, which in different ways and with different consequences prevented people from fulfilling their needs. The result of the action of different forces was always the same, i.e. human suffered pain. Starting from natural disasters, which he did not understand, to other people who wanted to steal his prey, the environment became more and more dangerous. Joining different groups brought certain advantages in the field of joint action, against certain dangers, but at the same time new conditions of life and realization of life's needs. In social groups, new relationships were developing, which were driven by previously unknown forces, which represented new dangers. Therefore, human no longer had individual problems, but they were raised to the social level, and with that the level of complexity of mutual relations between people increased. Human is simply forced to protect his values in order to fulfil his needs. In order to realize this, he had to create an environment in which there is no danger, that is, a safe environment. The creation of such an environment was influenced by many factors, i.e., forces in nature and social groups. Emergency situations are a significant danger to modern society. Observed in terms of intensity or consequences, the hazards that cause them generate significant problems for society. The last decades of the 20th century are full of an increasing number of emergency situations, which significantly disrupt social security, at the local, regional and global level.",

However, ideophones can evoke all kinds of other sensory responses besides sound: motion, colors, shapes, space, and – in some languages – mental states, feelings, or physical conditions.

      "abstract": "Physical inactivity and a passive lifestyle induce a plethora of negative effects on human physical and mental health. Physical activity is a fundamental human necessity as it enables the preservation of a healthy organism and its organ systems. Recreation entails every form of body movement that increases energy consumption while the body is in the state of inaction. It encompasses fitness, training, and competition, house chores, and other activities that require bodily exertion. Regular implementation of physical activity can benefit overall health and lower the probability of chronic illnesses. However, the lack of recreation presents a globally spread problem. Physical inactivity is a state of insufficient activity, whether it is inadequate with its intensity, length, and/or frequency; its insufficiency disables normal performance of different organs, metabolic regulation processes, construction, and maintenance of non-fat body mass, and preservation of motor abilities. The quality of life is mostly defined as an overall estimation or a personal perspective of an individual with regard to the entire welfare and pleasures of life. The usual understanding of lifestyle quality based on health factors is established on the definition of the WHO; the quality of life is therefore construed as the state of complete physical, mental and social welfare, not just the absence of illness and inability. The aim of this study was to determine the level of activity and quality of life of the working population.",

It is thus notsurprising that the conceptualization of fear in the book of Deuteronomy is strongly linked to the activation and moral formation of both individual and community. On the one hand, and especially in the book’s eve-of-battle rhetoric, fear is something to be avoided and confined so that it does not contaminate the entire community (“fear not!”). On the other hand, whenits object is the nation’s deity, fear is something to be learned and taught (“so that they may learn to fear me… and teach theirchildren for ever”). In both capacities, fear in Deuteronomy has an extraordinary potential to shape the social order. It has akey role to play in stabilizing society and promoting both collective and individual flourishing, while also being understoodas a destabilizing, destructive force that is to be quarantined as if it were a contagious virus. </",

      "abstract": "The article concerns the phenomenon of stalking, or emotional persecution. It also presents legal solutions concerning stalking in the countries where this type of behavior is penalized, and includes a discussion of the advantages and disadvantages of criminalization of stalking in Poland. In contrast with the admiration, stalking is a behavior which a victim does not wish. Stalking is an English verb denoting a quiet human or animal tracking in order to capture or kill. In accordance to the definition of an American psychologist J. Reid Meloy, stalking is a form of malicious and repeated harassing and annoying of another person which increases his or her feeling of threat. Stalking, just like domestic violence, and mobbing are classified as so-called \"emotional violence\", by which we understand “interference in the psyche of another person directed against his or her emotions, resulting both immediate and delayed negative effects”. Emotional violence is never a single event. Stalking most often exhibits in such behaviors as: calls, silent calls, night calls, wandering in the vicinity of victim's home, making contact through a third party, questioning about the victim in his or her surroundings, persisting at the door / home / work, sending letters, e-mails, text messages, and gifts, placing postal orders in victim's name, tracking and following the victim, slander (distributing false information and rumors), burglary to victims house or car, stealing victim's belongings, harassing victim's family and friends, as well as attacking and assaulting them. The main problem with providing an adequate legal protection to a victim of a stalker lies in the fact that some of these behaviors are criminal, and some are not prohibited by law, nevertheless if repeated, they carry severe consequences for the victim which cannot be counteracted by means of criminal law. The tragedy of stalking victims lies in the fact that a persecutor may intimidate his victims and force them to change habits and plans, to live in constant fear. Stalker often causes huge mental suffering through actions which, under Polish law, are legally indifferent. What is also important is that actions of a stalker do not have to result from his or her wrongful intentions or desire to annoy the victim (in many law systems malicious intention of the stalker is a sine qua non for criminalization of stalking). Sometimes the persecutor acts with good intentions (the desire to win the love of a loved one), nevertheless behavior of the stalker is frightening for the victim. Results of a study taken to estimate the scale of stalking differ between countries where such studies have been conducted. This discrepancy is probably influenced by the definition assumed by researchers, research methodology, sample size and selection, but also by the different temperament of the inhabitants of these countries.",

      "title": "The representation of self through the dialogic properties of talk and conduct",
      "abstract": "It is a basic dialogical principle that the meaning of what is said or done is based on its similarities and especially its differences with other things that might have been said or done as relevantly instead, just then, just there. This makes what was actually said or done meaningful as a “choice” for all practical purposes, whether the actor made it consciously or not. And any choice a person makes (or is deemed to make) is revealing about what he or she had in mind — his or her intentions and wants, values and affects, character and qualities as a social being — that subjectively warranted producing what was said or done instead of one of the alternatives. What one’s talk and conduct reveal about what one had in mind constitutes a representation of one’s self as a social being. This representation is a persona, a “face” in Goffman’s sense. This representation is discursively, dialogically produced, such that actors’ talk and conduct will unavoidably produce a representation of themselves regardless of whether they intend it. Accordingly, persons who would not be expected to have such competence nonetheless produce representations of self, for example young children or impaired adults. Insofar as those representations are in the person’s self-interest, there is a warrant for considering that they have that competence after all. In contrast, persons who can be expected to have such competence may nonetheless produce representations that work against their self-interest by accident or deficiencies of performance. Arguably, it is an additional dimension of the representation of self that an actor produces, having to do with his or her competence, whether the representation seems to be intentional, and beyond that, artful or clever. I examine two cases to elaborate on the key propositions here: (a) that representations of self are produced whether intended or not, (b) that ones that seem to be intended because they are in the actor’s self-interest are evidence of his or her competence, and (c) that ones that seem unintentional because they are not in the actor’s self-interest are evidence of a performance lapse, or more broadly, deficiencies of competence. The first case is of two young children whose talk and conduct interactively produce representations of self that do serve their respective interests, and thus warrant reconsideration of the expressive and interactional competence of children of that age. The second is of a doctor in an urban clinic whose representation of self is not in his self-interest.",

But, depending on the situation or circumstances, the killing of a human may not always be wrong and can be justied as excusable. Homicide is generally dened as the wrongful killing of a human. e key word here is wrongful. It usually is accompanied by other words such as “malice aforethought,” “lying in wait,” or “premeditated”; the perpetrator will be prosecuted and face a possible death penalty or a life of imprisonment. However, absent the key words and intent, the circumstances may dictate that the killing may be excused as “reasonable and necessary,” for instance, to save the life of oneself or others. In other words, killing another in self-defense is justied and is not a crime; it is excusable and the killer will not be prosecuted.",

      "abstract": "Humans create social closeness with one another through a variety of shared social activities in which they align their emotions or mental states towards an external stimulus such as dancing to music together, playing board games together or even engaging in minimal shared experiences such as watching a movie together. Although these specific behaviours would seem to be uniquely human, it is unclear whether the underlying psychology is unique to the species, or if other species might possess some form of this psychological mechanism as well. Here we show that great apes who have visually attended to a video together with a human (Study 1) and a conspecific (Study 2) subsequently approach that individual faster or spend more time in their proximity than when they had attended to something different. Our results suggest that one of the most basic mechanisms of human social bonding—feeling closer to those with whom we act or attend together—is present in both humans and great apes and thus has deeper evolutionary roots than previously suspected.",

Physical survival and the negotiation of social situations constantly require that we act or abstain from acting. The latter can be, of course, construed as a form of action. The kernel of a circus action is the implementation of a physically challenging plan but such actions are performed within a cluster of verbal, musical, and visual modifiers whose deliberate purpose is to make the actions appear easier or more difficult and dangerous than they actually are. The attitudes and behaviour of the assistants who monitor aerial acts from the ground play a significant part in construing modality of an action as particularly dangerous. Trainers belong to two different categories depending on whether they deal with domestic animals of higher status like dogs and horses or wild animals which qualify them as able to perform the impossible.",

Something similar can be said of interpersonal systems such as the family, the community, or whole societies, which must be capable of acquiring, transforming or transmitting, processing, and allocating resources and information among their human components. The way a social system performs these functions will affect power relations and condition the behaviors of its human components, but it is also true that people — both as individuals and through their organizations — affect their encompassing social, economic, and political environments. In responding to events and maintaining themselves, people alter their surroundings in ways that then push their lives in directions that often were not anticipated. Thus, we all tend to influence our futures in ways that may be indirect, complex, and difficult to perceive or understand.",

First, in the context of what may be called problems facing a society, prevention always refers to a class of behaviors or actortypes or conditions or things, not just to one unit or item. It is a mass, not an individual phenomenon. Second, prevention refers to such a category only as that category is seriously believed to be a continuing phenomenon, one that will almost certainly persist or recur unless rather striking change intervenes, change which is not expected unless someone does something about it. Third, to be viewed seriously, to have any chance of being worked for with intensity and continuity, prevention needs to be directed against a class of continuing or recurring phenomena which can reasonably be interpreted by a good many people to be extensive, costly and painful. This interpretation cannot merely be applied on a now and then basis or as a sometimes tolerable, if not acceptable, occurrence. Nor can it be widely viewed as an unfortunate failure to achieve some ideal; such an attitude would render the chances of prevention almost nil. An element of intolerability is requisite.",

Fear is often mediated by the perception of another fear issued from a peer, allowing the contagion of the emotion. Ontogeny of animal fear can be observed in the natural environment, and it can be experimentally manipulated. This suggests the idea that animal fear is an internal signal of a danger, and that it develops by imprinting of external objects which categorizes the animal's world in a familiar tranquillizing world vs. a strange anxiogenic one. In humans, the child's development allows us to observe similar phenomena until such time as the child has access to the semantic world, and will experience emotions released by gestures and words issued from attachment figures or anxiogenic ones.",

Most people do not want to acknowledge it due to societal pressures and awkwardness. But slowly, people are accepting the challenges related to mental health and learning to be okay with it. In Ayurvedic classics Vishada and Avasada are the two mentioned conditions which have close resemblance with depression. Acharaya Charak quote Vishado Rogavardhanam i.e., it is the most foremost factor to worsen the condition of any disease. Psychopathology of depression may even extend up to somatic level. As there are multiple correlations, understanding the pathology of depression by means of Ayurveda basic principles such as Sharirika Dosha (bodily humor), Manasika Dosha (attributes of psyche), Satwa Bala (strength of mind), Agni (biological fire), Dhathu (tissues sustaining the body), Srotas (channels or pathways of the body) and Ojas (vital essence of life) is essential. A better understanding of depression can help in effective prevention and treatment and will help reduce the stigma associated with the condition, and lead to more people seeking help.",

However, we must also take into account the variation over time of the person's 'state of mind' or 'transient internal conditions' (Eysenck and Eysenck, 1980). Since antiquity, philosophers such as Aristotle and Cicero distinguished temporary emotional states from stable dispositions. Someone whose personality is characterised by trait anxiety is not usually anxious the whole time. The high trait anxious person may experience feelings of anxiety more often and more intensely than the low trait anxious person, but, even so, periods of feeling anxious alternative with periods of more relaxed states of mind (Spielberger, 1966). Similarly, even extraverts may occasionally wish for solitude, and introverts may sometimes be in a party mood. Short-lasting, unstable general characteristics of the person, such as a temporary feeling of anxiety or sociability, are known as states. In principle, states may refer to any reliably measurable characteristic, but, typically, state variables refer to conscious, verbally reportable qualities such as moods.",

      "abstract": "&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Emotions which are considered as a basic factor of all relationships 1are very powerful and to a very great extent they control our behaviour, thoughts and all other aspects of life. The behaviour and thought processes are directly influenced by the past experiences and early developmental stages. Emotion is the feeling aspect of consciousness characterized by a physical aspect like physical arousal, behaviours that reveal emotion to the outside world, and an inner awareness of feelings. Healthy emotions motivate us and give us energy for appropriate action. Unhealthy emotions are either overly intense or suppressed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt; Smiston in 1974 defined “Emotional maturity is a process in which the personality is continuously striving for greater sense of emotional health, both intra-physically and intra-personally” (as cited in Singh &amp;amp; Bhargava, 1990). Kaplan and Baron describes a emotionally mature person as having the capacity to withstand delay in satisfaction of needs, ability to tolerate a reasonable amount of frustration, has belief in long-term planning and is capable of delaying or revising expectations in terms of demands of situation, has capacity to make effective adjustment with themselves, members of family, his peers in the school, society and culture. Maturity is not only the capacity for these attitudes and functioning but also it is the ability to enjoy them fully (as cited in Singh &amp;amp; Bhargava, 1990). According to Hollingworth (1928) an emotionally mature person will be capable of responding in gradation or degree of emotional responses, he does not respond in all or none fashion, but keeps within bounds. He will be able to delay his responses as controlled with the impulsiveness of young child. And he will also be able to handle self-pity (as cited in Singh &amp;amp; Bhargava, 1990).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

      "abstract": "The body's internal timekeeping system is an under-recognized but highly influential force in behaviors and emotions including anger and reactive aggression. Predictable cycles or rhythms in behavior are expressed on several different time scales such as circadian (circa diem, or approximately 24-hour rhythms) and infradian (exceeding 24 hours, such as monthly or seasonal cycles). The circadian timekeeping system underlying rhythmic behaviors in mammals is constituted by a network of clocks distributed throughout the brain and body, the activity of which synchronizes to a central pacemaker, or master clock. Our daily experiences with the external environment including social activity strongly influence the clock mechanism operates at the level of our genes, but its exact timing of this network is synchronized by our experiences with the external environment including social activity. In the present review, we examine evidence from a number of species and propose that anger and reactive aggression interact in multiple ways with circadian clocks. Specifically, we argue that i) there are predictable rhythms in the expression of aggression and anger, ii) disruptions of the normal functioning of the body clock circadian system increase the likelihood of aggressive behaviors, and iii) conversely, chronic expression of anger can disrupt normal rhythmic cycles of physiological activities and create conditions for pathologies such as cardiovascular disease to develop. Taken together, these observations suggest that a comprehensive perspective on anger and reactive aggression must incorporate an understanding of the role of the body circadian timing system in these intense affective states.",

Comfort is a basic component of well-being, commonly expressing a state or situation in which one is relaxed without any unpleasant feelings caused by external factors. It is conditioned by how human activities are performed, as comfort level may foster or hamper people performing their tasks due to the effects of human physiological and psychological perceptions and reactions to different situations and environmental conditions. Thermal comfort is defined as a condition of the mind and is influenced by a host of individual differences. Auditory environment influences hearing of occupants and their overall comfort, including their physical and mental health, performance, and overall satisfaction.

Consequently, it is simpler to think of deviance as occurring in one of two ways in a social system—the extent to which behaviors are missing that facilitate the achievement of the system goals and the degree to which behavior is present that disrupts or works against the system goals. The anomie-deviance hypothesis is about steady state behavior, the stable rates that occur after people have had a chance to learn what reinforcement contingencies are in effect in a social system. In the short run, people may be inaccurate about reinforcement contingencies. Hamblin, et al. shows that deviant behavior is routinely supported by pathogenic exchanges. A deviant person regularly outwits the other, who inadvertently rewards him or her for behavior to the other.",

Man conceives of himself and passes judgment on himself in three different ways: in each of his acts, taken separately; in his being as a whole, as a person; and in the complete development of his life, his entire existence including its termination. The justification of the whole life is of concern primarily to one who feels it has come to an end, either because he considers the active period of his life to have ceased or because he is confronted with death.

Existential humility includes holding cherished beliefs regarding the meaning of life and death loosely enough to revise in light of evidence, as well as lower defensiveness following existential threats or reminders. We discuss the broader personality structure IH and EH, focusing on the Big Five factor of agreeableness as well as narcissism. We propose that the most diagnostic situations of the existence of intellectual humility – heretofore rare in the empirical literature – are in the realm of existential beliefs. Moving from existential arrogance to humility may require substantial self-change, though transcendent situations such as flow experiences, awe (e.g., wondrous vistas in nature), meditation, or even experience with psychedelics may be viable pathways toward greater existential humility.",

Structuring historical memories connects to an area of algebra called global semigroup theory, which allows one to construct expressions in ’algebras of time) that can support recording events of fundamental significance to an agent. This may include records of internal changes (e.g. in motivational, goal, emotional, cognitive, body image, perceptual states, knowledge of other entities) as weU as external changes (location, objects or other agents in the environment, physical conditions of local environment) that provide grounding for the representation. The models of change and time selected can be different depending on what is important to the agent. Communicating knowledge of other minds could be modelled in this framework by the passing of algebraic expressions (in a historical ’expanded’ semigroup) which record changes in the life-long learning or experience of another agent. This would correspond to revealing one’s autobiography or, more generally, to telling a story.",

      "abstract": "Stories of loss are often polyvocal, spoken differently from the perspective of the many participants in a grief system, or even from the vantage point of the many voices that issue from a given individual, simultaneously or across time. Disrupted narratives take two forms: those that are chaotic, and those that are conflictual. In both cases, an existing and previously adequate life narrative is challenged by the loss, and ceases to provide a coherent structure for integrating past experience, enacting a meaningful social role in the present, and projecting into the future. Intrapersonal chaos occurs when a loss intrudes into an individual's heretofore coherent story of the self or significant others, in such a way that it cannot easily be assimilated. Interpersonal chaos refers to the jarring disruption of a shared or communal narrative that leaves two or more persons struggling to make sense of the destabilizing transition, without access to any clear means of doing so.",

      "title": "The Meaning(s) of Sound(s)",
      "abstract": "Abstract The meaning of sound for our lives and actions depends largely on the experience we have had with them, partly also on the context in which they occur. Sound events that humans and other animals can hear on earth are usually created by physical movement in the environment. Meaning implies that at least one (direct) relationship exists between the specific acoustic properties, and the perception of a sound, often associated with a second relationship: the perception of the sound and the identification of its source, e.g., a creaking door. And a third relation is usually associated, too: I like or dislike it (the sound and/or the source). Some relationships are rather trivial and are usually shared by a large cultural community. Other connections apply only in small groups of people (e.g., a neighborhood with a common history), and in extreme cases, only in a single person in a particular situation (e.g., a violin expert testing violins). This chapter starts with what dictionaries say about the word “sound” and the distinction between sound and noise. The next section deals with sounds as source of information. The last section describes the many non-acoustic influences on the meaning of sounds and noise, i.e., physical factors (e.g., color, object size, and motion), and personal factors (e.g., noise sensitivity, personal control, evaluation of the source, trust in the agents responsible, and expectations for the future acoustic development).",

According to Selye (1956) stress has been described as the ‘rate of wear and tear in the body associated with feelings’ that can be as subjective as the responses to pain and pruritus. In his Stress Syndrome or a General Adaptation Syndrome, Selye stressed homeostatis as the goal of the stages of alarm, resistance, and exhaustion. Selye emphasized that ‘stress is not necessarily morbid, could be curative and associated with changes in structure and in chemistry with the body’ attempting to adapt against the stress. Tinnitus is a stress. Tinnitus is a noise in the ear with subjective and objective qualities. It can occur normally in everyone, being invariably transient, without untoward emotional or physical effects. Tinnitus has been described as a buzzing, roaring, hissing, or grinding type of noise, located unilaterally or bilaterally.",

      "abstract": "Chapter 5 addresses how, whether as a general concept or as a feature of psychiatry, ‘change’ remains difficult to define because its meaning is parasitical upon metaphysical categories such as object, event, property, and time. It might be more practical to explore it in relation to specific ontological regions (e.g., physics, biology, and sociology). The biological and social sciences (both relevant to psychiatry) countenance change. The targets of change in psychiatry remain its epistemological structure and its objects. Change can be explored transepistemically by comparing historical narratives of madness or intraepistemically, by detecting variations within a given narrative (e.g., religious, social, or neurobiological). These studies can be value-neutral or value-laden (the latter can be redefined ‘change’ as ‘progress’). ‘Change’ can be accounted for by the Cambridge model of symptom formation. According to this, mental symptoms are events resulting from configuratory action undertaken by sufferers to make sense of (often) distressing information invading their awareness. This information can be biological signals (released by a distressed brain networks) or symbols (resulting from social interaction or personal reflection). Configurators (personal, sociocultural, dialogical, etc.) shape this inchoate information into effable experiences. Due to biological mutation or social change affecting the configurators, mental symptoms are liable to change in time. Hence, the objects of psychiatry are not eternal and will be replaced in the future.",

By “importance” I do not just mean basic survival value, for although we can survive without sight and hearing, and (perhaps with more difficulty) touch, our full engagement with the complex social and cultural world so vital to human flourishing depends on the pre-eminence of these senses. In contrast, although our senses of smell and taste can bring us pleasure, and in certain cases alert us to potential dangers, they can seem much less vital to our existence and well-being, and the pleasures they provide of far less interest and consequence than the objects we contemplate in sight and sound. Hence the scepticism frequently directed, for example, at claims that there can be objective standards of taste, or that food and drink can be genuine or serious objects of aesthetic interest, claims that we shall examine in some detail later.",

      "title": "The modern insurance market",
      "abstract": "A man and his community have long been endangered by various perils threatening to destroy or harm them, jeopardize their life, health or property, questioning even their survival. Various forms of protection being applied had to continuously be improved since there also emerged new hazards or risks. Except for the need to protect their own property from natural disasters or from other people's actions, there appeared the need for protection from the consequences of one's own actions as well, which could cause a damage to other people, but to his/her own goods too. The initial forms of a protection of people affected by the accident (the illness or death of the breadwinner, the emergence of disability, the destruction of property after fire and the like) were the common contributions and the help of the community - a family, village or tribe. In a primitive society, when there was no private property, this problem could not be complex: the destroyed goods were replaced by the newly created ones among the community. In these more or less poorly regulated undertakings can be found certain traces of a modern insurance. The root word of the term insurance is the adjective safe (sicuro in Italian, secures in Latin). An individual's own forces could not provide such a protection. Therefore, very early, during the development of the human society, there arose the idea on the organization of the necessary protection through a mechanism used by the individuals threatened by the same danger. In such a way, those individuals could, through their natural or, later, cash contributions, provide a compensation to those affected by the risk.",

      "title": "Circadian Rhythms and Agitation",
      "abstract": "In mammals, many aspects of physiology vary over the 24-hour day in a predictable, periodic manner. Hormones, such as thyroid-stimulating hormone and melatonin, as well as cardiovascular and autonomic measures such as heart rate, blood pressure, and body temperature all have a predictable diurnal pattern. It is important to understand that such variation is generated internally; that is, such variation represents a fundamental, endogenous circadian variation. Circadian variability is typically distinguished from the numerous exogenous factors that can influence the physiologic parameters in question by its periodic pattern (Turek &amp; Zee, 1999). For example, sleep lowers body temperature, and physical activity, upright posture, food intake, and the state of wakefulness increase body temperature. Such exogenous masking factors can affect body temperature at any point in the 24-hour day. Thus, the behavioral act of going to sleep lowers body temperature, but the fall in body temperature during wakefulness also heralds the onset of sleep and incipient sleepiness. Nonetheless, when all such factors are strictly controlled (by having volunteers confined to supine bed rest with restricted activity, sleep deprivation, hourly isocaloric food intake, and controlled lighting conditions), body temperature continues to oscillate in a highly predictable way, affected only by age, sex, and, perhaps, mental status.",

      "abstract": "There is much to be said in favour of the idea that anticipation and the preemption and deception which it permits play an important role in the social life of both humans and a number of other primates. This idea has been developed anew, particularly for the human case, in a number of different disciplines for a variety of different reasons. Goody (this volume), points to a number of instances, and the list could be extened almost ad nauseam. It ranges from computer scientists proposing plan-construction algorithms and user-modelling procedures for natural language front-ends, to economists speculating on the actions of economic agents planning their moves in the market-place with respect to the actions of others. The scope and explanatory range of this idea in any of these fields has always been questionable. In economics, for example, the very different effects of ignorance, habit and culture on individual choice have often been far greater than those of individual ratiocination. Nevertheless, any area of human activity which involves actual or potential interaction with other humans (and that might mean all of human life) can be seen to have characteristics which reveal an anticipation of how others will view and respond to one's actions.",

Background Homebound persons have a significantly higher mortality risk as well as physical and psychosocial burden. A clarification of the term is necessary to develop preventive measures. Design Concept analysis. Data Sources Scientific literature from electronic databases (CINAHL, Medline via PubMed, PsycINFO, PsycArticles, and Scopus) and definitions from online dictionaries. Review Methods Walker and Avant's method was applied to guide the concept analysis. To prevent arbitrary and empty results in determining the attributes, antecedents, and consequences a thematic analysis was carried out. Results Homebound is defined as an enduring condition in which the life-space is reduced to the home, but moving around in the home is possible (by walking short distances alone or by holding on to furniture, or with the help of a stick, walker, or another person). Homebound has six attributes: in need of help in ADL/IADL and in leaving the life-space, powerlessness, life-space confinement, mobility limitation, endurance, and weakness. Physiological instability and physical immobility are antecedents with wide-ranging influencing factors as illness, complexity, burden, and endogenous/exogenous booster. Homebound has also wide-ranging consequences such as the progression of inactivity, physical, psychosocial, and/or spiritual problems. Conclusions The multidimensional concept of homebound modifies the concepts of mobility and immobility. Given the extensive consequences of homebound nurses play a central role in the prevention.",

Human beings engage in relatively little direct eye‐to‐eye contact. For humans and other animal species, eye behavior plays an important role in survival, reproduction, and building/maintaining social and role relationships. Being watched is as important as watching others. As the target of another's eye gaze, a person's performance is infused with significance – in either positive or negative ways. Because of its importance to human interaction, people are sensitive to the absence of gaze when it is expected and its presence when it is not. We often perceive eye‐to‐eye contact when the eyes are actually tracking many points around the area of the eyes.",

      "abstract": "Regret, like guilt and fear, seems in a fundamental respect different from such emotions as amusement and disgust. Whereas amusement presents itself as a response to some sui generis form of value, the funny, regret seems to concern something with which we're already deeply concerned, quite independently of our tendencies to regret. What we regret, paradigmatically, are our bad choices or actions: Our mistakes, in a word. That is not to say that we can only regret mistakes, or only acts we take to be mistaken; but this is clearly the standard case. In the sense of regret on which we will focus here, it involves reproaching oneself for a decision, and it functions to motivate the agent to try to undo the action if possible and to act differently next time. Though it makes sense to lament an unlucky outcome or a poor set of options, if one decided well then regret would be inapt (though not impossible) to feel. Regret seems to be about something even a rational but disaffected alien, who was immune to regret, would care about: roughly, making bad decisions. By contrast, such an alien would have no interest, except perhaps anthropological interest, in the funny or the disgusting. Call this concern for mistakes the intentional aspect of regret.",

      "abstract": "Until the XVIth century, the notion of interest is nearly non existent in the representations of the world and of action. From the XVIth century and during all the XVIIth, it enlarges its uses as far as it becomes the notion we can't avoid nor refute nowadays. Through the study of its most important promoters, from Guichardin to Leibniz, and assuming that its introduction provides a solution that enables them to work out new problems they have to face, this work shows that the notion of interest is not a psychological motivation that would lead to the representation of a selfish man nor to the mere introduction of the utilitarian paradigm. The analysis of its uses (whether it's used to solve economic, moral or political problems), of its objects and subjects, of its qualities (either descriptive or normative, either particular or general) and of its ambivalent effects (utility, prejudice), enables to show that its stake is wider, in so far as the modelling of the reality is concerned. Interest works as a principle of action, as a corrective variable. It allows to get the phenomenons under control, to get a phenomenal representation of the relationships between the man and his world around. Its extension leads to an upgrading of tangible world, that gives the representation of value a new start, and appraises them throughout concurrence. Therefore, it takes part in the construction of modernity.",

      "title": "Trauma-related Structural Dissociation of the Personality",
      "abstract": "Abstract Many traumatized individuals alternate between re-experiencing their trauma and being detached from, or even relatively unaware of the trauma and its effects. At first sight one may be inclined to conceptualize detachment from trauma and re-experiencing of trauma as mental states. However, on closer scrutiny it becomes apparent that in both cases a range or cluster of states rather than a singular state is involved. For example, being detached from trauma does not itself exclude being joyful, ashamed, sexually aroused, or curious at times, and re-experiencing trauma can encompass states such as fleeing, freezing, and being in pain or being analgesic. In this paper we relate detachment from trauma and re-experiencing trauma to emotional operating systems (Panksepp, 1998) and functional systems (Fanselow &amp; Lester, 1988), briefly addressed as action systems. Action systems control a range of functions, but some are more complex than others. Reexperiencing trauma will be associated with the inborn and evolutionary derived defensive system that is evoked by severe threat, in particular threat to the integrity of the body. As a complex system, it encompasses various subsystems, such as flight, freeze, and fight. Detachment from trauma, in our view, is associated with several action systems (Panksepp, 1998), i.e., the ones that control functions in daily life (e.g., exploration of the environment, energy control), and the ones that are dedicated to survival of the species (e.g., reproduction, attachment to and care for offspring). In this context we will maintain that severe threat may provoke a structural dissociation of the premorbid personality (Van der Hart, 2000). In its primary form this dissociation is between the defensive system on one hand, and the systems that involve managing daily life and survival of the species on the other hand. To summarize the essence of the theory of structural dissociation of the personality, we argue (1) that traumatic experiences, especially when they occur early in life and involve severe threat to the integrity of the body, may activate psychobiological action systems that have been developed by evolution, and (2) that due to extreme stress levels and classical as well as evaluative conditioning to traumatic memories these systems may remain unintegrated to varying degrees.",

      "abstract": "Safety disciplines role in the formation of humanitarian profile specialistsThe proportionality between the concepts of safety and danger, depending on which of these concepts is predominant, is a measure of the quality of life of every society.The quality of a person's stay in a particular place is evaluated based on this proportionality.Every democratic society must ensure the safety of all its citizens, including in the context of their work activities.When we use the term \"work activity\", we primarily refer to the classical understanding that it is one of the main forms of human activity aimed at creating material goods such as objects, services, intellectual products, or artistic creations, such as by a dancer, artist, or other creative professional.Here is the key moment that concerns everyone, regardless of the realm in which a person works and what he or she does, he or she may be subject to the same harmful or dangerous factors.Safety does not determine whether the person is a humanitarian or a technical specialist; a man or a woman, a child or an adult, because injury, illness, or death can affect everyone.A civilized society is called upon to care about every citizen, but social distribution of duties is envisaged.So, parents take care of their children; healthy people take care of people with disabilities, and the state has undertaken to take care of those people who may lose their ability to work in the process of their work activities through employers.The study of safety disciplines, including such disciplines as \"Fundamentals of Occupational Health and Life Safety,\" \"Occupational Safety,\" \"Life Safety,\" and \"Occupational Safety in Industry\" or \"Professional and Civil Safety,\" implies considering labor relations through the prism of laws and regulatory legal acts.According to the professional classification system [98], humanitarian professions in Ukraine fall under a wide range of areas, as there is no clear definition of which specialties belong to the humanitarians and which professions have a clear humanistic focus.However, professions related to management, education, arts, and other related fields can be considered as part of the humanities.",

It is not an idea or concept, nor a type of action or event. It is a concrete reality, an event; it occurs. Furthermore, it occurs as utterly particular: the self is a particular person, and the face-of-the-other is a particular revelation of a particular person. What is occluded, hidden, or forgotten in our ordinary lives is not some idea or value; it is this presence of the other's face to me – and my responsibility to and for this person. Moreover, this reality or event or encounter, which in a sense is beyond our thinking, our concepts, and our rules, and prior to them, is determinative and unconditional. It is all plea and command, made again and again, in episode after episode. It is not like a single clash that occurred sometime in the past and that is heard only in its continuing echoes; it is more like echoes themselves always present without any such crash or origin.",

      "title": "Face for Interface",
      "abstract": "The human face is involved in an impressive variety of different activities. It houses the majority of our sensory apparatus: eyes, ears, mouth, and nose, allowing the bearer to see, hear, taste, and smell. Apart from these biological functions, the human face provides a number of signals essential for interpersonal communication in our social life. The face houses the speech production apparatus and is used to identify other members of the species, to regulate the conversation by gazing or nodding, and to interpret what has been said by lip reading. It is our direct and naturally preeminent means of communicating and understanding somebody’s affective state and intentions on the basis of the shown facial expression (Lewis &amp; Haviland-Jones, 2000). Personality, attractiveness, age, and gender can also be seen from someone’s face. Thus the face is a multisignal sender/receiver capable of tremendous flexibility and specificity. In general, the face conveys information via four kinds of signals listed in Table 1. Automating the analysis of facial signals, especially rapid facial signals, would be highly beneficial for fields as diverse as security, behavioral science, medicine, communication, and education. In security contexts, facial expressions play a crucial role in establishing or detracting from credibility. In medicine, facial expressions are the direct means to identify when specific mental processes are occurring. In education, pupils’ facial expressions inform the teacher of the need to adjust the instructional message. As far as natural user interfaces between humans and computers (PCs/robots/machines) are concerned, facial expressions provide a way to communicate basic information about needs and demands to the machine. In fact, automatic analysis of rapid facial signals seem to have a natural place in various vision subsystems and vision-based interfaces (face-for-interface tools), including automated tools for gaze and focus of attention tracking, lip reading, bimodal speech processing, face/visual speech synthesis, face-based command issuing, and facial affect processing. Where the user is looking (i.e., gaze tracking) can be effectively used to free computer users from the classic keyboard and mouse. Also, certain facial signals (e.g., a wink) can be associated with certain commands (e.g., a mouse click) offering an alternative to traditional keyboard and mouse commands. The human capability to “hear” in noisy environments by means of lip reading is the basis for bimodal (audiovisual) speech processing that can lead to the realization of robust speech-driven interfaces. To make a believable “talking head” (avatar) representing a real person, tracking the person’s facial signals and making the avatar mimic those using synthesized speech and facial expressions is compulsory. The human ability to read emotions from someone’s facial expressions is the basis of facial affect processing that can lead to expanding user interfaces with emotional communication and, in turn, to obtaining a more flexible, adaptable, and natural affective interfaces between humans and machines. More specifically, the information about when the existing interaction/processing should be adapted, the importance of such an adaptation, and how the interaction/ reasoning should be adapted, involves information about how the user feels (e.g., confused, irritated, tired, interested). Examples of affect-sensitive user interfaces are still rare, unfortunately, and include the systems of Lisetti and Nasoz (2002), Maat and Pantic (2006), and Kapoor, Burleson, and Picard (2007). It is this wide range of principle driving applications that has lent a special impetus to the research problem of automatic facial expression analysis and produced a surge of interest in this research topic.",

      "title": "Embodied Memory, Transcendence, and Telling: Recounting Trauma, Re-establishing the Self",
      "abstract": "Embodied Memory, Transcendence, and Telling: Recounting Trauma, Re-establishing the Self Roberta Culbertson (bio) Memory and Silence Naive public conceptions of memory, and the attendant assumption that memory takes certain forms and not others, contribute to a curious circumstance surrounding the victimized survivor of violence. The survivor most often, nearly invariably, becomes silent about his victimization, though the experience nevertheless in every case remains somehow fundamental to his existence, and to his unfolding or enfolded conception of himself. This silence is an internal one in which the victim attempts to suppress what is recalled (so as not to relive the victimization countless times), or finds it repressed by some part of himself which functions as a stranger, hiding self from the self’s experience according to unfathomable criteria and requirements. It is external as well: the victim does not tell what she recalls, in part because others do not seem to hear what is said, partly out of a conviction that she will not be believed, and more basically because she simply cannot make the leap to words: “If you were not there, it is difficult to describe or say how it was. It sounds very, very, very. . . . I don’t know if there is [a] word to describe the nightmare one go through . . . how men function under such a stress is one thing, and then how you communicate and express [to] somebody who never knew that such a degree of brutality [is] existing seems like a fantasy.” 1 Yet despite this silence, the momentous nature of threats and harm to the body dictates that violence and trauma nevertheless leave the survivor preoccupied with the memory of it, which itself seems both absent and entirely too present. Most disturbingly, bits of memory, flashing like clipped pieces of film held to the light, appear unbidden and in surprising ways, as if possessed of a life independent of will or consciousness. These undeniable presences nevertheless have an aura of unbelievability: though presenting themselves as clearly past, real, and fully embodied, they appear in nonnarrative forms that seem to meet no standard test for truth or comprehensibility. Survivor writings make it clear that to be a survivor of one’s violation [End Page 169] is precisely this: to live with the paradox of silence and the present but unreachable force of memory, and a concomitant need to tell what seems untellable. 2 The paradox is based in more than simply the difficulty of reporting events that listeners would rather not hear or believe, or which are too different to be grasped. It is the paradox of a known and felt truth that unfortunately obeys the logic of dreams rather than of speech and so seems as unreachable, as other, as these, and as difficult to communicate and interpret, even to oneself. It is a paradox of the distance of one’s own experience. No experience is more one’s own than harm to one’s own skin, but none is more locked within that skin, played out within it in actions other than words, in patterns of consciousness below the everyday and the constructions of language. Trapped there, the violation seems to continue in a reverberating present that belies the supposed linearity of time and the possibility of endings. It at once has a certain pastness, is a sort of “memory-knowledge” as Mary Warnock would call it, and is not past, not “memory”—that is, a personal, narrated account of something completed, locatable in time—at all. Perhaps it is not even remembered, but only felt as a presence, or perhaps it shapes current events according to its template, itself unrecognized. 3 The demands of narrative for their part operate in fact as cultural silencers to this sort of memory, descending immediately upon an experience to shape notions of legitimate memory, and silencing the sort of proto-memory described. We lose sight of the body’s own recall of its response to threat and pain, and of the ways in which it “speaks” this pain, because this wordless language is unintelligible to one whose body is not similarly affected, and because without words the experience has a certain shadowy quality, a paradoxical...",

Each actuality belonging to an experience is in coordinative proportionality to the preceding and succeeding ones, i.e. in kinesthetic (position), static (strength) and topic (direction) proportionality; as a result, the individual successive stages of each experience are related to one another and, in addition, the start and end stages of each experience to the end stage of the previous one or the start stage of the next one in a coordinative way, specific to each. Like the total actuality, their coordinative symbol components are specific (corresponding to the coordinative adjustments of the actual thought cell); so the structure of each experience is also specific; it corresponds to the associative series of the actual thought cells (to the structure) and thus to the constitution of the experiencing individual, which can also be called its structure. The hunger actualities are arranged in a wide circle and the anxiety actualities in a narrower one; pain actualities are in twists, sorrow actualities are in short straight lines and joy actualities in long ones. Each experience consists of round and straight series, and the change from round to straight is the threshold.",

POR EJEMPLO, LOS DISTURBIOS OCURRIDOS POR TURNOS DE TRABAJO O VUELOS TRANSMERIDIANOS FRECUENTES PUEDEN RESULTAR EN UNA DESINCRONIZACION INTERIOR QUE A VECES CONLLEVA A ENFERMEDADES O ACCIDENTES GRAVES. AFIRMO LO ANTERIOR HANS G.

      "abstract": "The health of servicemen is not only a medical and biological category, but also a psychological and social one. Performance of the military personnel of the biological and social functions can be interpreted as manifestations of health. From the correspondence of life attitudes, claims and manifestations of health, one or another degree of well being-physical, mental and social-is formed. In this regard, it can be argued that the health of the soldier is a complex medical, psychological and social phenomenon and its preservation should be carried out from a systemic perspective at these levels. The concept of “health” does not have a universally accepted unified interpretation, is characterized by the ambiguity and heterogeneity of the composition. According to the definition that was given in the preamble of the Charter of the World Health Organization (WHO) in 1948, health is a condition of a person who is characterized not only by the absence of diseases or physical defects, but also complete physical, mental and social well-being. It can be concluded that health is an integral characteristic that reflects the influence of various conditions (both external and internal environment) on the success of adaptation and professional activities of military personnel. The health of a serviceman is a complex medical-psychological-social phenomenon, and its preservation should be carried out from systemic positions at the indicated levels.",

Individual death is only an element in the endless chain which is life. An individual can disappear, but the species continues, despite everything, to carry on. The author specifies that the fear of death enters in the health education domain; this is in the back of our anxieties and shapes our way of confronting life and our attitudes when dealing with others.

This is a dramatic example of a situation that people face every day. An encounter with a beggar on the street, a request to give blood, or a call from a friend who is lonely or depressed—each is a situation in which someone can do something to benefit someone else. Such activity may be termed positive social action. Such acts as donating money or goods to charity, cooperating with others in carrying out a project, and doing favors for a person in need are typical examples of positive social action. Behavior of this kind may be contrasted with antisocial action, such behavior as aggression, destruction, and selfishness. Some theorists use the term prosocial behavior to stress the contrast with antisocial behavior. Other theorists prefer to use the term altruism, to emphasize the element of selflessness that exists in many helping situations. Altruism is action that benefits other people and is carried out with no expectation of external reward. Whatever words are used and with whatever emphasis, however, such action is worth investigating because it is deemed morally admirable and also contributes to the survival of society (Poplawski, 1985). Most people admire the individual who makes sacrifices so that others may benefit, and probably everyone agrees that society would be better off if everyone were less self-centered.",

      "title": "Human infants are aroused and concerned by moral transgressions",
      "abstract": "Humans reason and care about ethical issues, such as avoiding unnecessary harm. But what enables us to develop a moral capacity? This question dates back at least to ancient Greece and typically results in the traditional opposition between sentimentalism (the view that morality is mainly driven by socioaffective processes) and rationalism [the view that morality is mainly driven by (socio)cognitive processes or reason]. Here, we used multiple methods (eye-tracking and observations of expressive behaviors) to assess the role of both cognitive and socioaffective processes in infants’ developing morality. We capitalized on the distinction between moral (e.g., harmful) and conventional (e.g., harmless) transgressions to investigate whether 18-mo-old infants understand actions as distinctively moral as opposed to merely disobedient or unexpected. All infants watched the same social scene, but based on prior verbal interactions, an actor’s tearing apart of a picture (an act not intrinsically harmful) with a tool constituted either a conventional (wrong tool), a moral (producing harm), or no violation (correct tool). Infants’ anticipatory looks differentiated between conventional and no violation conditions, suggesting that they processed the verbal interactions and built corresponding expectations. Importantly, infants showed a larger increase in pupil size (physiological arousal), and more expressions indicating empathic concern, in response to a moral than to a conventional violation. Thus, infants differentiated between harmful and harmless transgressions based solely on prior verbal interactions. Together, these convergent findings suggest that human infants’ moral development is fostered by both sociocognitive (inferring harm) and socioaffective processes (empathic concern for others’ welfare).",

      "abstract": "Evacuation remains one of the main public protection strategies in response to a man-made or natural incident when people are at risk. In most cases when an evacuation is required, it indicates the presence of danger and urgency. By instinct, people affected act to escape from the danger; thus, two typical phenomena often occur during an evacuation: competitive behavior and herding behavior (Festinger, 1954). If people perceive a threat and are trapped at an incident site, they try to get out as soon as possible. Usually, they look for exit signs or evacuation routes that can lead them to a safer place and proceed to the nearest one. For people near the exit or route entrance, moving toward the exit or entering the evacuation route may be the only likely escape choice. Thus, two forms of competitive behavior may exist simultaneously: the effort to pass through the exit (or enter the route) as quickly as possible, and the effort among those at risk to run toward the exits. Such behavior may cause congestion at the exits or entrance points, even to the point that people may crush one another. The India stampede event on January 26, 2005, is just such a tragedy. According to media reports (BBC, 2005; CNN, 2005), a screaming crowd fled down narrow walkways chaotically when fires broke out, causing many people to be crushed and resulting in 250 deaths.",

This includes claims for anthropological harm that conflate the actions of particular individuals with the discipline. Alongside the potential harm in blaming anthropology, indiscriminately, a form of public anthropology may be gleaned: a mandate emerges to attend to spaces which presage this furore. The discipline is being ‘re-tasked’ robustly with its own huge remit to avoid damage in the studies of all peoples. This is extended to detrimental spaces that are revealed in academia, structural or evident, for which anthropology must be made to take culpability, particularly so in certain contemporary high-profile incidents.",

In any assessment of welfare, it is these feelings that should be assessed. Because feelings are subjective, they cannot be investigated directly. However, there are indirect methods by which animals can be 'asked' what they feel about the conditions under which they are kept and the procedures to which they are subjected. These methods involve preference tests, followed up by motivational tests to assess how important the animal's choice is. Measurements of impaired biological functioning, particularly those connected to decreased health and increased physiological stress responses, can provide good corroborating evidence that welfare is compromised.",

Care recipients are typically people who could not flourish without it, such as the very young or ill. Another meaning of 'care' is that it is a motivation based on concern for someone or something outside of oneself. There is a general sense that 'care activities' are of highest quality when accompanied by, and motivated by, authentic emotional commitments, or 'caring feelings'.1How does caring figure into economic life? From the viewpoint of orthodox neoclassical economics, it does not figure in at all. From this viewpoint, economics is centrally defined around the topics of (i) markets in which the goods and services are exchanged for money and (ii) the choice behavior of the rational, autonomous, self-interested agents thought to populate these markets. 'Economic man' then, is imagined as a creature who neither needs care nor has any responsibility or motivation to provide it. The model of the economy that, in theory, is created by these creatures is often taken as an accurate portrayal of real-world capitalism and a simple description of a heartlessness that is presumed to be of its essence. As a result, over the centuries, many supporters for a more caring economy have called for the dismantling of individualist capitalism in favor of a more solidaristic state socialism and/or local, nonprofit familial and community systems of cooperation and sharing.",

And we may well begin to wonder whether we can ever really know what someone else thinks and feels. After all, when we ascribe thoughts and feelings to another person, it seems that all we have by way of supporting evidence is what we observe, namely his external behaviour. But how can we know in the case of someone else which outward behaviour patterns are signs of which inner states? Perhaps the similarity of his behaviour to our own may lead us to conjecture that he thinks and feels as we do; but are we ever really entitled to be sure what is going on in his mind?",

      "abstract": "Psychiatry as a branch of medicine greatly differs from other branches regarding the fact that this is the only branch that applies forced therapeutic methods. Aggression is the act directed towards the other person or towards oneself and it can be verbal, physical or sexual. Aggressive behaviour is related to any kind of threatening behaviour, no matter whether the aggression was expressed verbally, shown physically or if there is a clear aggressive intention or physical behaviour which currently injures or harms the aggressive person, other persons or belongings.\r\n Towards the patient whose psychological condition seems to be followed by extreme agitation and aggression and who, by his behaviour, causes danger for himself and the environment, we apply protocol measures of one’s control in the form of constraining bands, fixation by magnetic belts, or by separation into an isolation room. Taking into consideration that there is not a scientifically-based argument for choosing one forced method as more competent than the others, its choice depends on cultural and traditional constitution of the society in which it is applied. Usage of physical force as an intervention in psychiatry dates back from the very beginning, that is from the conception of care for the mentally ill persons. It is still one of basic methods in psychiatric work. By its work a nurse has to protect patients’ and their interests, as well as themselves. By conducting measures and elaborated protocols unwanted situations and incidents which could result in worsening health condition and sometimes even death, are being prevented. Forcing measures should be used only when de-escalation was not successful, apropos when it is the only way for preventing aggressive behaviour. During the period of conducting procedure, medical staff takes care about security and respecting the patients’ rights and uses force just enough that is necessary to neutralize threatening behaviour.\r\n After applying forcing measures, in a standard procedure and with the presence of a department chief, it is necessary to analyse samples and to reconstruct the beginning of a conflict, early escalation signs, taken measures, potential errors and all the other circumstances. Therapist-patient relationship appeared to be a risk factor and protective factor in both increasing and decreasing risk. Creating supportive environment on a workplace can reduce aggression and psychological trauma, reduce sick leaves and enable worker to feel safe at work.",

      "abstract": "The notion that the development of certain gastrointestinal disorders and diseases can, at least in part, be ascribed to specific psychological characteristics of the patient, to an antecedent psychologically important event or to an unconscious conflict, is very popular both in the public and the medical profession. One of its earliest formulations was the conversion theory forwarded by Sigmund Freud, who assumed that the accumulation of a traumatic and unabreacted quota of affect induced defense or repression and caused a somatic conversion of emotion, i.e., a transformation into bodily symptoms. Subsequently, disorders such as globus sensation, diffuse oesophageal spasms and achalasia, the latter misconceived as \"cardiospasm\", were viewed as conversion symptoms. However, it has become clear that these disorders are the consequence of organic lesions and not of conversion. Similarly, concepts of an aetiological role of a specific psychological factor, a specific conflict, of certain affective states or live events and of \"inappropriate perpetuations of organ reactions adaptive to, or protective against, some stress in human life\" could not be verified. Although psychological characteristics and states have been shown to affect normal gastrointestinal function, there is no evidence to suggest that such influences can lead to gastrointestinal disorders or diseases. The fact that the validity of the concepts claiming such aetiological relationships remained to be tested has been repressed to such an extent in some quarters that these concepts still are advocated so as if they had been proven since long.",

      "title": "The value of animal life: how should we balance quality against quantity?",
      "abstract": "Abstract In many situations choices must be made that will have an impact on the welfare of companion animals. Often one of the options will be to euthanase the animal in question. The way in which one views this option will depend not only on one's assessment of the quality of the animal's life (or the lives of other affected parties), but also on how one values an animal life as such. Clearly, a companion animal may be valued by a human being or by another animal. A dog's death may affect its owner's quality of life (QoL), or it may affect the QoL of other animals in the household. But does the life of an animal have any value other than that? Is anything lost, for example, when a dog that lived with a sole owner, now deceased, is euthanased? Conversely, would anything be gained if the dog were re-homed (apart from the potentially positive contribution to the new owners' QoL)? More generally, in prolonging, or refraining from ending, the life of an animal, is it thereby ensured that something of value persists? There seem to be three main views on this matter. The first is that animal life has no value in itself. The second is that animal life has value to the extent that the life in question is worth living for the animal. The third view is that the life of an animal has a value that exceeds what is ‘in it’ for the animal in question. The view one accepts here will have a dramatic impact on one's attitude to many of the choices to be made about the treatment of companion animals — choices in which one must balance quality of life against, as it were, quantity of life. So the heart of the matter is not only quality of life. It is also value of life. Unfortunately it may prove much more difficult to agree about the value of animal life than it is to agree about the significance of animal welfare.",

      "title": "Natural Duties and the Duty to Obey the Law",
      "abstract": "The failure of Transactional and Associative theories to explain the source of a general duty to obey domestic law pushes us to explore other possibilities. In particular, since the moral duty to obey seems to many a relatively basic, natural, nonvoluntary feature of social life, it seems initially promising to suppose that the moral principle that accounts for this duty belongs to that group of principles that specifies our natural moral duties. Natural Duty theories of the duty to obey the law, as we have seen, are those that ground our duty to obey not in who we are (as in Associative accounts) or in what we've done or enjoyed (as in Transactional accounts), but rather either (a) in the moral importance of advancing some impartial moral good or (b) in some moral duty thought to be owed by all persons to all others as moral equals, regardless of roles, relationships, or transactions. Thus, the natural duty in question, from which the duty to obey is to be derived, could be a consequentialist moral duty to promote or maximize the occurrence of some good property or state of affairs – such as happiness (utility, preference satisfaction, etc.), moral perfection, or justice.",

      "title": "The power of stigma.",
      "abstract": "Stigma is a very powerful mechanism. It is the expression of an old coping strategy sometimes very efficient for survival. It serves to identify, and to do it forever, a danger. In order to do so, a characteristic of the danger becomes a distinctive mark, or the bearer is marked, often forcefully.\r\n\r\nStigma is the consequence of prejudice and prejudice is detriment or damage, caused to a person by judgement or action in which his/her rights and dignity are disregarded. Prejudice leads to action, and this action is to stigmatise.\r\n\r\nStigma is a brand. To brand is to mark indelibly as a sign of quality. To brand is also to impress indelibly on one's memory, therefore the stigma is both in the stigmatised person and in the stigmatising one.\r\n\r\nStigma comes from the Greek word στγμα, 'mark', which is related to the word στζeιυ, i.e., to tattoo, to prick, to puncture. In Latin it became instigare, 'to urge'; therefore, stigma also leads to action, and this action is discrimination against the stigmatised person. To discriminate is to make adverse distinctions with regards to those stigmatised, and to make distinctions prejudicial to people different from oneself (in race, colour, or sanity). Here the vicious circle is closed, because discrimination leads to prejudice, prejudice to stigma and stigma to discrimination.\r\n\r\nAnimals too stigmatise. Especially those living in woods mark their territory with signals on trees. Birds too mark their territory with their singing, but the closest to human beings is the cat. Allow me an anecdote. Nisse da Silveira, a Brazilian psychiatrist, devoted her life to the study of the artistic production of mentally ill patients, mainly those with chronic schizophrenia. She worked in the Rio de Janeiro Mental Hospital, which at her time was crowded with cats. She was very fond of them and one day she compared them to me with her patients. Cats rub themselves against human beings, leaving in them the odor of glands they have along their neck. The odor depends on which part of the neck they use to rub, and there are odors for friends and others for enemies. Once a cat has identified a person as a friend or enemy, the odor embedded on him or her marks this person forever. The same happens with patients with schizophrenia. Nisse told that if someone is recognised as a threat and forms part of the delusions of a patient, he or she will remain so forever. The opposite is true also.\r\n\r\nThis anecdote reveals two important things. First, the mark is embedded on the subject, and from then on it stays there. The 'marker', the stigmatising person, loses the control of the situation, which from then on is imposed on him. Efforts to remove the mark will lead to make it more prominent and to acquire other negative elements.\r\n\r\nThe second point is that the response to stigma is stigma; stigma is given back as stigma. Cats, and patients with schizophrenia, stigmatise people and are, specially patients, stigmatised themselves. This fact is so prominent and relevant that once I thought of writing a paper entitled Schizophrenia or stigmophrenia. The behavior of stigmatising normal persons towards patients with schizophrenia is the same that patients have towards their delusions. In both cases it consists of something which is experienced as imposed, self-evident, full in certainty, irrefutable to a logical line of argument, as in the old definition of delusion.\r\n\r\nThis is not new. In the late 1960s, Siegle and Osmond (1) described the models of madness, that is, the basic approaches to conceptualise madness. They described seven of them: medical, psychoanalytic, moral, familiar, social, psychedelic and conspirational. Then, the anthropologist Hsu (2) commented that curiously enough, those same models shape the delusions of patients. The consequence is that, when confronted with madness, the one which may afflict oneself or the one perceived in others, the answers are the same.\r\n\r\nThe Spanish psychiatrist Sarro (3) devoted his life to study the contents of delusions. He came to the conclusion that delusions are built with the same elements as myths. In total there are 24 themes of delusions and of myths (mitologemas in Sarro's words), and all of them are an explanation to the basic facts of life: birth, death, transitions, gender, and so on. The confrontation with madness is terrible indeed. Madness is conceived as the loss of one's own mind, and this is the source of great anxiety. Fear of dying and the fear of losing the mind are the two basic forms of anxiety (4), because they are the expression of the fear of ceasing to exist, physically or mentally. Anxiety sets up coping mechanisms, not all of them adaptive. The psychologist Kunz (5), many years ago, tried to find a normal mental phenomenon which had the structure of delusions. He found one, the idea of death. Unable to experience death without dying and full of fear of the unavoidable fact, human beings tend to externalise it, to objectify it, to deny it, the same mechanisms which are present in delusions.\r\n\r\nPsychiatry has done a great effort to delineate normal from abnormal mental events, following the path of the rest of medical disciplines. At the end, psychiatry has been able to identify the symptoms of madness, something essential in order to reach a diagnosis and to take decisions on the best therapeutic options. But this should not lead to abandon another, essential, perspective, which is to delve into the meaning of psychiatric disturbances and to look for common structures with normal mental phenomena. This is a way to understand underlying adaptive mechanisms.\r\n\r\nThe prevailing notion that delusions have a structure different from normal thinking was recently challenged. For instance, Hillman (6) and Blankenburg (7), among others, have reached the conclusion that this is not the case. If the difference does not lie in the structure of the delusions, if both patients with delusions and the rest of us use the same procedures to grasp reality, to build the world in which we live and to endow it with meanings, stigma becomes an essential aspect of mental diseases. Therefore, the fight against stigma becomes an essential part of the fight against mental diseases. It is not just the need to overcome barriers for care, it is essential to recover mental health. In other words, the barriers that sane, including psychiatrists, build to protect themselves against insanity are barriers that the insane has to overcome to recover his or her sanity.",

      "title": "Public mental health--what is to be done?",
      "abstract": "Mental health has been an integral part of an individual's well-being, although there have been difficulties in defining it and in whether mental illness should be seen as the opposite end of this spectrum. Sartorius (1) defined mental health as a state of the organism which allows the full performance of all its functions or as a state of balance within oneself and between an individual and his or her physical, social (and cultural) environment. Another definition used is absence of disease. However, the key is that an individual must be able to function well and in so doing meet the needs of food, shelter, survival, and so forth. (2) Mental health is related to feelings of self-worth and contributes to self-esteem. As such mental health is a mixture of physical, social, and psychological well-being. Interactions between the individual and that person's immediate family and peers and society at large will allow him or her to function effectively and successfully. Bhugra et al (3) noted that mental health is about a state of equipoise, where the individual is at peace with themself, functions effectively socially, and is able to look after his or her needs. Psychiatry has often focused too much on mental illness and not enough on mental health. Training both at undergraduate and postgraduate levels may cover some aspects of preventive and social medicine, but often does not deal with mental health and well-being. We ignore the interaction between physical and mental health at our peril. There is ample evidence that co-morbidity of physical and mental illness can diminish overall prognosis. Positive mental health can result in better educational attainment, greater productivity, reduced mortality, and reduced risk behaviours. (4) The relationship between mental health promotion and prevention of mental ill health is important. Clinicians are trained in managing mental illness and mental ill health. The challenge is to encourage them to lead on prevention. Mental ill health poses a considerable imposition on society directly and indirectly. In the United Kingdom, for example, mental ill health accounts for 22.8% of total disease burden, compared to 15.9% on cancer and 16.2% on cardiovascular disease, and the economic cost of mental illness is 105 [pounds sterling] billion in England alone. (4) The case for prevention is significant not only for economic reasons but for the functioning of society as a whole. There is evidence to indicate that the burden of mental illness cannot be reduced simply by treating mentally ill individuals. (5) It has been argued that the only sustainable method of reducing the burden of disease is prevention. (6) We know that half of lifetime mental illnesses (except dementia) starts by the age of 14 years and 75% by the mid-20s. (7,8) Risk factors for mental ill health in adulthood date back to childhood where these factors can be divided into those relating to the child, those relating to the family, and those related to the household itself. Maternal stress, substance abuse during pregnancy, child (physical, sexual and emotional) abuse, lone parents, low income, poor housing, overcrowding, debt, violence, unemployment, and other factors all play a role. Looked-after children (those in care), the elderly, women, lesbians/gay/bisexual and transgender (LGBT) people, and prisoners are all at a higher risk of developing mental ill health. Mental health and physical health should be promoted together and not in isolation from each other. Mental health promotion can be focused on societies and families as well as on individuals. Individuals must develop the personal ability to deal with the social environment and that subject's internal world. The entire population as a whole should be seen as the base of a pyramid. Most individuals will seek help from their personal, social and folk sector in the first instance. A small proportion will seek help in primary care and of these only a few may be referred on to secondary care. …",

      "abstract": "Individuals’ interaction with the external world is almost always influenced by their clothing, whether through personal choice, their “habitus”, dress codes, etc., through shaping how other view/interact with them, influencing their understanding of their identity, and conversely of influencing how others view them though how they dress. As a result of this, different clothing styles can evoke different connotations based on the viewers assumption of the ideals of the groups or contexts that the wearer’s clothing connects them to, such as formal office dress and LGBTQ+ fashions, whether by choice or by pressure. Also, through dress individuals can internalize these ideals of the group, to influence their view of themselves, and in turn how they interact with the outside world. Furthermore, clothing can also highlight a person’s individuality through failure to conform, evoking a different individual-world interaction. Regardless, an individual’s desire to express themselves and externalize the internal can lead to clothing construction or altering to better represent themselves, and/or their relationship to a group.",

      "title": "EVENT: SOME COMMENTS ON ITS POLITICAL IMPLICATION",
      "abstract": "An Event is an Encounter in human life.Social Science, according to what Edgar Morin says in his pioneering article on the Sociology of Event (“Evénement-Sphinx, ” in Communication, No. 18), has been oppressed by obsolete schemes for it relies on only two items of analysis: static Structure and dynamic History. With these archaic schemes, social science is no longer able to analyze the complexities of present-day society. To re-vitalize social science, two mediate items, System and Event, should be added.System is self-regulating, controlled by information-apparatus or culture, existing as it does within a larger Eco-system or Environment.Interactions between System and Eco-system are potential Events. So, Event may be considered the response to challenge, in Toynbee's terms. Responses can be of three types: 1) System is so closed that it shuts out any challenge, or if a challenge filters in, the System is unresponsive. In this case, System is stagnant. 2) If the response proves to be unsuccessful, System is destroyed. 3) Lastly, if System succeeds in achieving a creative response, Learning, Evolution and Development can result. In short, durable change or transformation is brought to the System.Another French theorist, Louis Althusser (“Pour Marx”) writes that the creative response, which can be achieved only by exploring our “collective unconsciousness of depth, ” enables us to solve the problem of “realizing the necessariness of History in our accidentalness.” Here the creative response can be construed as the significant Event in politics, and so we may, to present a hypothesis, apply this idea in exploring the implications of Japanese political tradition.What is the “collective unconsciousness of depth” of Japanese people? Shuzo Kuki, a philosopher who analyzed the implications of Japanese culture in “Ori-ni-Fure-te (Accidental Sayings), ” feels that the essence of Event is an Accidental Encounter between two things and/or persons that gives birth to something new. The Chinese characters are shown because they have the same pronunciation and associated meaning.Furthermore, in our own language, politics is literally called the Festival-Event (matsurigoto). According to sociologist, Kazuko Tsurumi, who explores the modernizing capacities of Kunio Yanagita's study of Japanese folklore in her “Hyohaku-to-Teiju-to (Vagrancy and Settlement), ” the festival (matsuri) is an Encounter between the settled people and the vagrants. This Event has a vitalizing effect on an otherwise static social life.In Japan, one of the most conspicuous recent phenomena is the increased population of Danchi, collective housing areas. Here the temporary inhabitants of Danchi once again embody the idea of an Encounter between the settled and the vagrant, as seen in the Matsuri concept above. Again, this form of temporary residence is expressed with the Chinese character, which has the same pronunciation as and.Moreover, these Danchi residents are assuming a large part of the responsibility for the “citizens” or “tenants” campaigns in Japanese politics. These campaigns are sowing seeds which could grow to have a long-range effect on maintaining and improving the quality of human life in post-industrial Japan.If this hypothesis or expectation is justified, the Encounter embodied by the political role of Danchi residents could result in the most significant Event in human history.",

      "title": "Twórczość jako źródło kultury",
      "abstract": "Creativity as the source of culture In this paper the author presents human creativity as the main source of culture. Logically, it comes even from the definition of culture, understood as everything created by men (everything, which does not belong to nature). Creation by man includes the material, symbolic and societal types of culture. In the field of symbolic culture, like art, science or media, the process of creativity includes activities which result in new and valuable products. Creativity develops in the private, social and cultural domains. In the private domain an individual creates something, which is new and valuable for himself (or herself). In the social domain an individual creates something, which is new and valuable to a group, where he or she belongs. Finally, creativity in the cultural domain means creating something, which is new and valuable for all human culture. Normally it is possible through the publication or public presentation of a product, after a process of selection. Thus, normally there exists a barrier of entering this main. Creativity in the domain of culture requires not only being a creative person in the psychological sense, but also a huge amount of knowledge and practice in the specific field of activity. But by enhancing the private and social creativity, it is possible to enlarge the number of persons, which could inspire to enter the domain of cultural activity. Moreover, the true creative activity always contains the individual, private, authentic internal perspective, and is always directed to some social environment. Also, the new ways of distributing the creative products, like the Internet, makes the barrier to cultural creativity less tight, than they used to be in the past.",

He recalled a theme he first enunciated in his middle 60s, which he spelt out more explicitly in 1930 in his book Civilisation and its Discontents (Freud, 1973). He then wrote: We are threatened with suffering from three directions: from our own body, which is doomed to decay and dissolution and which cannot even do without pain and anxiety as warning signals; from the external world which may rage against us with overwhelming and merciless forces of destruction; and finally from our relations with other human beings. The suffering which comes from this last source is perhaps more painful to us than any other.… Against the suffering which may come upon one from human relationships the readiest safeguard is voluntary isolation, keeping oneself aloof from other people.… There is, indeed, another and better path to happiness — that of becoming a member of the human community.

      "abstract": "In many instances, emotions do not simply happen to people by chance; Often, people actively seek out an emotion by engaging in practices that have culturally evolved to evoke that emotion. Such practices tend to be perpetuated and spread if people want to experience the emotion, like to recall it and tell others about it, want to give the emotion to others and experience it together, and/or regard the emotion as a sign of something wonderful. We illustrate this with a newly delineated emotion, kama muta. Many social practices around the world are structured to evoke kama muta. In those culturally evolved practices, and outside them, what typically evokes kama muta is a sudden intensification of communal sharing, or a sudden shift of attention to a communal sharing relationship. It seems probable that other social-relational emotions are also evoked by sudden changes in relationships or the sudden salience of a relationship. This change or saliencing may be incorporated in social practices that are perpetuated because they evoke the sought-after emotion. We suggest that such practices, as well as sudden changes in relationships that occur elsewhere, are especially promising places to discover social-relational emotions.",

      "abstract": "Expressive behaviour can be considered a subset of behaviour in general for an embodied agent, whether this is a living human, a robot or a graphically embodied synthetic character. We can think of it as that behaviour interpreted by others as directly signalling an affective state. It may be a distinctly produced behaviour, as in facial expression or gesture, but it may also be a behavioural modifier as in posture or tone of voice. Because in principle it tells the observer something about the internal state of the agent, it acts as an additional communication mechanism alongside more externally directed and functional behaviour, whether physical actions or the use of natural language. Indeed it is argued that in the case of humans, around 80% of overall communication comes through these indirect channels (Argyle, 1972).",

      "abstract": "Human behavior, for the purpose of the present study, can conveniently be discussed under three headings: one determined by internal stimuli, e.g., hunger; one determined by stimuli arising from physical objects in the outside world; and one determined by cues emanating from a person's social environment.But we know that behavioral reactions to these stimuli cannot easily be described in terms of elementary stimulus-response patterns such as are being studied by the physiologist.Social interaction and interstimulation are based on highly complex dynamic configurations involving past experiences, present needs and the anticipation of future events.They are the resultants from communications flowing both ways on many levels of interpersonal relationships, including spoken and written words, gestures, unconscious expressive movements as well as a variety of equally unconscious responses to involuntary expressive acts observed in other persons.Stimuli emanating from persons constituting our social environment are of a privileged order.We are more aware of their facial expressions and general demeanor than of similar behavior in people belonging to the anonymous crowd.The infant's first attempts at reality testing are directed toward parental figures or other significant adults.Again, we know that it is the familiar faces of his friends and relations which form the ultimum moriens, as it were, in the general disorganization of the perceptual world of brain injured patients suffering from optical agnosia.Meaning conveyed by such manifestations of personality as non-verbal expressive acts, subtle intonations of voice, etc., is thus endowed with highly specific gestalt character and has a significant effect upon behavior.Indeed, we must assume that the give and take of stimuli operating on this largely unconscious level of ^arts of this article are contained in",

      "abstract": "A Comprehensive Model of Death Anxiety (CMDA) was proposed by Tomer and Eliason. According to this model, death anxiety, defined as fear of death conceptualized as annihilation of the self, is related directly or indirectly to several types of belief: beliefs about the meaningfulness of death (or \"death attitudes\"), beliefs about the self, and beliefs about the world. Death attitudes together with attitudes about the self and the world are hypothesized to influence the level of death anxiety of an individual either directly or indirectly, by affecting death attitudes. Death salience and religiosity may also affect death anxiety directly or indirectly. A strong sense of coherence, a strong internal locus of control, a sense that the world is a just place, and a higher degree of self esteem are likely to reduce death anxiety either by having a direct effect or by affecting one's attitudes about death.",

      "abstract": "Environmental events that impact reproductive success may be called phylogenetically important events (PIEs). Some promote reproductive success, like mates and food; others threaten reproductive success, like predators and injury. Beneficial PIEs induce activities that enhance them, and detrimental PIEs induce activities that mitigate or avoid them. Free‐operant avoidance relies on electric shock as a proxy for injury, a PIE. One theory takes avoidance behavior to be reinforced by its reducing shock rate. A more complete explanation is that avoidance both reduces shock rate and is induced by the PIEs it usually prevents. Shocks received act in concert with shock‐rate reduction, in a feedback system. Four parametric data sets were analyzed to show that avoidance is induced by received shock rate according to power functions. Avoidance is not reinforced at all; avoidance is induced by its failures. Induction explains not only avoidance itself, but also phenomena unique to avoidance, like warmup and effects of unavoidable shock. Induction explains behavior more generally than reinforcement, because induction explains not only food‐maintained operant and nonoperant behavior, but also shock‐maintained behavior, including avoidance. Reinforcement fails to explain behavior when reinforcement is defined as strengthening by consequences. Induction erases the distinction between consequences and antecedents.",

      "abstract": "As shown throughout this volume, metaphors are regularly used to talk and think about experiences that are subjective, complex and sensitive in terms of experiences that are less subjective, simpler and more concrete. Health and illness, and the emotions associated with them, are among the experiences that we often talk about through metaphors. As is the case more generally, these metaphors tend to rely on perceived similarities between different kinds of experiences. For example, the metaphorical use of ‘battle’ in ‘she died after a long battle with cancer’ relies on the perception of a similarity between being ill with cancer and fighting in a war: both experiences are difficult and potentially life-threatening, both require perseverance, and so on. However, as our use of the term ‘perceived’ similarity suggests, metaphors do not reflect objectively given similarities, but can create similarities between unlike things: they can reflect, convey and reinforce different ways of seeing and experiencing different aspects of our lives. In the terms used in Conceptual Metaphor Theory (see Chapter 1), the choice of different source domains ‘frames’ the target domain in different ways, highlighting some aspects and backgrounding others (Lakoff and Johnson 1980; Ritchie 2013).",

This paper documents beliefs in a \"contact-free\" form of contagion whereby an object is thought to inherit the essence of a person when it was designed, but never actually physically touched, by the individual. We refer to this phenomenon as contagion through creative intent or “intention-based contagion” and distinguish it from more traditional forms of contact-based contagion (Studies 1 and 2), as well as alternative mechanisms such as mere association (Studies 2 and 3a). We demonstrate that, like contact-based contagion, intention-based contagion results from beliefs in transferred essence (Study 1) and involves beliefs in transfer of actual properties (Study 4). However, unlike contact-based contagion, intention-based contagion does not appear to be as strongly related to the emotion of disgust (Study 1) and can influence evaluations in auditory as well as visual modalities (Studies 3a–3c).",

      "abstract": "&lt;pre&gt;Every individual must have experienced anxiety, both originating from within the individual and from outside the individual self. If anxiety is excessive, it is very bad for an individual's body, especially after an accident. Nowadays there are phenomena that occur in him that cause anxiety. Anxiety is a condition where a person experiences feelings of anxiety or anxiety and the activity of the autonomic nervous system in responding to an unclear and unspecified threat, and also indicates a state of apprehension or state of worry that complains that something bad is imminent. This can be fatal because the anxious feelings suffered by the individual stem from the loss of meaning in life. &lt;br /&gt;&#x0D; So to overcome the anxiety of death experienced by these individuals, religious counseling is carried out using remembrance. Religious counseling is a help given to a person or a client who has a religious nuance, in order to understand oneself, namely to know oneself, to implement the goals and meaning of life, to form values that hold onto life and to develop as optimal potential as possible. Remembrance is a heart and verbal worship that knows no time limit. &lt;/pre&gt;Therefore, it needs to be instilled in him to be patient in dealing with it, try to be sincere, carry out worship to the Almighty God so that the anxiety of death will recover. The problem with this research is how to overcome anxiety about death after an accident. The purpose of this study was to determine the anxiety of death after an accident with religious counseling using remembrance. This study uses a qualitative research method that uses a case study approach with the subject of one accident victim aged 21 years. The instrument in this study was observation, interviews and client related data. The results of this mini research study state that religious counseling using remembrance can change anxiety about death after an accident.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The Eventive Verbs Of Pie were subdivided into two form/ function categories (albeit all but unmarked by formal differences), namely they were either punctual or durative. (Other terms are encountered for the same concepts.) The distinction hinges on whether the action or event is conceived of as requiring an elapse of time; the membership of a verb in one category or the other is therefore a matter of the meaning of the verb itself: ‘look for’ or ‘travel’ or ‘carve’ are inherently durative; ‘find’ or ‘arrive’ or ‘stab’ are inherently punctual. However, durative events can be conceived of as POINTS in future or past time (Alice traveled in Europe last year, punctual in contradistinction to the durative Alice was traveling in Europe when she met her husband), and punctual notions readily can be used in transferred (figurative) senses which are durative: I’m finding that Howard is possessive is an ordinary kind of sentence, whereas I’m finding a cat under the bed is so odd as to be unprocessable.1",

For the experimenter this poses a number of problems. A subjective experience can be quantified in man but not in experimental animals, because the animal is not able to express its experience in terms that are intelligible to us. However, we can measure the various effects of and reactions to a stimulus which can itself be described as painful on the basis of the effect of that stimulus administered to man. If the observation made is itself an objective observation such as a reaction time or the frequency of firing of a neurone to the noxious stimulus there is no problem until attempts are made to extrapolate the objective observation to the subjective phenomenon of pain. Particularly difficult to evaluate are experiments on animal behaviour in which the behaviour is expressed in anthropomorphic terms. Furthermore, the objective tests, even in man, do not usually assess the quality (degree of unpleasantness), as distinct from the perception or intensity of the pain.",

      "title": "Prosocial primates: selfish and unselfish motivations",
      "abstract": "Non-human primates are marked by well-developed prosocial and cooperative tendencies as reflected in the way they support each other in fights, hunt together, share food and console victims of aggression. The proximate motivation behind such behaviour is not to be confused with the ultimate reasons for its evolution. Even if a behaviour is ultimately self-serving, the motivation behind it may be genuinely unselfish. A sharp distinction needs to be drawn, therefore, between (i) altruistic and cooperative behaviour with knowable benefits to the actor, which may lead actors aware of these benefits to seek them by acting cooperatively or altruistically and (ii) altruistic behaviour that offers the actor no knowable rewards. The latter is the case if return benefits occur too unpredictably, too distantly in time or are of an indirect nature, such as increased inclusive fitness. The second category of behaviour can be explained only by assuming an altruistic impulse, which—as in humans—may be born from empathy with the recipient's need, pain or distress. Empathy, a proximate mechanism for prosocial behaviour that makes one individual share another's emotional state, is biased the way one would predict from evolutionary theories of cooperation (i.e. by kinship, social closeness and reciprocation). There is increasing evidence in non-human primates (and other mammals) for this proximate mechanism as well as for the unselfish, spontaneous nature of the resulting prosocial tendencies. This paper further reviews observational and experimental evidence for the reciprocity mechanisms that underlie cooperation among non-relatives, for inequity aversion as a constraint on cooperation and on the way defection is dealt with.",

The domestic dog shows behavioral patterns proper of this social organization towards the people they live with as they substitute its pack. Hierarchies are established during its growth in which it has to learn its subordinate position under a dominance not always exerted by its owner which gives rise to conflicts such as aggression (4) (5) . When it is manifested, it is described as aggression for dominance. In general, dog owners constitute the group of people more frequently bitten, what can be explained through a higher contact with the animal and their tendency to a lesser avoidance of other people’s dogs and even of dogs without owners (6)",

Although most social scientists have an intuitive sense of what constitutes a riot, the edges of the definition are fuzzy and it can be difficult to determine whether or not some events are actually “riots.” For example, it is agreed that a riot is a collective act. That is, more than one individual must be involved and at least minimally coordinate action in order for a riot to occur. Two people acting together, however, would not constitute a riot, even though it is a collective act of violence. The lower limit for participation, damage, or duration, or a combination of the three, necessary to qualify an event as a riot is ambiguous and disputed, leading many scholars to analyze events called “civil disorders” or “collective violence.” For most, however, unless there are at least 30–50 people involved, the events last more than a few moments, and there is action that could result in property damage or injury requiring medical attention, a riot has not occurred.",

      "title": "The Question of Suffering Confronted by Evolutionary Theology",
      "abstract": "One of the characteristics of the evolutionarily development of nature is the gradual emergence of various reactions as being a response to external stimuli. The growth of organisms' receptivity is the result of the increasing complexity of the nervous system. Some of the reactions assume a warning character. On the whole, these last reactions may be described as pain. In this context, from the point of view of biology, pain has a strictly instrumental character. However, the development of the nervous system demonstrates an interesting feature: the increasing perceptive capacities of organisms, accompanied by a growing experience of pain, lead gradually to the emergence of more complex inner states, e.g. in the case of more developed organisms we deal with emotional distress. The human being, the highest stage of complexity, is capable of experiencing the most advanced form of reaction: existential anxiety. Many of the mentioned reactions to a greater or lesser respect are associated with a parallel experience of suffering. However, the situation is particular in the case of a human being. He does not merely experience suffering: suffering is one of the factors that may also shape his individuality. The emergence of many positive personal features would not be possible without certain negative aspects brought about by suffering. Besides, some existential aspects of suffering associated with self-awareness may contribute to posing very fundamental questions, among others the question regarding sense. For theology, suffering may be understood as an element of the certain logic of creation: some aspects of the latter may be perceived as a means for God's purposes. God achieves his desired goals by natural processes: also shaping man's individuality. However, the Creator's action is interconnected with the inner causality of nature. For this reason our reception of the world is ambiguous and may even lead to an inner rebellion against suffering itself.",

However, the term “grief” is also used when referring to losses of various other kinds, as with grief over illness, injury, unemployment, diminished abilities, relationship breakups, or loss of significant personal possessions. Complementing such uses, we propose that grief over a bereavement and other experiences of loss share a common phenomenological structure: one experiences the loss of certain possibilities that were integral to—and perhaps central to—the unfolding structure of one’s life. Grief can thus be conceived of in a broad but still univocal way. To develop this position, we focus on the example of grief over involuntary childlessness, where lack of a concrete, historical object of emotion serves to make explicit the way in which grief concerns future possibilities. We go on to suggest that the phenomenological complexity, diversity, and prevalence of grief are obscured when approached via an abstract, simplified conception of bereavement.",

      "title": "When niceness becomes toxic, <i>or</i>, how niceness effectively silences nurses and maintains the status quo in nursing",
      "abstract": "Niceness has been referred to as our 'most fundamental social dysfunction' (Summers, 2005) and in nursing, niceness can be (and often is) toxic and disabling. Niceness is powerfully reinforced in nursing by spoken and unspoken discourses that control who can speak and when, and how that voice will be heard and responded to. Niceness is not to be confused with attributes such as collegiality or friendliness because unlike these qualities, niceness has very real malignant and malevolent connotations that act to silence and oppress those caught in its web and to strongly maintain the status quo. A 'caring' nurse who is always 'nice' to people is not likely to be an agent of conflict and change, of critique and opposition. To engage these activities means 'rocking the boat', 'making waves', 'speaking out' and not necessarily 'being nice'. Thus the 'tyranny of niceness' masquerading as 'caring' often severely disables a nurse in securing the material and social conditions her (sic) work requires. It also renders her (sic) 'docile' and submissive; it makes her (sic) a compliant and willing agent for domination. A 'good' nurse, a 'nice' nurse, does as she (sic) is told and seldom questions the authority of others (Walker, 1997:8). As Walker (1997) notes, the desire to be nice means that people remain silent when they should speak out. It also means that when people do show courage and speak out, they can be silenced by others who (in enacting their own 'niceness') may be uncomfortable with authentic communication or with the issues being raised. In environments shaped by niceness, speaking out can involve considerable personal risk, because in environments of niceness, any speaking up that can be perceived as challenging in any way is likely to be taken as a breach of the code of niceness. Breaches of the niceness code do not come without consequences. In cultures shaped by niceness, those nurses who will speak up and raise issues can come to be cast as a 'problem to be managed' (Jackson et al., 2013:577) and themselves become the focus of scrutiny and even investigation up to and including disciplinary action. This means those raising issues are quickly silenced, often with accusations they are unprofessional, unsupportive, negative, splitting the profession, breaching codes of conduct, breaching confidentiality or similar (Jackson et al., 2011). Once this happens, the initiation of measures designed to silence the dissenting voice is justified, as are any actions needed to restore and maintain the organizational status quo (Jackson et al., 2013). The flow-on effects can also mean that others who witness the fallout from speaking up will likely be dissuaded from doing so. Literature suggests cultures of niceness affect people from minoritized groups more than those from the dominant group. Amongst other things, being nice means avoiding conflict (Walker, 1997) and in ground-breaking work on racism in the United States nursing, Barbee (1993) linked entrenched and continuing racist practices and behaviours in nursing to a culture of conflict avoidance (Barbee, 1993). Writing more recently, Perlow (2018) argues that niceness is not harmless or benign—rather, Perlow positions niceness as a racialized and gendered tool used to disguise power relations and a powerful means to silence and oppress people of colour. This should be evident to many of us in nursing, because despite the mantras of diversity, equity and inclusion that are often prominent in the mission (and other guiding) statements of most nursing organizations, we still see widespread inequity and lack of inclusion. We still have way too many (so-called) peak nursing bodies that are monocultural, with only minimal (if any) engagement with any persons from minoritized or marginalized communities. For many years there has been increasing recognition of the need for nurses to speak up and speak out. Despite the general acceptance that nurses should speak up to raise concerns, or to challenge various behaviours and actions, even very contemporaneous research suggests that nurses can perceive speaking up as a 'challenging behaviour' and that nurses may remain silent, 'even when speaking up is needed for patient safety' (Lee et al., 2022). The importance of nurses speaking up is recognized as so crucial to safe and affective health care that there is increasing awareness of the need to foster 'speaking up' skills in undergraduate student nurses (Fagan et al., 2016). Speaking up should be 'business as usual', but it actually requires considerable confidence and enormous courage (Lee et al., 2022). Yet speaking up reflects exactly what we want from nurses—we want and society needs nurses who are critical thinkers, change agents, problem solvers—politically astute advocates who will stand up and speak out for social justice. We need nurses to speak up and speak out right from the bedside to broader more societal-level advocacy and active political engagement. In order to speak up and speak out; however, there is a need to contravene the niceness agenda and raise issues that we ourselves, and others may find uncomfortable. If we want nurses and students of nursing to speak up and speak out, we really must eradicate disabling cultures that are underpinned by toxic forms of niceness. Niceness is strongly entrenched and harmful. It does violence to any who are seen to breach the powerful discourses of niceness. Disabling toxic niceness acts to continue to oppress and silence nurses and in turn, short-changes those we serve. Nurses need to be able to exchange information, ideas and raise issues in climates and with colleagues who are willing to authentically engage with relevant information and issues, and with new and different ideas. Instead of enculturating our colleagues and our students into niceness, lets model and create healthier cultures that are underpinned by collegiality, friendliness and authentic, respectful communication that welcomes and actively listens to dissenting or seldom heard voices. These courageous and important voices are the very voices that we need, to ensure that nursing can fulfil its social imperative and maximize the contribution of nursing to human health and well-being. Because without these voices, nothing will ever change. Editorials are opinion pieces. This piece has not been subject to peer review and the opinions expressed are those of the authors.

      "abstract": "It is held by many that religion had its origin in the emotional life, in “loving reverence,” or in fear, or in awe; and many make some particular emotion the distinguishing mark of religion. Since, indeed, religion is a part of the struggle for the preservation and perfection of life, it involves from the very beginning emotional states. But to speak of religion as originating in emotions is to assume a conception of religion which seems to me utterly unacceptable. If any sentiment or emotion, such as reverence or fear or awe, is found at the dawn of religion, it exists as part of the response, in a particular situation, to a sense of the presence of an invisible Being, upon whom one depends and with whom one desires to hold satisfactory relations. The emotion belongs to an experience involving the whole man, that is, man as a feeling, thinking, willing being.",

      "abstract": "Natural environments often generate experiences that combine great emotional and moral power—“charged” experiences. Their characteristics are explored through writings that capture them convincingly. They appear to have a perceptual character. Perception of the scene is invested with a sense of something beyond it, and much bigger. It may be God, or immensity in time or space, or the essence of a nation. This encounter is often connected with moral authority. A recurring theme is the sense that environment and the things in it—including the observer—are a self-similar pattern. People are not passive recipients of these experiences. They seek them out. Evoking the environment in words can often evoke the charged experience too—at least in part. The material suggests tasks for psychologists—most simply, finding systematic ways to describe these experiences. That may help other environmental disciplines, which face difficulty characterising the dimension of response. Theoretically, the material raises questions about the representations generated by perceptual processes. The observation that powerful moral imperatives seem to be given in the act of perceiving is also suggestive for the psychology of morality. Culture certainly plays a part in charged responses, but landscapes have the power to be invested with an emotional and moral charge where other stimuli may not.",

      "abstract": "In religion, as in every other subject of human reasoning, much depends upon the order in which we dispose our inquiries. A man who takes up a system of divinity with a previous opinion, that either every part must be true, or the whole false, approaches the discussion with great disadvantage. No other system, which is founded upon moral evidence, would bear to be treated in the same manner. Nevertheless, in a certain degree, we are all introduced to our religious studies under this prejudication. And it cannot be avoided. The weakness of the human judgement in the early part of youth, yet its extreme susceptibility of impression, renders it necessary to furnish it with some opinions, and with some principles or other. Or indeed, without much express care, or much endeavour for this purpose, the tendency of the mind of man to assimilate itself to the habits of thinking and speaking which prevail around him, produces the same effect. That indifferency and suspense, that waiting and equilibrium of the judgement, which some require in religious matters, and which some would wish to be aimed at in the conduct of education, are impossible to be preserved. They are not given to the condition of human life.",

      "abstract": "Abstract David Mechanic, in his pioneering textbook, Medical Sociology, views human activity within an adaptive framework—as a struggle of human beings to control their environment and life situation. While this view informs the research to be outlined, there are a number of ways it differs in emphasis from much medical sociology. First, by its concern with particular disorders defined in medical terms. Second, by its use of the investigator rather than respondent to characterize phenomena—to decide, for example, whether an incident should be classified as a life event. Third, by the importance placed on context. In order, for example, for an investigator to make a judgement about the likely meaning of an event such as a loss of a job it is essential to know whether it cast the person in a bad light; its impact on the person's family; her chance of getting another job, and so on. It is such circumstances surrounding an event that usually give it meaning via the emotion they create. Finally, by recognizing that where appropriate such emotion should be taken into account: ‘A world experienced without any affect would be a pallid, meaningless world, and it is what gives us feedback about what is what is good or bad about our lives’.",

      "abstract": "Summary (1)Four varieties of primitive affect are distinguishable, characterised by (a) strain, and (b) relaxation in response to a favourable situation, and by (c) strain, and (d) relaxation in response to one unfavourable. Exhilaration, gladness and interest arise from (a); ease, bliss and contentment from (b); uneasiness, distress and repugnance from (c), depression, sadness and apathy from (d). (2)These affects are due to (i) the organic harmony or discord induced by the environment; wherewith are evoked (ii) innately purposive patterns of out-going locomotor and organic activity, partly self-controlled and producing organic sensations; the latter again induce (iii) organic harmony or discord. Self-activity is “affected” by (i), (ii) and (iii). An innate basis is afforded by (i) and (ii) for the affect, which is completely developed by (iii) derived from actual expression. (3)Instincts are integrated from different higher and lower reflexes, emotions from different instincts, sentiments from different emotions organized within progressively higher systems and subjected to control and inhibition, which are important determinants of the accompanying feeling. In the lowest reflexes the self is “affected” only by (iii). The higher reflexes are accompanied by the affects evoked as described above in (2). Instincts, emotions and sentiments are accom panied by their special feelings depending on the integration of dispositions to lower feelings and on (ii) and (iii).",

While its universal prevalence is recognized to some degree at least in nearly all forms of disease, yet it is in the departments of neurology and psychiatry that we find its most serious effects and disastrous consequences. Fear is defined by Gould as an emotion of dread, an apprehension the feeling of which in its intense manifestations is called terror or fright. Generally speaking, fear is the expression of a desire on the part of the individual to escape or ward off whatever may seem to threaten evil or work harm to his well-being. It therefore conforms to the instinctive power immanent in man and animals of self-preservation.

None of these studies, however, attempts to determine the cause of forkommenhet ; up to now, the approaches have been largely symptomatic.4 Thus the term has taken on a considerable number of nuances, so that an individual who is called forkommen may be lonesome, isolated, alienated, rootless, sick or degenerate (physically or mentally), passe, inactive, anxious, hopeless, down-and-out, morally depraved, or a variety of these traits.5 Much as this list of qualifiers might add to the meaning of forkommenhet , it does not bring us appreciably closer to an understanding of its cause. At times, of course, the cause may be readily apparent, as when physical illness is the sole debilitating factor (e.g., in D0den ombord and Faerdig), but these cases constitute an insigificant minority. Most important, as can be seen from the descriptive list of symptoms above, forkommenhet must be defined mainly as a disease of the spirit, a pernicious state of mind caused by psychic trauma, and its etiology is by no means obvious. Clearly, this pervasive and dominating yet critically unexplained malady requires investigation. Moreover, the results should provide more than just an etiology of forkommenhet , for the issues involved concern the basic needs of every Andersen character, not just the forkomne ones.

      "title": "Physiological Role of Pleasure",
      "abstract": "A given stimulus can induce a pleasant or unpleasant sensation depending on the subject's internal state. The word alliesthesia is proposed to describe this phenomenon. It is, in itself, an adequate motivation for behavior such as food intake or thermoregulation. Therefore, negative regulatory feedback systems, based upon oropharingeal or cutaneous thermal signals are peripheral only in appearance, since the motivational component of the sensation is of internal origin. The internal signals seem to be complex and related to the set points of some regulated variables of the \"milieu interieur,\" like set internal temperature in the case of thermal sensation. Alliesthesia can therefore explain the adaptation of these behaviors to their goals. Only three sensations have been studied— thermal, gustatory, and olfactory, but it is probable that alliesthesia also exists in such simple ways as in bringing a signal, usually ignored, to the subject's attention. For example, gastric contractions, not normally perceived, are felt in the state of hunger. Since alliesthesia relies on an internal input, it is possible that alliesthesia exists only with sensations related to some constants of the \"milieu interieur\" and therefore would not exist in visual or auditory sensations. As a matter of fact, luminous or auditory stimuli can be pleasing or displeasing in themselves, but there seems to be little variation of pleasure in these sensations, that is, no alliesthesia. There may be some esthetic value linked to these stimuli but it is a striking coincidence that they are in themselves rather neutral and that it is difficult to imagine a constant of the \"milieu interieur\" which could be possibly modified by a visual or an auditive stimulus—such as light of a certain wavelength or sound of a given frequency. In the light of this theory, it is possible to reconsider the nature of the whole conscious experience. The existence of alliesthesia implies the presence of internal signals modifying the conscious sensations aroused from peripheral receptors. It is therefore necessary to question the existence of sensations aroused by direct stimulation of central receptors, such as hypothalamic temperature detectors, osmoreceptors, and others. Does their excitation arouse sensations of their own, or does the sensation have to pass through peripheral senses? Only human experimentation could answer this question. In the same way, it is possible that self-stimulation of the brain is pleasant, not by giving a sensation in itself, but because the electrical stimulus, renders peripheral stimuli pleasant.",

      "abstract": "Humans, it may be argued, have the distinction of being perhaps the only kind of creatures who can raise fundamental questions about existence. While requiring basic items such as food and drink in order to survive, humans nevertheless are often made aware that the fulfillment of human existence needs more than these.1 Unfortunately, the answer to the problem is rarely clear. What is less unclear is a certain uneasiness or even dissatisfaction with merely satisfying one's immediate needs.2 Hence, questions such as: what makes us truly human? is life worth living? is there a purpose to life? are asked. Humans, apparently unlike other living beings, can and sometimes do wonder about the significance of being alive and interacting with others. A specifically human concern is whether life itself has any ultimate meaning. It would be naive to think that we humans always ask these questions in such an explicit way. Nor do we address the issue of ultimate meaning with uniform concern and interest. Our list of priorities in life would hardly reveal such in-depth existential values. In fact, we generally set ourselves certain goals, strive after them, and, if we attain them, look for others.3 Nonetheless, the question as to whether life has any meaning at all is a human one not only because, as far as we know, humans alone are capable of reflecting on it, but also because every human being-although in most cases implicitly rather than explicitly?is confronted by it.4 As a matter of fact, we more or less presume the meaningfulness of life by carrying on with our daily routine.

Although most social scientists have an intuitive sense of what constitutes a riot, the edges of the definition are fuzzy and it can be difficult to determine whether or not some events are actually “riots.” For example, it is agreed that a riot is a collective act. That is, more than one individual must be involved and at least minimally coordinate action in order for a riot to occur. Two people acting together, however, would not constitute a riot, even though it is a collective act of violence. Thus, the lower limit for participation, damage, and duration to define a riot is difficult to establish and has led many sociologists to analyze events more ambiguously referred to as “civil disorders” or “collective violence.” For most, however, unless there are at least 30–50 people involved, the events last more than a few moments, and there is action that could result in property damage or injury requiring medical attention, a riot has not occurred.",

      "title": "Keep Your Mask On: The Benefits of Masking for Behavior and the Contributions of Aging and Disease on Dysfunctional Masking Pathways",
      "abstract": "Environmental cues (e.g., light-dark cycle) have an immediate and direct effect on behavior, but these cues are also capable of “masking” the expression of the circadian pacemaker, depending on the type of cue presented, the time-of-day when they are presented, and the temporal niche of the organism. Masking is capable of complementing entrainment, the process by which an organism is synchronized to environmental cues, if the cues are presented at an expected or predictable time-of-day, but masking can also disrupt entrainment if the cues are presented at an inappropriate time-of-day. Therefore, masking is independent of but complementary to the biological circadian pacemaker that resides within the brain (i.e., suprachiasmatic nucleus) when exogenous stimuli are presented at predictable times of day. Importantly, environmental cues are capable of either inducing sleep or wakefulness depending on the organism’s temporal niche; therefore, the same presentation of a stimulus can affect behavior quite differently in diurnal vs. nocturnal organisms. There is a growing literature examining the neural mechanisms underlying masking behavior based on the temporal niche of the organism. However, the importance of these mechanisms in governing the daily behaviors of mammals and the possible implications on human health have been gravely overlooked even as modern society enables the manipulation of these environmental cues. Recent publications have demonstrated that the effects of masking weakens significantly with old age resulting in deleterious effects on many behaviors, including sleep and wakefulness. This review will clearly outline the history, definition, and importance of masking, the environmental cues that induce the behavior, the neural mechanisms that drive them, and the possible implications for human health and medicine. New insights about how masking is affected by intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells, temporal niche, and age will be discussed as each relates to human health. The overarching goals of this review include highlighting the importance of masking in the expression of daily rhythms, elucidating the impact of aging, discussing the relationship between dysfunctional masking behavior and the development of sleep-related disorders, and considering the use of masking as a non-invasive treatment to help treat humans suffering from sleep-related disorders.",

      "abstract": "Were one to be asked to think about well-being, his or her mind would probably wander among images of harmony, happiness or satisfaction. Others might focus on physical health, conjecture on the achievement of personal goals or conceive of well-being by negation: as the absence of illness, negative emotions or worries. Yet, this would be all but a complete picture. It is in fact possible to think of well-being as a far more complex phenomenon: something other than comforting and fleeting emotions, and different from mere individual feelings of joy or vitality. Well-being may be considered first and foremost as a social issue, pertaining to the composition of conflicting values and the fulfilment of collective needs. All the more so, against the background of global phenomena such as climate change and economic inequality, well-being cannot be reduced to a patchwork of good emotions or to the absence of disease or social unrest. The interconnected and quick transformation of contemporaneity calls for a trans-individual and multidimensional understanding of the concept: encompassing the fields of physical, mental, and social health.",

      "title": "Turbulence, Vibrations, Noise and Fluid Instabilities. Practical Approach.",
      "abstract": "Colloquially speaking, turbulence in any language means disorderly, incomprehensible, and of course, unpredictable movement. Consequently, we encounter expressions that employ the word turbulence in social and economic contexts; in aviation whenever there are abnormalities in the air, and even in psychology and the behavioural sciences in reference to turbulent conduct, or a turbulent life, in the sense of a dissolute existence. Thus has the word turbulence become associated with chaos, unpredictability, high energy, uncontrollable movement: dissipation. All of the foregoing concepts have their source in the world of hydrodynamics, or fluid mechanics. In fluid mechanics, turbulence refers to disturbance in a flow, which under other circumstances would be ordered, and as such would be laminar. These disturbances exert an effect on the flow itself, as well as on the elements it contains, or which are submerged in it. The process that is taking place in the flow in question is also affected. As a result, they possess beneficial properties in some fields, and harmful ones in others. For example, turbulence improves processes in which mixing, heat exchange, etc., are involved. However, it demands greater energy from pumps and fans, reduces turbine efficiency and makes noise in valves and gives rise to vibrations and instabilities in pipes, and other elements. The study of turbulence and its related effects is a mental process; one that begins with great frustration and goes on to destroy heretofore accepted theories and assumptions, finally ending up in irremediable chaos. “I am an old man now, and when I die and go to heaven, there are two matters on which I hope for enlightenment. One is the quantum electrodynamics, and the other is the turbulent motion of fluids. An about the former I am rather optimistic” (Attributed to Horace Lamb). Nonetheless, some progress has been made in turbulence knowledge, modelling and prediction. (Kolmogorov, 1941). This chapter will deal briefly with these advances, as well as with the effects of turbulence on practical applications. In this sense, reference will be made to noise effects and modelling, as well as to flow vibration and instabilities provoked by turbulence. (Gavilan 2008, Gavilan 2009).",

The personal encounter with the new being and the change from a relationship between 2 individuals to a 3-way+ relationship. 3. The anticipation as a manifestation of the principle of hope. 4.

      "abstract": "Abstract Major depressive disorder is frequently associated with the disruption of the natural orderliness of rhythmic physiological processes such as sleep and endocrine function. Several hypotheses have been developed to account for this disturbance in biological rhythms, associated with depressive episodes, which are briefly reviewed. We previously postulated that depression may he the result of loss of “social Zeitgebers” (i.e., persons, social demands, or tasks that set the biological clock). We have been impressed with the need for investigations into how internal as well as external social and environmental factors may disrupt the integrity of biological rhythms. We now present the concept of a “Zeitstorer” (time disturber) which is envisioned as a physical, chemical, or psychosocial event which acts as a source for circadian rhythm disruption. The development of a Zeitstorer concept has led us to a revised hypothesis of rhythm disturbance and affective disorders. It is our expectation that this hypothesis can provide descriptive models for application in the study of human psychopathology, as well as potentially new therapeutic modes of treatment.

      "abstract": "The individual inclination to lead an autonomous life until death is associated with requirements that may be of physiological, psychosocial and environmental nature. We aim to describe a conceptual oro-facial health model with an emphasis on oro-facial function, taking the domains of quality of life and patient-centred values into account. In the context of oro-facial function, the requirements of life are met when the oro-facial system is in a fit state. 'Fitness of the oro-facial system, that is oro-facial health, is a state that is characterised by an absence of, or positive coping with physical disease, mental disease, pain and negative environmental and social factors. It will allow natural oro-facial functions such as sensing, tasting, touching, biting, chewing, swallowing, speaking, yawning, kissing and facial expression'. In the presented conceptual model of oro-facial health, it is postulated that each individual has present and future potentials related to biological prerequisites and resources that are developed by an individual through the course of life. These potentials form the oro-facial functional capacity. When the individual potentials together do not meet the requirements of life anymore, dysfunction and disease result. The oro-facial system is subject to physiological ageing processes, which will inevitably lead to a decrease in the oro-facial functional capacity. Furthermore, comorbid medical conditions might hamper oro-facial function and, alongside with the ageing process, may lead to a state of oral hypofunction. Currently, there is a lack of widespread, validated, easy-to-use instruments that help to distinguish between states of oro-facial fitness as opposed to oral hypofunction. Clearly, research is needed to establish adequate, validated instruments alongside with functional rehabilitation procedures.",

      "title": "332 What’s causing obesity in pets and what can we do about it?",
      "abstract": "Abstract The majority of dogs (56%) and cats (60%) are now overweight or obese. A novel theory posits that obesity in pets is due to “treats” and excessive meal amounts given by the “pet-parent” to obtain affection from the pet, which enables “‘eating addiction” in the pet and results in pet-parent “co-dependence.” The pet-parent may even become hostage to the treats/food to avoid the ire of the pet. Eating addiction in the pet appears related to stress/conflict, involving the displacement mechanism, which is a bio-behavioral mechanism in the brains of all animals, even fruit flies. It allows the animal to deal with situations that cannot readily be faced or avoided or are thwarting, such as social isolation. Displacement behavior is out-of-context, irrepressible behavior, e.g. an animal in the wild who sleeps or feeds when threatened by a predator. It is thought due to re-channeling of overflow brain energy to another drive (e.g. feeding drive) when two drives, e.g. fight or flight, equally oppose each other. Moving the opposing drives out of equilibrium, by resolving the animal’s stressful life situations, theoretically halts the displacement mechanism and addictive behavior, e.g. overeating/obesity. Similarly, dealing with the pet-parent’s stressful life situations curtails displacement regarding overfeeding the pet. Treatment for each contribution to companion animal obesity will be presented: Pet-parent seeking affection from the pet by giving food treats, which induces and subsequently triggers displacement overeating in the pet -- &amp;gt; Treatment is pet-parent withdrawal/abstinence from treat-giving. Displacement of pet-parent’s stressful life situations by feeding the pet. The received affection induces and subsequently triggers further treat-giving by the pet-parent. -- &amp;gt; Treatment is developing an action plan for each of the pet-parent’s stressful life situations. Begging, annoyance, aggression, and hostage state of the pet. -- &amp;gt; Treatment is “tough love” by the pet-parent.",

      "title": "Poltergeists - a Phenomenon Worthy of Serious Study",
      "abstract": "FOLKLORISTS FOCUS ON STORIES, tales, legends, proverbs, riddles, and jokes -- all genres that contain artistic elements and lend themselves easily to analysis and comparative studies. In the area of folk belief, studies in the past have concentrated mainly on such genres as ghost stories or superstitions, both of which feature verbal art and the expressive use of language. However, we neglect hundreds of other folk beliefs not nearly as entertaining or as easy to study. Often these beliefs pose a special problem for folklorists, since people may seldom express them, or the activities related to the beliefs may rarely occur. One of the more interesting of these obscure folk/popular traditions in Europe, England, and America (and probably elsewhere as well) is the phenomenon. term derives from the German (polter meaning noise or racket, and geist meaning spirit), and traditionally referred to specific types of activity that have no demonstrable cause but were believed to be the activity of pesky little spirits: objects flying through the air and perhaps striking someone, furniture or walls moving or shaking, or the production of rapping noises or sounds that imitate the human voice. For most of us, this and other unexplainable phenomena seem too bizarre and far-fetched to warrant further study. folklorist, however, recognizes in the poltergeist phenomenon something that contains surprisingly more than meets the eye. Poltergeist outbreaks occur rarely, and last only a very short time, perhaps only days, thus making difficult serious investigation or scientific analysis; by the time the reports reach folklorists or other researchers, the attacks have stopped as mysteriously as they started. Observers notice that the activities center around a particular person -- usually, but not always, an adolescent female -- only during that person's waking hours. One of the most famous cases of poltergeistery in the United States occurred in Hydeville, New York about 1848 in the home of John D. Fox. His three daughters noticed a recurrence of mysterious rappings suggesting a code of communication -- one rap for no, two raps for doubtful, and three raps for yes, with a more complicated code for longer messages. Fox sisters eventually became mediums in the Spiritualist movement, whose followers believed the rappings to be messages from the dead. Sometime later one of the sisters apparently admitted that the spirit knocks were produced fraudulently, thus giving weight to the theory that poltergeist cases always involve trickery. (Perhaps the Fox sisters did indeed have poltergeist experiences in the beginning, but were never able to reproduce them and thus resorted to fraud.) Before the advancements of information technology, sporadic reports of poltergeistery appeared in the United States, Britain, and Europe. More recently, about once or twice annually, we have reports of activity that we recognize as poltergeistery, even though that word may never be used. Merely because a newspaper or television program publicizes a mysterious event does not mean, of course, that the phenomenon is genuine or that no fraud is involved. However, because reports of poltergeistery come very often from sensible, disinterested witnesses and bear striking similarities, we may conclude that either the events really happened or that the observers are somehow influenced to believe that similar activities occurred. In any case, this phenomenon deserves very careful consideration by scholars from various disciplines. We tend to discount reports of anything unconventional or strange from centuries past, as if almost everyone who lived before the mid-20th century had superstitious beliefs and therefore could not possibly be objective. Some accounts, however, appear to be so rational that we take notice. For example, the Reverend Glanvill, a 17th century philosopher and scholar, described in a very sensible and straightforward manner what came to be known as The Drummer of Tidworth, a classic poltergeist case. …",

      "abstract": "The Presence of Absence: The Concept of Lack in Sociality Benjamin Lozano Arjun Appadurai, Fear of Small Numbers: An Essay on the Geography of Anger, Duke University Press, Durham NC, 2006 Thomas M. Hawley, The Remains of War: Bodies, Politics, and the Search for American Soldiers Unaccounted For in Southeast Asia, Duke University Press, Durham NC, 2005 The colloquial definition of “lack” - deficiency, wanting, or otherwise unavailability of some key element or feature - often assumes that there is now something absent where it was once (or at least ought to have been) present. “This steak lacks salt”, “For lack of funds the project was left incomplete”, or, “The body’s lack of white blood cells rendered it incapable of fighting off disease”, one might remark, therein implying that if that which is lacking or absent were in fact present in said-noun, the phenomenon under consideration would not be in occurrence. Under these terms, lack equates to an effective negation or withdrawal of some essential feature, whereas the absence of lack, presence, equates to positivity, a fullness or wholeness necessary to said-noun’s essence. And though this common assumption may appear all too obvious in the respective commonalities of cooking, financing construction projects, and epidemiology, two recent books - Arjun Appadurai’s Fear of Small Numbers: An Essay on the Geography of Anger, and Thomas M. Hawley’s The Remains of War: Bodies Politics, and the Search for American Soldiers Unaccounted For in Southeast Asia - argue that in sociality the presence of absence functions to the contrary. For both authors, lack in sociality is not absence where presence belongs. Rather, lack is that which proceeds to instill a fullness or presence of absence where there was once neither presence nor absence; in other words, lack itself functions as a presence of absence in sociality that often emanates or is created ex nihilo, the concrete effects of which prove more decisive than would be thought upon first glance. Fear of Small Numbers is intended by Appadurai as a follow-up to his 1996 Modernity at Large: Cultural Dimensions of Globalization, a study largely dedicated to investigating the complex structural modifications an increasingly globalized world poses for the interactive “disjunctures” between the nation-state, local communities, and the imagination of social practices. In part, then, one might likewise view this second installment in Appadurai’s general project as a response to the critical reception Modernity at Large received upon its initial publication. “Some critics”, Appadurai notes in his Preface to Fear of Small Numbers, “saw the book as being insufficiently attentive to the darker sides of globalization,” or what psychoanalysts might call globalization’s “other scene.” Americans, for instance, laud cheap food and clothing prices from various outlets, and yet on the production-side of the equation, prefer to remain unaware that these prices are so low precisely due to exorbitant exploitation of the labor and resources of poor, local communities without option as to the terms of sale. Appadurai cites less banal and sociologically more complex examples of globalization’s other scene in his new work, extending beyond the contradictions of the ubiquity of global capital, organizing his theoretic framework around a series of analytic concepts. The central premise of Fear of Small Numbers is the puzzling proliferation of racialized majoritarianism, ethnonationalism, and ethnocide in even strictly democratic polities today. A mere 15 years past the end of the Cold War and the supposed “end of history”, how does one account for such an intensive resurrection of large-scale ethnocidal mobilization? From Rwanda to the former Yugoslavia, Chechnya, India, Sudan, and now the War on Terror waged by western liberalism against its ugly Other (and vice versa): how does one make sense of such rabid, large-scale, heterogeneous violence in the context of globalization, at the precise moment when one expects that the world is becoming more homogeneous? Appadurai’s answers the question thus: “where the lines between us and them may have always, in human history, been blurred at the boundaries and unclear across large spaces and big numbers, globalization exacerbates these uncertainties and produces new incentives for cultural purification as more nations lose the illusion of national economic sovereignty...",

Unlike their individualist counterparts, collective inaction and omission have not yet received much attention in the literature. (Unintended) collective inaction, I argue, can be attributed to a group of agents where a collective action (or a collective outcome) x that the agents did not perform (or did not produce) was collectively feasible at time t where each agent in that group had sufficient reason to contribute to performing (or producing) x or others had a reasonable expectation that they would perform (or produce) x . I show that, perhaps surprisingly, we can speak of collective inaction even where only one member of the group fails to act. However, where large and dispersed groups of agents are concerned, there is often no meaningful way of attributing collective failings. Still, I contend that the failure to close the global emissions gap and—in some cases—to generate herd immunity are indeed on us .",

On peut observer par exemple l’isolement d’un individu au sein d’un troupeau de bovins ou d’ovins, l’apparition soudaine d’une agressivite a l’encontre d’autres individus, une diminution notable de l’activite de jeu ou de travail comme pour le chien de chasse ou encore une perte de poids chez un individu au sein d’une colonie en elevage comme pour les rats, les souris ou les singes… Ces signes declenchent la mise en œuvre de tests subjectifs individuels d’evaluation de la fonction visuelle comme la recherche du reflexe de clignement a la menace ou le test de la boule de papier en vision binoculaire. Ces tests subjectifs individuels peuvent etre entrepris chez des especes comme le chien ou le chat mais pas chez les especes « mal voyantes » comme les rongeurs (rat, souris, …).

      "title": "The complexity and simplicity of the experience of grieving",
      "abstract": "Grief is a natural and expected reaction to the rupture of a bond; it is a process of preparing for a significant loss, which does not apply only in the case of death, but also to other situations of irreversible deprivation, such as separations or retirements. It is not considered lost when there is no interest in what has been lost. Thus, its meaning is determined individually, subjectively and contextually by those who experience it. Grief is a consequence of the experience of loss that happens when our lives are affected by the termination of a relationship, a project or a dream. It signifies an intense emotional suffering caused by loss, a profound sadness, a dynamic, individualized and multidimensional process through which the individual traverses. Since the early work of Freud (1) , grief has been studied and there has been a great evolution in the manner of understanding this experience. The most recent conceptualization of this mystery that pervades our human condition is to consider it as an inevitable life experience, unpredictable, unrelated to the stages previously presented, neither resolvable nor likely to be “overcome”, but as an event that becomes part of life in unique ways, changing over the course of life, and itself being life-changing. It consists of a normal and expected process of transformation and redefinition of the relationship with the lost person, a task that allows for its preparation (2) . Thus, it concludes with a “resolution”, with the return to normalcy, but with the incorporation of loss into the life of the grieving person, so you can follow on with life with a continuous connection to the deceased, but which allows one to continue to move forward with life. Currently, scholars no longer work with the concept of phases of grieving, which risks unfair and biased assessment of the person’s condition in a generic way, ignoring individuality. It is a process of transformation of the relationship with those who died, which it is important to note, can not be simply eliminated from the life of the bereaved; it is not only more physically present, but the grieving person continues with a different relationship from that which existed before. The development not only depends on the working through the loss, but also the ability to disregard",

      "title": "Using metaphor in healthcare: physical health",
      "abstract": "As shown throughout this volume, metaphors are regularly used to talk and think about experiences that are subjective, complex and sensitive in terms of experiences that are less subjective, simpler and more concrete. Health and illness, and the emotions associated with them, are among the experiences that we often talk about through metaphors. As is the case more generally, these metaphors tend to rely on perceived similarities between different kinds of experiences. For example, the metaphorical use of ‘battle’ in ‘she died after a long battle with cancer’ relies on the perception of a similarity between being ill with cancer and fighting in a war: both experiences are difficult and potentially life-threatening, both require perseverance, and so on. However, as our use of the term ‘perceived’ similarity suggests, metaphors do not reflect objectively given similarities, but can create similarities between unlike things: they can reflect, convey and reinforce different ways of seeing and experiencing different aspects of our lives. In the terms used in Conceptual Metaphor Theory (see Chapter 1), the choice of different source domains ‘frames’ the target domain in different ways, highlighting some aspects and backgrounding others (Lakoff and Johnson 1980; Ritchie 2013).",

This applies even if what we want to say about these things is that they represent a disorganized or unstructured example of their kind or else that they simply lack any discernible form of internal organization or structure in the sense that their internal structure is undifferentiated or homogenous as opposed to being ‘all over the place’. We therefore live in a world in which everything can be characterized, either positively or negatively, in terms of its form of organization or structure.

Sickness is thought to be due to one of two causes: it may be, and the people think most frequently is, the result of magic which has been worked by some person who wishes to give pain or even to cause death because of a grievance, real or imaginary; or it may be due to some ghost. Under either circumstance, when a serious case of sickness occurs, the family seek the aid of a medicine-man who by his various tests and incantations discovers the cause; and, in a case where magic has been worked, he not only discovers the cause but also discloses the name of the culprit, who is thereupon sought and asked to give his motive for afflicting the sick person, and is paid to release him from the spell. Should the man have intended to kill the other because he has suffered some discourtesy or received some offence at his hands, he would probably have speared his shadow, so that the sick person will die unless the spell or magic is removed. Again, it may be that some magic has been worked and certain objects have been hidden near the house which are causing the sickness; these have to be removed and the spell broken before any drugs or treatment will avail the sick man. The perpetrator will only remove these when his grievance has been settled and he has received the needful compensation.",

      "abstract": "According to Nanay emic ideas, shamanic disease, which affects a shaman in the period of his or her formation, also affects his or her relatives, who begin to suffer from nervous disorders and other problems but recover at their new shaman’s incarnation. A similar spiritual correlation within the group of relatives becomes apparent also when a shaman is involved in a situation which connects him or her with the spiritual world (murder, death, incest, etc.), so that the consequences of such events influence not only the shaman, but also his or her kin.&#x0D; From the emic perspective, relations with the spirits have not only spiritual, but also biological components (emerging for instance, in the idea about the possibility of human-spiritual cohabitation), which opens up possibilities for spirituality to be inherited by descendants. These circumstances suggest that the social factors that unite the clan (exogamy etc.), are secondary to the religious factors, and probably used as a means to adapt to the spiritual problems that shamanists face. Running the danger of collective clan disease, people have to remember their clan peculiarity and exclusiveness and undertake common efforts for its avoidance. Being aware of their patrilineal descent and of their own place in it, people can define the circle of possible persons who are subject to similar mental and other troubles and who should look together for the means of a cure. The wish to ensure spiritual security results in the social prescriptions and taboos that form the patrilineal clan.",

      "title": "The Forgotten Message of the Infant Smile.",
      "abstract": "Few developmental phenomena enjoy the universality, inevitabil ity, and temporal determinancy of the infant smile—features that beguile the layman and bedevil the experimenter. In attempting to account for the various factors that control smiling and the it plays in human behavior, we face immediately the communication vs. expression issue, the question of whether to emphasize the effect of smiling on outsiders or the meaning of smiling for the insider, a simple point often overlooked or confused in the literature. Consider first the adult smile. As an outsider, we interpret the smile of another person (leaving aside the rare nervous smile) to mean simply that he has experienced a positive change in feeling. It may be because he is happy to see us, because he has appreciated a twist of humor, because he has mastered a problem, and so on. The social role of the smile here is to communicate to others something about the in feeling of the smiler. To the insider, if my introspections have any validity, the outsider's perceptions are fairly veridical. Treatments of infant smiling have traditionally weighed heavily the external aspects of smiling, one of which is the effect of infant smiling on others. Bowlby (1969) has rightly pointed out the value of smiling for the attachment of mother to infant. I would claim, inci dentally, that this virtue is not unique to the infant; people tend throughout life to be attracted to smilers no matter what their age. Another effect of the infant smile is to signal others that they are doing something right; mothers, fathers, and siblings will perform any number of antics to maintain the infant smile. A second ex ternal aspect of smiling has interested investigators. Smiling has frequently been treated relatively mechanically as either a triggered response, in the ethological tradition, to eyes, to faces, to voices, to jouncing or, in the operant tradition, as a response to be reinforced or extinguished. Amazingly enough, little has been said about what the smile",

      "abstract": "In reciprocities, the transfers are gifts. In the simple gift/ return-gift processes, there are two agents, and agent i hands out gift xi to agent j who reciprocates with the return gift xj to agent i. The xi and xj can a priori be of any nature, but we will consider later the “quantitative case” in which each gift is a quantity of a good. A notable issue is that of gift refusal, the possibility of refusing a gift in totality or in part, and its consequences. This can apply to the initial gift, to the return gift, or to both. The issue of gift refusal is disregarded in this section for simplicity and because, in a number of cases, it does not matter, or does not occur, or even cannot occur. (It may be that the agents do not refuse because they appreciate the other's gift, or only the gifts offered matter, or refusing the gift or returning it back may not be possible for a material reason or because of a norm internalized or imposed by social pressure, or the giver may be able to refuse the refusal – for instance in not “taking back” something refused –, and so on).",

      "abstract": "Disgust has been hypothesized to be uniquely linked to violations of a distinct moral domain (called divinity, purity, or sacred) aimed at preserving one's body from contamination with pathogens and preserving one's soul from violations of what is sacred. Here we examined whether the same emotion-core disgust-occurs when witnessing both types of violation, and we proposed a specific method for doing so. In two studies (N = 160; 240), American and Indian participants indicated their emotional reaction to (stories depicting) sacred or nonsacred violations, each either with or without pathogens. Both Americans and Indians felt \"grossed out\" (a term for core disgust) by events with pathogens (whether violations of the sacred or not). They felt disgusted and angered, but not grossed out, by violations of the sacred. For both Americans and Indians, grossed out was never the modal emotion when a sacred violation did not involve pathogens. Results were inconsistent with a focus on any single emotion: sacred violations were associated with several different negative emotions.

Ideas are created by individual personalities, communicated to others, and then enter human culture. Design for creativity is considered in terms of temporal and spatial factors and the two cerebral hemispheres. The temporal criteria drive the left hemisphere, for example, acoustic parameters related to voice, speech, and music as well as visual temporal patterns related to movements such as leaves in a gentle breeze, twinkling stars, pendiulum of wall clock, flame, or streamlet [1]. Factors related to spatial patterns, such as those generated in painting and sculpture, engage the right hemisphere. For creativity-enhancing design, creative working space (CWS) [2-6], separate areas are devoted to activities that mainly engage left cerebral hemisphere (calculation, writing sentences, reading) or right hemisphere (ex. drawing figures, painting, selection photographs). Such creative activities may keep a body in good health and a mind strong, no matter what the age, even up to the last moment of life hopefully without any mentally weak.

The basic moral dilemma of psychiatry is generated by the conflict between the self and the other. This conflict can never be \"settled.\" Instead, if man is to survive, the contenders must achieve a decent mutual accommodation, a creative compromise. Why? Because victory of the self—meaning unrestrained freedom—would, given the types of weapons available today, lead to the certain destruction of man as biological organism. Similarly, victory of the other—meaning unrestrained oppression—would, given the means of coercion available today, lead to the certain destruction of man as moral agent or person.

The act done with full consciousness intention and preparation, then it is called Amd in Islamic jurisprudent and Shariah and other acts; done unintentional, are called Khata or Bis-sabab (unintentional act or by reasons of something else). In either cases; intentional or unintentional acts, the loss should be compensated. Islam has formulated such rules derived from the Holy Quran and Sunnah of the Holy Prophet (peace be upon him). In case of loss of life, limb or loss of effective activity of a limb or more (injuries to human body), the Shariah has ordained rules which include Qisas (retribution), Diyat( blood money) and AFW (forgiveness by victim or heirs of victim). These rules are exceptions to general rules and are blessings of Allah (SWT) as mentioned in the Holy Quran that : O ye who believe! The law of equality is prescribed to you in cases of murder the free for the free, the slave for the slave, the woman for the woman. But if any remission is made by the brother of the slain, then grant any reasonable demand and compensate him with handsome gratitude, this is a concession and a mercy from your Lord. After this whoever exceeds the limits shall be in grave penalty . It is because of the previous nations as Bani Israil (Jews) and Nasara (Christians) were not bestowed such remissions simultaneously in case of offence of injuries and murders. Bani Israil (Jews) were ordered Qisas only but no Diyat or Afw whereas Nasara (Christians) were given permission of Afw only but no Qisas or Diyat. As compared to them Muslims were given three possibilities in case of loss of others so that the enmity and grudge may be settled down between parties amicably or by way of Qisas . These rules have been proved to be a source of stability in the Muslim society. Qisas and Diyat laws introduced in Pakistani legal system and certain amendments were introduced in the penal and procedural laws and rules were framed for the said purpose. The Islamic concept of security to the human being is far lasting and is secured in each and every manner. Concept of Aqilahh is one of those securities provided in Islamic law. The loss of human being should not go vain in any manner whatsoever.",

      "abstract": "In humanity’s current historical and cultural situation, stress is commonly recognized as having an important role in origin and continuation of disorders and illnesses. In everyday terms stress means both set of potentially harmful external forces that produce a series of biochemical, somatic and visceral reactions in organism, as well as reaction, whether or not it is behavioural, resulting from or in defence against stress itself. In fact, word stress would have no meaning if organism’s reaction to potentially harmful stimuli were considered; therefore reactions are highly individualized and coherent according to psychobiological uniqueness of each personality, and way an individual perceives meaning of an event is extremely variable. The definition of term is different in scientific domain: here stress means only human organism’s reaction to one of more events (stressors) which alter homeostatic equilibrium. Every kind of stimulus is presented as a request for a modification of homeostasis which, independently from source, whether it is characterised by a physical, chemical or psychosocial stimulus, is always associated and mediated by emotive reactions. From this point of view, then, it can be said that stress is expression of an effort made by organism when faced with any request for modification of its homeostasis. Moreover, stress must always be seen as a complex psychophysiological reaction concerning whole personality. In itself, term “stress” should not have a negative or positive meaning, since its harmfulness is tied to different variables such as type of stressor, frequency, intensity, conditions of system, personality, context, etc., however in psychosomatics, stress is usually considered as at least a potentially pathological element or anyway one with negative nuances. In actual fact, when it was first formulated (Selye, 1970), stress was defined as the organism’s aspecific response to every request made upon it”. For Selye intensity of stress can be measured only by assessing size of organism’s reaction, and numerous changes produced by stress constitute what he called General Adaptation Syndrome (G.A.S.). With its reaction organism tries to adapt to different conditions of disequilibrium, trying to overcome them or tolerate them. The G.A.S works in three phases: a) alarm reaction, response of arousal of Vegetative Nervous System of Cannon (1932) in which essentially biochemical-hormonal modifications are manifested. b) resistance phase of adaptation to stimulus with arousal of Neuroendocrinal and Immune Nervous System in which organism organizes its defences c) exhaustion phase in which there is incapacity to further adapt to stressors. Therefore for Selye, stress is to be considered adaptive insofar as it enables organism, before a stressor of various kinds, to implement physiological responses that try to re-establish homeostatic equilibrium. Selye later described two separate models of stress based on effect produced at every level of organism; he in fact called pleasant, desirable and adaptive after-effect, eustress, and disadaptive, harmful, unpleasant effect, “distress” (Selye, 1970).",

      "abstract": "More than a century ago European observers began to describe an odd Malayan' malady known in the vernacular as latah. Upon provocation, usually involving a shock or acute fright, a latah person would shout an obscene utterance, imitate a word, gesture, or action, or automatically obey commands that he/she would not normally follow. Such reactions made a vivid impression upon the Europeans who witnessed them, partly because they involved a loss of self-control that was quite uncharacteristic of peoples who placed great emphasis upon decorum, equilibrium, and personal dignity. These observers also quickly became aware of certain other things about latah. It was apparently widespread among Malayan peoples, but affected only certain individuals. It was well known to the natives themselves, but they regarded it as a personal quirk rather than a form of insanity. What brought it on? Was it inherited or acquired? Was a narcotic substance of some sort involved? Or the tropical climate? And just what was latah anyway?--an odd form of hypnosis? hysteria? trance? Was it dangerous to others? Was it, for example, related somehow to that other well-known Malay practice of running amok? Was it curable? It was certainly not something that could be readily explained by reference to anything in an Englishman's or a Dutchman's own cultural system of psychiatric knowledge or experience, whether folk or medical.",

      "abstract": "The capability of the human organism to work or exercise comprises of several components of physical performance capacity: endurance, power, force production, velocity, flexibility and co-ordination. Working in cold environments where it is possible that the temperature of the body, either superficial or core, decrease, the above mentioned components may be altered. In general, cooling decreases the ability of these components to function. The amount of decrease is dependent for example on: exercise type, exercise duration and degree of cooling. The exercises that seem to be most susceptible to cooling are those which are very short lasting and dynamic, utilising fast movement velocities and/or elastic properties of the working muscles. The decrease in core temperature, however is not a prerequisite for the decrease in performance. Already a very superficial cooling is sufficient to substantially decrease performance. Several mechanisms may be responsible for the decreased capacity of performance and they can severely suffocate the capacity to work in cold environments. Due to this an increase in individual strain and also the risk to have an accident are increased. Therefore, while working in cold environments cooling, especially of the working muscles, has to be avoided as efficiently as possible.",

      "title": "Border Narratives: Three First-Person Accounts of Depression",
      "abstract": "The story of depression is a long and changing one: It appears that depression has been around as long as man has been capable of self-conscious thought (Solomon 31). Over centuries, depression has been variably understood as a result of biological humors, religious or moral failings, existential emptiness, soul-sickness, early loss, unconscious conflicts, distorted thinking, chemical imbalances, genetic predispositions, and more, or as Andrew Solomon states, the shape and detail of depression have gone through a thousand cartwheels. Depression is a construction that changes with prevailing sociocultural discourse: Our Prozac-popping, cognitively focused, semi-alienated postmodernity is only a stage in ongoing understanding and control of mood and character (286). While theories of depression's causes vary according to times, many of features described by those who have experienced or treated depression are remarkably consistent over long history of illness. Certainly symptomatology of our time is more or less indistinguishable from what was described by Hippocrates some twenty-five hundred years ago (Solomon 31). Despite changes in meaning of depression and in spite of psychological and pharmacological advances, depression persists in a form that is recognizable, and its prevalence and incidence are increasing (Maxmen and Ward 206). (1) Depression to those who experience it, however, is more than a list of quantifiable symptoms, though surely symptoms are its most salient and defining feature. The symptoms and their persistence trigger varying narratives about meaning and nature of disorder; its etiology for particular individual; and what it means to, for, and about self. Even within contemporary psychiatric and psychological thinking, definition of depression underwent significant changes during second half of twentieth century. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), accepted nosology for mental illness, has undergone six revisions since its inception in 1952. This document is reification of medical-model, or disease-model, of mental illness. Psychiatrists and psychologists with expertise in relevant areas of psychopathology work in groups to compile DSM. They review and interpret empirical and clinical findings and solicit feedback and opinions from professionals in a variety of mental-health disciplines. In end, they then determine what will be included in or excluded from DSM (DSMIV xv-xvi). The DSM designates what is and what is not a mental illness as well as symptoms that define each particular disorder and duration those symptoms must persist to warrant a diagnosis of a particular mental disorder. However, even truths contained in this psychiatric bible have changed over time. The changes have been based on a variety of considerations, including shifts in extent to which various psychological approaches were in favor. The first (2) and second (3) editions of DSM were written with psychoanalytic theory as subtext. These DSMs defined, labeled, and described disorders in relation to presumed psychoanalytic causal factors. For example, DSM-II defines depression as follows: Depressive Neurosis: This disorder is manifested by an excessive reaction of depression due to an internal conflict or to an identifiable event such as loss of a love object or cherished possession (40). The constructs of neurosis, internal conflicts, and love objects all are associated with psychoanalytic theory. The DSM-III (4) and subsequent revisions (5) reflect a shift not only in their language but also in their authors' paradigms. (6) No longer Freudian in definitions of disorders, their symptoms, and causes, DSM-III and its successors have chosen language of contemporary science to define mental disorders. The DSM-III is notable in its shift from language of unconscious causes and motives--constructions that are difficult to investigate with contemporary empirical methods--to current language of science: lists of quantifiable, specific symptoms that are intended to be atheoretical. …",

We show that this pattern holds (Experiment 1), but only when creativity is socially valued (Experiment 2). Finally, especially individualistic people are more creative under MS when they can leave a legacy than when they cannot, and high originality predicts subsequent accessibility of death thoughts (Experiment 3).

The noun describes the feeling or emotion one has upon resigning oneself to an unalterable situation. The Danish adjectival form, resigneret, similarly expresses the awareness of having resigned and knowing this to be the case.1 But resignation, as Kierkegaard understands it, is not merely passivity, wherein one simply gives up hope, and with it all effort.

      "title": "The Sting of Intentional Pain",
      "abstract": "When someone steps on your toe on purpose, it seems to hurt more than when the person does the same thing unintentionally. The physical parameters of the harm may not differ your toe is flattened in both cases but the psychological experience of pain is changed nonetheless. Intentional harms are premeditated by another person and have the specific purpose of causing pain. In a sense, intended harms are events initiated by one mind to communicate meaning (malice) to another, and this could shape the recipient's experience. This study examined whether self-reported pain is indeed higher when the events producing the pain are understood as intentionally (as opposed to unintentionally) caused by another person. Although pain was traditionally conceived to be solely physical in nature (Aydede, 2005), its experience varies substantially with psychological context. The placebo analgesia effect, for example, is the reduction of pain without a change in physical stimulation when context, expectations, or sugar pills challenge the interpretation of a sensation as painful (e.g., Fields, 2008). The nocebo effect, in turn, is the experience of pain without any physical stimulation as when participants report headaches when told that a (nonexistent) electric current is passing through their heads (Schweiger & Parducci, 1981). These variations in pain experience seem to depend on the meaning of the stimulus: A sugar pill is meant to decrease pain, whereas electric current is meant to increase pain. In an interpersonal context, the meaning of an action is derived from the perceiver's perceptions of the actor's intention (Clark, 1996), which means that intentional harms, unlike accidental harms, are meant to cause pain. The possibility that the malicious intent of other people could be translated into additional physical pain is suggested by studies demonstrating that similar areas of cortex respond to both physical pain and social harms (Eisenberger, Lieberman, & Williams, 2003). Social harms, which are presumably laden with intention, have also been shown to be more painful to relive than simple physical harms (Chen, Williams, Fitness, & Newton, 2008). So, although a broken toe (or electric shock) may hurt, an intentionally broken toe (or electric shock) should hurt more. METHOD",

      "abstract": "Nature does things well, but sometimes it takes crooked paths... In psychoanalysis, the role of the psychoanalyst, as of any other therapist, is not only to set clinical goals, to understand the psychic work of the patient and to accompany him in his self-discovery. Above all, it is supposed to manage the internal conflicts of the suffering subject. To do this, he seeks to shed light on his unconscious journey and detect the vagaries of his psychic functioning. He try to act on his commitment, motivation and adherence to the values of the society in which he lives, without hindering his subjectivity. This human mission is often complex because individuals are free and autonomous beings. They should not be treated as if they were instruments of any society. These people are also specific: they each have a particular childhood and social background. They have a different history and heritage, do not have the same ambitions, the same responsibilities, or the same dreams or professional goals. In short, individuals are very heterogeneous. This increases the difficulty of supporting them therapeutically and requires helping them to flourish despite their traumas. However, the trauma and the emotional emptiness it causes, added to the pain it causes, create a strong internal uncertainty in the patient. The psychoanalyst must endeavour to take this into account. The effectiveness of the intervention depends on the psychoanalyst's ability to understand and analyze the patient's behaviour in light of the psychological evidence. In this article, we will look at clinical cases representing essential facets of human behavior as well as the theories behind them. The approach is quintessentially Freudian. These conceptual foundations provide the clinic with levers for action to heal people. We analyze human behavior according to the social environment with which it interacts and which will cause its pathology to evolve... thus forging one's own nature.",

      "title": "The Doppelgänger Phenomenon and Death: A Peculiar Case of Homicide by a Subject with First-Episode Psychosis",
      "abstract": "The Doppelgänger phenomenon refers to the experience of a direct encounter with one's self, characteriswed by: (i) the perception of a figure with one's own identical physical features; or (ii) the apprehension that the perceived figure shares the same personality and identity. The Doppelgänger does not only look like the same person, it is his/her double. The perceptual element is usually a hallucination, although occasionally a false perception of an actual figure may be involved. This phenomenon has been described in individuals suffering from overwhelming fear, severe anxiety or intoxication, epilepsy, as well as in the sleep-wakefulness transition. It has also been reported in major psychoses. The fear of imminent death often precedes the Doppelgänger experience. This report presents the case of a 30-year-old man, Mr. Y, who was stabbed to death by Mr. X, his \"double\". The aggressor and his victim, although not related, were truly doubles; remarkably, they shared the same name and surname, age, professional activity and place of work. Moreover, they attended the same sports center but barely knew each other. The forensic psychiatric evaluations in Mr. X, subsequent to the crime committed, were suggestive of a psychotic condition. This case is unique in the scientific literature. In the most serious psychotic forms, the issue of the \"double\" calls into question not only the dissociative processes involved in the etiopathogenesis of the disorder, but also bio-psycho-social elements, as well as personal data in this case, which made the victim and the aggressor \"identical\". In the context of psychopathological functioning, the delusional mood (Wahnstimmung) that precedes the development of delirium is a sort of gateway to an impending psychotic illness, involving delusional awareness or mood (atmosphere). In psychosis, splitting is the main issue and this influence is seen as an evil, foreign, apocalyptic and unknown side no longer recognised as belonging to the self even in a physical sense. In such a situation, it is felt that the only way to survive is by suppressing one's double as a defense against disorganisation of the self.",

The focus of this chapter is on the psychosocial knowledge required for successful interactions. Social beings are complex and their behavior is not entirely predictable; so also are some physical phenomena. But in coming to understand nonsocial objects, predictions about the behavior of those objects may be made with out concern for how those predictions may themselves alter the behavior of the objects. For example, predicting the weather is inherently fallible, because the system is so complex that very minor perturbations can have major unanticipated effects. But the predictions of weather scientists are not part of the system, and actions emanating from them do not affect the behavior of the system in any way. In contrast, a person within a social group of two or more people acts always with the knowledge that her own action may influence the actions of others in ways that she must be able to predict if she is to act intelligently.",

Is desire free? These questions and others arise from the urgent current need to think about a different and supportive world, different from the one we currently have which is in crisis, due to a pandemic that is nothing more than the reflection of a lifestyle that, not only was putting in check to nature - innumerable animal and plant species extinct by human footprint - but also to human life. If we reflect on what brought us to this situation, we will realize that the foundation of this crisis is found in an exacerbated hedonism, in the insatiable search for enjoyment and in the bottomless well of desires.\nBut obviously the problem is not enjoying or wishing, the problem is not knowing what, how and why we want, especially if we consider that this enjoyment often leads to the suffering of others. Obesity in some —which is already an approach to death— implies hunger in others —the systematic presence of painful death—, just to give one example. If this is so, then It is evident that our aesthetic direction is not only unclear, but it goes against our own life; But this was not a simple choice in a decisive historical moment in the life of each person, in any case It comes from a great colonial tradition, which is subverted into a neocoloniality, which, in the same tradition, but with increasingly refined resources It has created the sensitivity of Its time, has manipulated and directed It at will, so that the dominant system survives time. A colonial aesthetic distances people from their sensitivity, and those who are far from their sensitivity are far from knowing the world and inhabiting It, they settle for superficialities and move away from the enjoyment that life itself allows.",

      "title": "The Lived-Experience of Aggression in Secondary Schools in South Africa",
      "abstract": "Introduction According to Planalp (1999: 1) the world is forcing its inhabitants to come to terms with emotion. One of these emotions is aggression. Aggression is an integral part of a human being in relationship with his/her self, other persons and the environment. The external manifestations of aggression, whether constructive or destructive is not the starting point of aggression. Aggression develops from childhood and continues into adulthood. In this regard Chamberlain (2000: 2-4) even states that aggression can develop from before birth. Aggression starts within the psychological world of the individual. The way in which the individual interprets his/her perceptions will elicit an emotional response that will effect the person's decision on what to do with his/her interpretation of the world. What matters is the way in which it is expressed--either constructive or destructive behavior. Aggression is expressed in a constructive manner if it is about the survival and personal and healthy growth of the individual, family, group and/or the community. Aggression is expressed in a destructive manner if it harms self and/or others and/or the environment (Tesser, 1995:383-418). According to Kruger, Rech and Van Staden (1993: 9) aggression can be viewed as any type of behavior that is directed to harm, hurt, inflict pain or destroy another person when this person is motivated to avoid such behavior. Aggression can also be self-directed--consciously or unconsciously (self-critical, self-harm, verbal threats and assault). From literature it is clear that aggression should be viewed within a multi-dimensional perspective. Psychosocial, situational-environmental, and biological factors are all viewed as possible contributors to the manifestation of aggression. This indicates that the phenomenon of aggression is embedded within a specific psycho-socio-ecological context. Authors such as Barker (1968:1-9) and Myburgh (1981:7-8) emphasize the importance of studying human behavior and development within the psycho-socio-ecological context. This refers to the physical, social, psychological and volitional (values) environment (Myburgh, 1981:7-8). Psycho-social factors that contribute towards aggressive behavior include inability to cope with frustration; uncomfortable livelihood; exposure to aggressive models such as violence in the media and parents with aggressive behavior; poor socio-economic circumstances especially in urbanized areas; poor family relationships; times of social stress (such as a high inflation rate and increasing divorce statistics), and rejection by peers (Pepler & Sedighdeilami, 1998: 1; Morrisen, Robertson & Harding, 1998: 217; Solomon & Serres, 1999:339-340; Mooij, 1998: 374; Debaryshe & Fryxell, 1998: 205-214; Collings, 1994: 35-37; Pulkkinen & Ramirez, 1991: 69; Krager, Rech & Van Staden, 1993: 9-10). Situational-environmental factors that can contribute towards aggressive behavior include competitive sport; physical pain; anxiety; being in a crowd; and air and noise pollution (Smith & Furlong: 1998, 2021-202; Kruger, Rech & Van Staden, 1993: 10). Biological factors contributing to aggression include constitutional factors (a person's temperament); genetics; hormonal oactors; neuro-anatomical factors such as neurotransmission and neuro-logical disturbances (Mooij, 1998: 374; Kruger, Rech & Van Staden, 1993: 10-11). Currently the South African society is exposed to social stress such as high inflation rates, increasing divorce statistics, increasing suicide and increasing death rates related to AIDS. This can contribute to an increase in aggression in the society, and especially aggressive behavior by adolescents in secondary schools that are destructive in nature. Adolescents are exposed to such aggression but also expose other persons like their peers, parents, educators and school managers to aggression. …",

But an organism that could also (i) identify, defend against, and attack its foes, and (ii) identify and support its friends, would seem to have an even greater advantage. To identify is to allow discrimination – friend or foe? – the former classification being non–dangerous (potentially unharmful), the latter classification being dangerous (potentially harmful). For this, friend and foe must have distinguishable characters and the organism must both detect these characters, and know which characters are likely to associate with non-danger (friend) and which characters are likely to associate with danger (foe). After this discrimination, there must then be a response (either non–alarm, or alarm) that, in turn, would lead to a variety of other responses of an adaptive nature (e.g. escape from, or destroy, the foe).",

      "abstract": "Complexity is a term that is often invoked by those writing appreciatively about the taste, aroma/bouquet, and/or flavor of food and drink. Typically, the term is used as though everyone knows what is being talked about. Rarely is any explanation given, and the discussion soon moves on to other topics. However, oftentimes it is not at all clear what, exactly, is being referred to. A number of possibilities are outlined here, including physical complexity at the level of individual molecules, at the level of combinations of molecules giving rise to a specific flavor profile (e.g., as in a glass of quality wine or a cup of specialty coffee), at the level of combinations of distinct ingredients/elements (e.g., as when composing a particularly intricate dish in a high-end restaurant, say, or when pairing food with wine), and/or the number of stimuli/steps involved in the process of creation. Of course, people might also be referring to some aspect of their perceptual experience, and one of the intriguing questions in this space concerns the nature of the relationship(s) between these different ways of conceptualizing complexity in the chemical senses. However, given that physical/chemical and perceived complexity so often diverge, we argue that it is the latter notion, or rather inferred complexity, that is the most relevant when it comes to the chemical senses. Finally, we look at the role of expertise and review the evidence suggesting that inferred complexity can emerge either from a unitary taste experience that is judged to be complex, or from a tasting experience having multiple individuable elements.",

In psychoanalytic practice, analysts encounter a variety of patients who operate at different levels of anxiety or desire in regards to their objects. Some patients who exhibit control and conviction about self and object demonstrate borderline and narcissistic disorders that revolve around more persecutory phantasies. There are also patients who face a constant depressive and persecutory threat to themselves and their precious objects. They rely heavily upon idealization and projective identification to traverse their psychological standoff against these overwhelming anxieties. The subsequent defenses that are always in overuse to sustain the brittle ideal self or object and to prevent the aggressive, envious self from breaking through actually cause either the death/damage of the object or the rise of a persecutory object. Often it can be both, creating a dual fear and phantasy of loss and persecution.",

Therefore, 'unless each duly cares for himself, his care for others is ended by death; and if each thus dies, there remain no others to be cared for.'1 To the extent that a man is rational he will first address himself to his own survival and only then attempt to satisfy his less immediate needs, an attempt that usually exhausts his time and energy without providing as great a return as he would like. Even if he is fortunate and his resources are not exhausted, he may decide to save them to put things away for 'a rainy day.' In the former situation there is nothing to distribute to those in need; in the latter, kindliness ('helpfulness towards someone in need, not in return for anything, nor for the advantage of the helper himself2) does not seem to be consistent with a man's long-range self-interest. In either case, kindliness is not perceived as rational. To sum up : since kindliness is not rational in the face of death, and seldom rational when death is not imminent, it appears to follow that kindliness is generally not a rational act. At least four classic ethical traditions, Judaism, Christianity, Kantianism, and Utilitarianism (especially Mill's theory), reject this argument. Each maintains that there is a duty to help others and that this duty, the duty of beneficence, when properly understood is not irrational.",

Compulsive drug use may therefore be seen as an attempt to obliterate particular states of mind. In this paper addicts are considered as dangerously addicted to a loss of contact with parts of the mind as they are to a given drug. A splitting off, for example, of loving and nurturing or hateful parts of the personality is effected where these cannot be tolerated by or integrated into a pathological internal constellation. Deficits in early caregiving and environment as well as constitutional factors play a part in this. Addiction is therefore seen as an unconscious attempt to maintain a precarious inner equilibrium by destroying contact with parts of the personality, literally through their drugging. In psychic reality or in phantasy this may be felt as a slicing up or tearing to pieces, and so subjugation of objects. A clinical example will illustrate this idea.",

If an individual’s behavior or motives are altruistic, one shows concern for the happiness and welfare of other people rather than just for oneself. One is selfless and not selfish. To express it in another way, altruism is the renunciation of the self and an exclusive concern and care for the welfare of others. It is a traditional virtue in many cultures and a core aspect of various religious traditions. Giving alms to the poor is often considered an altruistic action in many cultures and religions. Altruism is also a motivation to provide a value to a party who must be anyone but the self, while duty and loyalty are somewhat moral obligation of a person toward a specific individual (God or a king) or collective body (a government). Some individuals may feel both altruism and duty, while others may not. Pure altruism is an instinctively “giving” value without any regard to rewards or the benefits that recognition of the giving may bring. The term altruism may also refer to an ethical doctrine that claims that individuals are morally obliged to benefit others. Used in this sense, it is the opposite of egoism.",

ICD-10's definition of trauma is: \"an event that is outside the range of usual human experience and that would be markedly distressing to almost anyone\". But what is the role of pre-morbid mental health status and the reason for different presentations in survivors of the same event? The vulnerability theory applies here. Vulnerability in psychic function originates from previous experiences, particularly in childhood when the internal world is still developing and external experiences are able to shape it. Therefore we can summarise that quantity and intensity of an external event would determine whether or not the survivor would be affected by that incident, whereas the quality of interaction between this event and previous experiences of person (vulnerability) would determine the presentation and, particularly, the long term consequences of that traumatic event. In the first 48 hours, the survivor needs and wishes to find something or someone he can perceive, even temporarily, as offering primary maternal care. For many this will be a pressing need to return home. After the first 48 hours, people feel urge to start talking about incidence. These are considered as normal stress reaction. But in some survivors (who are vulnerable), they may remain in the first stage of regression for longer or feel overwhelmed by unmanageable aspects of their experience and show prolonged symptoms known as PTSD. Both of these conditions need outside help and treatment.",

      "abstract": "SUMMARY Social cues of threat are widely reported [1–3], whether actively produced to trigger responses in others, such as the emission of alarm calls, or by-products of an encounter with a predator, like the defensive behaviors themselves, such as an escape flight [4–14]. Although the recognition of social alarm cues is often innate [15–17], in some instances it requires experience to trigger defensive responses [4,7]. One mechanism proposed for how learning from self-experience contributes to social behavior is that of auto-conditioning, whereby subjects learn to associate their own behaviors with the relevant trigger events. Through this process the same behaviors, now displayed by others, gain meaning. [18,19 but see: 20]. Although it has been shown that only animals with prior experience with shock display observational freezing [21–25] suggesting that auto-conditioning could mediate this process, evidence for this hypothesis was lacking. Previously we found that when a rat freezes, the silence that results from immobility triggers observational freezing in its cage-mate, provided the cage-mate had experienced shocks before [24]. Hence, in our study auto-conditioning would correspond to rats learning to associate shock with their own response to it – freezing. Using a combination of behavioral and optogenetic manipulations, here we show that freezing becomes an alarm cue by a direct association with shock. Our work shows that auto-conditioning can indeed modulate social interactions, expanding the repertoire of cues that mediate social information exchange, providing a framework to study how the neural circuits involved in the self-experience of defensive behaviors overlap with the ones involved in socially triggered defensive behaviors.",

In other cases as in the amount of shading, degree of hairiness, &amp;c., it might be possible by counting scales or hairs to obtain a numerical estimate of the character, but the labour in the case of several hundreds or a thousand individuals becomes appalling.

The first experiment shows that intentional violations are judged to be worse than accidental ones, regardless of whether they are harm or purity violations—for example, Sam poisons his colleague versus Sam eats his dog, when participants judge how morally responsible was Sam for what he did, or how morally wrong was what Sam did. The second experiment shows that violations of others are judged to be worse than violations of the self, regardless of whether they are harm or purity violations, when their content and context is matched—for example, on a tropical holiday Sam orders poisonous starfruit for dinner for his friend, or for himself, versus on a tropical holiday Sam orders dog meat for dinner for his friend, or for himself. Moral reasoning is influenced by whether the violation was intentional or accidental, and whether its target was the self or another person, rather than by the moral domain, such as harm or purity.",

      "abstract": "Language is a universal means of expression. With language we can\ncommunicate our experience, our thoughts, and even our aspirations to others.\nLanguage, however, is not only for communication. Words allow us to classify\nobjects in the world. By the use of language we make sense of our experiences\nin a very structured and elaborate way. We can ‘class’ objects together and we\ncan make subtle distinctions between them. We can predict certain qualities that\nmay be found in an object by comparing our own experience with the internal\nlist of objects that fits the same class as the object being observed. For example,\na child’s first confrontation with a puppy may result in a variety of experiences.\nIf the puppy is friendly and quiet and allows the child to play or cuddle it, the\nchild’s first experience will, in the main, be a pleasurable one. If, on the other\nhand, the puppy barks or growls or even bites the child, the outcome will be\nquite different. Whatever the outcome the child will probably add to his or her\ngrowing vocabulary either the word ‘dog’ or ‘puppy’ (or perhaps ‘Rover’,\n‘Shep’, ‘Snapper’ etc.). On the second occasion that this child comes into\ncontact with a dog, the child will most probably remember the first experience.\nIt is likely that the child will utter the appropriate label, ‘dog’ or ‘Rover’\nalthough the experience may well be of a different dog altogether. What is\nimportant is that the child has started to classify his or her experience and by so\ndoing can start to predict the potential outcome of the encounter and to act\naccordingly, either by attempting to play or by moving away in fright. The word\n‘dog’ helps to classify differences; for example, ‘cats’ are often like puppies in\nappearance but do not fit the same class.",

It need not correlate with the reality to an external observer of physical or psychological disability. Psychoanalytic emphasis is directed to the motivations for the persistence of this sense of defect, rather than primarily to etiology (trauma) or genetic history. Accurate perception and evaluation, having been interdicted during childhood, is avoided with the magical hope that thereby one will be acceptable and what is wrong will disappear. The interaction between self and parents, real and fantasied, cannot be clearly known. The patient remains uncertain as to what is wrong, in whom it is located, and how it has come about. The sense of defect, physical or psychological, becomes the nidus around which much is crystallized. This is then offered up to a parent (and the superego) as an appeasement and seduction, aiming to help this parent feel better by agreeing that the child is indeed the cause of what is wrong. Dangerously destructive (and sexual) wishes are defended against and atoned for by emphasis on one's defectiveness.",

This shared reality includes the message that the world either has accomplishments to be promoted, inducing a promotion focus, or has dangers and mistakes to be prevented, inducing a prevention focus. Evidence is presented that these different types of regulatory focus influence both people's memory for different life events and their emotional responses to them. Evidence is also presented that: (a) self-regulatory confusion occurs when shared reality with different significant others about desired selves is in conflict; (b) alienation is produced when there is a lack of shared reality with others about one's actual self; and (c) people prefer information about their actual selves that is shared with significant others as compared to equally self-relevant but unshared information. In these ways, shared reality shapes the world that we experience.",

It is claimed to be a central element in word learning, by which a child comes to realize that the object in question is named or described by an interlocutor's words. It is also considered an important diagnostic for the child's growing awareness of another's “mind,” capable of attention distinct from the child's own. The complexities of joint attention in human interaction, however, extend well beyond such a static and limited canonical case, to include other sensory modalities, involving attention over sometimes extended time spans, and implying transformations and reconstruals of the “object” attended to, including its possible conjoint and collaborative constitution by multiple participants through different linguistic modalities, including sign language.",

In the design and organization of physical settings, the human properties of the individual are ignored, oversimplified, or implicitly assumed, because of the influence of such socioenvironmental values as scientific‐technological progress, urbanism, pseudoprogress (novelty and change), and the value placed on an ever increasing acceleration of technological change. Spaces and places are improperly designed not only in physical terms; designs overlook human needs for privacy, territoriality, freedom of choice, etc., and the conceiving of the individual as a simple “machine man.” Unintended consequences are often ignored and no attempt is made to evaluate just how well the setting actually works. The danger is that the person will adjust and at the price of a continuing erosion of the properties that make him distinctively human. It is imperative that as behavioral scientists turn to the systematic study of man/environment problems they recognize the need to maintain the contextual reality and integrity of any such problem as it evolves, develops, and becomes modified in the time framework of a complex society.",

      "title": "Tracking objects, Tracking agents",
      "abstract": "Animals and humans have to keep track of individuals in their environment, both in perception (sensorimotor tracking) and in cognition (e.g., spatio-temporal localization and linguistic reference via memory, communication and reasoning). Items that are typical targets for tracking are things such as stationary physical objects (e.g., rocks, plants, trees, buildings, or attached artifacts), moving physical objects (e.g., animals, certain artifacts) and human beings. All such items are located in a spatial environment, persist over time, and are – or at least closely related to, in the case of conspecifics' bodies – physical objects that respect non trivial objecthood criteria such as having cohesive parts, following continuous spatio-temporal paths, or possessing causal powers and dispositions. Perceptually tracking these objects through space and over time requires possessing sensorimotor systems (e.g., the oculomotor system, the visuo-haptic system or the auditory system) that can anchor into and smoothly pursue objects' properties. Nonetheless, one may suspect that tracking intentional agents (i.e. creatures to whom it is natural to attribute intentional states such as beliefs, plans, desires, and who may even participate in shared intentionality), as opposed to physical objects without mental states (i.e. objects which are not intentional agents) exploits or requires further abilities and strategies. In particular, at least for humans, tracking conspecifics amounts to tracking intentional agents. This raises the question of how the perceptual tracking of non-intentional objects relates to the keeping track of intentional agents. Here, we propose an extension and augmentation of recent work on object-tracking to the tracking of intentional agents. Based on the examination of the elementary procedures available for pursing agency, our principal suggestions are as follows. First, identifying intentional agents is significantly dependent upon the perceptual abilities of physical-object tracking, and might therefore be explained by the ‘object-file' hypothesis (this hypothesis is explained in section 3), which we suggest to use in the study of the tracking of intentional agents (section 4). In the most elementary case, humans track intentional agents as physical objects: they track such agents by tracking their bodies (section 5). Even though this kind of tracking is insufficient for keeping track of human individuals ‘as' intentional agents (and explaining their behavior with an intentional stance), it may suffice to explain a number of interacting and situated behaviors in social contexts with intentional agents. Second, however, tracking intentional agents ‘as' intentional agents requires additional capacities for detecting and understanding intentional states and certain further properties which creatures with such states can exhibit (section 6) – e.g., (ir/)rationality, and the capacity to participate in shared intentionality. We note, however, that tracking a human individual as an intentional agent may require an appeal to specific perceptual cues and may even recruit basic sensorimotor skills – such as the detection of biological motions – whose tracking might be independent of the understanding of conspecifics' mental states. For reasons of parsimony and computational economy, unless we have reason to think that there is a separate system devoted to tracking intentional agents, we should suppose that the same mechanism used to track physical objects is recruited for tracking intentional agents.",

      "title": "Beyond deﬁnition: violence in a global perspective",
      "abstract": "This article proposes that violence may be most usefully thought about as a psychological rather than a behavioural phenomenon. Violence, it is contended, is a pathological variant of aggression, where 'aggression' is used to describe a particular part of the range of affective endowments possessed by human beings. We might think about aggression as a 'set' of which violence is a subset. As an affective endowment, aggression requires integration during development and this is supplied initially by an infant's primary carers and later by other important objects and institutions in the environment and culture in which the growing child lives. In the absence of the required conditions for enabling psychological integration to take place, rather than integration, disintegration holds sway with the aggressive affects denied or dissociated from. In this instance the affects do not become part of the affective repertoire upon which the individual can draw in order to orientate him or herself to their environment and in particular objects in the environment. Instead the affect is experienced as exterior and other and in some circumstances as violating. In this circumstances violence is resorted to as a way of escaping from the experience of overwhelming affects, for example by evoking in another affective experiences that cannot be tolerated within the self. Clinical case material is used to illustrate this.",

      "abstract": "The focus of this paper is the requirement that the use of live animals in experiments and in vivo assays should never be allowed if those uses involve severe suffering. This requirement was first implemented in Danish legislation, was later adopted by the European Union, and has had limited uptake in North America. Animal suffering can arise from exposure to a wide range of different external and internal events that threaten biological or social functions, while the severity of suffering may be influenced by the animals' perceptions of their own situation and the degree of control they are able to exert. Severe suffering is more than an incremental increase in negative state(s) but involves a qualitative shift whereby the normal mechanisms to contain or keep negative states at arm's length no longer function. The result of severe suffering will be a loss of the ability of cope. The idea of putting a cap on severe suffering may be justified from multiple ethical perspectives. In most, if not all, cases it is possible to avoid imposing severe suffering on animals during experiments without giving up the potential benefits of finding new ways to cure, prevent, or alleviate serious human diseases and generate other important knowledge. From this it follows that there is a strong ethical case to favor a regulatory ban on animal experiments involving severe suffering.",

Increasing efforts have been put in the understanding of what causes these phantom sensations and several psychological states and traits have been found to be associated.

Future studies are encouraged to conduct longitudinal research in which the different forms of phantom sensations are independently examined and not as a catch‐all container concept.",

The Behaviourists, however, consider anxiety as an acquired/learned behaviour from the environment in which a person lives in terms of positive and negative reinforcements. Behaviourists do not believe in the unconscious motives, but they explain anxiety in terms of action-response classical conditioning, that is, the association of a new motive with an old one. The new motive becomes able to recall the old motive's response (7). This means that anxiety is an acquired, conditioned response of fear; and the individual is unaware of its normal, original impetus (6). Whereas Humanists see anxiety as fear of the future, and that each future event bears a threat to one's existence and humanity. Anxiety stems from what an individual expects to happen and not from the individual's past (6).",

Like other break-away behaviors, we understand these as corporeal embodiments anchored, in both form and substance, more on the side of psychic productions than passages-to-the-act that are known to short-circuit thinking. These behaviors are linked in part to a conscious intent that embodies the erasure, or emptying of inner tensions out of oneself, “getting a handle on them,” which is synonymous with control, the transposition of psychic suffering into palpable, visible percepts and the attempt to have an effect on people around the adolescent, in order to obtain recognition and favorable rearrangements. They are also unconscious and very condensed, carrying out attempts at figuration which give form and substance to psychic representations that the subject suffering in his identity tries to avoid or cover up. Most of the adolescents in question cannot put this suffering into words. In order to prepare them for psychic work, we think it is necessary to gradually ally emotion with representation and act with speech. This can be through therapeutic acts able to foster re-binding, offered as supports to figuration. We give some examples from the experience of our staff, which for the past 15 years has been organizing brief hospital stays for suicidal youths in a specialized unit.",

      "abstract": "People are fundamentally social beings and enjoy connecting with others, sometimes reaching out to others—whether simply to say hello and to check in on how others are doing with a brief message, or to send a small gift to show that one is thinking of the other person. Yet despite the importance and enjoyment of social connection, do people accurately understand how much other people value being reached out to by someone in their social circle? Across a series of pre-registered experiments, we document a robust underestimation of how much other people appreciate being reached out to. We find evidence compatible with an account wherein one reason this underestimation of appreciation occurs is because responders (vs. initiators) are more focused on their feelings of surprise at being reached out to; such a focus on feelings of surprise in turn predicts greater appreciation. We further identify process-consistent moderators of the underestimation of reach-out appreciation, finding that it is magnified when the reach-out context is more surprising: when it occurs within a surprising (vs. unsurprising) context for the recipient and when it occurs between more socially distant (vs. socially close) others. Altogether, this research thus identifies when and why we underestimate how much other people appreciate us reaching out to them, implicating a heightened focus on feelings of surprise as one underlying explanation.",

When this happens, we may then fulfil our obligation to care for the other person not out of loving concern for them, but from other motives, such as the self-righteous satisfaction of having done our duty, or out of fear of not doing it. We thus find ourselves in a contradictory situation, of being faced by a demand on the one hand, which it is impossible to satisfy on the other, as the demand should not have arisen as a demand at all. When it does arise, we seem to be faced with a decision whether to act, and obey the demand for care; but for the agent who genuinely loves the other person, no such decision situation will arise, as no other option will appear to be available to them.",

      "abstract": "The contributions of Jagarlamudi et al1 and Bergamo2 to this issue of Infectious Diseases in Clinical Practice remind us of the health risks shared by human and nonhuman animal species. This human-animal-ecosystem interface has been described by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a continuum of direct or indirect human exposure to animals, their products, and their environments.3 In this continuum of exposure then, it should come as no surprise that animals may act as sentinel species for human disease1,4 or that another human may act as a sentinel species for another’s zoonotic disease after common animal exposure.2 Health care providers, both human and veterinary, are responsible for the historical exploration and the detailed unmasking of these complicated species interfaces. Such clinical discovery often requires a painstakingly detailed history of “pets, or travel, or dietary habits, or sexual escapades, or home improvement projects, or assorted hobbies” by an inquiring oftentimes obsessive-compulsive physician!5 The result of human-animal-ecosystem interactions and the subsequent historical connections made to these interactions by an inquiring physician is usually an “interesting case”—a case presented as an idiosyncrasy when it may only be the tip of the zoonotic iceberg. Given the constant human-animal-ecosystem exposures of numerous individuals throughout their daily activities with domestic animals, wild animals, animal vectors, animals foods, and even animal palliative care,6,7 it is probably surprising that more such zoonotic disease is not diagnosed on a routine basis. Emerging and reemerging diseases most commonly arise from animal sources as has occurred with HIV infection, influenza variants, severe acute respiratory syndrome, and others.8 In the case of human pulmonary cryptococcosis reported in this issue of IDCP,1 the patient’s pet cat was a harbinger of human disease, and both animal and owner probably contracted cryptococcosis from environmental exposure to pigeon excreta from a pigeon roost surrounding the patient’s (and patient’s cat’s) porch. In Bergamo’s report of siblings with disseminated cat scratch disease (CSD) in this issue, the first sibling acted as a diagnostic harbinger of illness for the second sibling with hepatosplenic disseminated cat scratch disease, and both had exposure to the family’s kitten—the face of the younger sibling having been licked by the kitten!2 After 34 years of experience in the field of clinical infectious diseases, I am still awed by the diagnostic pearls uncovered by a careful, tedious, detailed, ongoing, and personalized medical history as demonstrated by these current and other case reports.1,2,5,7 The world is an interactive environmental wonderland, and only when we as physicians realize the vast nature of the human-animal-ecosystem interface will we more quickly discover the benefits of using detailed histories and shared zoonotic disease information to both patients’ and animals’ benefits. The WHO3,6 and the One Health Initiative8 have recognized the need for professional and multidisciplinary cooperation and collaboration among physicians, veterinarians, dentists, nurses, microbiologists, immunologists, environmental scientists, and ecosystem specialists throughout the world. As the global burden of zoonotic infection expands9–11 and as we continuously teach ourselves to routinely probe the historical harbingers of zoonotic disease processes,1,2,4 we will find greater need and benefit to partner with our many colleagues from the fields of veterinary medicine, dentistry, microbiology, immunology, and environmental/ecosystem sciences to diagnose and prevent such diseases. We face “The Perpetual Challenge of Infectious Diseases”11—we can stand stronger and longer as we ally with all members of the ecosystem’s medical team in a joint and collaborative effort to benefit human, animal, and ecosystem health care initiatives.3,6,8",

      "abstract": "One reason that theories of mental illness have made little progress may be their focus on individuals, omitting the social/relational and emotional world. Adding these components will be difficult, however: in modern societies they have become virtually invisible, particularly the emotion of shame. The theory outlined here is based on the work of Cooley, Elias, Lewis and Goffman: shame is both social and individual and, if anticipation is included, virtually omnipresent in modern societies. It is proposed that most symptoms of mental illness are products of shame and relational feedback loops: emotion and alienation can both spiral leading to further alienation and chaotic or hidden emotions. Almost everyone is especially ashamed of their shame. Being ashamed of one's shame and/or anger can spiral when not acknowledged. Under certain conditions, these spirals continue without limit, generating immense force for acting out symptoms or depression. To the extent that this theory is true, we would need to rename the field using non-medical terms, such as emotional/social dysfunction.",

Philosophers who have studied games to determine their nature have evidently established two hypotheses: on the one hand, that all games can be studied collectively, as though the essence of the game were common to all, and on the other hand, that the answer to the problem lies in the subject, or who plays, and not in the game itself considered as an object. The question then is to determine the psychological, biological or social reasons that induce men or animals to play, the inclinations that are involved, but not the external structures to which games must conform in order to please or to be adopted.",

      "abstract": "Adulteration is the wilful addition to an article of any substance or substances the presence of which is not acknowledged in the description under which the article is sold, or the abstraction from an article of an essential constituent without disclosing that it is impoverished. Some common synonyms are: corruption, defilement, debasement, vitiation and sophistication, all of which indicate the sinister nature of the act. Articles are adulterated to increase their weight or bulk, and to improve or change their appearance or flavour in imitation of an article of higher grade or different kind. In the limiting case it can be regarded as covering the complete substitution of one article for another. Wilful addition implies addition which could have been avoided and hence covers contamination brought about by lack of care. The term is used mainly in connexion with foods and drugs, but in practice extends to almost all manufactured products and is an almost inseparable accompaniment of trade competition. It will be observed that there are two requirements for adulteration, viz. an action and an intention. The mere act of mixing one thing with another does not, in itself, warrant the term adulteration. It must be coupled with an intention to deceive by passing off the mixed article as if it were unmixed. The intention is usually not apparent until some circumstance warrants the inference, such as the sale or exposure for sale of the article. The inclusion of such concepts as wilfulness and intention, which are much more difficult to prove than facts, introduces difficulties and prevents in practice the employment of a simple definition without provisions being made to protect the honest man from injustice. Accidental contamination or impurities unavoidably present, if not due to neglect or lack of reasonable care, are not normally regarded as adulteration unless the impurity is dangerous to health. In this country the only law which deals directly with adulteration is the Food and Drugs Act. The present Act, that of 1938, prohibits :—",

      "abstract": "The purpose of the study is to study and define unmotivated (idiopathic) aggression of animals (dogs) as behavior when there is a motive, but it was not seen or understood. Among the variety of behavioral forms in animals, in dogs in particular, a special place is occupied by behaviors that are expressed in the form of aggression. Establishing the place of unmotivated (idiopathic) aggression of animals (dogs) in this series, as behavior, is important when developing certain legislative acts that determine a certain attitude towards animals in general, especially aggressive in their behavior towards humans. When solving issues regarding humane and responsible attitude towards animals, in relation to the concept of “unmotivated aggression of animals” it is necessary to understand what animal behavior is, forms of their behavior, whether unmotivated aggression of animals is a particular form of behavior. In general, unmotivated aggression in an animal (dog) should be understood as its defensive behavior, expressed in going beyond the stereotypical behavior typical of an animal of a given species and manifested in the form of aggression towards a person and (or) an animal, not caused by any external cause (factor).",

      "abstract": "The past several years have seen an explosion of research in the area of spirituality and health. However, confusion and incomprehension of the conception of spirituality (e.g. confounding spirituality with various conventional views on religiousness) hampers better understanding in this area. The present paper proposes definition of spiritual phenomena in man based on natural epistemological and instrumental criteria (whether a certain phenomenon can be objectively known and evoked): spiritual phenomena in man are those, which cannot be objectively known nor evoked, but which act (e.g., love, idea). Spiritual phenomena can be really known only in the self (\"in spirit\"). Objectively known can be only manifestations of spiritual phenomena. Some attributes of love (e.g. its personal uniqueness) or ideas (e.g., sense of own life) whose satisfaction appears to be important for health are briefly outlined. A review of some frequently cited recent papers investigating the role of spirituality in health and discussion of frequent pitfalls in this area is given. Spirituality is a universal human phenomenon. All human beings, secular or religious, encounter with spiritual phenomena. Although the present conception of spirituality distances from some conventional views on religiousness, it is not atheistic. On the contrary, it accommodates the basic religious concept \"God is love\". Conceptual clarification is essential for further progress in the study of impact of spirituality on health.",

      "abstract": "The observations that animals obstructed in the execution of a particular ongoing or customary activity (e.g. attacking, copulating) tend either to direct the same activity toward another object or to engage in a completely different activity (e.g. doodling, grooming, preening) have traditionally been described as ‘displacement phenomena’. Both psychologists and ethologists currently interpret these phenomena in terms of some kind of displacement mechanism , which is assumed to displace the ‘energy’ or ‘drive’ from one reaction system to another. This type of interpretation is vague and ad hoc , and at best provides only a redundant description of the observed phenomena. The alternative interpretation proposed here looks upon the problem of the occurrence of the so‐called displacement activities as a special case of the general question of the factors determining the occurrence of any activity that exists in an animal's repertoire. In particular, it is suggested that all instances of displacement phenomena can be adequately accounted for in terms of the operation of three factors: ( a ) an increase in the level of arousal of the animal brought about by the obstructing event, ( b ) the relative habit strengths of the various activities in the repertoire of the animal, and ( c ) the nature of the sensory cues provided by the altered stimulus situation. This formulation incorporates the important ethological and psychological findings, and provides an interpretation of displacement phenomena which is not ad hoc and which suggests new lines of experimental work.",

Or simply say that redundancy is the overgrowth of individual organs, plant population that expose negative effects to aim production of individual organs, population and community performance etc. To reduce the living body to a suitable level, the performance of organs, individuals, population, community and ecosystem, to human's benefit, will be increased, we call the living body redundancy. The process of redundancy occurring is the process of functional extension and its existence is helpful to maintain the stability of individuals, population and even community. According to level of redundancy that exists in life system, redundancy can be divided into individuals, population and community. Compensation or overcompensation could be realized through the reduction of the redundancy, which occurs on different levels of life system, i.e. the production of aim organs or performance of aim species population could be improved through reduction of redundancy, and the increase of the production is based on the reduction of stability of life system to variable environments.",

The self is not a phenomenon and is thus not accessible to the same kinds of scientific inquiry and measurement as are natural psychological constructs that are observable (e.g., human motor behavior). Self-esteem is nonsensical-cannot be measured through sensory data collection-and hence imaginary (Berlow, personal communication); as a result, an individual's self-esteem must be inferred, either by an individual's report of his/her sense of self (experienced self) or by reporting the individual's self-esteem (presented self). But the social science community has too readily accepted an individual's personal self-report of self-esteem as natural fact. The guiding, and unquestioned assumption has been that the individual alone has access to the self. Who are we as outsiders to question this source of data? Few self-esteem researchers have used others to infer self-esteem-and thus they have relatively little knowledge of the validity of their self-report data (Wells & Marwell, 1976).",

      "title": "The sciences on mental order/disorder and related concepts Normality, meaning, natural and social norms",
      "abstract": "Abstract Mental disorder and related concepts such as normality, function and meaning are the subject matter of sciences ranging from biology though to sociology, and the next broad topic, for Chapter 2, is what they have to say about them. Three points are noted about the sciences ‘basic to psychiatry’, including psychology, neuroscience and genetics. First, they search for causes of the conditions of interest, typically as defined by the psychiatric manuals; second, for this purpose it is immaterial whether these conditions are considered as disorders or not, and third, at least two of them – psychology and genetics – tend to be antithetical to the notion of disorder as discontinuous with the normal, or as meaningless/non-functional. Another basic science considered, neuroscience, has no notion of order/disorder independent of what derives from the distinction drawn at the psychological/behavioural level. In current models of psychopathology constructed in these basic sciences it is notable that meaningful/functional strategies typically play crucial roles, sometimes alongside other causal factors, including brain disease or lesion, or genetically based temperamental characteristics. These two characteristic features of the current science – that meaning has a causal role, and explanatory pluralism – are both signs of a paradigm shift that has been in progress roughly since the middle of the last century and which is crucial for the line of thought about mental disorder being pursued in this essay.The next main theme in Chapter 2 is that increasingly the biobehavioural sciences are embedded in evolutionary theory. From an evolutionary point of view, what stands out is the essential linkage between behaviour and specific environments and task demands, and the process of more or less successful adaptation to more or less benign or adverse environments. In this context, what sense can be made of mental disorder? While behaviour may be more or less adaptive relative to specific environments and task demands, and this for a variety of reasons, the idea that some behaviour is just ‘disordered’ has no clear rationale. Beyond the behavioural and brain sciences, the social sciences abound with theories of social functions and order, providing further scope for understanding what mental disorder may be. Sociological theories of mental disorder are relatively rare but they were prominent in the 1960s critiques of psychiatry and their influence continues. The sociological theories naturally tended to construe mental disorder as a kind of social deviance. This has much to be said for it, but it passes over distinctions among kinds of social deviance, some attributed to issues such as criminal intent and others to mental disorder, and it also passes over distinctions within mental disorders, in particular between the ‘behavioural’ disorders associated with antisocial activity, and emotional and other disorders that are characterized more by high levels of personal misery and help-seeking. A related problem is that problems at the individual level are not the focus of – are invisible to – social science and for this reason its grasp of what psychological dysfunction means is limited.Having reviewed some main approaches of the sciences to concepts involved in mental disorder, Chapter 2 concludes with considering the norms which demarcate order from disorder, and specifically the validity of the old natural/social distinction. On this topic the basic sciences have not much to say: they are interested in causes, not norms. Norms of function can be defined in an evolutionary theoretic framework, but here the ‘naturally evolved’ and the ‘social’ are blurred, and both of these factors also involve individual differences. There are three kinds of factor involved in the design of human action – the evolutionary biological, the cultural, and individual agency – and each of them corresponds to a way of interpreting function and dysfunction, and hence order and disorder.",

      "abstract": "Crises that occur after natural disasters are real and serious issues that can cause serious depression. A crisis is a situation in which a smooth process suddenly turns into a depression with negative, dangerous consequences. Since our country is in an earthquake-prone region and has experienced earthquakes with great losses, it has a very traumatic history. The concept of crisis, which spreads over a wide area, is a phenomenon that needs to be talked about by drawing boundaries. Natural disasters cause crises, and crises cause trauma. Resilience is the most effective way to deal with natural disasters and the traumas that follow. Resilience can be considered as the ability to adapt to the adverse conditions caused by external factors causing the crisis for disaster management. Psychological resilience is defined as the ability to cope with the negative consequences that may follow a natural disaster and adaptation to a negative situation. The phenomenon of resilience is important for both the individual and the society in societies where major natural disasters such as earthquakes are experienced. This definition of psychological resilience points to an approach that leaves the individual on his/her own in the face of disaster, crisis, and trauma by placing a great responsibility on the individual. However, individuals who have been exposed to natural disasters should not be left on their own and all opportunities should be mobilised to help them. Passive exposure to the wounds caused by natural disasters decays both the individual and the society. Instead, engaging in emotional, mental, social, and artistic investments and taking part in new and multiple fields will benefit the individual and the society in order to tackle the wounds.",

These emotions, along with anger, tend to disrupt the emotional homeostasis of the body, while the positive emotions such as contentment tend to restore homeostasis. The actions of anxiety and depression may be synergistic but they differ in important respects. Anxiety usually has an obvious cause and also a goal (safety, and the avoidance of danger), whereas depression usually has no obvious cause and also has no goal. Depression is thought to be related to social factors in relation to other human beings, whereas anxiety is related partly to social situations but also to non-social dangers. The strategies for dealing with human danger include submission, whereas this is not an appropriate response to non-human dan‐ ger. Anxiety is classically thought to be concerned with the threat of danger, whereas de‐ pression is thought to be the result of danger.

      "abstract": "Pain is a subjective expression. An individual learns its expression through experiences encountered in the early life. [1] Pain is an unpleasant emotional and sensory experience related to noxious or potentially noxious stimuli. In the medical model, pain is considered an expression of a disease which should be diagnosed and treated. Unfortunately, it is not always possible to establish a cause and diagnosis relating the symptoms. Attempts to identify a substantial cause repeatedly may lead to needless and occasionally harmful investigations and treatments. In such situations, establishing a precise diagnosis and the following eff ective management protocol is challenging. This paved the way for introduction of a biopsychosocial or biobehavioral model to explain the pathophysiology of chronic pain. In this model, pain is not divided into physical or psychological components. In fact, physical, psychological, and social factors are considered as mutually infl uential forces with the potential to create a vast number of distinctive pain experiences. The biologic system deals with the structural and molecular basis of a disease. The psychological system deals with the role of motivation and personality on the experience of illness and individual reactions toward it. The social system deals with cultural, environmental, and familial infl uences on the expression and experience of illness. Each system aff ects and is aff ected by all of the others.

      "abstract": "Survival depends upon the ability to recognize potential predators and competitors for scarce resources such as food, water and a safe resting place. Survivors also must be capable of elaborating appropriate aversive motivational states that support behaviors which result in (1) escape from a source of noxious and potentially life-threatening stimulation, (2) avoidance of stimuli that have in the past been associated with noxious stimulation, or (3) removal of a source of potentially noxious stimulation by aggression. All three require the activation of motivational states that are often call affective reactions (even though most investigators in this field find it difficult to define the term without reference to specific instances). It is important to note that under normal circumstances, these affective reactions are triggered by stimuli in the environment, external to the organism. Aversive motivation differs in this important respect from appetitive motivational states which are based on changes in the internal environment (although such external stimuli as the sight and smell of food do, of course, interact with the internal milieu and may, under some circumstances provide adequate stimulation of appetitive behavior).KeywordsLimbic SystemMotivational StateAggressive ReactionAffective ReactionSeptal LesionThese keywords were added by machine and not by the authors.

      "title": "ИНСТИНКТ БЕЗОПАСНОСТИ – СОЦИАЛЬНАЯ АДАПТАЦИЯ ИНСТИНКТА САМОСОХРАНЕНИЯ",
      "abstract": "The instinct of self-preservation can be considered as the main instinct, it is directly related to other instincts, such as: the maternal instinct, the instinct of hunger, thirst instinct, instinct of power, sexual instinct, and all of these instincts are responsible for the preserving life and its continuation. Nowadays, in the conditions of scientific and technological progress, man has developed the habitat and is going to develop a new habitat – technosphere, one feature of which is the progressive increase in the amount of dangers, such as: technological, social and political, biomedical, ecological, etc.; thus, in these changed circumstances the instinct of self-preservation can be described as the instinct for safety. The protective mechanisms generated by scientific and technological progress against the danger have not formed for a human in the process of evolution. An example is penetrating radiation, the consequences that may be the cause of death or a significant deterioration in human health. The consequences of penetrating radiation are well acknowledged, since no senses perceiving it and the perceived danger launches the instinct of self-preservation. The foundation of this launch is an instinctive fear for life and health. In the conditions of scientific progress growth rates and the amount of dangers generated by the progress, the instinct for safety is necessary as synonymous with the instinct of self-preservation. The justification of it can be the fact, that it’s not possible to stop the development of scientific progress, it will keep providing regular danger, because it’s unreal for the modern society to keep away from the benefits of civilization.At present, the security has become a constantly increasing social significance. The confirmation of the significance is the initiation of the mandatory subject «Safety of vital activity» at schools and universities. The subject «Safety of vital activity» for the universities is particularly important, since an alumnus of university becomes entitled to hold senior posts and responsibility for security of the managed enterprise and the team of employees. The chief has a moral, administrative responsibility and even criminal liability in the event of employee injury.Human instincts, in contrast to animal instincts, in which they are realized in full and unchanged form recorded in the genome, are controlled by it and subject to its conscious activity, formed in the process of its socialization. On this basis, individual authors replace the instinct of self-preservation in man with the concept of homeostatic regulation, also formed in the process of evolution. Homeostasis and homeostatic regulation in terms of its functional content is the instinct of the constancy of the internal environment of the organism, as well as all the instincts formed in the process of evolution. An illustrative example in the resolution of these contradictions is the description of the behavior of people in the wreck of such ships as the Titanic and Lusitania. The chances of survival were about 30%; on both ships there were not enough lifeboats. The difference was in the sinking speed. The speed of the sinking of ships affected the behavior of people: on board the rapidly sinking «Lusitania», everyone was for himself, so the most viable had more chances to escape. It should be noted that in both cases there was a pronounced stress. Slow sinking «Titanic» allowed people to follow the accepted social norms – to save in the first place children and women. At the same time, everyone realized that he was doing this to the detriment of himself, that is, ignored his own instinct of self-preservation. This analysis illustrates, that it takes time, there should be a certain place, favorable conditions and the personality in demonstration of the instinct of self-preservation by human, but it does not mean that the instinct is absent at the genome.",

      "abstract": "Aristotle's Forbidden Sweets JAMES BOGEN JULIUS MORAVCSIK I To ACT INCONTINENTLYis to do what one knows or strongly believes is not to be done (NE 1146b25-31).' Is incontinence possible? It is clear that one can do what one knows or believes is not to be done if one does it unintentionally or unknowingly. A man's conviction that champagne should not be spilled on the dress of the wife of his college's president will not prevent him from spilling it on her if he is tripped or if he mistakes her for someone else on whom champagne should be spilled. But Aristotle's question is whether a man can freely and intentionally do what he knows or believes he should not do when he realizes what it is that he is doing. Speaking very generally, Aristotle's answer is that a man may have knowledge or beliefs that have no influence on what he does on a particular occasion. For example, a man who is gripped by uncontrollable anger may fail to recall or consider something he knows or believes and so may act against that belief or bit of knowledge (1146b32ff.). In cases in which a belief or bit of knowledge plays no part in, determining an agent's behavior, incontinence is possible. It is only in cases where the belief or knowledge plays a fully active role in the determination of a man's action that incontinence is impossible (1146b35). Unfortunately, the details of Aristotle's view are less clear than its outline. How can we be said to retain a belief or bit of knowledge when it does not The authors constitute The West Coast Ancient Philosophy Collective. The general lines of this interpretation come from a meeting of the Northern California Aristotle reading group attended by the authors and Alan Code, David Glidden, Richard McKirahan, and Henry Mendell . Details of the interpretation came from comments from J. O. Urmson and extensive discussion with Charles Young, who made so many valuable and helpful suggestions that we offered him honorary membership in the collective, which he declined, saying that he preferred to appear in a footnote. 1 Unless otherwise noted, all references are to passages in the Nicomachaean Ethics (NE). [11:1 112 HISTORY or PHILOSOPHY determine our behavior? Which sorts of belief or knowledge are inactive in the incontinent man? In the Nicomachaean Ethics the most detailed discussion of a case of incontinence and the best place to look for the specifics of Aristotle's account is the following difficult and often discussed passage. [l] Again, we may also look to the cause of incontinence scientifically [physikos] in this way: On the one hand there is a universal belief, while the other belief is concerned with particular things over which perception is immediately authoritative [KvQi(~]. When one belief arises out of these it is necessary [&v~yKTI]in one case for the mind to affirm the conclusion, and with beliefs concerned with conduct [~v 8~ ~(~g z~QCtK~tKCffg] ~ one must act straightway. [1147a~4-28 ] [2] For example, if one should taste everything sweet, and this thing is sweet, being one of those particular things, then a man who is able and not being prevented must of necessity do this immediately. [ x147a28- 31 ] [3] And so, when there is in the mind one universal belief which forbids tasting, and another belief that every sweet thing is pleasant, and this is sweet (and this belief is active), then when desire happens to be present, the one belief tells us to avoid this, but desire leads us to it (for it can move each of the parts). 3 l1147a3t-35] [4] And so it turns out that one acts incontinently in some way under a principle or belief which is not in itself but is only incidentally opposed to the right belief [~ 8Q00~ L6y~] (for it is the desire and not the belief which is opposed). 4 [1147a35 lt47b2 ] [5] That is why animals are not incontinent; they do not have a grasp of universals, but they have only mental images and memories of particular things.

      "abstract": "In response to a stimulus, a sensation is tridimensional: qualitative, quantitative, and affective. The affective part of sensation, pleasure or displeasure, depends on the qualities of the stimulus. Within a narrow range of intensity, chemical, thermal, and mechanical stimuli are able to arouse pleasure. In addition, pleasure depends on the internal state of the subject. This is easily observed in the case of temperature: pleasure is is aroused by a warm stimulus in a hypothermic subject and by a cold stimulus in a hyperthermic subject and by a cold stimulus in a hyperthermic subject. This property of given stimulus in a hypothermic subject and by a cold stimulus in a hyperthermic subject. This property of a given stimulus to arouse pleasure or displeasure according to the internal state of the subject is termed alliesthesia. Alliesthesia is also produced by chemical and mechanical stimuli. Acquired preferences or aversions for alimentary stimuli represent a case of alliesthesia. In the same way, the capacity of any indifferent stimulus to become rewarding, or punishing, by association with some reward or punishment, is also a case of alliesthesia. In all cases, pleasure is a sign of a stimulus useful to the subject; displeasure a sign of danger. Usefulness and danger are judged by the central nervous system with reference to homeostasis and the set point of the implied regulation. Pleasure and displeasure thus appear to motivate useful behaviors.",

      "title": "The Psychology of Risk: A Brief Primer",
      "abstract": "Risk is commonly defined in negative terms-the probability of suffering a loss or factors and actions involving uncertain dangers or hazards. On the other hand, the term risk as used in the social sciences relies on simply the degree of uncertainty: It merely addresses how much variance exists among the possible outcomes associated with a particular choice or action. A counterintuitive example is the classifying of an investment that is certain to lose $5 as less risky than one that has an equal chance of yielding a gain of $10. Andreassen states that uncertainty and value are treated as separate entities because expanding the notion of risk to include gains as well as losses adds considerable conceptual power. Economic theories based on perfect rationality are undoubtedly powerful. Andreassen states that id one wanted to predict human behavior in the simplest manner, one would certainly begin by assuming that people are motivated by self-interest, and that they can be extremely calculating when valuable opportunities arise, learning quickly from the success of others. Research on the psychology of risk does not begin by assuming that all human behavior is irrational, random, or thoughtless. Rather, this research has centered on how people may be biased by myriad social influences, the perceived choices available, or the cognitive rules of thumb used to simplify difficult economic and social decisions.",

      "title": "The environmental causes and consequences of migration: a search for the meaning of ‘environmental refugees.’",
      "abstract": "The 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees defines a refugee as any person who, owing to a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political opinion, is outside the country of his nationality and is unable or, owing to such fear, unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country; or who, not having a nationality and being outside the country of his former habitual residence as a result of such events, is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to return to it. In 1985, El-Hinnawi identified a new class of persons known as ‘environmental refugees’. He defined environmental refugees as those people who have been forced to leave their traditional habitat, temporarily or permanently, because of a marked environmental disruption (natural and/or triggered by people) that jeopardized their existence and/or seriously affected the quality of their life. \r\n\r\nThis note seeks to understand whether highlighting environmental damage and degradation as a single cause of migration, or as a single consequence of migration, has any benefit. The term ‘environmental refugee’ will be examined from a legal perspective and from an environmental perspective. It will be asked whether the issue of environmental refugees is an environmental problem or a legal problem. The answer, that it is an environmental problem, will account for much of the confusion stemming from the term in international law. Finally, it will be asked whether highlighting environmental refugees, if not of benefit to the displaced persons, is of benefit to the environment.",

Although these specific behaviours would seem to be uniquely human, it is unclear whether the underlying psychology is unique to the species, or if other species might possess some form of this psychological mechanism as well. Here we show that great apes who have visually attended to a video together with a human (study 1) and a conspecific (study 2) subsequently approach that individual faster (study 1) or spend more time in their proximity (study 2) than when they had attended to something different. Our results suggest that one of the most basic mechanisms of human social bonding—feeling closer to those with whom we act or attend together—is present in both humans and great apes, and thus has deeper evolutionary roots than previously suspected.",

      "title": "Claims of Affect: Affectivity as a linguistic and sequential phenomenon",
      "abstract": "This study investigates how conversationalists use emotion in interaction. In analysing audio recordings of American English phone calls, a phenomenon labelled “claims of affect” was found. These are utterances which a speaker uses to claim a particular emotion that he or she feels at a certain point in time and is related to a certain set of events. Linguistically, the phenomenon is versatile in its design. However two main linguistic constructions have emerged. Each structure relies on copular verbs and affective terms. Yet pronoun use differs in each case. The first person pronoun I is commonly used to refer to the speaker herself whereas the third person pronoun it is found to function as a global reference that refers to abstract items such as events, situations and various circumstances. Claims can be located in “pre-cause” and “post- cause” positions. The cause should be understood as a trigger of the emotion that the speaker is claiming to feel. Pre-cause claims topicalise the cause whereas post-cause claims elicit either an aligning or disaligning response depending on the activity the conversationalists are engaged in.\r\nThe responses of second speakers are typically empathetic. By doing an empathetic response second speakers claim to have access to how the claimer feels. In one fragment, a second speaker has been observed to deny the claimer her right to feel in a certain way. This suggests that one aspect of emotion is that it is a public, social phenomenon and not the private, psychological one that some researchers have argued. Conversationalists negotiate their affective lives with their conversational partners in order for them to confirm that their emotional response to a situation is valid. Their partners will therefore judge if this is so. If it is not the case, they will orient the claimer towards it as being an unreasonable claim. This means that they must be appropriate to the cause. If considered invalid the claimer faces a dispreferred response from the second speaker.",

      "title": "Stress induced obesity: lessons from rodent models of stress",
      "abstract": "Stress was once defined as the non-specific result of the body to any demand or challenge to homeostasis. A more current view of stress is the behavioral and physiological responses generated in the face of, or in anticipation of, a perceived threat. The stress response involves activation of the sympathetic nervous system and recruitment of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. When an organism encounters a stressor (social, physical, etc.), these endogenous stress systems are stimulated in order to generate a fight-or-flight response, and manage the stressful situation. As such, an organism is forced to liberate energy resources in attempt to meet the energetic demands posed by the stressor. A change in the energy homeostatic balance is thus required to exploit an appropriate resource and deliver useable energy to the target muscles and tissues involved in the stress response. Acutely, this change in energy homeostasis and the liberation of energy is considered advantageous, as it is required for the survival of the organism. However, when an organism is subjected to a prolonged stressor, as is the case during chronic stress, a continuous irregularity in energy homeostasis is considered detrimental and may lead to the development of metabolic disturbances such as cardiovascular disease, type II diabetes mellitus and obesity. This concept has been studied extensively using animal models, and the neurobiological underpinnings of stress induced metabolic disorders are beginning to surface. However, different animal models of stress continue to produce divergent metabolic phenotypes wherein some animals become anorexic and lose body mass while others increase food intake and body mass and become vulnerable to the development of metabolic disturbances. It remains unclear exactly what factors associated with stress models can be used to predict the metabolic outcome of the organism. This review will explore a variety of rodent stress models and discuss the elements that influence the metabolic outcome in order to further extend our understanding of stress-induced obesity.",

      "abstract": "In the human brain, simple molecules and complex circuits are constantly making decisions which are indispensable for our survival and also to accomplish a variety of daily activities such as walking, memorizing, conversing, composing music, painting or poetry.... All are the result of the integration of many neural systems that perceive many and simultaneous visual, tactile, auditory and/or mental stimuli. Once synthetized, they are immediately transmitted to the corresponding executive systems, thus completing the fascinating functional loop of decision-making: a) perception of stimuli or information which originate in the environment, b) selection and elaboration of the decision which is considered more appropriate or attractive according to personal experience or intuition and c) execution. If these neural nets have been damaged or haven failed to develop the mechanisms of facilitation or inhibition that govern them become unbalanced. If inhibition is reduced, excessive and violent behaviour is expressed as in patients suffering from manic phases. Conversely, if inhibition is excessive, decision making mechanisms are not operative. In either case, behaviour is not \"reasonable\" and does not follow prototypical patterns. All these processes must be the consequence of a constant molecular activity full of micro-decisions whose effectiveness depends on the histological and biochemical integrity of the neurons. This microenvironment is responsible for all types of decisions of all forms of life and represents one of the fundamental successes of evolution.",

As important the single risk factor may be, as limited is their impact when we look at the amount of explained variance, mostly only around 10%. On the other hand each examined population includes a larger amount of individuals who will not fall ill in spite of identical stressors as those getting sick. This ability to resist, based on special interior and exterior resources, is now called salutogenesis. It stands opposite to the term pathogenesis. More recent research in that area examines favourable exterior resources such as structures in \"social support\", favourable conditions at the work-place, in the family and so on. Other more personality oriented abilities include optimism, hardiness, etc. The founder of the theory on salutogenesis, Aaron Antonovsky, describes a concept of \"sense of coherence\" including (1.) comprehensibility, (2.) manageability, (3.) meaningfulness.

      "abstract": "I USE here not (in the first instance) in the sense of not harming or not intending to harm, but in the sense of not being accountable for the consequences (possibly harmful, although this is no longer essential to the meaning of the term) of not having knowledge one does not happen to have-knowledge that one might have or even be expected or assumed to have. Innocence in this sense is not the same thing as ignorance, but it presupposes ignorance. Of course the two senses are connected, since it was tasting the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge that constituted the traditional first loss of innocence, but that is not a line I wish to follow here, even though it is not without relevance to the issues I shall be discussing. There are some things one can't come to know without losing one's innocence in some respect or other-coming to know which reveals hitherto unrealized possibilities of error, either already committed (as in the evangelical conviction of sin) or encountered for the first time, whether as risk or temptation. Such knowledge may be disquieting, but it may also be liberating, since error does not necessarily ensue, nor is it the only new possibility. In this short article I want to deal with a kind of knowledge of language, which has consequences for the understanding of literature, that I think falls under this description. A useful paradigm case of loss of innocence in the sense I mean, and that I have described elsewhere, is something that happens frequently in the history of individual religious belief. Somebody growing up in a closed community, and learning only one set of beliefs, may die in the faith without ever having felt a challenge to it. But just knowing that an alternative set of beliefs exists and is held, let us say, by infidels may start a chain of thought like this: here are two sets of beliefs that contradict one another; they cannot both be true, so one of them must be false; but if one is false the other may be false also, so there may be no true belief. Language has this in common with religious belief, that the one we start with is characteristically that of the culture we grow up in, and it may be a long time before we grasp the significance of the fact that there are others. It need not ever be grasped: people (English tourists on the Continent used to be one of the stock examples) can observe that foreigners",

      "title": "The enigmatic phenomenon of loneliness",
      "abstract": "Much has been said and written on loneliness, which is a common human phenomenon that belongs to everyday existence, but few attempts have been made to capture the phenomenon and its existential meaning without reducing its complexity. This paper addresses the question: What is loneliness, what is its essence? The study practiced a phenomenological approach, called Reflective Lifeworld Research. Twenty-six interviews were analysed for meaning with the aim of describing an essential structure for the phenomenon, showing what loneliness is. The analysis shows that the phenomenon of loneliness stands out in meaning as figure against a background of fellowship, connectedness and context. One is lonely when important others are not there, because either one has rejected them or they have chosen to be rejected and left the person behind, feeling lonely. One can reject others in favour of another kind of connectedness. Such loneliness is restful and pleasant. It involves the lack of tangible context that other present people can offer, yet a context is not missing*in this instance there is a relationship to and one is part of something else such as nature or animal fellowship. Involuntary loneliness on the other hand involves a lack of context and connectedness. To be involuntarily lonely and not belonging to anyone is to lack participation in the world. To not be. Loneliness as a phenomenon is further characterized as transcending the present situation containing loneliness. One can feel lonely even if there are many people around, or one can be completely alone without feeling lonely. Loneliness can disappear with a sense of belonging, when one connects with someone who is miles away. Key words: loneliness, phenomenology, lifeworld, Reflective Lifeworld Research",

Underlying the response are rules for detection, detecting discomfort in another. The bodily sensibility is not on one side and the rules of engagement on the other.1 Fast appraisal of these events generates approach or avoidance. The representations in the brain are rich in information processing and reflect bodily engagement. Bodily representations are inherent in what has been traditionally called the “moral sentiments” (A. Smith, 1759/1976; table 4.1). Darwin (1871/1982) repeatedly referred to the “moral sense.” He asserted, “Any animal whatever, endowed with a well-marked social instinct, the parental and filial affections being here included, would inevitably acquire a moral sense of conscience, as soon as its intellectual power had become as well or nearly as well developed as in man” (p. 95). The use of such social abilities is not necessarily solely oriented toward doing no harm or helping conspecifics.",

      "abstract": "Pairing involves using two rewards at once: eg, a physical and a verbal. Eventually the less desirable becomes acceptable enough to reward behaviour by itself. For example, conditioned reinforcers are not automatically reinforcing. Stimuli or events which were once neutral in value may acquire reinforcing properties as a result of being paired with events which are already reinforcing — either primary or other conditioned reinforcers. By repeatedly presenting a neutral stimulus prior to or along with a reinforcing stimulus, the neutral stimulus becomes a reinforcer. For example, praise may not be reinforcing for some people: therefore to establish it as a reinforcer it must be paired with an event that is reinforcing, such as food or money. Then when a behaviour is performed, the individual is praised and reinforced with money. After several pairings of the praise with money, the praise alone will serve as a reinforcer.",

      "abstract": "There is agency in all we do: thinking, doing, or making. We invent a tune, play, or use it to celebrate an occasion. Or we make a conceptual leap and ask more abstract questions about the conditions for agency. They include autonomy and self-appraisal, each contested by arguments immersing us in circumstances we don’t control. But can it be true we that have no personal responsibility for all we think and do? 'Agency: Moral Identity and Free Will' proposes that deliberation, choice, and free will emerged within the evolutionary history of animals with a physical advantage: organisms having cell walls or exoskeletons had an internal space within which to protect themselves from external threats or encounters. This defense was both structural and active: such organisms could ignore intrusions or inhibit risky behavior. Their capacities evolved with time: inhibition became the power to deliberate and choose the manner of one’s responses. Hence the ability of humans and some other animals to determine their reactions to problematic situations or to information that alters values and choices. This is free will as a material power, not as the conclusion to a conceptual argument. Having it makes us morally responsible for much we do. It prefigures moral identity. Closely argued but plainly written, 'Agency: Moral Identity and Free Will' speaks for autonomy and responsibility when both are eclipsed by ideas that embed us in history or tradition. Our sense of moral choice and freedom is accurate. We are not altogether the creatures of our circumstances.",

      "abstract": "Human being is a complex combination of intertwined agency and events that makes humans and their social constructions fascinating and unpredictable. As events unfold, failures and mistakes in constituting their significance enable us to learn how to identify pitfalls and what to avoid next time. In nature, traumatic events trigger the generation of biological antibodies and, by analogy, the formation of similar psychological defensive mechanisms. Individual resilience requires the presence of some negative stressor and an individual being exposed to significant threats; resilient individuals perform a positive adaptation in the face of stressful or threatening events. As individual resilience overlaps with some related constructs (for example, grit, thriving, anticipation, improvisation, coping), this chapter discusses how they articulate with individual resilience (a component of psychological capital) to isolate its antecedents and consequences. Resilience emerges also as a paradoxical strength: risk factors may destroy, but where they do not, resilience may be energized.",

      "title": "Physical and mental violence as the main types of criminal violence",
      "abstract": "The article states that there is no clear diﬀerentiation of types of violence either in domestic legislation or in criminal law science. The following are defined as objective and subjective signs of violence: illegal behavior that manifests itself in the external environment and is expressed in specific conscious acts of human activity; targeting another person's body; the presence of a specific addressee (the victim — in the case of direct violence, or his relatives — in the case of indirect violence); can take place both against and against the will of another person (victim); the intentional character of the person's behavior; the ability to influence the unconscious and cause physical, moral, property damage to another person; the presence of a goal to cause harm to another person of a certain nature. The dominant position is the division of violence into physical and mental. An objection was expressed against the existence of formulas: «violence = physical violence», «threat = mental violence» (this is exactly the vision of the developers of the new Criminal Code of Ukraine). This approach, in contrast to the generally accepted division of violence into physical and mental, determines the thesis that violence exists exclusively in the form of physical harm to the victim, and reduces another type of violence, mental, to a threat. Whereas mental violence in the current Criminal Code of Ukraine manifests itself not only through threats, but also coercion, coercion, influence, terrorizing, etc. The thesis that physical violence can manifest itself not in active actions, but in the form of inaction, has been criticized. However, even examples simulated by scientists refute this approach. It is supported by the idea that murder is also a manifestation of violence, since it is committed in a violent way, at the same time, violence does not include the destruction and damage of someone else's property. Although physical violence is traditionally considered the most dangerous, in some cases mental violence can cause irreparable damage to a person's health. Signs of mental violence as a deliberate, criminally illegal and socially dangerous act are also the active nature of the behavior (as in the case of physical violence), the influence on the psyche of another person against their will, as a result of which harm is caused to the health or life of a person. Key words: violence, aggression, physical violence, mental violence, psychological violence, types of violence, threat, harm, murder, destruction of property, action, inaction, influence, intimidation.",

      "abstract": "This chapter focuses on collective moral failures: drastically harmful events stemming not (only) from individual deeds or inaction but (also) from the deed (and/or inaction) of multiple people. They are failures because the events in question could have been prevented. They are collective because their happening depends on a collection of people not intervening or acting otherwise to prevent them. Thus the malignant intentions of a few cannot by themselves account for what has happened: a collective is complicit. Might such events still be designated as 'evil'? I argue that collective moral failure is a definite category, that it has been a condition of the largest-scale atrocities, that such collective moral failures cannot be sufficiently accounted for in terms of the malignant intentions of individuals and that to the extent that the evil characterising large-scale atrocities cannot be reduced to individual intentions, we must be able also to locate evil in social situations, relations, or structures. This does not mean that evil functions as an explanation of such event, but rather that it is something itself to be explained. Thus only a suitably deflationary conception of evil is of relevance in the characterisation of large-scale collective moral failure.",

      "abstract": "The terrors of flying are as old as the dreams of it. The first flight of man, reported in Greek mythology, ended with the crashing down of Icarus. Today, planes have become indispensable. Air transport companies boast the fact that travel by air is the safest, despite the fact that fear is ever present. There is little knowledge about fears and passenger behavior. Accident statistics turn terrifying events into “cases”. Tribute is paid to “technical progress” and to “more quality of life.” Measures must be taken to reduce the reasons for apprehension to achieve some kind of rationally based safety to relate to behavior. One should, however, not aim to abolish fear to an irrational and unrealistic degree. Such induced behavior cannot be firm in a real crisis. Fears are founded upon social and personal reasons: (1) Predominantly sociological aspects: the fact of airplane disasters; obscurity of the causes and effects of such disasters; inadequate knowledge of technical facts; doubts about disaster prevention; and “technology trauma.” (2) Predominantly socio-psychological aspects: alien surroundings; isolation; don't know what to do; inescapability; and “Mogadishou-effect.” Anthropological and socio-cultural factors also have an impact. Fear of flying of pilot and crew: Their reasons for fear are related to the exact knowledge of dangers and risks, which are involved in economic and job efficiency oriented requirements and obligations. We recommend: improving information and explanation of risks and the related behavioral safety; improving technical means and management of disaster prevention along with appropriate mediation; courses to decrease fears of flying, including safety training; and decreasing potential conflict with airline personnel.",

      "abstract": "Synaesthesia is the confusion or conflation of sensory modalities, where one sense is experienced or described in terms of another as in Charles Baudelaire’s simile \"perfumes sweet as oboes, green as prairies.\" Synaesthesia captures an already existing tendency in language to blend the senses as in \"sweet melody,\" \"velvety voice,\" or \"loud colors,\" and psychologists have conducted studies that show our shared experience of weak audiovisual associations between low pitch and darker colors, or high pitch and lighter colors. In a strictly neurological sense, synaesthesia is a perceptual condition in which the stimulation of one sensory system (for example, hearing) triggers sensations in another sensory system (for example, vision). Cross-sensory associations form one-to-one correspondences that are stable, delicately nuanced, and highly individual. For instance, a synaesthete may experience the timbre of violins as lime green, or the pitch A as burgundy. Synaesthetic associations occur as involuntary, automatic, and emotional responses to sensory stimuli. They persist throughout life and often aid memory: some synaesthetes reliably remember historical dates thanks to their color-to-number associations. The prevalence of synaesthesia has been contested over time, with varying ratios of synaesthetes to nonsynaesthetes of 1 in 2,000, 1 in 100 for colored letters and numbers in recent studies, and even 1 in 23 for all types of synaesthesia.",

      "title": "The Leader-Follower Connection",
      "abstract": "(Figure 1) The \"absence of leadership\"' has become a convenient excuse for all of the shortcomings of the nursing profession.Leadership is about power. And it may be that we have misread the nature of power, thereby misjudging roles and relationships and compromising our ability to take charge of our own future. Power has to be understood as the product of social relationships. Power is given or it does not exist. Sometimes it is given freely, sometimes coercively; often it is withheld as a demonstration of defiance. Power may be awarded by a system, it may be a personal attribute, or it may be shared by those who possess it with those they wish to empower. The underlying principles of power and its connection to leadership are abstract, but the proofs are within the personal experiences of each of us. We have known the manager who finds it difficult or impossible to move an agenda despite being in a position of authority with access to resources, or the bully who is far more successful in controlling the behavior of others than reality warrants. Each scenario depicts leadership, if only by its absence or in a negative form. The outcome is largely dependent on the choices of the followers. And then there are the leaders who motivate you to walk that extra painful mile, who wear their power comfortably but purposefully and convince you that there is an end beyond the means. The attributes of successful leaders have been well documented. As a class they are natural role models who convey the expectation that subordinates will emulate their values. Those values include a large dose of humanism and respect for people. People skills are their forte. They are very much part of the team, yet possess vision that sets them apart. That vision is shared openly and honestly, but in a restrained fashion so as not to overwhelm those that follow. The net result is security among followers based on the fact that someone is out front leading the way through uncharted territory. To accomplish the goals they share with their followers, these leaders surround themselves with the best and the brightest people for the challenge at hand and allow them to proceed, resisting any temptation to micromanage. They comfortably straddle the line between internal and external environments, acting, looking and speaking the part of leader, eclectically educated and polished. A sometimes inordinate faith is placed in the support of one's followers, and consequently they are comfortable taking risks. In fact, anything that does not entail risk in the acquisition is probably not worth having as far as they are concerned. Such are the characteristics of effective leaders, which may come to them naturally or through the cultivation of followers. With a leadership vacuum, there is little vision, even less risk-taking, and a parochialism that reduces work to drudgery. Communication becomes incomplete and guarded. Deception and insecurity begin to dominate and paralyze. Followers are restrained in their commitment, feeling an absence of direction. There is an uneasy sense among followers that they are being held to a higher standard than their supposed leaders. Today's challenge is to achieve practical application of these observations about leading and following and their relationship to power. Honesty also moves us to question whether a leadership vacuum is any more costly than a deficit of followers. Each role requires talent and strength. One is neither more nor less than the other, but simply aligned with different talents, personalities, and lifestyles. While the prescription for leadership seems clear, the qualities of an effective follower are less well defined. Are we comfortable with open and complete communication? Are we ready to buy into a vision when some pieces are imperfectly defined? Are we willing to assume ownership of our ideas, and to tear down the fences that are conveniently erected to maintain the distance between our professional and private lives? How much personal sacrifice will we endure and how much support and protection will we assure leaders when the going gets tough for them on our behalf? Those are neither leaders nor followers who find themselves marking time in place and going nowhere. Those who show the qualities of leadership should be empowered, and it is by this deliberate and conscious action that a cohort of followers is created.",

      "abstract": "Dealing with the concept of god in philosophy, theology, kal ā m etc. is necessary, aside being surprising, since it is among one of the most essential topics of these disciplines. But when it comes to deal with the concept of god in Sociology or when “the concept of god in Sociology” is talked about, it is considered at first glance that the two things which should not be together are used together in a paradoxical way and with a meaningless force. However, if the issue is seen a little more closely, it will be understandable that the situation is not so. Because researching social dimensions of religion or reverse that society’s religious dimensions, Sociology has directly or indirectly been interested with the concept or subject of god; by carrying the subject on further aspects, some sociologists have even argued that society generates a god or gods, the society and God are the same thing, and god or gods are the reflections of society or groups. Thus, in Sociology, especially in the classic “Western Sociology”, society is god (God, god or gods), and god is society or group. In this viewpoint, society deifies or makes itself god. This can also be expressed as follows: God makes Himself society or socializes Himself that is, reflects himself into society. In a sense that God has become sociology/sociological, and sociology has become god/divine. In this study, the concept of god in sociology is considered based on the ideas of some sociologists and some sociological sources at the level of introduction. Summary: That sociology and god are mentioned together or side or made interconnected can be quite surprising at first glance. Even the expressions such as the  “the  concept of God in sociology” can be seen paradoxical. However, when it looked at sociologists’ approaches to religion and society closely, it can be seen that how much sociology has been internalized and related to God or intimately connected with God. When the issue approached in this way, matters such as how sociology looks at “God”, whether sociology has a god, and if it has, what kind of god is and whether sociology is atheist, become important. In this context, the questions such as what sociologists’ conception or beliefs of God are; what kind of science will emerge when it is looked at the relationship of sociology with “God” or gods and its approach to gods regardless of the beliefs of sociologists; what will happen if there is or isn’t god conception in sociology; whether sociology must not have a god conception as a requirement of being a science like many other sciences; and whether being objective requires being godless are equally meaningful and important. Also, seeking answers to questions like whether a godless or godly scientific discipline is possible or not; whether godless sociology or atheist sociology requires godless/atheist sociologists; if there is a god concept’ on in sociology, whether this is a monotheistic or a polytheistic god understanding, can contribute to the understanding and clarification of an important dimension of sociology. In this article, the approach of sociology to the “God” is tried to be covered around these questions and issues within relatively narrow limits.  In this study, it is assumed that “Western Sociology” has acted from a sociologistical and anthropomorphist point of view about God in relation to institutions, events and processes such as primitive religions, church, Reformation, Protestantism, positivism, modernity and modernization, secularization, rationalization. In this context, it can be said that the main line of classical Western sociology has seen society as a venter of religion and God/gods and argued that the society deified itself with certain structural features and various processes, and therefore that society is the same thing as God.  Sociology as a modern science, especially in the context of Auguste Comte’s (1798-1857) and Durkheim’s (1858-1917) sociologies of religion, sometimes identify society with religion and God (gods).  In the background of this  identifying , it is not very clear whether society produces God (gods) or whether God (gods) produce society; but it seems that society is slightly more dominant. This is seen in Comte, Marx (1818-1883), Freud (1856-1839) and Durkheim’s views of religion and society. It is understood that some of classical sociologists sometimes have made religion, sometimes gods or gods society and also made society god on the basis of positivism, and some on the basis of modernization and secularization, some on the basis of rationalization, some also on the basis of all of these. Classical sociologists have developed a conception of God that changes in parallel with the general change of society and centered on the society and the culture, education and knowledge level of society and also probably being influenced by their own imaginations and beliefs of god. Accordingly, it can be said that sociologists have contemplated on the  “ sociology of God’s imagination” or “the sociology of faith in God”. In doing so, it must be said that sociology can go as far as sociologicalization of God, which is not its subject of research. In the final analysis, it can be mentioned that a great number of the early and classical sociologists such as Comte, Marx and Durkheim, who played a primary role in the formation and development of sociology as a modern science, replaced man, humanity and society with God. Many sociologists have acted with an evolutionist concept of god in accordance with evolutionist progressive understanding of history, religion and society. In this view, societies evolved from polytheistic beliefs to monotheistic faith, and finally reached a monotheistic faith. In modern times, societies have become more distant to God, and God has lost power in social or public spaces. It should be noted that Ibn Khaldun, the first “sociologist”, the scholar of Umran, performed the science of sociology which he invented under the name of ‘Ilm al-‘Umr ā n without concealing and removing the belief in Allah, even on the basis of Allah’s social rules and laws (Sunnatull ā h), but by paying utmost attention to be objective. Ibn Khaldun, bases many of his concepts and theses in his sociology which is developed in Mukaddimeon the Qur’anic verses. It is understood that Ibn Khaldun forming many of his concepts on the basis of the Qur’an and of course, his Qur’anic belief is the belief in Allah. Ibn Khaldun sets forth an example of the fact that a sociologist with a belief in Allah can look at things objectively and impartially. In this context, the god of sociology is an anthropomorphistic and a sociologitical god. Although many sociologists, especially classical sociologists, stated that God was not the subject of sociology, they have dealt with the subject of God and understood god as a product of society. In fact, perhaps the most important aspect of their involvement with God is “the idea of God as the product of society” which helps explain how religion emerged. In the final analysis, it can be said that although “those who involve God” state that god is not the subject of sociology in their sociological researches and investigations, they see god as a collective entity representing the society, the shadow or reflection of society, and they considers or are close to considering society or group one/the same with the god or gods. From all these issues, it is understandable that classical Western sociology and those who influenced by this sociology put society as a god and perceive society as a god. It should be noted that, at this point, no longer be regarded that sociology perceives “God” as it done in a part of the period of origin and the classical phase; although sociology as a relatively established science, it excludes the theological and metaphysical issues, it does not have the absolute attitude of rejecting and denying the subjects that fall within these fields.",

      "abstract": "Moral obligations towards animals are dominantly conceived of as rooted in cognitive abilities like the ability to suffer, (self-) awareness, proto-morality, etc. However, these criteria are selective precisely where they are intended to be more inclusive than classical anthropocentric accounts to ethics. Many animals (invertebrates, very young or very old animals) as well as some humans (infants, severely impaired individuals) do not conform to them. To provide an alternative model, animal ethics can be rooted in vulnerability as foundational ethical category. Instead of cognitive capacities that occasionally form a high threshold for a moral status, the universally shared dependency and injurability of bodily beings comes to the fore. However, vulnerability is not a mere fact but socially mediated. Any kind of perception of vulnerability – and of responsiveness to it – are predetermined by a selective moral infrastructure that reveals certain vulnerabilities (e.g. of companion animals) while concealing others (e.g. livestock animals). Yet we are not fully determined by this infrastructure and can criticize hegemonic frames of perceiving and treating animals though we are never outside those structures that frame animals.",

      "title": "Symbolic Environment and Liking",
      "abstract": "George C. Homans (1950) has set forth an assumption about the relation between interaction and liking: the frequency of interaction between two or more persons increases, the degree of their liking for one another will increase, and vice versa. (p. 112). After some criticism concerning the generality of the assumption, he has added that the thesis is valid only when the interaction is not forced (1961, p. 186-187). This reasonably means that if one of the actors in the interaction sequence dislikes one of the others, the thesis is not assumed to be generally valid. Homans has shown in a somewhat convincing manner that this thesis is reasonable and can be supported by different kinds of empirical data. From this it follows that: (1) If A likes B (and B does not dislike A), then A and B will interact. By interaction or communication we mean every action performed in a social situation. The concept interaction is a central one in what Homans means by group, namely: . . a number of persons who communicate with one another often over a span a time, and who are few enough so that each person is able to communicate with all the others, not at secondhand, through other people, but face-to-face (1950, p. 1). From this definition and (1) it follows that: (2) If A and B interact then A and B belong to the same group. This is true only provided that A and B do not meet by chance at some isolated times and are temporary acquaintances. Now let us introduce Torgny T. Segerstedt's concept of symbolic environment, which can be defined in the following way: the symbolic environment is the meaning the words (the verbal symbols) have for a person. By meaning we imply here the object to which the word is knitted, the behaviour which is associated with the word, and the emotion which is associated with the word.",

The focus of this chapter is the third of those sets of options. More precisely, it is concerned with some of the ways in which scientism in some prominent views of the relationship between minds, brains and persons, and of the body, genes and athletic performance, seems to contribute to the development and perpetuation of a conception of performance enhancement in sport that frequently seems to be to the detriment of the welfare of athletes. The reductionism evident in scientistic conceptions of the athlete not only paves the way for pictures, reasoning and values that might justify performance enhancement practices (prohibited or otherwise) that may be detrimental to the health and welfare of the athlete, but it creates conditions that render any apparent 'achievement' hollow, and the realisation of that should surely negatively affect the welfare of the individual person long beyond the point he or she ceases to be an athlete.",

      "abstract": "In advertising, the digital manipulation of the human body involves removing, adding, distorting, replacing, or disfiguring body parts, creating a unique form of schema violation. Such manipulations—termed body disturbance (BD)—are generally designed to attract attention, underscore message content, and inject humor. Based on our lifetime of exposure to the human body’s appearance, properties, and capabilities, our schema is well established, and the disfiguring or distorting of the human body can elicit strong emotional and physiological reactions. This two-part study shows that BD functions similarly to other types of schema violations in terms of its attractive force, rendering such ads as more intriguing, entertaining, and humorous, thus leading to greater eye fixation and elaboration. Yet unlike most schema violations in advertising, BD ads evoke more aversive reactions compared to non-BD ads, resulting in lower ad and brand liking and offering no advantage in terms of greater recall of ad copy, brand logo, brand name, or product type. Further results and implications for advertisers are discussed.",

      "abstract": "Encounter a stranger in need and, sometimes, you will feel empathic concern—an other-oriented emotional response evoked by and congruent with the perceived welfare of that person. What determines whether you will? Perhaps the most common answer among psychologists is that empathic concern is felt when you adopt the perspective of the person in need (see Batson, 1987; Davis, 1994; Stotland, 1969). But in this answer, what is meant by adopting the person's perspective? First, it is an act of imagination. One does not literally take another person's place or look through his or her eyes. One imagines how things look from the other's point of view. Second, it is not the same as perspective taking in the symbolic-interaction tradition (e.g., Mead, 1934). In that tradition, one adopts the perspective of another—often a significant other—to imaginatively see oneself through the other's eyes (and values). The perspective taking that evokes empathic concern involves imaginatively perceiving the other's situation, not oneself.",

Think, say, of ethical value (e.g., “war is wrong”), aesthetic value (e.g., “war is horrible”), existential value (e.g., “war dehumanises its victims”), sentimental value (e.g., “this watch is a memento of my son, fallen on the battlefield”), ecological value (e.g., “we must prevent a radioactive catastrophe, which would render this region barren for millennia”), biological value (e.g., “prolonged exposure to radioactivity causes terrible tumours”), etc. Economic value is one of them, e.g., “it is time to invest in the shares of arms manufacturers amid surging demand for new anti-tank equipment in Eastern Europe”.

The overt, antisocial act may be precipitated by anything which, symbolically or actually, seems to intensify the above factors.

The type and source of the food varies from developing stage of the embryo to after birth till death. Food (which really includes many types of drinks too – such as milk, juices and cola – but not water) is made up of nutrients. The one who has born on this planet needs food to grow [1]. In other words food is essential for growth and sustenance of life. To some extant every living being is addicted to food, this compulsive behaviour may be in response to an emotion, such as stress, sadness, or anger [2]. Food is a epigenetic factor and influence on gene expression and personality of the person [3, 4]. The human body needs food to function, but food addiction is when a person becomes dependent on certain types of foods only [5]. Our sense organs give clues for the presence of the food which we like, from these clues endocrine glands start working, sending messages through neurones to brain and we feel hungry.

      "abstract": "Physical handicap, especially congenital in origin, threatens our sense of security and raises in us distinct feelings of anxiety. We naturally tend to screen out disturbing stimuli. Visible physical handicap however is not so easy to screen out. In its more extreme forms it affronts our feelings of wholeness. To be brought face to face with physical handicap therefore causes us to want to escape the situation altogether or to dissipate in some way the embarrassment engendered. Our escape takes several forms. We may become over-solicitous for the person confronting us. We may shift attention away by focusing on anything irrelevant. We may become ‘moral’ about disabilty, holding implicit attitudes about the value of suffering. All these evasions provoked by our own attempts to handle our own anxiety make us adopt a ‘false consciousness’ or ‘bad faith’. Bad faith is trying to hide from oneself an unpleasant truth or trying to present as true some pleasing untruth. All children are vulnerable to the ‘bad faith’ practices of adults and these communicate themselves effectively to children. Laing1 writes ‘Other people become a sort of identity kit, whereby one can piece together a picture of oneself’. Questions about who one is are answered for the child by asking others. But these questions are mostly asked implicitly by acting in particular ways and finding out what happens to other people when one does.",

      "abstract": "The change of state verbs analyzed in the previous chapter all refer to situations in which an object or event undergoes some change of state or transformation with well-defined beginning and end points. Formal representation of these words involved depicting the state of the object at an initial “moment of attention” followed by its state at subsequent, including terminal, moments of attention. On the other hand, a second very broad class of verbs involves not the transformations of objects but the actions people and other animate beings perform – actions such as seeing, running, throwing, waving, licking, crying, and loving. These words have as their underlying conceptual situations not object states but bodily or psychological states and motions. Further, although these activities do take place in time, they do not'rely crucially on a well-defined sequence of states with characteristic beginning and end points: Running and seeing have durations but not well-defined initial and final states. In general, when the child “moves” or “gives” something, she is focusing on the object and its transformation, and many different specific actions may effect the change of state; when the child “sees” or “touches” something, she is naming the specific action she is actually performing, and the effect on the object is in the background. These two classes of verbs have been identified and analyzed by a number of linguists (e.g., Foley & van Valin, 1984) as well as some developmental psycholinguists (e.g., Edwards, 1973; Huttenlocher, Smiley, & Charney, 1983).",

Alongside this, almost all situations described as a crisis carry a number of common features and the results arising from these features, though trivial, are still possible to discuss. In this chapter, after a brief review of the term crisis' academic language status, common psychological characteristics carried by the social systems in crisis situations arising from situations of weakness are addressed. In crisis situations, the available individuals', communities' or societies' self-defense and protection mechanisms indicate inability of the available methods to solve problems. Furthermore, Crisophilia can be found in all cases related to social systems and in all stages of crisis in your living area. In order to create living space, crisophilia applies actions aimed at creating the crisis itself. Crisophyilic individuals or groups wait patiently for the system to fall into a state of crisis and the intervention made during the crisis in the system is viewed as saving the system, due to this a crisophyilic individual or group can also sometimes be seen as a hero. Because of the desperation in the system a crisophyilic individual or group is adopted in the system. Here in this case, the system itself opens its doors to crisophyilia.",

Leaving aside for the moment the issue of the status of medical definitions, this quotation serves to remind us that, legally and historically, what is now regarded as mental disorder is basically the need to deal with a social problem. Such a social problem may be revealed at an individual level, because someone finds that they cannot cope with life in society; or at an interpersonal level, because those with whom they live cannot cope with them; or at a social level, because the agents of some social institution find them socially deviant. Yet the importance of this social situation has often been ignored in attempts to explain the cause of mental deviance in mysticism, malice or madness, and to remove this cause by eradication or cure. We are not suggesting that the causes of mental problems can be ignored; we merely want to stress, particularly to lawyers and social workers, that the form of the problem to be explained can in fact be determined by the nature of these practical situations, and that therefore in different situations there may be different problems to explain.1",

      "abstract": "Abstract Work may be a mere source of livelihood, or the most significant part of one’s inner life; it may be experienced as expiation, or as exuberant expression of self; as bounden duty, or as the development of man’s universal nature. Neither love nor hatred of work is inherent in man, or inherent in any given line of work. For work has no intrinsic meaning. No adequate history of the meanings of work has been written. One can, however, trace the influences. of various philosophies of work, which have filtered down to modern workers and which deeply modify their work as well as their leisure. While the modern white-collar worker has no articulate philosophy of work, his feelings about it and his experiences of it influence his satisfactions and frustrations, the whole tone of his life. Whatever the effects of his work, known to him or not, they are the net result of the work as an activity, plus the meanings he brings to it, plus the views that others hold of it.",

The therapist is therefore ill - at - ease in front of this splitting, with varied reactions influenced by his own personality, by the patient's personality and by what alcohol means to both of them. Several attitudes may result from this relational difficulty: rejection and possible referral to a \"specialist\", symptomatic treatment or rigid, ethical, defensive attitudes. The approach to be alcoholic should pass through acceptance of his relationship to alcohol and the privileged place it occupies in his life so as to enable him to have access to another relationship with some one who restitutes him his human dignity.",

Stress represents a normal reaction of the organism which appears as a response to an aggression situation which requires an unusual and quick adaptation effort from the organism. Stress is a state of putting in alert, of mobilizing the forces of the organism in the occasion of an event which requires, in order to be kept under control, a big amount of energy in a very short time. This alert state or action preparation translated through physical and psychological manifestations. Psychical stressors are those which come into being independently from the man’s will and destroy – as social factors – psychic and organic components taking place in the response, the organism consequently get tired. During the harmonic life gradually all human psycho-organic components shall get exhausted.

It is true that people have to face problems throughout their life and there is no way to avoid them. Human beings’ problems are always based upon how to understand sufferings and conflict in the individuals. They have not only the physical problems but also more complicated psychological problems. However, some problems are man-made, created by people according to their worldly understanding of life. These causes are still relevant in modern society and they are still effective in making people unhappy in their life. Suffering is not a mistake but it is a part of ones self and it is caused by interpretation of situations. Poverty and ignorance are other dimensions of sufferings. Thus, most of the people suffer from the effects of these calamities. It naturally happens in the common life of everyone. Human suffering takes many forms: Physical, Psychological, Natural and Moral. All these sufferings are always equally harmful and they are interconnected. Sufferings can collapse a person or it can make one strong. It always depends on ones sufferings in a positive way or a negative way.

      "title": "Review of: \"Jung on the Meaning of Life\"",
      "abstract": "The question of the meaning of life is a central feature in Jung's psychological project, or even, one could say, its keystone.It is explicitly mentioned in his well-known statement: \"About a third of my cases are not suffering from any clinically definable neurosis, but from the senselessness and aimlessness of their lives.I should not object if this were called the general neurosis of our age\" (CW 16, § 83).This standpoint is reiterated in another passage: \"There are in addition not a few patients who, although they have no clinically recognizable neurosis, come to consult the doctor on account of psychic conflicts and various other difficulties in their lives, laying before him problems whose answer inevitably involves a discussion of fundamental questions\" (CW 16, § 250).These questions, says Jung, determine people's own attitude (i.e., their form of being-in-the-world), which \"is bound up with certain principles or general ideas, in a word, with their religious, ethical, or philosophical beliefs\" (CW 16, § 250).And, as long as the suffering springing from these particular psychological problems are brought to the psychotherapeutic setting, psychology cannot avoid stepping \"into regions that were formerly the province of priests and philosophers\" (CW 16, § 250).As a matter of fact, Jung was mainly interested in these \"regions\" as they appear in the psychological life of modern subjects (including himself).They are the homeland of the question of the meaning of life, and at bottom Jung's psychological project aimed at addressing this question, rendered extremely problematic in nihilistic modernity.It is the characteristic destruction of meaning performed by nihilism that gives birth to the \"general neurosis of our age\".The centrality of the question of meaning in Jung's thought shows with undisputable evidence the relevance of Sanford Drob's choice of the subject matter for his article on \"Jung on the meaning of life\".Given the limits of any article, Drob obviously could not deepen the problems arising from this fundamental and thorny issue.He opted for simply collecting passages in which Jung deals with the problem of the meaning of life, on its various levels, without really discussing them.These well-chosen passages provide a most valuable map of the different kinds of perspectives or approaches to the problem of life-meaning to be found in Jung (radical doubt, existential, archetypal, and transcendental), and Drob briefly comments on each one of them.In what follows, I will simply add a few comments to what Drob offered us in his valuable piece, giving some more context to the problem of meaning in modernity, and rising some problems and further questions which seem to me important to the critical reflection about Jung's standpoint on this problem.Concerning the first perspective, it should be pointed out that \"radical doubt\" corresponds to the essential",

People with certain symptomatic and characterologic traits seem especially prone to this.

      "abstract": "I begin by saying that I am not a doctor; I have no clinical experience. I am a philosopher. I must therefore ask myself what I am talking about. I am speaking in some way related to health. I find out that health is, as far as I can understand, an ordinary language word referring to what theoretical biolo gists would call 'the level of autonomy with which an organism adapts its internal states to the conditions of the environment, and ... (in the case of human health) consciously engages in changing some of these conditions in order to make adaptation more pleasurable or more effective.' Health therefore refers to something which is a property of aliveness it is related to the aliveness of that organism or of that primary group. Health care can mean two things : an increase in this autonomy, or, and that is a very strange way of using the concept of health care, substituting for the autonomous ability to cope with changing environ ments and changing, decaying perhaps, internal states, engineered inputs which adapt that organism to its environment or which render the environment less trivial; decrease the level of noise in the environment and thereby make it supposedly more suitable for that organism. In thinking about these matters I come, therefore, to the conclusion that (at least if my starting point is not wrong) there must be some level beyond which any further attempt at improving health by trans forming autonomous coping into heteronomous maintenance, what I originally called 'health', must decline. I start with a dilemma. Now I look at the medical endeavour, which is really an engineering endeavour, in order to intervene for individuals who are sick, who might become sick, or in supposedly disease-making aspects of their environment, in order to improve health. Three years ago, I never thought that I would dare to say those things, for me clear simple observations, which now have become evidence. I say that medical endeavour gives decreasing results with increasing manpower, prestige and money invested in technical means, seeking technical effects. And notwithstanding, society is willing to throw ever more resources into this endeavour. The simplest explanation is that society does not finance medicine primarily because it seeks measur able, verifiable, specific technical results from technical investments but because of certain non technical results, certain non-technical effectiveness of the medical establishment. For instance, if some people consider it a privilege to have a certain kind of complex operation in a certain kind of society, one would consider that that society is bad as long as everybody in that society does not have access under similar conditions to the same very complex and expensive investment. Medical investments will be made in order to foster social equality. This is a positive external of medical investment: it is not directly related in any way to health. Some of these externals created by medicine clearly have the characteristics of burdens. Medical investment becomes increasingly more expensive. It imposes increasingly more problems on the city planner, on the transportation engineer, on the teaching establishment in a society, but these are still externals, though negative ones.",

Nonverbal behavior like tone or volume of voice, actions, touching are ways of communication which can complement or substitute for verbal language. Successful human relationships hinge on the ability to express oneself non verbally and to understand the nonverbal communication of others. The reasons why nonverbal behavior is important in communication are as follows. 1. Nonverbal behavior may form a universal language system. 2. Nonverbal behavior reflects one's social and cultural background. 3. Nonverbal behavior creates an expectation of the verbal message. 4. Nonverbal behavior is unconscious and instinctive, so people are apt to put more faith in it than utterances. 5. Nonverbal behavior can express feelings and emotions that can't be expressed through verbal language. 6. Because nonverbal behavior is visual, its expressive capability is strong. The subjects of this study are limited to facial expressions, eye contact, hand gestures and touching. Other elements of nonverbal communication like silence, physical appearance, the use of time, the use of space will be dealt with in the next study.",

The typifications of social interaction become progressively anonymous the farther away they are from the face-to-face situation. An important aspect of the experience of others in everyday life is thus the directness or indirectness of such experience. The social reality of everyday life is thus apprehended in a continuum of typifications, which are progressively anonymous as they are removed from the \"here and now\" of the face-to-face situation. Social structure is the sum total of these typifications and of the recurrent patterns of interaction established by means of them. Human expressivity is capable of objectivation, that is, it manifests itself in products of human activity that are available both to their producers and to other men as elements of a common world.",

NATURE OF THE EXPERIMENTTo test out the above assumption an experiment was performed with 13 black and white rats.A \"multiple choice\" apparatus was used containing four compartments.One of these led the animal to the food box by a short path; another, by a longer path; another confined the animal for a period of time, and a fourth provided an electric shock punishment.For convenience of discussion we shall hereafter call these four compartments 1 Invaluable suggestions and assistance were received from Dr.",

Or perhaps we feel indebted to him because of something heonce did for us. Or, again, perhaps we once harmed him in some way, and as a result we feel a responsibility to make reparation to him.

      "title": "Autonomy, Diminished Life, and the Threshold for Use",
      "abstract": "Normative ethical theories today place enormous stress upon autonomy or agency and treat it as of the utmost significance to the value of human life. Some theorists understand agency as referring to personhood or to moral personality; some take it to involve such things as rationality and action upon reasons, self-awareness, self-critical control of one's desires, the application of norms to conduct, and deliberative choice. Some take it to be about making one's own decisions (in the important affairs of life) and directing one's life or about constructing a life of value for oneself or about adopting and living out a life plan or rational plan of action. On all these views, the effect is to set up agents or autonomous beings as a special or privileged class, against which the lives of nonautonomous beings – such as infants, young children, the irreversibly comatose or those in a permanently vegetative state, those suffering from senile dementia, the severely mentally enfeebled, some of the brain damaged, and animals – are assessed and valued. So privileged is this class that all kinds of notions are invented or assumed – such things as impaired autonomy, potential autonomy, interrupted capacity, unrealized capacity, trusteeship, and proxy agency come to mind – by which to try to squeeze as many beings as possible into it. The fear, obviously, is that, if some human being falls outside the privileged class, the protections that normally extend to one morally may possibly be in doubt.",

A person is unhappy not when one does not know his center and boundaries, but when one cannot have power over them. Happiness is not rather in the retention of goods, but in the free possession of them. This rule is emphasized by rare exceptions from it: these include a person's dependence on the good of communication with spiritually close ones, relatives, loved ones, friends. Happiness is not a constant escape, but rather a constant learning of happiness. Person uses his / her eccentricity to find his / her new center each time, not to lose it or lose faith in it. Changing one's borders is also not unlimited and completely arbitrary. All this must also be learned, because the loss of goods is also bitter, especially if involuntary or, moreover, against our will, and the loss of some goods is the loss of our very life – organic and / or spiritual. Happiness is in the unity of eccentricity and centripetal of some personality: in the constant rejection of the unchanging center and boundaries of one's personality and at the same time in the constant search and new discoveries that partially reaffirm this center and boundaries – but as a result of one's own choice. Keywords: happiness, goods, eccentricity, centripetality, learning of happiness.",

      "title": "Literary Conventions and the Human Body: The Use of Bodily Expressions for States of Mind",
      "abstract": "A. Correlation expression and state of mind 1. Evidence Variations in the mood of speakers habitually co-occur with variations in their facial expressions or movements. This kind of correspondence has been observed and commented on [i], not least in the medical literature, where speakers with different types of handicap, mental and others, have been studied. [ii] That we are not alone in the animal world in this respect is shown by studies of apes [iii] and monkeys [iv], where similar relations have been found. From a communicative point of view we may, with Wierzbicka (1995), make a distinction between bodily actions which function as speech [...] and actions which while meaningful cannot be seen as speech surrogates (209). Although many physical manifestations are deliberately communicative [v], such as hugs and kisses as expressions of friendship or love, physical manifestations are unconscious or semiconscious perhaps most of the time, and speakers vary with regard to their wish and ability to control them. Consequently, a given physical expression can be assumed to indicate a certain emotional state while a given emotional state cannot without reservation be expected to result in a certain physical expression. [vi] As this relation between certain mental states and physical expressions is fairly well established [vii], writers, particularly writers of fiction, have been quick to make use of it. It is obvious, therefore, that it has aspects of interest to linguistic and communicative studies. Kurath (1921) observed, as Sweetser (1990:28) notes, that Indo-European words for the emotions are very frequently derived from words referring to physical actions or sensations accompanying the relevant emotions, or to the organs affected by those physical reactions. What the present study will do is consider the stage preceding that discussed by Kurath, viz. the stage where the physical actions or sensations have not yet become, or are just beginning to become, lexicalised as purely emotional expressions. The study will thus look into the way in which states of mind are represented as physical expressions in written English. It will use material from two language corpora, viz. the 57-million-word Cobuild Direct Corpus (examples where the reference follows the text) and the 100-million-word British National Corpus (examples where the reference precedes the text). An important question to be addressed will then be to what extent the actual physical manifestations represented in writing can be assumed to be present in the persons referred to. For example, can a person said to be tearing his or her hair out in exasperation actually be assumed to be physically doing so, or has the phrase become just a literary device to signify an emotional state? Is the link between the state of mind and its physical manifestation being severed? 2. General validity? There has been a great debate as to whether terms and relations in the emotional field established for one language community can also be taken to apply to other language communities. [viii] Wierzbicka, for one, emphatically denies that this could be the case: [A]s empirical cross-linguistic studies show, there are simply no emotional expressions interpreted the same way across cultures ... (2000:149). The present little study is only concerned with English, so the question whether the expressions can be translated and whether they apply in the same way to states of mind in other language communities does not arise. Moreover, we are not here concerned with deliberately communicative manifestations, such as handclapping, hugging and kissing, but rather with mostly unintentional and perhaps unconscious ones like pursing one's lips or dropping one's jaw. B. Literary use The fact that facial expressions and movements are often unconscious and yet expressive of some mental state makes them an obvious medium for anyone wanting to observe, study and describe internal processes in our fellow human beings. …",

      "abstract": "Abstract Nonsuicidal self‐injury (NSSI) refers to the deliberate destruction of one's own body tissue without suicidal intent and for purposes not socially sanctioned. Although terms such as self‐mutilation and deliberate self‐harm have also been used for this behavior, NSSI has increasingly become the term of choice. Common examples of NSSI include skin‐cutting, burning, scratching, needle‐sticking, rubbing against rough surfaces, hitting or banging body parts, and interfering with wound healing. In general, behaviors associated with eating disorders (e.g., binging or purging) and substance disorders (e.g., alcohol or drug use) are not considered NSSI, because they are not accompanied by specific intent to physically damage one's body tissue. Similarly, most cases of tattooing and body piercing are not considered NSSI, because they are socially sanctioned forms of body decoration or artistic expression. Importantly, NSSI can be distinguished from suicidal behavior. Unlike suicide attempts, NSSI is not performed with the intent to die, and the injuries caused by NSSI are rarely life‐threatening or medically severe (Klonksy &amp; Muehlenkamp, 2007).",

The first is a single overwhelming incident resulting in great shock and loss, such as an accident or natural disaster. The second is a continuing parent-child relationship or other relationship which is brutalizing to the child/adolescent and from which he or she cannot escape. The third is a general energy field or atmosphere in which the person grows up and which is offensive enough to that person's sensitiveness and sensibilities to be brutalizing. The therapy of terror is a contact sport, but the contact must be caring, loving, as a friend. The terrorized patient must be kept in contact with his or her avoidance of excitement when in the phobic layer until implosion and trembling explosion occurs, not once but repeatedly, until the basic organismic resiliency is restored. The best therapy system to use very explicitly with a terrorized patient is none.",

      "abstract": "The actualization of polar axiological vector in the new generation value priorities space and a problem of religious values consideration in the youth spiritual environment are embodied into the following crucial constants : 1) the religious part of a valued phenomenon has never disappeared from the area of scientific analysis and human interest, since spiritual factor has always been the basic one in the sphere of a person or society meaningful valued space; 2) the attitude to a religion obviously or non obviously shapes the spiritual and value culture details of a person; 3) the youth, as the embodiment of past experience and bearers of future culture, has always been in the focus of researches’ attention as the most vital social group. The priorities can be different, even alternative in their context and opposite in their sense; eternal and temporary; truth and false; real and illusory; clear and subconscious or rational ones. The religion does not exist without the human factor, it has lost its sense, context, role, display, etc. The community without religion has never occurred. Each person and each community appeals to a religious source. A religion in its intrinsic sense is an embodiment of some axiological knowledge, search for a transcendental phenomenon. The religious approach to the moral values contains the deep considering of life sense independently of a person realization sphere. To conclude, while considering the specific features of the modern youth religious values, the two main factors can be named that influence on their functioning: spontaneity and rationality. A person has always been in their interaction. This is the core of a personal existential choice, a man has a real right for freedom, existence, and obtains an opportunity to understand the responsibility for the self existence through internal law, the law of conscience.",

      "title": "How We Should Suffer?",
      "abstract": "Here I ask the question: how should we suffer? Asking this question presupposes another question, which is Why we should suffer, a question I’d like to explore with you before progressing to the ‘how’ of it. Suffering is more than pain. If we cast an eye over the dictionary, it is defined primarily as to undergo or endure; and secondarily as to go, or pass through, or be subjected to, a painful experience. Pain is an immediate sensation, and usually experienced physically even when it is caused by abstract rather than concrete manifestations. Moral or emotional pain produces biological effects – the now-cliched idea of ‘heartache’, or the more contemporary notion of the ‘breakdown’. The language we use to express emotional pain reflects that physical quality: we speak of being wounded or hurt. Grief is a pang for which we seek healing. We also speak of metaphorical pain – the agony of separation, the stab of betrayal. But physical pain is only ever a symptom – it is a message our body sends our brain, telling it to stop or avoid the action causing the unpleasant sensation. Pain is a healthy reaction: it insists that we be in the here and now. We are not distanced from pain: by its very nature it cannot be avoided or overlooked as it is a message that requires and receives our prompt attention. When we feel sudden and acute agony we are one with the pain, present to it while it lasts. Dealing with it and overcoming it take all our attention. We assume, perhaps falsely, that pain will have an end. When pain does not conform to this expectation; when in fact it becomes part of our life, is experienced long-term, we acquire a measure of distance from even acute pain. We move from a helpless position in which instinct takes over to a place where we are consciously aware of what we are undergoing: we suffer. Pain is centred in the body, and stills the mind to all but itself; suffering is experienced by more than our body. As Eckhart says in Sermon 13:",

Whatever, therefore is terrible, with regard to sight, is sublime too, whether this cause of terror, be endued with greatness of dimensions or not; for it is impossible to look on anything as trifling, or contemptible, that may be dangerous. To make anything very terrible, obscurity seems in general to be necessary.

      "abstract": "Abstract Most primate species live in complex and dynamic social groups that present them with difficult cognitive problems on a continuing basis. All theories of primate social cognition assume this fact, although whether and in what ways primate social life is more complex than that of other mammalian species is a difficult question. Cheney et al. (1987) noted that although differences between primates and other mammals are not especially obvious, there are three characteristics of primate social life that together may make for special complexities. First, in a purely quantitative sense, most primates live in complex social groups that result in “a complex network of interactions, with many alternative strategies for survival and reproduction.” Second, primates form various types of long-term social relationships with others involving kinship, dominance, and short-term coalitions, and these may change over the life cycle. Third, primates have an extremely varied repertoire of means for expressing themselves socially in terms of species-typical displays that make manifest their emotional states and behavioral intentions. Although it would be difficult to document primate uniqueness in any one of these characteristics, together they make for a highly complex form of sociality that may encourage the development of all kinds of social knowledge, social strategies, and social learning (see Cords, in press, for a review).",

The activity of reflection builds symbolic landmarks between which the metaphorical narrative myth about making and leading others can be organized. The conduct of men is not only organizational and methodological: it is spiritual. Self-knowledge that avoids recourse to defensive or aggressive mechanisms allows us to develop emotional accommodations, connecting practice and ethics without confusing them in “justastructure” (Seve 1966). We must all suspect ourselves and each other of hidden temptations disguised with legitimate reasons. Ethics is the unconditional authorization to become “someone else” in a space where knowledge, skill, initiative, and respect for shared values mean that freedom and limits must constantly be defined. But let no one be fooled: the best is confiscated by the discrete, efficient, and united castes who firmly hold the titles and means. Management serves them. Unconditionally.",

Responses to painful stimuli either involve the skeletal musculature or are internal but they are experimentally quantified as escape and avoidance’ (Le Magnen, 1998, p. 4). Both types of responses to this source serve adaptive functions. In many species, specific escape mechanisms have evolved for dealing with physical danger. One of the simplest is the withdrawal reflex that removes the organism from damaging stimuli. When specific taste receptors are in contact with bitter substances, they result in a spitting reflex that protects the organism from ingesting possibly toxic substances that are generally associated with the bitter taste. In Chapter 5 the mechanisms by which rats learn to avoid smells and tastes that have previously been followed by illness were examined. Animals will also react to aversive stimuli with attack behaviour, particularly when escape is difficult. Such a reaction is particularly evident in feral animals.",

Religious faith and dogmatic certitude are closely associated in general and may be based on various levels of emotional development and specific modes of relatedness. The transcendental quest of establishing identity with the nonmaterial and the spiritual realm of experience sees life span and physical existence as a preparatory phase for the purpose of launching the soul onto the everlasting spiritual life. Even the devoutly faithful spiritual leaders are subject to varieties of deviation, doubt, confusion, denial, ambivalence, or vacillation in their sense of certainty.

Assumed similarity affects judgments of well-acquainted others and strangers alike, and it is apparent for a great variety of traits, attitudes, and behaviors. Most robust assumed similarity effects are, however, apparent for characteristics that are closely linked to values. This suggests that assumed similarity can, at least in part, be attributed to perceivers' tendency to particularly see others as sharing those aspects of the self that perceivers deem highly relevant to who they are and how they see themselves.",

Because such substances cause changes in states of consciousness and create a state similar to trance and the departure of the soul from the body or a kind of altered perception of facts. But in some cases, some additional facts are perceived. The question is, to what extent can the use of these materials be a way to perceive a supernatural understanding of reality? And by what mechanism does this happen? The fact is that experience and experimental methods and philosophical analysis show that these materials can have such a result in very controlled and exceptional or accidental cases; But in general and in most cases, the use of these substances for these purposes is not recommended and not only does not have the desired result, but also has unintended consequences and many harms.",

      "abstract": "The individual, as an actor in the social world, relies on “a stock of knowledge at hand” (Schutz). However, he also addresses the cultural and historic forms of validity based on the perspectives of his own interests, reasons and wishes, ambitions, religious and ideological commitments. In this sense, not only does the social world constitute the main scene of our actions but also the locus of resistance. These days of highly social complexity and growing cultural interaction mobilize different identification and differentiation processes. In extraordinary situations of change, such as migration for reasons of work or study, or reasons of political or allegedly religious exile, a reformulation of socio-cultural spaces occurs, which is coupled with a rupture of social connections of support and belonging. This refers to a lifestyle under a “transience” status, which may last, in certain cases, all life long. The “place of roots” fails and the subject ends up feeling a stranger even in its own spaces. In this sense, the foreigner’s right (xenos) to hospitality resides precisely in not being considered the absolute other, the barbarian, the savage who is absolutely excluded and heterogeneous, but in being someone whose identity should be guaranteed. Upon answering this requirement, the foreigner undertakes responsibility before the law and before its hosts: the foreigner becomes “a subject of rights”.",

This, in and of itself, is not a particularly radical notion - the gender, sexuality, religion, etc, of the researcher having been problematised in a variety of critical discourses for at least several decades - but what is proposed here, rather, is an analysis of a somewhat more fundamental nature; one that explores the concept of the researcher as a ‘Being’ and, at least initially, strips away such cultural inflections of the researcher’s ‘self’ to concentrate upon what it means to be an inquiring Being. Only once the researcher’s experience of being a ‘Being’ in the world has been examined, and ‘this must be done explicitly, even at the risk of discussing the ‘obvious’’ (Heidegger, Being and Time 1997: 81), can an attempt be made to qualify its impact on their reaction to the physical world and the artefacts and beings therein. \r\n\r\nThis paper builds upon current discourses that endeavour to reintroduce the ‘agency’ of studied individuals into the anthropological and archaeological records, but argues that before the agency of others manifested by their material and cultural practices can be understood, the researcher must necessarily understand their own being and subsequent relationship with others and external ‘things’.",

In this definition, mimicry is closely related to mimesis or the practice of representation in literature, performance, and the visual arts. Yet in contrast to mimesis, which often seeks to reproduce an image of the object that is being copied, mimicry can have a humorous and even subversive potential that deliberately sets out to challenge the meaning of the object that is being copied or represented. This is not to say that the act or practice of imitation is restricted to literature and the visual arts, however, since the imitation of other human beings is also one of the formative processes through which children learn to speak, act, and perform as socialized human subjects. Furthermore, in biology, the practice of mimicry denotes the close external resemblance of an animal or plant to another, or to an inanimate object (OED) , in some instances as a tactic of self‐defense.",

As one whistleblower put it, \"They wouldn't talk about it, and they wouldn't talk about not talking about it.\" Silence does not just mean the absence of speech. Silence means that one party to the dialogue refuses to engage the other. Whistleblowers try to talk about what the organization is doing. Their bosses will only talk about the whistleblowers and their problems. \"Nuts and sluts\" is the name given to this strategy by experienced whistleblowers, in which the goal of the organization is to turn the issue into one of the mental health or morality of the whistleblower. What is unsaid, what cannot be spoken, is almost always the moral and ideological corruption of the organization. Corruption means the loss of an organization's mission. Society is a conspiracy of silence against those who cross an invisible boundary that most of us will not recognize, for to do so would establish our willingness to do almost anything to belong.",

This chapter describes the conceptual boundaries that distinguish the emotions from other affections, such as agitations and moods; from felt desires, such as urges and cravings; from obsessions and appetites; and also from attitudes. Emotions are classified as negative or positive, according as to whether one would (normally) prefer to feel such emotions (delighted, excited, overjoyed, contented, amused, affection), or prefer not to be subjected to them (feeling bored, envious, jealous, frightened, sorrow, embarrassed, humiliated).",

      "abstract": "The current international crisis situation caused by the COVID-19 pandemic is having a strong psychological impact on our subjectivities. We are constantly threatened by the danger of i) being infected, ii) infecting other people, and (iii) by the loss of social relation. Departing from these premises, we here aim to investigate the psychological and neurodynamics of this complex phenomenon. First, we discuss about recent psychological and neuronal findings on fear and its disorders, related to an unbalanced intero-exteroceptive processing and emotional regulation. Secondly we move to the psychological and neuronal dynamics of self and others characterized by a temporo-spatial alignment with the world. Due to the neural overlap of emotion and self and the deep-reaching neuro-ecological layers of self, emotional feelings like fear and anxiety cannot be detached and dissociated from the world; they signify the world–brain relation, and, more specifically, our self-other relation. The deepest neuro-ecological and neuro-social layers of self are threatened by the loss of subjectivity, which is manifest in our loss of body and thus the fear of dying, and the loss of intersubjectivity that surfaces in our fear of infecting others, which reflect the intimate anchorage of the self with the world. In our opinion the pandemic of COVID-19 deeply affect our sense of self and its spatio-temporal neuronal dynamics providing the prerequisites for the manifestation of fear and existential anxiety, thus disrupting the brain-world relation with significant repercussions on our psyche and on our daily lives.",

      "title": "How to make sense of suffering in complex care practices?",
      "abstract": "This chapter focuses on the tension between complexity of caring practices and the normative dimension of providing good care. The question we raise in this chapter is whether practice theory provides conceptual space for the good of the patient, being a vulnerable person, longing for cure and support in dire times, receiving care under conditions of complexity? Our answer is that this is possible, by considering the epistemological and moral position of a patient as someone dealing with illness and social vulnerability as well ('precarity'). The very character of being a patient is that he or she is suffering. Suffering, however, is not specific to patients. As the French philosopher Paul Ricoeur puts it, suffering and more broadly being the subject of forces displays what is common to all humans. People are 'passible': they constantly undergo processes, they are subject to time and material circumstances, such as heat, light and air pressure (Ricoeur, 1986: 125). People also constantly undergo acts of other people (pep talk, admonishments, putting a needle in one's back for diagnostic reasons, caressing fingers). And people undergo diseases. Of course some diseases are self-inflicted. But even then, when the disease is raging or slumbering in the body, people undergo it: they feel the contractions, the throbbing pain, the itching. People are also actors but with the constant reality of being 'passible'. Thus Ricoeur balances his idea of human agency with his observation that people are sentient beings undergoing situations, time and space; they are both subjects and objects and often at the same time. The neologism passibilité points at something different than passivity. When passivity means remaining without action, passibility does indicate movements: inner movements, even if people are not always consciously aware of them. Undergoing evokes inner movements: repulsion, attraction, contraction etcetera. In ethics this interplay of action and undergoing realities is a major shift: what if human acts are not just reigned by intention, decision, will, by principles, by duty, by rational accounts of consequences but by mere passibility as well? We thus propose that it is not evident that a patient is an actor in care practices similar to the acting roles of nurses, physicians, care managers; patients should not be seen as co-players in this field.In this chapter, we will take up the issue of whether the passibility and vulnerability of patients can be weaved in a practices oriented conceptualization of complex care. While our aim is to offer a conceptual contribution to practice theory, our considerations are based on five years of qualitative empirical research (2009-2014) of the first two authors in a general hospital in the Netherlands. As care ethicists, we were (and are) interested in how good care can come about and how it can turn, in an instant, into bad care (see Tronto 1993 and Held 2006 on the philosophical ethics of care and caring). We have shadowed patients waiting for hours in the emergency room; we have witnessed astonishingly good care and unnecessary incriminating acting by one and the same physician on the very same day; we observed the use of high tech and physicians at particular moments relying on more classical experience based diagnostics; we shadowed and interviewed nurses on their rounds distributing medicine while using a computerized safety system, pointing to just one example of the prominent role of materiality in care practices. Complexity became a more and more predominant issue during our observations. Standing explanations from organization theory, interesting as they are, were not satisfying, as suffering of patients or even 'harm added by care' (Van Heijst, 2011) were absent in them. If an organization is an arrangement of things, people, ideas or activities (Hatch, 2011) the lack of any telos, and the absence of any conceptualization of the substance of the work, and the experiences that it brings about, render that definition problematic. Such a formal definition of an organization is theoretically weak: that what is done and what is experienced seems irrelevant (cf. Pellegrino, 2001). As Lyotard has analysed there is no such thing as a 'nil institution', an organization defined as devoid from content. Thus, the presence of patients constitute the carework in a hospital, they are not just add-ons to an already existing, morally neutral organization. As we were sceptical of theories concentrating on complexity that leave out the substance of care and the normative, we were looking for a theory that could serve us better as a heuristic tool for our research. We needed a theory that could help to dig up matters of concern to those working and being ill in the hospital organization and which is also capable of capturing issues of complexity and normativity. How could caring, suffering and the high complexity of the late modern hospital be adequately theorized? We side with Annemarie Mol (2003) as she emphasizes 'that what is enacted' in an organization. However, we do not concentrate, as she does, on the enactment of the body multiple or perhaps disease multiple in various care practices in which health care is leading. Rather, we wanted to understand the very nature of being a patient: the one who is suffering, undergoing both the disease and the care practice. We are interested in the complaints and concerns of patients as they come for assistance and help to doctors, nurses, physiotherapists, nutrition experts, and we are interested in the actions of the care professionals as they take place in the highly complex setting of the hospital too. Any theory that is of heuristic value to our research would",

      "abstract": "Maria Frick, Combining physical actions and verbal announcements as \"What I'm doing\" combinations in everyday conversation Frick's paper examines a particular type of announcement in spoken interaction, one in which a speaker verbalizes what they are about to do next.These announcements are accompanied/followed by the speaker's executing the announced action.Therefore, they are said to form an 'action combination': clausal verbal announcement + physical action, constituting a \"What I'm doing\" combination.This type of action combination is an initial (i.e., non-responsive) but not an initiating action, as it does not make a response conditionally relevant.It is distinct from an informing (and is thus not epistemically driven), and also distinct from a directive (thus is not deontically driven).It is appropriate when participants are about to do something that departs from a social norm: break out of a group unilaterally, leave the room, take more than one's share of food, use a boarding-house reach to help oneself at the dinner table, etc.The paper thus makes an original contribution to the understanding of (one kind of) announcement and its use in everyday Finnish conversation, while at the same time pointing to a hitherto unexplored action combination.It demonstrates that declarative clauses are combined with simultaneous or following physical actions within the social action of treating the physical action as accountable and as a departure from social norms.6.

      "abstract": "Search activity (SA) is the behavioral and mental activity that is oriented to changes of the environment or of the subject's view and approach to the environment according to personal needs without the definite probability forecast of the outcomes of such activity, but with a regular consideration of the outcomes in the process of active behavior. Dream's lucidity (the subject's realization that he/she is dreaming) protects dreamer from awakenings during emotionally disturbing or frustrating dreams, because lucid dreams allow subject to feel separated from the dream events that may cause a feeling of helplessness. Due to such a protection from awakenings that can bring subject back to the frustration in wakefulness, subject can turn in the further sleep to normal non-lucid dreams that are restoring subject's SA in the subsequent wakefulness (activity in the uncertain situation with the feedback between behavior and its outcome). It is the advantage of lucid dreams. Their disadvantage is that due to the separation from the dream events that are in lucid dreams accepted as rationalized dreams, not as real stories where the dreamer acts like in wakefulness, their ability to restore SA is decreased until they are not displaced by the normal non-lucid dreams accepted as real stories.",

      "abstract": "The article comprises an attempt to answer the question why some material objects are, in a social and cultural sense, more long-lasting than others. The answer lies in the model of the life-space of the things. This space is created by two basic dimensions. The first is defined by the character of the relationships created by the objects (this dimension comprises the opposition between the technical relations versus the communicative ones). The second is defined by the character of the relationship between the body of the user and the material object (this is created by the opposition: accessible or inaccessible to sensory experience). The transition of the material object through this space is the life-way of the object, and it is precisely this which defines the longevity of the object and thus the length of time it persists within a specific community. The author determines that long-lasting objects are above all those which are linked with the community, or users, by single, unambiguous relationships and links, while those which have ambivalent and multiple links are of shorter lifespan. Whether or not a thing has a long life or not is determined therefore by the multiplicity of meanings it has which render impossible its role as a stabiliser of the links that constitute a community, as a foundation of the individual’s identity, a guarantee of ontological security.",

      "abstract": "Animal Welfare Science began to gradually develop in the 60´s, probably as a consequence of the publication of the book “Animal Machines” by Ruth Harrison [1], which denounced several practices that were done without regard for animal suffering. Since then, much research has been conducted aiming to identify the welfare states of animals. Firstly, an animal was considered to have good welfare when it was physically healthy, feeding, and producing well. Everyone can easily understand the importance of these characteristics and believe they may be part of animal welfare considerations, but welfare may not be restricted to this. How the animal behaves may also indicate if it is in a better or a worse condition. Thus, a healthy and productive animal or even an animal that is feeding well may be in a poor welfare condition if it is, for example, expressing some stereotypic behaviour. Stereotypies are defined as a series of movements regularly repeated with no apparent purpose or goal [2], probably induced by frustration, repeated attempts to cope and/or brain dysfunction.",

      "abstract": "Abstract During the last century it has often been argued that mind emerges from matter. Values, on the other hand, were rather thought to be (merely) supervenient. However, it seems reasonable to conclude that values are at least conceptually (or epistemically) emergent on neutral facts. This process of emergence, of course, is a temporal process. It may have taken a long time for certain values to arise, and they presuppose conscious memory and expectation. Moreover, even when constituted, values involve time. They do so mainly in two ways. Firstly, by having a temporal aspect, as in certain moral virtues and obligations. Secondly, by having time itself as their object. Examples can be seen in religion (sacred/secular time), economy (“time is money”, time can be cheap or expensive, wasted or gained), sport (priority), science (idem) and art (rhythm and related properties).",

Dissimulation means concealment of genuine psychiatric or other medical symptoms in an attempt to present a picture of psychiatric or organic health. Secondary gain is prominent, yet, primary gain exists as well. Aspiration is a higher degree of dissimulation, whereby the person not only denies having symptoms but pretends to be much healthier than he actually is and even more than all the healthy people surrounding him. Aspiration is mostly driven by primary gain. Secondary gain strengthens the primary one by the positive feedback the individual receives in considering him to be healthy and strong, deserving appropriate social, professional and financial attitudes.

Serendipity deals with grasping affordances, that is, usage potentials, creating correspondence and resonance between environmental and personal factors.

In fact, much of our communication is carried out not through our words, but with the affective features that accompany those words: the prosody of our speech, our facial expressions, and body postures. Consider, for example, the disrespectful \"tone of voice\" that a teenager might use when speaking to a parent. (In the T.V. sitcom Seinfield, Jerry's mother refers to this as \"the tone\" and warns Jerry not to use it with her.) In the nonverbal domain, consider \"the look\" that some mothers use to control their children's behavior. Indeed, we can communicate \"volumes\" without speaking. In addition to our facial expressions, our body postures and the way we \"carry\" ourselves can communicate internal mood states such as excitement, defensiveness, and depression. For example, a quick look at a good friend may prompt us to ask, \"Are you all right?\" In all of these examples, of course, the affective communication is two-sided. One person is expressing a feeling or thought and the other is perceiving and interpreting the intent of these expressions.",

      "abstract": "This article reviews four types of personality disorders. Narcissistic, avoidant, dependent, obsessive compulsive personality disorders. Here is a brief introduction to these four personality disorders: The avoidant personality disorder is defined by a constant feeling of inadequacy. Patients with this disorder are hepersensitive to negative situations and they fear of being criticized of rejected. Thus, they avoid social and cultural interactions. They have limited themselves into a small line of close friends. The narcissistic personality disorder can cause great difficulties in interpersonal relationships, especially marriage. This is because narcissists are always self-righteousness and the world should revolve around them. Narcissistic people are not able to love others. They do not understand love (they constantly ridicule others and humiliate their subordinates). However, they take advantage of concept of love in order to deceive and trap others but it is all theatrics and role-playing. People with dependent personality disorder typically rely on others for their needs. They expect that others accept responsibility for most important issues in life. They lack self-confidence. They feel intense dissatisfaction whenever they feel lonely, even for a short time. Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder is presented by discipline-oriented perfectionism and psychological control. The individuals with this disorder try to be in control of everything through careful attention to norms, details, lists and programs. They are extremely careful, repeat every task for several times, and pay special attention to details and frequently resolve probable mistakes. They do not pay attention to the fact that other people feel upset in case of delays and discomfort that arises from their excessive behavior.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Silence is thought of both as an absence (whether desirable or deplorable) and as a lack (indicating a potentially retrievable deficiency). Each dialectically points to its opposite: a presence in the first case, and a sufficiency or an abundance in the second. Absence relates to concepts such as void and nothingness, and is associated with a non-specific invisible and inaudible state. It may be wordlessly sensed or intuited. Identifying putative absences depends on the epistemologies at the disposal of the student of silences. Lack calls attention to a particular incompleteness that can be named. It entails the political unfolding of a process and possesses a teleological undertow. Silence as absence has a different order of inaudibility. As a form of elimination it is itself patently political. Lacanian radical lack has its own peculiarities. It too is non-specific, pertaining to an underlying Real that cannot be articulated or communicated, and for which inadequate terms of language must be substituted. The defective symbolic representation of the Real stands in for an ineluctable lack, a perpetually inexpressible voice. Removal relates to the erasure, loss, or entombment of what had previously existed and was perceptible—often hiding the act of concealment itself, most commonly found in the palimpsests of changing historical narratives.",

      "abstract": "Externalities, Social Networks, and the Emergence of Norms: A Critical Analysis and Extension of James Coleman’s Theory Karl-Dieter Opp (bio) INTRODUCTION Norms are pervasive in everyday life. They specify what is allowed, prescribed, or prohibited. Many norms are stated explicitly, such as laws, which are often well known. This holds for many paragraphs of the penal code. Most norms, however, are not explicitly formulated, and sometimes we are not even aware of them. For example, when people meet and have a conversation, it is the rule to keep a certain physical distance from each other. This rule is automatically followed, and many are not aware of it. When we encounter a friend, we address him or her in a certain way, we talk about specific themes (and not about others), and say goodbye using certain linguistic expressions. In former times, duels took place according to specific rules. The study of social norms—be they formal or informal—is a central theme of all social sciences. In sociology, for example, a classic study is William Graham Sumner’s Folkways (1906), which provides a detailed description of a great number of norms. [End Page 167] One of the goals of social scientists is to find out what the existing norms in a society are, how they differ among groups, and how they change over time. These are descriptive questions. Another goal is explanation. One wants to know the conditions for the emergence of norms. For example, how can we explain the emergence and change of norms or systems of norms (sometimes called “institutions”) such as table manners, norms at the workplace, or norms about the behavior of men toward women? Another question concerns the explanation of the effects of norms. In answering this question it is assumed that norms have come into being, and the effects of their existence are explored. For example, if tax law is changed so that more income tax must be paid, one may ask about the effects this has on tax evasion. Most existing theories of norms deal with their effects. In this essay, we address the origins of norms. One of the most important theories about norm emergence was proposed by James S. Coleman (1990, chaps. 10 and 11). This theory is widely discussed in the literature (Berger 1998; Braun and Voss 2014, 82–89; Cherkaoui 2007; Elster 2003; Ermakoff 2017, 176–78; Frank 1992, 148–52; Horne 2009; Lüdemann 2000; Opp 2001, 2002, 2015b; Voss 1998, 2000, 2001, 2017). There is further a detailed empirical test of a central proposition of the theory (Piskorski and Gorbatâi 2017). James Coleman (1926–1995), an American sociologist, was one of the most eminent sociologists in the history of the discipline. His work focused on social science theory (with his major work, Foundations of Social Theory, published in 1990). His theoretical approach was what is called today structural (or methodological) individualism. The basic assumption is that societal phenomena (such as revolutions) are brought about by individuals and should therefore be explained by going back to individual action. Coleman’s writings are particularly clear. This is probably due to his strong mathematical orientation and his contributions to mathematical sociology (see, e.g., Coleman 1964). But Coleman was not only a theorist. He conducted important empirical studies as well. An example is the Coleman Report from [End Page 168] 1966, “Equality of Educational Opportunity” in the United States. The sample consisted of more than 650,000 students. There are other theories about norm emergence. I selected Coleman’s theory because it focuses on the most important causes for norms, namely externalities and social relationships, as will be shown below, and because it is the only theory that proposes an elaborate causal model. (I will briefly compare Coleman’s theory with some other theories after the exposition and discussion of Coleman’s theory in the final section.) Nonetheless, the theory is not without fault. I focus in particular on two issues: first, the argument that one of the major factors in Coleman’s theory, namely social relationships, contributes to the emergence of norms only under certain conditions; and second, that Coleman addresses only norms that are consciously created...",

      "title": "The Meaning of Health in the Era of Value-based Care",
      "abstract": "In an era of value-based care, the practice of medicine and other health professions have been drawn to subjective, comprehensive and multidimensional views of health such as the World Health Organization (WHO) concept that defines health as a state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity. This paper, through a philosophical analysis, demonstrates that health is not multidimensional and is a natural phenomenon. A philosophical discussion contends that health must realistically and logically reside in the person and this requires it to be a physical state. This paper also illustrates that, in the popular language of health, many times, health professionals: (1) inappropriately view health as a subjective human construct as opposed to viewing health as an objective phenomena, (2) confuse what is desired and valued as a good life with what is good health, and (3) fail to recognize the vital distinction between what affects health and what is health. A meaning of health is offered through several examples and arguments that demonstrate why health is a state of physical well-being or physical fitness that is defined by how well the body is functioning in accordance with its natural design and how well this natural design affords individuals the ability to achieve essential functional objectives of humans on the biological and person level.",

      "title": "The meaning of representation in animal memory",
      "abstract": "Abstract A representation is a remnant of previous experience that allows that experience to affect later behavior. This paper develops a metatheoretical view of representation and applies it to issues concerning representation in animals. To describe a representational system one must specify the following: the domain or range of situations in the represented world to which the system applies; the content or set of features encoded and preserved by the system; the code or transformational rules relating features of the representation to the corresponding features of the represented world; the medium , or the representation's physical instantiation; and the dynamics , or how the system changes with time. In part because of the behaviorist assumption that the hypothetical, covert changes occurring in an organism during learning correspond to the overt physical changes that are observed, issues of representation in animal behavior have been largely ignored as irrelevant or misleading. However, it can be inferred that representations, acting as models of environmental regularities, operate at many levels of behavioral functioning, both cognitive and noncognitive. Objections to the use of this concept in explanations of animal behavior, based on the claim that it is indeterminate and on behaviorist considerations of parsimony, can be answered. Animal representations may be specialized in terms of tasks and species. Data from tasks involving spatial memory, delayed matching-to-sample, and sequence learning suggest some foundations for a general theory of animal representations.",

      "abstract": "Two fundamental aspects of cultural intuitive conceptions of time's passage - cyclic and continuous temporality - are here related to clinical psychopathology of post-traumatic stress in Brazil. People with predominantly cyclical cultural perceptions of time tend to see life and death as part of an eternal movement. Severity and persistence of mental trauma are not directly related to the magnitude of the catastrophe or even of the traumatic experience, but rather to the way they pervade the mind and to the roles they represent on it. Modern culture tends to produce individuals prepared to a highly complex world, running in a frantic rhythm and under constant pressure. Nearly all events must be anticipated, planned or controlled, and obsessive traits tend to be facilitated. However, in catastrophic, unpredictable events, when nothing can be done, these full-schedule people may show frailty and despair. Traditional communities seem capable to bear extremely high levels of aggression or suffering - in traumatic and catastrophic situations - without showing proportional signs of mental stress. While in the high social layers of modern communities an act of violence as an assault or rape may have serious and long lasting consequences, in everyday public hospital practice we come across victims of potentially traumatic events without any of the expected devastating effects on their mental life. Periodic dissociative rituals may have a role in their resilience.",

      "abstract": "No class of diseases with which man is afflicted are so various in their manifestations as those known under the general term of insanity. No diseases present such an infinite variety of light and shade belonging to their own nature, or to their intermixture with other maladies, or to the influence of temperament, of individual peculiarities of habit, or of social position; and therefore the diagnosis of no other class of diseases taxes nearly so much the ingenuity and the patience of the physician. The Diagnosis of almost all other diseases depends principally upon weighing the evidence afforded by physical signs and symptoms, upon evidence addressed to the senses; but in mental disease, it is for the most part dependent upon evidence which is cognizable by the intellect alone, and upon data which the senses furnish to us only at second hand. The physician is compelled to bring to this investigation, not only a knowledge of those functions which are subservient to the vegetative and animal life of the individual, but also a clear and analytical conception of those which collectively constitute mind. He must not only be a physician, but a metaphysician; not indeed in the almost opprobrious sense of the term, but in that better sense which designates a lover of truth, seeking to ascertain not the essence of mind or any other unattainable abstraction, but the laws of mind which are as regular as any other natural laws, and the knowledge of which offers to philosophy a wholesome and legitimate object of research.",

      "abstract": "Although all social action is directed at other people, many social actions are initiated by someone who did not perform the action. This form of social action is called bonded action - any action that is not a direct expression of the acting individual's will or decision - anything that someone asks, coerces, or forces another person to say or do. Bonded actions are characterized by the social bonds that hold a relationship together, but the action itself can also be directed at people outside the relationship. That actions are bonded means not only that they are initiated by or together with others within the same relationship; it often means that people are provided with resources to help them perform these actions. People who act on behalf of organizations are transformed into organizational centaurs. Not unlike the mythical centaurs, their individual human features are insufficient to restrain the collective power of which they are a part. Most people are affiliated with several relationships, and they perform different types of bonded actions. In this way, the individual's ability to act is divided, and each piece uses only part of the person's repertoire of actions. Both actions and emotions are divided and exercised as people move from relationship to relationship. The remainder of the chapter is an exploration of the interfaces between bonds and between individuals and their bonds. Some form of casting occurs in most social bonds as a method of creating correspondence between individuals and bonds. The concepts of greedy relationships and emotional labour are also discussed, as is the interface between bonds in such situations as multiple citizenship, whistleblowing, corruption, and match fixing.",

For the affect to occur, the brain must contain circuitry connecting the cognitive with the affective that is activated when the second item overlaps the first. On some occasions the positive affects evoked are easily noticed but more commonly they are subdued --- but they make up for smallness by abundance. For example, when one enters a familiar room, recognition events, (perception matching memory) are innumerable, the affects merge, and a continuous effect, the “comfort of the familiar” is sensed. Many other episodes of mild satisfaction are produced in a similar way. The overall picture is of one’s daily affairs running on a day-long substrate of innumerable pairings. The pairings make a healthy person more upbeat than an anhedonic person, they contribute to each person’s personality traits, and the pleasure involved is the basic ingredient underlying higher-level motivations. A general benefit will be gained if people become more aware of this pervasive affect.",

      "abstract": "In many applications, particularly in the biological sciences, the time course of a continuous response for an individual may be characterized by a function that is non-linear in one or more parameters, where an \"individual\" may be a human subject, an animal, a plant, an agricultural plot, a laboratory sample, or other observational unit. The non-linear function may be chosen on empirical grounds for its ability to represent faithfully the apparent individual-specific response-time relationship. For example, the logistic growth model, discussed in Section 5.2.1, is often adopted for this reason to describe the S shape, typical of relationships between continuous measures of growth and time on a given plant or plot. Alternatively, a non-linear model for individual behavior may arise from theoretical,mechanistic considerations that are of central scientific interest. In pharmacokinetics, as we demonstrate in Section 5.2.2, non-linear models for drug concentrations achieved over time following administration of a drug are derived from representing the body as a system of \"compartments,\" embodying assumptions on how processes of drug absorption, distribution, and elimination take place within a subject.",

It is an altogether tense time, place, and manner to speak, at a moment when the idea, doctrine, and \"marketplace\" of \"free expression\" divides generations and fuels contemporary kulturkampf, a proto-stasis in which fewer and fewer want or care to hear from those who are not already in the \"proper\" (progressive, reactionary, tolerant, conservative, fundamentalist, etc., etc.) crowd, singing the proper tune in the right chords, the truths about all the big lies. The infinitely recallable words afloat in social media's gloomy cloud set the fear of being called out—ever later—into the calling to speak. The demand to burn books echoes from school board meeting to meeting, as trending tirades about the difference between cancelation and censorship flame, smolder, and flame back. More fire—throwing light on the fact that the problem at hand is a very old one. The hemlock has taken many forms, with varying levels of toxicity. The promise underwriting audi alteram partem has long provoked (better and worse) opposition and more than a few bans for violating standing \"terms of service.\"What cannot be said? It's fashionable to deem language incapable of revealing what \"matters\" and so best indicted as mere \"linguisticism.\" If the charge risks a certain hypocrisy, it is never self-evident what grounds good speech or embodies its power, whether to cross the line turned smudge between speaking and writing, and how best to conceive the work of interpretation, representation, and critique that continues to attend and confound expression. Though so many words yet strive to figure a rational-deliberative-public persona that may have long left the building, this aspiration with dwindling audience may be no less chilling than a fragmenting articulation of belief that demands recognition of an \"I\" that appears naïve to the speech-action on which its emergence hinges. One wonders then if much has changed, if we remain in a moment, as Foucault put it, that \"never attached much importance to the fact that, after all, speech exists\"—a denial that has well-served those who take the word as their own in the name of refusing any advice about the merits of learning more about how to talk about talk.What cannot be said? The question abides, multiplies, and compounds, not least within and between rhetoric and philosophy. What goes and what can perhaps only go without saying, for better and worse—that is, for the lifeworld? What is said in what's left unsaid, perhaps as the unsayable is the ground and demand to speak? What's not being said in the name of being and at the cost of becoming otherwise? What remains unsaid and unsayable, in silence and in the midst of the damage done, not least the damage done to language itself? What cannot be said in time and what saying has no place? What cannot be said for history? How does what cannot be said appear—as inability, choice, prohibition, transgression, virtue, imperative? What potential abides in the unsaid and unsayable, for truth, freedom, authority, judgment?What cannot be said? Quick and tidy replies will not do, except perhaps as evasion. This is partly to say that it is likely important not to introduce this special issue of Philosophy & Rhetoric, an extended and challenging consideration of the question—What cannot be said? It is not so much that the essays here speak for themselves, although in many ways they do, at the same time that they ask after and frequently trouble such certainty. It is not that they demand silence, even as they provoke quiet reflection. And it is not that they require an interpretive map, as they are best approached from multiple angles and taken up in various orders—the essays here sit in some tension, and also abide with and work for one another, in ways that invite discovery. Indeed, anything resembling a \"proper\" introduction may be less a distraction than evidence of a deep misunderstanding, a failure to grasp that the question of what cannot be said—as a question—may resist obligatory first words, the definitions, topoi, speech acts, and language games that are deemed prior and held so very tight, perhaps at the cost of language itself. The essays here, not least as they manifest the possibility that Adorno discerned in the essay's form, resist this conformity. In their own way, each \"says what is at issue and stops where it feels itself complete—not where nothing is left to say\" (1984, 152). Neither first nor last word, but a compound opening, an idea whose very form may amount to heresy.",

      "abstract": "Humans are characterized by a compulsive tendency to distinguish themselves from the rest: differences in clothes, hairstyle or \"decorative\" details are used to this effect, based on highly diverse criteria. Such differentiating practices may be aimed at identification with a certain ideological group, for example, or with a concrete \"fashion\", and involve the use of jewelry, clothes, unusual attire, hairstyles, mutilations, etc. In this context, the present review addresses certain aspects of mutilation practices from both the general and specifically dental perspectives. Mutations imply permanent or lasting sectioning or lesions of a part of the body, and comprise skeletal deforming, dental mutilations, circumcision, ablation of the clitoris, scarification, tattoos, and perforations (particularly of the soft tissues). In this sense, tattoos and perforations or piercings are popular -- particularly among adolescents. This trend may be interpreted as a form of communication, identity expression, or as a type of body cult (i.e., so-called \"body art\"). Such mutilating practices reflect different motivations including fashion, rebelliousness, differentiation, sexual motives, the remembering of events, physical sensations, and ethnic or tribal influences. However, these practices can cause complications such as infections, laceration and soft and hard tissue damage, hypersensitivity reactions and other alterations of variable severity. Under these premises, questions are raised concerning the competence of those who perform these mutilations, the preventive measures adopted, and the legal conditions under which tattoos and piercings are made in our society.",

The findings and cross-cultural examples explored here contrast with other work in the field where such experiences are described, but insufficiently analysed, as common, folk, invisible or implicit religion. Scholars in the study of religion are often ill-equipped with appropriate concepts and terminology, mainly because they often seek to classify such experiences into different realms, such as sacred/profane or this world/other world. Those divisions do not seem to be significant, if they are apparent at all, to the informants who experience such phenomena. The majority of those experiences occur through bereavement, where belief narratives describing the experience of ‘sensing’ deceased relatives suggest a self-conscious desire and performative strategy to continue their belongings.Many people do not need religion or God to mediate those experiences, prompting the author to analyse the experiences as sensual, emotional, cognitive, self-mediated, and performative, produced in specific social contexts and explained with reference to longings for belongings. They are frequently supported by collective, social interpretations. In illustrating how informants experienced transcendent, non-material feelings and sensations in their ‘here and now’, transcendence is relocated to a non-spatial, temporal, social realm. That shift is made possible by ‘believing through bereaving’, supported by collective memory and desires for continuing relationships.",

Así mismo, el ser humano manifiesta caracteres fenotípicos y genotípicos únicos como, por ejemplo, los rasgos faciales que, además de diferenciarnos de otras especies animales, nos distinguen de otros seres humanos; los cuales a su vez manifiestan características variables. Es por eso que la diferenciación y especificación son dos aspectos muy importantes para encasillar dichas características a un individuo. Las Ciencias Forenses es una rama de la investigación que permite esclarecer hechos que se han cometido en distintas circunstancias, es por ello que busca descubrir el hecho delictivo a través de pruebas periciales que serán de gran ayuda en los procesos judiciales. Alrededor del mundo, a menudo, el técnico forense puede encontrarse con indicios en la escena del crimen que liguen o asocien al victimario con el delito cometido o atentado contra la integridad de otro individuo, estos pueden ser, elementos que se encuentran en la escena del delito, en la víctima y/o en el victimario; aplicando así el principio de intercambio el cual manifiesta que todo paso por el lugar de los hechos deja tras de sí una huella aprovechable. Entre estos indicios se encuentran: máculas sanguíneas, fibras textiles, elementos pilosos o capilares, entre otros. Estos indicios mediante el análisis de laboratorio permiten vincular sus características a las del victimario y su papel en el desarrollo del delito. Es por ello que el laboratorio forense realiza diversas pruebas tanto de microscopía (observación y pruebas especiales) como microscopía (características fenotípicas). Entre esas técnicas se encuentra la tricología forense la misma que resulta nueva y muy poco usada, la cual responde al estudio del elemento piloso que contribuye en muchas maneras a la resolución de numerosos casos que pueden estar llevándose a cabo mediante la comparación de elementos dubitados e indubitados que permitan dar un estudio comparativo de la investigación, por ello al examinar detalles como la forma, dirección, color, residuos genéticos entre otros aspectos secundarios del elemento piloso encontrado en la escena del crimen, se puede hacer una comparación con una muestra del sospechoso y puede atribuir o descartar su relación o implicancia TRICOLOGÍA FORENSE - Incluye ilustraciones y descripciones 20 en algún acto delictivo, permitiendo así la autenticidad e integridad del indicio , como pieza clave desde la recolección en la escena del hecho hasta la presentación en juicio, permitiendo así garantizar su calidad probatoria, debido a que se encuentra enmarcado en instrumentos internacionales. En la problemática mencionada, debemos entender que las Ciencias Forenses son una rama con un crecimiento evolutivo acelerado, pues son áreas que no se han manejado rutinariamente. Al contrario, se están utilizando y estandarizando técnicas, protocolos, y material que permita ejercer un estudio correcto de cada una de las áreas ya sea la biología forense, la química forense, la histopatología forense, entre otras. En definitiva, resulta un mundo nuevo, en el que muy pocos han profundizado, además de contribuir con el público forense como una herramienta útil para su aplicación en el área del conocimiento mencionada; es por eso que, se ha creado un manuscrito con información de Ecuador que aporte al estudio tricológico forense con patrones propios del área geográfica, siendo un referente dentro de las investigaciones y un aporte a las ciencias investigativas forenses.",

      "title": "Noir as Affect",
      "abstract": "Noir as Affect Christopher Breu (bio) Like most forms of popular fiction, crime fiction is known to produce affective responses in its readers. One of the defining features of most genre fiction is that it produces effects in the body, whether it is the excitement of adventure, the fear produced by horror, the arousal of pornography, or the sense of longing and fulfilment produced by romance. Indeed, popular fiction is often denigrated precisely because it produces such “vulgar” bodily affects, in contrast to the complex and distanced contemplation instilled by capital “L” literature. The production of such forms of embodied affect may be lamentable for the guardians of high art, but for scholars interested in questions of affect, popular fiction can be seen as a privileged medium. Popular fiction does not just instill affects in the reader, it also narrativizes them. Put simply, affect can be defined as that which affects a body in a given cultural, communicative or intersubjective context. They are bodily and intersubjective states that are both conscious and unconscious and are often experienced consciously as emotions or moods. Affects attach not only to characters and spaces but to the very workings of narrative itself. As psychoanalytic critics have demonstrated, central to the drive of detective fiction is the desire to know. In conventional detective fiction, this desire to know often manifests itself as a will to mastery. Thus, the classical detective narrative is premised on the movement from fear, suspense, and disorientation to mastery, clarity, and order. While the hardboiled detective story may forego much of the conventional resolution associated with the classical narrative, it too is predicated on a sense of mastery, even if this mastery is proven to be more about the toughness or endurance of the protagonist rather than any restoration of justice. Similarly, crime fiction that narrates the exploits of the master criminal, from the Memoirs of Vidocq forward, is predicated on the daring and mastery of the criminal. Whereas detective and crime fiction are finally about mastering affects (as well as mastery as an affect), noir, as a reworking of these other genres, is about the opposite. Noir is predicated on the inability of the protagonist to master the affects dramatized by the narrative. Instead, the affects typically master the protagonist (who is unmastered by them) and define the coordinates of the fictional world. Noir thus has a privileged position in understanding affect in relationship to crime and detective fiction. It demonstrates the power of affect to both shape individual actions and the larger landscape in which such actions take place. Noir takes shape as a specific affective mood or atmosphere. Central to noir is the staging of negative affects. Negativity clings to the very bones of the noir crime story. Noir works via the staging of negative affects such as guilt, sadness, (often murderous) rage, cynicism, loss, resentment, fear, anxiety, destructive desire, often including an erotic attachment to death. Initially, this definition of noir may seem counterintuitive. Noir is often associated in popular culture with a certain kind of nostalgic image of mid-twentieth-century life, featuring tough guys, femme fatales, shadows, crime, and a dangerous yet alluring urban demimonde. It is also usually associated with film, with such actors as Humphrey Bogart, Lauren Bacall, Veronica Lake, Robert Mitchum, Barbara Stanwyck, Edward G. Robinson, and others. Indeed, it has only been in the past thirty years or so that the category of the noir novel has gained critical currency in the work of Christopher Metress, James Naremore, William Marling, myself, and others. Yet, many film noirs were adaptations from crime novels that shared many of their thematic concerns and narrative structures. Moreover, the novels often were resolutely darker and more disturbing than many of their filmic counterparts, since the latter had to negotiate the Hayes code. Thus, the term noir seems to fit the novels even more fully than the films, even if the naming was belated and the films were named first, if also retrospectively, as Marc Vernet has noted. If we focus just on the noir crime novel (leaving to one side the detective novel), we can construct a timeline that begins with the writings of James M...",

The structure referred to could be either in the mind (a state of mind, for example), in writing (a constitution or management structure), or in building and land, or in a combination of any of these. Institutional dynamics then refers to the process of relating the various component parts as well as the consequences of this dynamic for the institution and its environment. The term refers not to the conscious traffic of institutional functioning but specifically to the unconscious and hence unacknowledged factors at play.

      "abstract": "The societal concern for animal welfare stems from the acknowledgement that they are sentient beings, whether their sentience makes morally unacceptable any act that would increase their suffering (utilitarian point of view) or animals deserve rights because of their sentience (animal rights point of view). Several definitions of animal welfare have been proposed, based on common sense, mechanisms, or operational indicators. These definitions should not be interpreted as uncertainties about the existence of the concept but rather as different aspects of the same concept. Whatever the definition used, research on animal welfare attempts to answer the following questions: To what extent are the animals used by humans capable of emotions? How does an animal perceive its environment? How can we assess the level of animal welfare in a given situation? What are the impacts of the ways we treat animals on their welfare? To answer these questions, animal welfare scientists borrow methodologies and theoretical frameworks from various disciplines, mainly behavioural sciences, including not only ethology but also experimental psychology, animal cognition, or stress physiology. The focus is not on the description of animal behaviour or stress responses but rather on the understanding of how animals experience their world. Hence the recent developments issued from psychology, studying cognitive bias or relations between cognition and emotions. Animal welfare science can be considered as a new behavioural science, applied to societal concerns about our relations to animals, with specific research questions and methodologies inspired by other disciplines.",

      "abstract": "Zoo- and anthropomorphism may both be scientific heresies but both may serve as a basis for thought (and real) experiments designed to explore our ability to assess quality of life as perceived by another sentient animal. Sentience, a major contributor to evolutionary fitness in a complex environment, implies 'feelings that matter'. Strength of motivation is a measure of how much they matter. Since humans and most domestic animals share the property of sentience, it follows that some aspects of feeling may be similar, and where we differ, the differences may be of degree rather than absolute. One of the assumed absolutes that I shall challenge is the concept that non-human animals live only in the present. I explore how domestic animals may experience the feelings of hunger, pain, fear and hope. Hunger is indisputably a primitive sensation. Pain and fear are primitive sensations with emotional overtones. The problem is to discover how they may affect quality of life. Acute pain and fear are positive signals for action to avoid harm. These actions and their consequences ('how well did I cope?') will be committed to memory and affect how an animal feels when they recur, or it fears they may recur. Hope (and its antithesis, despair) are considered by many philosophers (who do not own dogs) as emotions restricted to humans since only we can imagine the future. However, by application of zoomorphism we may classify hope with hunger as a primitive feeling of dissatisfaction with the status quo . Either may lead to action directed towards the goal of feeling better or encourage the belief that things will get better (food will arrive). Both are feelings of expectation for the future modulated in the light of past experience. With all these four emotions quality of life may be expressed in terms of how well the animal feels it can cope, both in the present and in the future. When it feels it cannot cope, then it will suffer.",

      "abstract": "The organization of brain processes leading to language and movement show important parallels with one another and also express important aspects of biological organization in general. Four major differences between biological processes and their commonly proposed analogues, machine processes, are as follows. 1) Reduction is not simplification in biological analysis; rather the subsystems that result from separation of parts of a biological system are themselves complex, often potentially viable, systems. 2) Machine processes are typically generalized, or, if specialized, they are specialized by connecting general-type subsystems in special ways. But biological systems are typically specialized at many levels, both in subsystems and their connections. 3) The history of a biological system is often an intimate and inseparable part of its structure. Furthermore biological systems never develop alone or de novo. Not only do they develop in clusters of contemporaries, they also develop in the presence of an older generation and a “culture.” 4) Not only do formal logics have some constraints that biological minds may not have (e.g., internal consistency and universality), formal logics require descriptions of qualitative phenomena in a language that is inadequate and (as a deeper issue) may always require parsing a meaningful whole into approximate parts (e.g., as in writing this abstract). Instances of contrasts between biological systems and machine-type systems are seen in language and movement phenomena, such as embodying a distinction between purposes and causes and having flexibly reorganizable subassemblies, multiple goals, and motor equivalence.",

For them, the intonation of utterances and the mood of gestures are more expressive than the words or gestures themselves because they inform about the sender’s mood (joy, fear, anger…) and the speech act (praise, warning, order…). Additionally, nose animals smell strong emotions. On the one hand, during their common history, men learned to interpret characteristic expressions of animals like wagging the tail or ruffling feathers. On the other hand, pets and domestic animals understand the facial expressions of men. Further indices of mood are body tension and proxemics. Greetings like giving the paw (dog) and giving the head (cat) come from the natural behavioral repertory and are reciprocated by humans – unlike the equally friendly licking of cows. Signs in a narrow sense are produced in order to communicate specific information to somebody else. Guide dogs, for example, learn numerous orders as well as signs for telling humans something specific. Riding animals and draft animals are guided by shouts (“Giddy up! “) and motoric signals (leg pressure, pull of the rein or guiding rope). A last group of signs are gestures for luring or chasing away which are mostly combined with specific shouts like “Here boy!” or “Pssssst!!!” Die Materialitat von Zeichen ist in der Interaktion mit Tieren viel wichtiger als in zwischenmenschlichen Dialogen. Tiere identifizieren bekannte Menschen olfaktorisch (individueller Geruch), akustisch (Stimme, Gangart) und visuell (Gestalt, Bewegungsmuster). Fur sie sind der Tonfall von Auserungen und die Gestimmtheit von Korperbewegungen aussagekraftiger als die Worte oder Gesten selbst, denn sie informieren uber die derzeitige Stimmung des Senders (Freude, Angst, Arger…) und den Sprechakt (Lob, Warnung, Befehl…). Nasentiere riechen zusatzlich starke Emotionen. Im Laufe ihrer gemeinsamen Geschichte lernten Menschen artspezifische Ausdrucksbewegungen von Tieren (Schwanzwedeln, Federn strauben usw.) zu deuten, umgekehrt verstehen Haus- und Nutztiere die menschliche Mimik. Weitere Anzeichen der Stimmung sind Korperspannung und Distanzverhalten. Grusgesten wie Pfotchengeben (Hund) und Kopfchengeben (Katze) stammen aus dem naturlichen Verhaltensrepertoire und werden – im Gegensatz zum ebenso freundlichen Ablecken von Rindern – vom Menschen erwidert. Echte Zeichen produziert man, um anderen etwas Bestimmtes mitzuteilen. So lernen Blindenhunde zahlreiche Befehle sowie umgekehrt Zeichen, die dem Menschen etwas Bestimmtes mitteilen. Reit- und Zugtiere werden durch Zurufe (“Hu!”) und motorische Hilfen (Schenkeldruck, Zug am Zugel oder Leitseil) gelenkt. Eine letzte Zeichengruppe sind Lock- und Scheuchgesten, die man meist mit artspezifischen Rufen wie “Putt-putt-putt” bzw. “Ksch!!! “ kombiniert.",

In (1), for example, being drunk and kissing someone are typically interpreted as temporary properties or events which take place in a particular place at a particular time: John was drunk last night in his office, or he kissed Mary on Sunday 13th of May, 2001, at 2:13pm, for exactly 8,56 seconds. Contrastingly, in (2), if one is intelligent or in love, one tends to retain these properties for a relatively long period of time. Although one’s mental capacities may change due to accidents and illnesses and although one may well fall out of love, this does not change the fact that these properties are potentially stable and long-lasting:",

      "abstract": "This paper is not about the silence of the other. Neither is it a phenomenological, hermeneutical, political, aesthetical or ethnographical account of silence taken as a form of existential practice. It concerns an ethics. It explores, rather than an ethics of semiotic care or recognition, an ethical structure, possibility or resources of silence, the still auditory, disclosed in the disrelational ontology of language: a richness and complexity of that dramatic tension, the postlapsarian interplay between fallen time and fallen language; the key question is how not to sanitise, fetishise and economise on the dialogic inadequacy of the other, of the dumb foreigner in us. Silence, thus approached as a universal speech act, as the inclusive preclusion of the word across time, space and cultures, is more specific, precise and resonant than quietude or muteness, the absence or eradication of sounds. Silence, thus understood, is then not a mystified non-language, a solipsistic disproof or disqualification of mediated communication but the language that is forever foreign. The originary force of silence, its speechless power is an evolutionary index to ethical dialogue, or rather dialogue as an ethical act. We, of we-are-the-world, should be able to communicate not in spite of, but through, silence.",

      "title": "The Metaphysics of Death",
      "abstract": "This collection of seventeen essays deals with the metaphysical, as opposed to the moral issues pertaining to death. For example, the authors investigate (among other things) the issue of what makes death a bad thing for an individual, if indeed death is a bad thing. This issue is more basic and abstract than such moral questions as the particular conditions under which euthanasia is justified, if it is ever justified. Though there are important connections between the more abstract questions addressed in this book and many contemporary moral issues, such as euthanasia, suicide, and abortion, the primary focus of this book is on metaphysical issues concerning the nature of death: What is the nature of the harm or bad involved in death? (If it is not pain, wha is it, and how can it be bad?) Who is the subject of the harm or bad? (if the person is no longer alive, how can he be the subject of the bad? An if he is not the subject, who is? Can one have harm with no subject?) When does the harm take place? (Can a harm take place after its subject ceases to exist? If death harms a person, can the harm take place before the death occurs?) If death can be a bad thing, would immorality be a desirable alternative? This family of questions helps to fram ethe puzzle of why—and how—death is bad. Other subjects addressed include the Epicurean view othat death is not a misfortune (for the person who dies); the nature of misfortune and benefit; the meaningulness and value of life; and the distinction between the life of a person and the life of a living creature who is not a person. There is an extensive bibiography that includes science-fiction treatments of death and immorality.",

      "abstract": "English-speakers sometimes say that they feel moved to tears, emotionally touched, stirred, or that something warmed their heart; other languages use similar passive contact metaphors to refer to an affective state. We propose and measure the concept of kama muta to understand experiences often given these and other labels. Do the same experiences evoke the same kama muta emotion across nations and languages? We conducted studies in 19 different countries, five continents, 15 languages, with a total of 3542 participants. We tested the construct while validating a comprehensive scale to measure the appraisals, valence, bodily sensations, motivation, and lexical labels posited to characterize kama muta. Our results are congruent with theory and previous findings showing that kama muta is a distinct positive social relational emotion that is evoked by experiencing or observing a sudden intensification of communal sharing. It is commonly accompanied by a warm feeling in the chest, moist eyes or tears, chills or piloerection, feeling choked up or having a lump in the throat, buoyancy and exhilaration. It motivates affective devotion and moral commitment to communal sharing. While we observed some variations across cultures, these five facets of kama muta are highly correlated in every sample, supporting the validity of the construct and the measure.",

      "abstract": "The disposition of Article 299 Part 1 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine provides criminal liability for animal’s cruel treatment, including for inflicting bodily harm in the injury form. However, regulations and sources of scientific literature don’t contain a definition of the animal mutilation concept and the procedure for its establishment. Therefore, the aim of the study was to analyze the practice of forensic veterinary examination of animal’s bodily injuries, which resulted in injury. The article shows that the author's definition of \"animal mutilation\" is a persistent disorder of animal health due to injury or its consequences, congenital malformations, diseases, accidents that led to complete or partial loss of any organ or animal body part, or to the total or partial loss of only the functions of the organ or parts of the animal's body, which in the interaction of the animal with the environment may lead to permanent loss or significant limitation of the ability to provide physiological manifestations at the level of other animals of the same species(nutrition, reproduction, orientation and movement in space, coordination of movements, natural lifestyles, contact with other animals, self-defense, ability to perform useful work, etc.), and distorts the appearance of the animal due to mutilation of body parts due to deformation, and their physical absence. The purpose of a live subject with signs of injury forensic veterinary examination is to determine the location, nature, severity of damage to animal health, nature of the injury, the degree of disability of the animal in connection with the injury, as well as solving other tasks within the competence of forensic veterinary expert, as well as at the request of the body or person who appointed the expertise or involved the expert. It was stated that the forensic veterinary examination objects are live experimental animals in order to establish their mutilation, including victims of abuse or other illegal actions, as well as signs of congenital malformations, pathological conditions that developed during breeding, animal’s exploitation and transportation; accidents. It was found out that the subjects of forensic veterinary examination of the subject for the purpose of establishing its mutilation are veterinarians who have higher veterinary education, have been trained in forensic veterinary examination in the expert specialty 18.1 \"Veterinary Research\" and have the forensic veterinary expert qualification. When deciding on the infliction of an animal bodily injuries that caused its injury, the forensic veterinary expert must use the \"Rules of forensic veterinary determination of the severity of damage to animal health\" and the \"Methodology of forensic veterinary examination of animals to determine their injury\". Key words: animals, mutilation, injuries, ill-treatment, forensic veterinary examination.",

First, the average person can discriminate and remember hundreds of faces in spite of the fact that, by any objective measure, faces are highly similar objects.1 This talent is not merely a marginal perceptual skill, for the ability to distinguish two faces as different and the same face as the same is often powerful enough to overcome changes due to cosmetics, dress, eyeglasses, and beards, and even the effects of age. Second, the average person uses the face as a source of a great amount of information about other individuals. Identification is but one aspect of this information; faces also serve as the basis for inferences about character and personality, mood, and the specific feelings being expressed by another person.",

The child finds certain aspects of the anxieties intolerable, and so begins to set up defences. In perfectionism a hate of the world that would turn it upside down is dealt with in advance.

As a result, a character fights against the fatal forces or loses his/her will - falls without unconscious (the most frequent reaction), begs for mercy or runs away.

The body is a variable in social interaction. For example, having a cold can make us irritable and grumpy, being in shape can compel us to start up a neighbourhood pickup basketball game and having frozen toes at an outdoor football game can force us to retreat to a heated home before the game is over.

      "abstract": "It is necessary that the adolescent be prepared to face the bio-psycho-social changes that are implicit in this period of growth. This allows the constructive participation in the second process of separation and individualisation. Should this separation be lacking there is the risk of a developmental breakdown (Laufer and Laufer, 1984). In this situation the appearance of self destructive behaviors can be fatal as seen in anorexia, bulimia, drug dependency and suicide. The roots of these self destructive choices seem to be found in the lack of clear definition of the initial process of separation and individualisation from the first part of the second year to the end of the third due to relational disturbance in the mother-child relationship in the symbiotic phase (beginning of the third month-end of the first year). One of the constants in the behavior of an addict that can be found in most self-destructive behaviors is the concept of one's body as an enemy. In order to maintain a connection to his archaic parental objects that allow him to protect an ideal self image, the addict denies the reality of his body. The extreme consequence of this can be found in the paradoxical and delirious decision to « die so as not to die ». There is a moment in the life of the addict in which a change from addiction as a search for pleasure turns into addiction as a game with death. The addict becomes convinced that it is worth while to risk death so as to live. In other words his behavior becomes very similar to the ordalic, where, challenging death, he repeatedly attacks his own security",

      "abstract": "Consciousness tends to be viewed either as subjective experience of sensations and feelings, or as perception and internal representation of objects. This paper argues that neither view sufficiently acknowledges that consciousness may refer to the brain's most adaptive property: its capacity to produce states of objectivity. It is proposed that this capacity relies on multiple sensorimotor networks for internally representing objects and their properties in terms of expectancies, as well as on motivational and motor mechanisms involved in exploration, play, and care for vulnerable living and non-living objects. States of objectivity are associated with a very special phenomenal aspect; the experience that subjective aspects are absent and one is \"just looking\" at the world as it really is and can be. However, these states are normally closely preceded and followed by (and tend to be combined or fused with) sensations and feelings which are caused by activation of sensory and motivational mechanisms. A capacity for objectivity may have evolved in different species and can be conceived as a common basis for other elusive psychological properties such as intelligence, conscience, and esthetic experience; all three linked to crucial behaviors in human evolution such as tool making, cooperation, and art. The brain's pervasive tendency to objectify may be responsible for wrongly equating consciousness with feelings and wrongly opposing it to well-learned or habitual (\"unconscious\") patterns of perception and behavior.",

      "abstract": "The mechanisms of vulnerability come into play, mechanisms which call on the social resources of the person concerned, on his social anchorages but also on the chain of experience which constitutes his real-life world. Family socialisation, acquired values, the social trajectory, possible situations of betrayal which lead to a precarious identity, everything can finally converge towards a vulnerability which is not latent but real. Vulnerability is no longer restricted to the domain of the badly-integrated or excluded, it touches the whole of the social world. Vulnerability as being specific to the responsible human being, a vulnerability of a moral nature, as it were, and vulnerability making it impossible for a person to appear to the world, in other words a vulnerability of a social nature. Responding to the potential vulnerability of the other person, is the vulnerability of he who responds and who not only 'always has one response more to give' but a responsibility which is inexhaustible.",

      "abstract": "A witness is defined as one who provides of a fact or an event whose attestation fulfills the role of or serving as evidence to that which has occurred. [1] Such attestation becomes concrete and enduring through either the witness' written record or the legal provision of testimony within a court of law.\n\nBy its nature, history is subject to interpretation by those who were not present. Sometimes, interpretation challenges the very existence of events themselves (historical revisionism). Historical research, therefore, must be founded upon the physical record of primary archival material and the testimony of witnesses to maintain its veracity. While the witness is often chosen by fate alone, in certain situations special skills may choose the witness. The observations made by such a witness coupled with astute interpretation of the reasons for the events themselves can serve as catalysts that modify subsequent human conduct.\n\nSuch a witness was neurology's own Leo Alexander. Because of his special skills in linguistics, neurobiology, and psychiatry, Alexander was chosen to prepare intelligence reports on medical practices within the Third Reich's army, its mental institutions, and its prison camps immediately after the end of World War II. In a frenzy of activity during one brief summer in 1945, and under a mandate from the Combined Intelligence Operative Sub-Committee (CIOS) of the United States VIIth Army, Alexander completed seven reports providing first-hand testimony of the perversion of medicine and medical science in the totalitarian setting of Nazi Germany. [2-8] These reports contained primary archival material, debriefings of physician-participants, and synopses of Alexander's review of captured documents. They were prepared not only to satisfy the intelligence needs of a victorious army, but also to fulfill an individual physician's need to record and comprehend for posterity that which bordered on the incomprehensible.\n\nThere can …",

There are regularities characteristic of beliefs and desires, regularities that dictate both the effect of certain sort of evidence on what beliefs and desires are maintained, and the effect of certain sorts of belief–desire profiles on what responses are evinced. Those regularities will typically identify what it is to be evidentially rational in the attitudes one holds and responsively rational in the responses one makes, though they may also point us toward obstacles that get in the way of rational performance. A system will count as an intentional agent to the extent that its interactions with its environment, or at least some of its interactions, are governed by such regularities.",

Such behavior of dehumanization and objectification of others, where we spend some attention to discover the common ground, may eventually lead us in one direction: Fear. When a person feels weak and threatened, he/she tends to do things that don’t see others as human beings to vent their aggression. In modern civilization, all human behavior stems from only two different, most fundamental motives, one of which is motivated by love and one by fear. Love is a product of the evolution of the human mind and consciousness, while fear governs the most basic physiological and survival needs of human beings.",

      "title": "ELDERLY ALIENATION, SATISFACTION, AND SOCIAL CLASS",
      "abstract": "BACKGROUND Alienation usually refers to certain perceptions and feelings that individuals have about themselves and aspects of their social environment. According to Seeman (1959), alienation is characterized by five symptoms: social isolation (real or perceived), meaninglessness normlessness. powerlessness, and self-estrangement. Alienation is typified more accurately by degree and direction. Social structures and institutions often attribute to the aged feelings of having little if any aontrol over their life situation. Ambivalence and existential meaning loss occur. Frankl (1963), held that man is a spiritual being motivated not by the will to pleasure or the will to power but by the will to meaning. Aged persons find themselves in a state of melancholy where they become desensitized to the inherent values In their own being and subsequently to the values outside themselves. Reisman (1971), maintains>that alienation is genesis of loneliness. He set forth a typology of man as inner-directed and man as outer-directed as a function of the social structure. A social structure imposing direction consists of increased personal mobility, rapid accumulation of capital, technological shifts and constant expansionism. The source of direction for the individual is inner in the sense that it is implanted early in life by the elders and directed towards generalized, inescapable goals. Inner directed persons receive more input to the self with no opportunity for, reciprocity. The other directeGl individual has as its source others on whom s/he depends on for validation and unlike the directed person who is acted upon, ~s engaging in activity. Park's notion (1959), of marginal man emphasizes that while an individual's personality has a physiological makeup, it achieves its final form under the individual conception of self. This conception is determined by the role which society assigns the person, and the attitudes others in society form of him. The aged persons find themselves in a marginal, alienated position. Weiss (1973), has focused on disengagement theory as a descriptive model for alienation. As society has increased in mobility and complexity, individuals are forced to engage and disengage from significant others. This may OCCUr developmentally in terms of age and peer pressure or by formal positioning in a social stratum. The constant shifts in structural definitions reduce the chances for the longevity of relations with others. Alienation and its association to the lower class has been demonstrated in several studies (Faris, Dunham 1960, Hollingshead, & Redlich 1958, Meyers 1959). The elderly person of low socio-economic status not only has been structurally disengaged from society, but if in a lower class has the Iiklihoodof beihg alienated as well. The alienation in terms of magnitude and intensity is higher. Thus mental disorders in the elderly may have to do not with intrinsic personality disorders but rather with structural shifts. Faris and Dunham (1960), found that the elderly residing in the central business districts of lower class status, were more likely to be alienated or isolated and that these factors are thus related to the high rates of schizophrenia.",

They talk about society in a way as if it shares same attributes with human being: can be sick (as if it has body), can think (as if it has mind), can speak (as if it has mouth), for example. It is quite obvious that this gesture implies a view of society as an agglomeration of individuals. The problem arises around the legitimacy of this gesture: namely, to analogize the society as individuals always implies a logical leap. Things even get murkier when this gesture is applied even more to the way in which people recognize the state: as collectivities, as a &ldquo;big-person.&rdquo; This gesture, which has methodological impact, is what the author call &lsquo;anthropomorphism analogy&rsquo;.

      "abstract": "Fieldwork can be defined as any activity that involves leaving the school classroom, university lecture hall, laboratory or the confines of one's own home and getting outside, for some purpose connected to learning. As with any definition, there are uncertainties at the edges. For example, what precisely is meant by 'outside'? Can going round a large aquarium (when one is under a roof) count as fieldwork? I am not too bothered about providing a watertight definition; this is not a situation where the uncertainties are that important. Watching a computer simulation of river pollution, however well designed and educationally valuable, is not an example of fieldwork (though used before, after or even concurrently with fieldwork it may well help with learning). Determining the distribution of plants on a moorland (biology) is, as are mapping rock types in a location (physical geography or earth science), undertaking a survey of traffic in a city centre (human geography, sociology or social studies), asking people on a beach about their use of sunscreen (psychology) or surveying grave stones in a churchyard (history). To all intents and purposes, therefore, fieldwork can be equated with out-of-classroom learning, though the term is most often used in a way that implies being in the natural environment – without wanting to get into a long discussion about what is meant by 'natural', which I am not equating with 'wilderness'.",

      "title": "Role of the Amygdala in Decision‐Making",
      "abstract": "A bstract : The somatic marker hypothesis proposes that both the amygdala and the orbitofrontal cortex are parts of a neural circuit critical for judgment and decision‐making. Although both structures couple exteroceptive sensory information with interoceptive information concerning somatic/emotional states, they do so at different levels, thus making different contributions to the process. We define ‘ primary inducers ’ as stimuli that unconditionally, or through learning (e.g., conditioning and semantic knowledge), can (perceptually or subliminally) produce states that are pleasurable or aversive. Encountering a fear object (e.g., a snake), a stimulus predictive of a snake, or semantic information such as winning or losing a large sum of money are all examples of primary inducers. ‘ Secondary inducers ’ are entities generated by the recall of a personal or hypothetical emotional event or perceiving a primary inducer that generates ‘thoughts’ and ‘memories’ about the inducer, all of which, when they are brought to memory, elicit a somatic state. The episodic memory of encountering a snake, losing a large sum of money, imagining the gain of a large sum of money, or hearing or looking at primary inducers that bring to memory ‘thoughts’ pertaining to an emotional event are all examples of secondary inducers. We present evidence in support of the hypothesis that the amygdala is a critical substrate in the neural system necessary for triggering somatic states from primary inducers. The ventromedial cortex is a critical substrate in the neural system necessary for the triggering of somatic states from secondary inducers. The amygdala system is a priori a necessary step for the normal development of the orbitofrontal system for triggering somatic states from secondary inducers. However, once this orbitofrontal system is developed, the induction of somatic states by secondary inducers via the orbitofrontal system is less dependent on the amygdala system. Perhaps the amygdala is equivalent to the hippocampus with regard to emotions, that is, necessary for acquiring new emotional attributes (anterograde emotions), but not for retrieving old emotional attributes (retrograde emotions). Given the numerous lesion and functional neuroimaging studies illustrating the involvement of the amygdala in complex cognitive and behavioral functions, including ‘social cognition,’ we suggest that this involvement is a manifestation of a more fundamental function mediated by the amygdala, which is to couple stimuli/entities with their emotional attributes, that is, the processing of somatic states from primary inducers.",

Nor can they be clearly distinguished from the feelings discussed in the last chapter under the terms of sneering and defiance. Disgust is a sensation rather more distinct in its nature, and refers to something revolting, primarily in relation to the sense of taste, as actually perceived or vividly imagined; and secondarily to anything which causes a similar feeling, through the sense of smell, touch, and even of eyesight. Nevertheless, extreme contempt, or, as it is often called, loathing contempt, hardly differs from disgust. These several conditions of the mind are, therefore, nearly related; and each of them may be exhibited in many different ways. Some writers have insisted chiefly on one mode of expression, and others on a different mode. From this circumstance M. Lemoine has argued that their descriptions are not trustworthy. But we shall immediately see that it is natural that the feelings which we have here to consider should be expressed in many different ways, inasmuch as various habitual actions serve equally well, through the principle of association, for their expression.",

      "abstract": "Within any health profession, we begin to examine a person, animal, community or ecosystem when we have some inkling that something might be amiss. Usually, someone comes to the practitioner with a complaint: the animal has diarrhoea, the person is having trouble breathing, the water smells funny, there are dead ducks along the shoreline. This is called the 'presenting complaint'. Certain symptoms and signs characterize this complaint. Symptoms are what a person or animal feels (headaches, depression); signs are what can be measured (temperature, heart rate, dead bodies). We tend to think that a dysfunctional ecosystem might have signs but no symptoms; however, ecosystem ill-health may be manifest by symptoms in the people and animals living there. For instance, poet Leonard Cohen captured the feeling of dis-ease between external events and internal feelings in one of his songs when he said it 'looks like freedom but it feels like death'. In general, presenting complaints have to do with symptoms, and practitioner responses have to do with signs. This book will tend to focus on signs, but the process we finally arrive at in Chapter 6 is designed to improve symptoms as well.",

It is a phenomenon in which their own expectations of themselves or what other people expect from them can influence their behavior and performance. Moreover, this works even at the most basic, primitive physiological level — in an enriched environment, the brain becomes larger in volume, and the density of its nervous tissue increases, while provoking severe stress or depleted conditions reduce the number of nerve cells in the brain. People in the USSR had absolute confidence that in the end good would win (the Pygmalion effect or placebo in the language of medicine), while from the 1990s to the present day, inclusive, the opposite attitude (program) totally prevails in Russia — evil will still prevail (the Golem effect or nocebo in the language of medicine). The proof of the Pygmalion effect in Soviet times is modal personalities — those who realized all the best of their (Soviet) era. There are countless of such examples in Soviet times. One of the most prominent of them in the philosophical environment was Professor V.A. Kutyrev. Anyone could become an academician, philosopher, engineer, officer or cosmonaut, etc. It was the Pygmalion effect in action.",

      "title": "Loneliness: The Silent Killer",
      "abstract": "Loneliness is a universal human emotion that is both complex and unique to everyone. It has no single and widespread cause. Therefore, the prevention and treatment of loneliness as a potentially damaging state of mind can vary dramatically from person to person. Notwithstanding the deleterious impact on quality of life and life satisfaction, loneliness has an equivalent risk factor to health as smoking fifteen cigarettes a day, thereby shortening one's life span by eight years. Humans can survive three minutes without air, three days without water, three weeks without food—as told by survival lore—and three months without companionship. We are a social and gregarious people. People simply need people. Loneliness is a complicated emotion. Some people can feel lonely in a crowded room or feel content in solitude. A quick way to think about loneliness is this: It's the difference between how much social connection or interaction people want and how much they are getting. It is essential to acknowledge that these relationships should be important and positive. A few positive relationships are far better than a dozen negative interactions. Thus, it is a subjective feeling. Without that social connection, people often become depressed, which further feeds feelings of loneliness. Loneliness has been linked to higher rates of heart disease, alcohol and drug addition, violence, anxiety, depression, altered brain function, Alzheimer's disease progression, decreased memory and learning, increased stress levels, suicide, and even death. Loneliness is almost as prevalent as obesity and has shown to impact all aspects of quality of life. Loneliness causes people to feel empty, alone, and unwanted. Loneliness is clearly a public health concern. Over the past two decades, there has been a threefold increase in the number of Americans who say they have no close confidants. More than fifty-five million people in the US described themselves as lonely or socially isolated. One of our responses to COVID-19 is social distancing, where we stay six feet away from others. This is a misnomer. Don't we really mean physically distancing because we engage in phone conversations, email each other, attend Zoom meetings, and so on? Perhaps it is time for US institutions of higher education to follow one approach to combating loneliness used in the United Kingdom: appointing a minister of loneliness at the dean's level or above. Loneliness is a universal condition that affects all of us directly or through the people we know and love. A sad reality of modern life is that loneliness is pervasive and on the rise. In fact, since 1985, the number of people in the US who indicated they had no close friends has tripled. Loneliness has been found to be a serious impediment to flourishing while cultivating strong positive connections with people has been seen to bring meaning and well-being to individuals. Loneliness is also a strong predictor of poor health. To feel lonely is to experience a sense of being painfully disconnected, left out, and isolated, with no one to turn to for emotional and social support. Since the dawn of antiquity, we have been built to be social creatures. Across key demographics, younger generations are lonelier than older generations, men are lonelier than women, higher-income people are less lonely than those with lower incomes, and those living in urban and suburban communities are less lonely than those in rural areas. Department chairs are in an enviable position to address loneliness in their faculty and staff. Although COVID-19 has reduced in-person interactions, chairs can still be cognizant of how department members are relating to other faculty, staff, and students. Colleges are often equipped with resources and services such as group sessions, counseling, and workshops to proactively address many types of issues. One of the best ways that chairs can help with loneliness is to recognize that it is a very real possibility and to stay connected with faculty and staff via regular interactions with them. Perhaps Thomas Wolfe said it best in God's Lonely Man: “The whole conviction of my life now rests upon the belief that loneliness, far from being a rare and curious phenomenon, peculiar to myself and a few other solitary men, is the central and inevitable fact of human existence.” Robert E.

      "abstract": "Abstract When people avoid conflict, there is no “away.” Where do they go physically or mentally? Both engaging and avoiding have a push and a pull. If we knew where avoiders go, we could study the pull of avoidance. This is a descriptive study ( N = 446) of interpersonal conflict. We found that physical and mental avoidance appeared with similar frequency, and that they could occur in combination. People often recognized their need for avoidance early, based on the topic being familiar or various signals of trouble. Avoidance during the conflict could be physical or mental, but notably involved false agreement or topic manipulation. The possibility of violence (physical, verbal, or emotional) was often relevant. Relationship worries frequently motivated the avoidance. After the avoidance rumination was common, often centering on what we called “festering anger.”",

      "abstract": "A typical traditional psychophysics has been concerned with a functional relation between a single sensory dimension and a single physical dimension. However, a perceptual object is usually defined by many perceptual dimensions and related to many physical dimensions. Accordingly a multidimensional state-space model of perception is proposed. The state space of visual perception consists of several dimensions including perceptual dimensions of color, shape, size, as well as spatial dimensions. A point in the state space represents a perceptual object which has some color, size, shape, and is located at a certain point in the visual space of an observer. Different points in the state space correspond to different perceptual objects in some perceptual characteristics and/or in location. Distances between these points correspond to differences in perceptual characteristics and/or perceived spatial separation. Interactions between different points indicate some perceptual phenomena related to these objects, e.g. perceptual grouping, apparent motion, etc.",

      "abstract": "To possess the virtue of honesty or kindness, it is not enough to act sometimes in honest or kind ways. Virtues, like character traits in general, are standing properties of agents that explain their actions. Over the past decade or so, philosophers have debated whether the findings of experimental social psychology undermine the traditional confidence that people do indeed possess such dispositions. This debate has supposed that dispositions are states that generate a particular kind of output from a particular kind of input. The fragility of a vase, on this view, is the disposition to shatter when struck with a certain amount of force. Likewise, the virtue of compassion is, or includes, a disposition to respond to other people's suffering, or the prospect of it, with actions, or at least thoughts and feelings, that tend towards alleviating or averting that suffering. The disagreement has concerned whether people really can develop dispositions to respond appropriately to such a stimulus irrespective of the fine details of the context in which that stimulus occurs (see Miller, this volume, Chapter 37). However, there are many virtues and other character traits that are not properly understood in terms of stimulus and response. The virtues of constancy, fidelity and integrity form one cluster of such traits. These traits may be displayed in behaviour in difficult circumstances, but what seems essential to them is not the way in which one responds to any particular kind of situation.",

      "abstract": "A philosophical question'What is happiness?'In these words one sometimes seeks a resolution of certain philosophical difficulties: Is happiness the satisfaction one obtains when one's desires are satisfied?Is it the capacity to be pleased with what one has and to enjoy what one does?Is the happy person one who enjoys life or one who has attained inner peace?How far does a person's happiness depend on his state of soul, his values and attitudes to things, and how far on his external circumstances.What can one do to be happy?Can the desire for happiness be anything other than a form of selfseeking?These and other questions come crowding in.Yet they do not come from ignorance.One who asks them knows well enough what the word means and what he or she is talking about.They are an expression of perplexity and seek for an order in one's appre- hension of what is familiar territory, for a clearer view of the application of the concept of happiness and its relations to a host of other concepts: enjoyment, pleasure, satisfaction, gladness, joy, doing what one wants, contentment, serenity, virtue, and many others.It is worth noting that the words 'What is happi- ness?' may also express a request for something dif- ferent: for one's conception of happiness to be made explicit.This involves bringing out what one considers to be of supreme importance in life.Here too one is called on to reflect on what one already knows, on 'what lies open to view'.But what is in question here is not the application of and the connections between concepts with which speakers of one's language are familiar.What is in question are one's own thoughts, attitude to life, desires and ambitions, beliefs and val- ues.The question this time calls for self-reflection, and this bears a certain resemblance to philosophical reflec- tion.It may even lead one to certain philosophical questions and so come to be intertwined with philo- sophical reflection.Two people can thus attach the same meaning to the word 'happiness' and yet have very different concep- tions of happiness.Consequently they may differ over whether or not someone is happy, as Socrates and Polus differed over whether Archelaus, the Macedo-",

      "title": "Borderline desire",
      "abstract": "Abstract The borderline personality unconsciously seeks emotional turbulence because this complex of affect is the shape of the object of desire. Whether these people were intrinsically disturbed as infants, or, whether the early object world was itself disturbing, they knew the maternal object as disruptive effect. This effect then became the shape of the object, so, in seeking turbulence they are in fact constituting the primary object. As painful and disturbing an event as this is, it is nonetheless desired and finding themselves in states of distress is unconsciously gratifying. This person cultivates “borderline objects” which evoke turbulent frames of mind. Such an object usually has an escalatory potential to it, so that the borderline may turn to ordinary distressing facts of life—environmental pollution, harassment of workers in the work place—and transform these facts into self stimulating objects. They bring about a toxic response which constitutes the object of desire. The borderline personality often seeks moments of misunderstanding with the psychoanalyst paradoxically enough in order to feel closer to the clinician. If he feels that he is bringing about irritation or distress in the analyst, the patient feels that he and the analyst are sharing the primary experience together. By persistently interpreting to the patient the unconscious desire of his character the analyst can effectively deconstruct the analysand's pathological attachment and help the patient to understand a complex dynamic that has always put this person at acute odds with himself, let alone with others.",

      "title": "Consumption",
      "abstract": "Consumption Mavis Reimer From the time that the word consumption entered English from Latin in the late fourteenth century, according to the Oxford English Dictionary, it carried a double meaning: it could refer to the “wasting of the body” generally (and so came to signify such illnesses as pulmonary disease) and it could refer to the “action or fact of destroying or being destroyed,” such as when a fire reduces something to ashes. Following these nominal uses in English, the verb consume was coined almost immediately to mean, first, to destroy something physically, and shortly thereafter, in its intransitive form, “to eat or drink; to ingest” specifically and to use or exploit resources more generally, and, in its transitive form, to spend (for example, money), especially wastefully, and to squander (for example, goods), as well as to “engage the full attention or energy of (a person).” Linked, then, from its beginnings as an English word to the body, the market, and forms of response, and associated simultaneously or alternately with necessity, engagement, disease, destruction, and waste, consumption has never been a simple idea. Its complications persist. In the introduction to The Oxford Handbook of the History of Consumption—a thirty-four-chapter, 695-page overview, published in 2012, of the state of scholarly study in the field—Frank Trentmann defines the contemporary study of consumption as including questions about “[t]he acquisition, use, and waste of things, taste and desire” (1); as “a major point of interface” between history and such disciplines as anthropology, sociology, and geography, “stimulating new directions in cultural, global, and material history” (2); and as a prompt to historians, including historians of the present, “to think about the production, representation, and circulation of things, and about the nature of symbolic communication, material practices, and identity formations” (2). Given all of this, Trentmann’s [End Page 1] opening assertion—that “[c]onsumption is a mirror of the human condition” (1)—does not seem to be an overreaching claim. Eating has been said to be “the prototype” of consumption, as Alan Warde observes in his chapter in Trentmann’s volume (377), the first instance from which other kinds of consumption are derived. There are some senses in which this would seem obviously to be true. Standard anthropological accounts of the long history of the development of human societies, for example, focus on the transitions in food sources available to those societies, with forager or hunter-gatherer groups displaying social organizations distinctly different from those of agricultural groups. In The Raw and the Cooked, Claude Lévi-Strauss famously argues that cooking food is the means by which humans first distinguish themselves from other animals and begin to manufacture culture: “not only does cooking mark the transition from nature to culture, but through it and by means of it, the human state can be defined with all its attributes” (164). While he maintains that the categorization of food as raw, cooked, or rotten is basic to all human cuisines (and metaphorically extended to other social activities), what is assigned to each of these categories varies from culture to culture. Once established, however, “culinary traditions remain recognizable over centuries,” according to food researchers, with “eating habits … among the most resistant to change” and “food behaviours … among the last to be abandoned by migrants” (Warde 376–77). The complex commitments of groups to particular food and eating behaviours are noted by Roland Barthes in “Toward a Psychosociology of Contemporary Food Consumption” when he proposes that food is not only a source of nutrition but also “a system of communication, a body of images, a protocol of usages, situations, and behavior” that can be “read” for its semiotic codes as many other everyday practices can be (29).1 In Mythologies, published before the essay on method, Barthes performs such readings of wine and milk, steak and chips, and ornamental cookery, refusing to accept the “falsely obvious” notions of his society (11) and demonstrating that food can be read in relation to national imaginaries, capitalist systems of production, morphological structures of language, temporal organization, and the display of class identities, among other protocols and systems. In Distinction, his detailed analysis of the principles...",

There is one particular type of ADC that can be referred to as a bereavement detachment experience (BDE) because the experient has the impression of being out of and/or away from their physical body during that encounter. Despite the general absence of an imminent threat or a near-death condition associated with a BDE, there are a number of similar features that are also found in reports of the NDE, such as encountering and communicating with deceased loved ones, venturing through a dark place or a tunnel, seeing or entering into a bright light, entering into transcendental otherworldly environments, and feelings of love or peace. This is an exploratory study of the BDE in which seven case examples are examined for a possible thematic pattern and then analyzed for their similarities and differences with the NDE. The aftereffects of the BDE are also explored as a beneficial psychological outcome for the experient. The findings of this study have therapeutic implications with important insights for those providing care to the bereaved.",

      "title": "Emotional tears: What they are and how they work",
      "abstract": "Tears serve ophthalmic functions: They lubricate, nourish, and protect the cornea. Tearers produce tears non-permanently and at relatively low cost. And observers pay attention to the eyes of others and extract from eyes and faces a lot of information about others’ stable and transient characteristics, including their mental states. These background conditions may have led to the evolution in the human lineage of additional signaling functions in tears. Emotional tearing occurs during negative events (e.g., injuries) and positive events (e.g., achievements). Episodes of tearing appear to be united by tearers’ subjective imputation of negative or positive value to certain internal or external events. Knowing the degree to which things enhance or diminish one’s prospects—the value of things—is a pressing matter for humans and other organisms. Value information is produced for internal consumption, to be used by behavior-regulating mechanisms in the focal individual. But some value information is made available, in addition, to other people, through tearing and other forms of verbal and non-verbal communication. Tearing may function as an implicit plea for receivers to minimize the costs imposed on the tearer by nature, by third-parties, or by the receivers themselves—common when the tearer has lower formidability or wherewithal than receivers do. In addition, tearing may exhort receivers to infer and register which things the tearer values, positively or negatively. Here, we characterize tears, describe the game-theoretic logic of bargaining from a position of weakness, outline the computational systems that regulate the production of and responses to emotional tears, and review findings about emotional tearing that are relevant to the signaling hypothesis.",

The person is caused to have, or caused to form, such intentions as another wishes him to have. Hence, regardless of how it may 'feel' to him from the inside, from the external point of view people can see that he is not in control, not self-determining.

As such, alterations in biological systems that result from spaceflight would be expected to evidence themselves in subtle or even pronounced changes in the behavior of that organism. These alterations in visible behavior may then indicate or even be diagnostic of alterations in the physical well-being of humans and other animals as they adapt to space environments or readapt to Earth--alterations that might not otherwise be detected without relatively invasive and frequently expensive procedures. Moreover, behavior and performance constitute the central standard for evaluating the mission success of spaceflight ventures. The success or failure of any excursion into space is primarily indexed by the ability of astronauts and cosmonauts to perform the tasks and experiments of any particular mission, to land a re-entry vehicle after extended exposure to microgravity (as with the space shuttle), or to make time-critical and life-saving repairs or other decisions while in orbit (as with the recent Mir events). Thus, understanding the effects spaceflight on behavior and performance is inherently important, in addition to those insights that behavior can provide about the physiological consequences of space adaptation.",

      "abstract": "Physical and physiological experiences greatly differ in the degree to which they become meaningful elements of our narratives. Some experiences, however, are uniquely imbued with the power to evoke, or catalyze, the search for meaningful engagement with the environment. One such area is illness. This study examines differences in meaning-making processes involving commonplace experiences of physical sensations, particularly changes in temperature, and it does so within the uniquely charged context of illness. Semistructured interviews were conducted in two countries (Poland and the US). The data show interesting points of both convergence and divergence on the interpersonal, intergroup, and cross-situational levels. While we are all familiar with the particular physical experiences in question (drafts of air and sitting on a cold, hard surface), they are meaningful, and thus captured in participant narratives, only in some social contexts and/or only in conjunction with certain catalysts (e.g. illness). What is more, in the absence of such meaningful, shared explanatory tools, participants showed confusion as to the source of the illness. This study includes an exploration of the poetic notion of “catching the wolf” (a Polish expression for falling ill after sitting on a cold, hard surface).",

      "abstract": "Within each human group there is a set of commonly understood symbols attached to every generally experienced form of behavior which places it somewhere along a continuum between aggression and assistance and which has no necessary connection with the actual nature of the behavior. A man with a sharp instrument may represent a doctor, a fellow play actor or an enemy. When a segment of a group reacts to the behavior of another segment, it chooses a behavior symbolizing, among other things, some degree of aggression or some degree of assistance. That one segment takes the trouble to respond to another segment is a sufficient indication that the responding segment hopes to achieve some particular value or set of values through its response. Hence, if an aggressive response is made to an aggressive behavior, thus initiating conflict, it can be assumed that calculation or experience have indicated that the communication of aggressive intent is most likely to lead to value realization. Because the behavior of any two segments of a group must be in sufficient conformity to reality to permit the survival of both, it can be assumed that the choice of conflict as a mode of interaction is ordinarily rational. In any group which survives over a period of time, it can be expected that interaction between individuals and subgroups within it will be patterned in such a way that conflict occurs only under specified conditions and within definite limits. Built into the cultural tradition must be rules of the game which maintain a balance of power and insure that the degree of conflict which develops does not interfere significantly with the realization of values.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Ethologists and comparative psychologists have found that the social behavior, discrimination learning, and especially the communicative behavior of many animals are sufficiently versatile to call into question the customary denial that animals have mental experiences comparable to our own. Many of their behavior patterns suggest that animals have mental images of objects, events, or relationships remote from the immediate stimulus situation, as well as self-awareness and intentions concerning future actions. Our behavioristic Zeitgeist has inhibited investigation of such possibilities, but reopening these long-neglected questions requires no departure from the materialistic approach to biological and behavioral science. The basic question at issue involves a comparison of those aspects of human and nonhuman brain function that sometimes lead to what we call mental experiences, at least in our own species. It seems more feasible to devise objectively verifiable tests for the existence of these general categories of mental experiences than for that of many others. While many other kinds of evidence could well be used (with appropriate caution and all possible controls) to weigh the likelihood that animals sometimes know what they are doing, the experimental use of communicative behavior seems especially promising, because the latter could serve a function analogous to human language, which provides our best evidence about the mental experiences of our fellow men.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Problems of self-control as well as social cooperation may be seen as conflicts not between internal spiritual or neurological entities, but between highly valued overt behavioral patterns of differing temporal extents or social distances. For example, an alcoholic must choose between having a drink now—valuable in the short run—and being healthy, performing well at work, maintaining satisfying social relationships, etc. —valuable in the long run. The essential question addressed in this chapter is how the latter may come to dominate the former within a person's lifetime. A behavioral evolutionary process is proposed by which valuable temporally or socially extended behavior patterns evolve over an individual lifetime from simpler, shorter patterns. It is argued that complex patterns, such as social cooperation over long periods, arise from simpler patterns in behavioral evolution analogously to the way complex structures, such as the human eye, arise from simpler structures in biological evolution. The idea that complex, long-term behavioral patterns in conflict with short-term patterns, if they are not inherited in toto, must be generated by an internal and autonomous spiritual, neurological, or cognitive process is compared to creationism in biological evolution. The role of delay and social discount functions in measuring the extent of coherent behavioral patterns is explicated. Finally, the chapter examines several implications of teleological behaviorism for practical behavioral control.",

Compassion, in short, calls for particularity. The administration of the law, in contrast, calls for abstraction, it encourages an approach which treats people in general terms. Law's emphasis is on generality and the sameness of people; for justice demands that rights and obligations be applied equally, often irrespective of particular circumstances.

We are constantly threatened by the danger of i) being infected, ii) infecting other people, and (iii) by the loss of social relation. Departing from these premises, we here aim to investigate the psychological and neurodynamics of this complex phenomenon. First, we discuss about recent psychological and neuronal findings on fear and its disorders, related to an unbalanced intero-exteroceptive processing and emotional regulation. Secondly we move to the psychological and neuronal dynamics of self and others characterized by a temporo-spatial alignment with the world. Due to the neural overlap of emotion and self and the deep-reaching neuro-ecological layers of self, emotional feelings like fear and anxiety cannot be detached and dissociated from the world; they signify the world-brain relation, and, more specifically, our self-other relation. The deepest neuro-ecological and neuro-social layers of self are threatened by the loss of subjectivity, which is manifest in our loss of body and thus the fear of dying, and the loss of intersubjectivity that surfaces in our fear of infecting others, which reflect the intimate anchorage of the self with the world. In our opinion the pandemic of COVID-19 deeply affect our sense of self and its spatio-temporal neuronal dynamics providing the prerequisites for the manifestation of fear and existential anxiety, thus disrupting the brain-world relation with significant repercussions on our psyche and on our daily lives.",

A sense that events are irrational and fundamentally unpredictable arises, regardless of whether the reference is to external events or the discussion concerns one's own organism. The body image begins to form in childhood, absorbing knowledge associated with sciences such as anatomy, physiology, and medicine, which is informed by the latter. For an alert consciousness, there are days when these stereotypes, tried and tested over the ages, begin to be shaky. Our consciousness has a prognostic function. At any moment in time, it may, so to speak, \"get ahead of itself on the basis of these stereotypes. But when they begin to fail, when the unpredictability of the future, both immediate and long-term, begins to threaten existence, fertile soil is created for belief in miracles. This belief is a psychological defense mechanism of the individual, his protection against stress and fears, something that gives his fragile life stability. Hope for a miracle arouses an urgent need for miracle-makers, on the part of society, social leaders, and the individual, for healers of body and soul.",

Second, in a science of behavior, everyday mentalistic terms like believe, expect, and intend either must be avoided or carefully redefined. Third, private events, if they need to be spoken of at all, are natural and share all the properties of public behavior. Even if they are to be spoken of, their origins lie in the environment, just like other behavior; behavior never originates in private events.

The effects of this hearing loss are complicated, being an interplay of physics, psychology, social interaction, etc. Because people are able to adapt, the extent of this “unseen” handicap is underappreciated. Responses by the public to an informative website (http://909ers.apl.washington.edu/∼dushaw/SSD) suggest that this handicap has a universal nature. Obvious effects are the inabilities to locate sound or to bilaterally process sound signals. Less obvious effects are a heightened sensitivity to noise: as masking to a desired signal, as a fatigue factor, as an impediment to mental concentration. The difficulties encountered when talking over the telephone to someone who is speaking in a noisy environment may give one an appreciation of the effects. Even less obvious effects are the long-term social implications of the handicap: the tendency to ignore those on one’s deaf side, the inability to function “normally” at noisy events such as parties, ASA receptions, etc., or a tendency to irritability in noisy environments.

Dalam kehidupan modern, terlalu banyak manusia yang membanggakan rasio, materi yang ada pada akhirnya dapat menjerumuskan manusia kejurang yang sangat dalam, yang mengakibatkan manusia memalingkan diri dari hal-hal yang bersifat supra natural. Dalam kehidupan manusia modern yang telah kehilangan jati dirinya, berjalan nyaris tanpa pedoman yang kokoh yang membuatnya sangat ringkih dan mudah terombang ambing dalam seribu satu krisis. 2. Agama mempunyai peran yang sangat penting dalam kehidupan manusia. Agama memberikan ketenangan dan ketentraman serta kedamaian batin. Dalam kaitannya dengan perilaku agama mengandung norma-norma dan etika yang akan mengarahkan manusia kepada jalan yang benar. Ketenangan dan ketentraman batin itu diperoleh dengan jalan dzikrullah",

Se rechaza violentamente al extranjero; a la minoria sospechosa; en definitiva, al que se percibe como subjetivamente como diferente; como des-semejante; este ultimo caracter lo convierte en enemigo; enemigo externo que se construye con restos libidinales no integrados al yo.

No one would hesitate to sacrifice the latter for the former, if it were necessary. We should add very much to our happiness by a timely recognition of the simple truth that every man's chief and real existence is in his own skin, and not in other people's opinions; and, consequently, that the actual conditions of our personal life, health, temperament, capacity, income, wife, children, friends, home, are a hundred times more important for our happiness than what other people are pleased to think of us: otherwise we shall be miserable.(Schopenhauer)",

      "title": "Teaching respect: philosophical",
      "abstract": "Teaching respect: a philosophical analysis According to a Zulu proverb a human being can only become truly human because of others. Each person can only become more human, more him self- regardless of his sex - through the co-involvement of others. It is the love for one’s neighbour and the respect one has for him/her as a person which makes one consider the other party's feelings, viewpoints and circumstances. In order to arrive at a situation of peaceful coexistence it is important to realize that human attitudes and a mature life style evolve through a process of learning and interaction with others. It is a time­ consuming and costly process which starts at infancy and continues throughout someone's life. Instruction concerning interpersonal relations and the teaching of respect cannot be confined to individual lessons or working sessions at home or in school. Discussions and conversations concerning interpersonal relations need to form an integral and natural part of a child’s life within the home environment and throughout the pupil's school career. It is senseless if educators talk about the importance of teaching respect only to reveal disrespectful behaviour themselves, or to talk about the importance of self-esteem in the paying of respect whilst causing children to feel negative about themselves. To be able to express respect to other human beings, one needs to be respected. A child needs to experience how it feels when homage is paid. The following rule of life applies in this regard: one can never give if one has never received respect.",

      "title": "EVOLUTION SUPPORT FOR MODEL-BASED DEVELOPMENT AND TESTING SUMMARY",
      "abstract": "3.1. Key aspects of the term Evolution Unfortunately, clear definition of the term evolution is missing. According to Lehman and Ramil (chapter 1 of [1]), the term evolution reflects a process of progressive, for example beneficial, change in the attributes of the evolving entity or that of one or more of its constituent elements. What is accepted as progressive must be determined in each context. It is also appropriate to apply the term evolution when long-term change trends are beneficial even though isolated or short sequences of changes may appear degenerative. For example, an entity or collection of entities may be said to be evolving if their value or fitness is increasing over time. Individually or collectively they are becoming more meaningful, more complete or more adapted to changing environment. Our understanding of the term related to the workshop theme covers the following key aspects: • Modification, change, progress, extension over time • State of an artefact at different points of time • Models change: dynamic versus static • Evolution versus revolution while revolution means the replacement of an existing system by new one",

      "title": "Locus of Control of High School Students of Punjab State",
      "abstract": "Locus of control refers to the extent to which individuals believe that they can control events that affect them. Understanding of the concept was developed by Julian B. Rotter in 1954, and has since become an important aspect of personality studies. One's (Latin for place or location) can either be internal (meaning the person believes that they control their life) or external (meaning they believe that their environment, some higher power, or other people control their decisions and their life).Locus of control refers to a person's beliefs about control over life events. Some people feel personally responsible for the things that happen to them. Those people are labeled as internals. Individuals with a high internal locus of control believe that events result primarily from their own behavior and actions. Others feel that their outcomes in life are determined by forces beyond their control (e.g.; fate, luck and other people). These people are labeled as externals. Those with a high external locus of control believe that powerful others, fate, or chance primarily determine events.Rotter while advocating his theory of social learning has given the concept of 'Locus of Control'. The construct of locus of control is a personality dimension involving an individual's perceived control over events occurring in his life. People are having internal or external locus of control. Locus of control is the extent to which people believe that they are responsible for their behavioral outcomes. It has often been cited as an important factor in achievement oriented behaviour. Rotter terms persons who strongly believe that they can shape their own destinies are called as internals. Those who believe that their outcomes are largely the result of forces outside their control are called as externals. Internals are often happier and better adjusted than externals.People with an internal locus of control tend to believe their behaviour influences outcomes. Internal locus of control individual believes that he is guided by his/her personal decisions and efforts. On the other hand, while those with external locus of control tend to attribute outcomes to outside forces, such as fate, chance and other people. External locus of control individual believes that his/her behaviour is guided by fate, luck, or other external circumstances. These people are labeled as externals.People need to believe in their own abilities to achieve and be happy. They need to develop a sense of control. People's locus of control influences how they view the world and how they identify the causes of success or failures in their lives. Internal factors mean personal whereas external are situational ones. Obviously, most people fall between the two extremes forming a continuous distribution of locus of control beliefs. Locus of control is thought to be relatively enduring dispositional characteristics, although certainly modifiable through experience.The variable of locus of control is of major significance in understanding the nature of learning processes in different kinds of learning situations. The construct of locus of control, an integral part of social learning theory of Rotter (1954) is a personality dimension involving an individual's perceived control over events occurring in his life. This concept grew out of Rotter's Social learning theory (1954) which provides the general theoretical background for his conception of the nature and effects of reinforcement and his work on levels of expectancies.According to this theory, the unit of investigation for the study of personality is the interaction of the individual and his meaningful environment and it is the study of learned behaviour. Behaviour as described by personality theorists has a directional aspect and this aspect is inferred from the effect of reinforcing conditions. The occurrence of behaviour of a person is determined not only by the nature or importance of goals or reinforcements but also by the person's anticipation or expectancy that their goals will occur. …",

      "abstract": "The number of notions of health is not infinite. In the history of medicine we can only find a number of different conceptions or paradigmatic ideas of health, in a variety of references and combinations. Health was seen as: 1. harmonious balance between principles or entities, 2. result of a struggle against opposing forces, 3. continuous dialectical process, 4. hierarchy of components or functions, 5. potential to perform and to develop, 6. transcendence towards higher levels of being, 7. result of conscious autonomous action, 8. optimal causal functioning, or 9. public task and responsibility. Hahnemann’s view of health, as reflected in his writings, utilized virtually all of these elements. They reappear for instance as: 1. harmonious tuning of the life force, 2. defeat of pathogenetic influences, 3. admittance of aggravations, 4. autocracy of the spirit-like life principle, 5. reference to a higher goal of human existence, 6. perfecting character of medical service, 7. concern about dietetics and life style, 8. utilization of causality and natural science, and 9. appealing to governmental provisions and medical police. These paradigms have been repeatedly recombined and applied. The theory of medicine is the attempt to analyze, adjust, and develop concepts that meet the demand of contemporary medical practice. Medical theory lies between the fields of observable facts and metaphysical convictions. Distinguishing the levels of practice, theory, and metaphysics could allow the open discussion of theoretical issues, such as the concept of health or disease, without raising purely theoretical objections to well-established practice.",

      "title": "Some Aspects of the Orcadian Time Structure in the Elderly",
      "abstract": "Rhythmicity is a fundamental property of living matter: biological rhythms in man as well as in other organisms can be demonstrated at all levels of organization (population, group, individual, organ, tissue, cell and subcellular structure). From a macroscopic point of view a rhythm implies regular periodicity of data displayed as a function of time. With the help of computers and special programs, it is possible to obtain a microscopic characterization and quantification of rhythm. A biorhythm can be characterized by the statistical estimation of several parameters: the period, the acrophase, the amplitude, the mesor. Each of these parameters is expressed as a mean with its confidence limits for a degree of security of 95%. With reference to the period, rhythms can be analyzed as a spectrum with several spectral domains: circadian rhythms (with period of about 24 h) are the most carefully studied, but other rhythms exist such as ultradian rhythms (period < 20 h) or infradian rhythms (period > 28 h, e.g. circamensual, circannual...). The acrophase is the peak time of the sine function used to approximate the rhythm. The amplitude is equal to half of the total rhythmic variability. The mesor is the mean adjusted rhythm; it corresponds to the 24-hour mean when sampling is performed at equal intervals. Circadian rhythms in blood variables are now fairly well documented in young healthy adults. Reports dealing with circadian rhythms in elderly subjects are few for obvious reasons, including the difficulty of gathering a group of elderly subjects comparable in age and social synchronization and moreover, free of major liver, heart, kidney, bone or any other degenerative disease and, consequently, not requiring medication. Therefore, we have undertaken a comparative study of the circadian rhythms in a group of 7 young healthy medical students (mean age 24 years) and in 18 elderly persons, free of the aforementioned diseases (mean age 80 years; 6 elderly men, 6 elderly women, 6 elderly women and men suffering from senile dementia). All subjects, either young or aged, were synchronized with respect to meal timing, diurnal activity and nocturnal rest. Blood samples were drawn at fixed times, every 4 h, during a single continuous span of 24 h beginning at 07.45 h (circadian rhythm) and the sampling was renewed four times a year to gather data on the circannual variations. Several biochemical variables were assayed, including electrolytes, enzymes, hormones. From these studies, it appears that the parameters characteristic of the biological rhythm may be modified with aging. However, the modifications are different from one function or variable to another. Differences in acrophases, mesors and amplitudes could be demonstrated. For instance, the acrophase may be shifted in the elderly for magnesium, calcium, proteins or some steroids, or on the contrary, it may be remarkably steady, e.g. for adrenal steroids, melatonin. The administration as a function of time of drugs or agents used as a diagnostic tool allowed to ascertain the importance of the time structure in this field. Both validity and interpretation of such administration depend upon the timing of the agent administration in the 24-hour scale. Therefore, the temporal organization of the subjects undergoing such treatments should be taken into account. One may presume that in a near future this type of investigation on various biological variables may lead to an improvement of the desired drug effects. Thus, the important changes observed in total serum proteins in the young and the aged, as well as the differences in the localization of their peak troughs, depending on the group, must be taken into consideration with regard to the roles played by serum proteins, in particular in the binding of several molecules, including hormones and drugs.",

      "abstract": "From the introduction]Genuine novelty is the introduction and creation of new things, relations, and affections in the world.Human experience constantly confronts us with novelty, in surprising, intimate ways (spotting new freckles, a great cup of hot chocolate, budding flowers), and in more time-extended, sweeping ways (invention of the automobile, the Little Ice Age, the development of homo sapiens).And yet things are the same.The novel always contains what has already been as a component, but with some modification.Generically, all novelty is the outcome of some creative act, and all creative acts beget some novelty.Apart from this, the concept of novelty is not homogenous.There can be novel itemsindividual and unique things.There can be novel kinds: new sorts of things or states of affairs, new types of events.There can be novel problems and questions and concepts.All novelty involves a measure of unpredictability and a measure of breaking from the status quo.And novelty is a pervasive element of human experience.I want to take this aspect of human experience seriously when doing metaphysics; I do not want to make the world of human experience secondary to some ineffable realm.Because our experience is an aspect of the real world, an account of novelty must acknowledge that the novel things that emerge in the course of events are \"genuine.\"That is, they are metaphysically significant and ontologically real.I want to construct a metaphysic that accommodates pervasive change and novelty, one that accommodates radical novelty.This is, however, a drastic change from much contemporary metaphysical work.Often, the way change is dealt with metaphysically renders our most intimate interactions and feelings an unimportant component of reality (if it is a component at all).Thus the reworking of many fundamental notions is required in order to make sense of the ideas of 'change' and 'novelty.'One of these notions is 'possibility.'Commonly held notions of possibility, such as an existenceless form (a \"possible object\" -a plaid apple, for example), or possibility as a rearrangement of the elements of actuality (taking what actually exists and putting it in new combinations -horse + horn = unicorn), drain all significance from the notion of novelty.In this paper, I attempt to revise our notion of possibility using Bergson and Whitehead by creating a picture that does not entail \"possible objects,\" but allows for a creative actuality and radical novelty.This modified view of possibility will provide a basis for understanding higher and more complex and coordinated forms of novelty.[...",

      "abstract": "Affection is a warm gentle feeling of caring for or loving somebody or something. It is goodwill. Fondness or kindly feeling is affection. Only a tender soul is the store house of affection. A soul that has already been hardened seldom shows affection. Affection is guided by emotion. As such affection is a disease. It is one kind of mental state or a mental disposition. Thus it signifies a person’s natural qualities of mind and character. Mother is always affectionate but father may not be so. Indulgence is the state of being allowed whatever one wants. It overlooks faults. It is the action or habit of satisfying one’s own or other people’s desires. Indulgence allows oneself to enjoy the pleasure of something. It is to become involved in an activity, especially one that is illegal or disapproved of. It is to satisfy an interest, a desire, etc..Sacrament is any of several rituals in the Roman Catholic, Anglican and other Christian Churches through which Christians believe they are specially blessed by God. The sacrament of baptism is the striking example of it. Indulgence is the remission of unishment in purgatory, still due for sins even after sacramental absolution. Thus absolution is a formal declaration, especially in a Christian Church, by a priest that a person’s sins have been forgiven. Forgiveness is a great virtue. To forgive is divine. A sinner is rectified through pardon. Only a lucky soul can follow that immortal light.",

The data used are mostly extracted from Indonesian proverb books, and ones found in proverbs of other languages. First, the data are classified based on plants or parts of plant possibly concurred. Later, the investigation is directed toward the various possibility the combination might represent. Through careful analysis, it is finally found that the plants or parts of the plants to be combined can be between different plants, parts of the same plants, one plant and its parts, parts and different plants, and parts of different plants. Plants or parts of plants to be combined are perceived as: to have the same quality for representing something hard or impossible to change, something must be committed by both parties, the same destiny to be experienced, or how should someone to behave; the different quality of plants or parts of the plant is used to represent unexpected thing (better or worse) to happen, not easy to give up and always depend on something available, could differentiate between good and bad matters, to use the worse quality things first before the better ones, imbalance competition, ability and sincerity to accept the good and bad aspect of things; one plant or parts of the plant are older (coming out earlier) or younger (coming out later) than the others to represent the difficulties for the older people to change, any occasion follows cause and effect law, the new comers usually should or could not drive out or defeat the natives; and phonological representation to show that sometimes the proverbs are created on the basis of aesthetic achievements instead of merely on metaphorical similarities.",

      "abstract": "SOME HUMAN behavioral disturbances may be given a biological and uniform type of interpretation; it requires a new usage of some old evolutionary and neurological ideas and the employment of some new biological observations and hypotheses. 1 First, behavior is seen as the direct outcome of the evolutionary struggle for existence, as being basically the expression of the factors which made survival of that struggle possible. Customarily, man's relation to the rest of the animal group is not regarded as a primary, dynamic force underlying his behavior. It is seen as something the human organism tries to get away from; the animal components of man must be repressed and escaped from for man to fit into society. Instincts, when regarded at all as inherited, evolutionary qualities, are considered more as nuisances than as essential parts of man and as the intrinsic foundation of his individual and social behavior.

But when children are strange in this way they are still at home within themselves, not alienated from their own lives. An adult in a wholly strange environment also may still be at home within himself; indeed, he may depend more on himself, the less a strange environment welcomes him. Alienation from oneself is something quite different, and estrangement is different again (which is what we will have to show in a roundabout way). It is easy to hear where some sounds come from. The word entfremden (“to alienate”) is an old one, originally used in business. Abalienare in Latin means to rid oneself of a thing, to sell something.",

      "title": "Dead Sorrow: A Story About Loss and a New Theory of Wrongful Death Damages",
      "abstract": "In this “scholarative,” combining personal narrative and traditional doctrinal scholarship, the author uses a story about personal loss to argue for a new type of wrongful death damages.When a tortiously caused death occurs, five losses/injuries result: (1) the decedent’s life itself; (2) the trauma and bereavement suffered by the decedent’s survivors, collectively referred to in this article as “grief;” (3) the pecuniary value of financial and service contributions that the decedent could have been expected to make to his or her dependents; (4) the loss of the decedent’s society and companionship, which in some states is considered a type of pecuniary loss under the fiction that society and companionship are a type of “lost service” with ascertainable monetary value (technically placing such damages in category 3) but which in other states is viewed as an intangible or noneconomic loss; and (5) the direct costs associated with the death, such as funeral expenses.The wrongful death system fails to account for the first two elements. Current law attaches no monetary value to life itself. The second item, grief, traditionally has been the invisible injury from wrongful death. This article proposes a legislative reconceptualization of wrongful death damages that addresses both of the deficiencies described above — for one price. Specifically, it argues that life has independent value apart from what we earn and give to others and that this value should be recognized in the form of “lost life” damages.Departing from the orthodox view that such damages should be allocated to the decedent’s estate or to the survivors, the article instead suggests that damages for the lost value of life be used for the exclusive purpose of establishing a lasting memorial to the decedent. Such a solution would promote both the economic deterrence and corrective justice models of tort law. Additionally, the memorial established with the lost life damages would, at no additional cost, provide a proven grief-healing instrument for all persons who mourn the decedent’s passing. Finally, because it is recommended that memorials created with lost life damages be required to serve a utilitarian function, another unique aspect of the proposal is that it would allocate tort damages in ways that benefit society in addition to tort victims, enhancing the net social benefit of the tort system.",

Furthermore, we may then well think, events occurring at earlier times, by causing them, determine those at later times; by causing, the earlier leave no alternative but for the later to occur. There are some other further suppositions, somewhat more radical, which are also quite natural, even if they do not occur quite so easily or frequently as those just previously expressed: As things are determined so that prior events are causing everything which happens, there is no chance for any person himself to cause anything. There is, then, no possibility for you yourself to make anything happen, prior events always and inevitably taking care of things completely. Accordingly, it is not within your power to act, or to do anything at all. You are totally, completely impotent.",

      "abstract": "Humans have a propensity to readily adopt others’ perspective, which often influences their behavior even when it seemingly should not. This altercentric influence has been widely studied in adults, yet we lack an understanding of its ontogenetic origins. The current studies investigated whether 14-month-olds’ search in a box for potential objects is modulated by another person’s belief about the box’s content. We varied the person’s potential belief such that in her presence/absence an object was removed, added, or exchanged for another, leading to her true/false belief about the object’s presence (Experiment 1, n=96); or transformed into another object, leading to her true/false belief about the object’s identity (i.e., the objects represented under a specific aspect, Experiment 2, n=32). Infants searched longer if the other person believed that an object remained in the box, showing an altercentric influence early in development. These results suggest that infants spontaneously represent others’ beliefs involving multiple objects, and raise the possibility that infants can appreciate that others encode the world under a unique aspect.",

As such, the discussion of coercion as it appears in political and social affairs may be conducted best in the context of the polarity between restraint and release that forms the background of human activities in their spatial aspect. At any moment of human existence neither restraint nor release is absent, though attention may be fixed more on one of the conditions than on the other. It is perhaps impossible even to conceive of a situation in which restraint played no part. A situation of complete release might be described fancifully as the condition of having all of one’s plans fulfilled in action immediately as they appeared. No conflicts between plans, precipitating the pain of deliberation, would be possible in this case; and there would certainly be no tragedies in which one had to sacrifice a cherished value so that 64he could attain another. The situation of complete release would nullify the problematic character of human existence, of which the polarity between release and restraint is merely an expression.",

Thus, the characteristic occupation of the threshold, in the form of doorways, by homeless people symbolises an inability to make choices, whether with respect to identity or location in space. By refusing to inhabit a material, internal space, homeless people demonstrate, in concrete terms, the lack of an internal world capable of holding their anxieties. Mother's physical presence is sought in the proximity of the baby's personal body-space, and her emotional ability to contain anxiety is sought as a taking-in of a good object into the developing internal space of thought and feeling.",

      "title": "Quality of life: the heart of the matter",
      "abstract": "Abstract It is believed widely, and with good reason, that some other members of the animal kingdom, like us, have feelings (associated with brain states induced by various sensory inputs and cognitive processes) which can be pleasant or unpleasant. Associated with the strengthening scientific foundations for this belief, there has been growing consensus around the world that we have a moral responsibility, in all of our dealings and interactions with sentient animals, to take account of their feelings. This has led to widespread re-evaluation, in recent years, of the nature of our interactions with other animals. However, assessment of the feelings of animals — the quality of their lives — remains a great challenge for veterinarians and others involved with their management. The fundamental difficulty is that whilst judgements about management or treatment often have to be made on the basis of our inferences of how they feel (ie of the feelings they consciously experience), a subjective step cannot be avoided in making these inferences. We cannot know how other animals feel but can only infer this based on our knowledge of the animal and on our own experiences of feelings. This inevitable ‘gap’ in objective deductions about feelings is often wide enough that people can reach radically different conclusions when judging an animal's quality of life. Opinions thus often differ regarding the point at which it becomes kinder to euthanase an animal than not to do so, the point at which it becomes kinder not to undertake a potentially painful therapeutic intervention than to do so, and where the balance lies when animal welfare costs are being ‘weighed’ against some benefit of their use for humans (eg as laboratory, farm or companion animals). The aim of this meeting is to discuss if and how science has helped in developing reasoned approaches to these dilemmas, and to consider the need for further research, education, and policy development.",

If this feeling later is weakened or diluted by a back-to-normal attitude, no bearing effects on vital consciousness or identity feeling can be observed, but a general feeling of pessimism and resignment remains. If, however, 'normalisation' did not set in until the first interview in this study, personal identity is found to be undergoing a change. A more conscious apprehension of life can be observed, a change in life style up to political commitment, or also leading to a determined turn to short-term, private compensating activities, (last-minute panic).

He asserts that the phenomena of mental illnesses, including suffering, signal “problems in living” or difficulties in determining the best use of one’s agential powers. The goals of the relationship are to enhance the client’s knowledge of his or her personality, to refine his intentions and sense of responsibility for his “symptoms” and other actions, and to achieve his aims and satisfy his desires, as long as he does not, by his actions, harm others. For the author of this chapter and other clinicians, the experience of phenomena exhibited by persons judged to be mentally ill are, to some extent and sense, apprehended as events that happen, rather than as actions authored by the person as agent. These untoward activities suggest a undesirable organismic condition of a person as agent, a diminution of the agent’s capacity for living a life, the signal of a organismic disorder, a problem with the human organismic equipment for living a life—not solely a problem about the best use of that equipment (as Szasz contends) but a state of ill health and a suffering person in need of treatment.",

      "abstract": "All investigative, expressive and creative endeavours—cate gorised as intellectual, artistic, scientific and so on—are ultimately attempts to search, seek or to rediscover one's relationship with the cosmos and find a place in the universe. These kinds of endeavours either arise out of some presumed—a priori— socially conditioned metaphysical assumptions or out of a recreation of new metaphysical truths, perhaps, directly perceived. At some point or points in one's life these attempts gain primacy, as in 'crisis' periods, when one needs to reaffirm a harmonious relationship between the self and the world in which one lives. (The falseness or truth of the duality of 'self and the world' need not be discussed at the moment.) The self in this case may be defined as the person (with a self-image) who projects and identifies himself with other persons and other non-human existence as also, especially, with various socio-cultural concepts such as family, society, nation and so on. Individual existence implies relationships, be it with nature or humans; whether this relationship exists in the person's mind or outside, he or she cannot do without it. The word 'person, synonym for self, is deliberately used because it means 'mask' (Latin derivative—persona). This particular use of the term 'person' is different from the category of 'being', or 'human being'. In fact, even the word 'individual' is derived from the root word 'whole' or 'complete'. In this sense, the same applies to the word 'alone'—all one (not to be confused with lonely), i.e. it is derived from the root of being One without a second—referring to a total, complete individual. In turn, whole-complete is the same as holistic, implying 'one-ness'. From this flows the idea of being holy, virtuous, and that is inseparable from the notions of beauty, goodness, love and creation. The experience of all these words may only be known within",

      "abstract": "Architecture is like a bowl that contains our lives. Therefore, it can be considered the right one only when we can live and do what we like in it without any inconvenience. As more importance has been placed on creating spaces such as roofs or ceiling, and floors, activities and comfort are being more ignored in architecture. Besides, when we assume that convenience and safety are also put into consideration for architecture, it could be only limited to normal and routine circumstances. For those reasons, it is considered that architecture cannot follow the rapid change of its surrounding environment. As our life is uncertain, accidents can occur anytime and anywhere. This is one of the most important factors why architecture should ensure safety at least for such unexpected accidents. Air is a very important element for all living beings to survive, and indoor spaces are the common environment for human beings. An important characteristic of indoor spaces is that they are related directly to the modern life style but it also has a variety of pollutants in it. Indoor air pollution due to various reasons has a negative impact on human health and people are not aware of it. Particularly on children and elder persons who have weaker physical strength and immunity, it has a more serious impact than the one on other people. Nowadays people spend more time indoors than before. Furthermore, the indoor spaces tend to be more enclosed for better privacy, protection and safety. Even when we move from one place to another, we experience being in enclosed spaces such as cars or subway. Especially the efforts of many industries to reduce energy consumption and increase energy efficiency make indoor space more enclosed. In addition, as construction materials composed by chemicals are more used, a variety of issues related to indoor environment air quality arise from materials that before have not been considered problematic. Representative examples are ‘new house syndrome’, ‘indoor air pollution’, and ‘building syndrome’. Indoor air of various spaces such as houses, schools, offices, public buildings, hospitals, underground facilities and transportation is polluted by multiple causes. The truth is that the polluted air has a negative impact on indoor residents in a long term but also it can seriously threaten their life in a short term. It is necessary to look into air quality of buildings which are our shelters and directly connected to our life. Developed countries like the ones in Europe have reinforced the regulations on the use of chemicals and have efficient measures against environmental damages by chemical accidents. Accordingly, Korea should also make efforts to implement preventive, protective and countermeasure systems against chemical mishaps and improve them to protect the national safety and health. Those kind of harmful chemicals keep increasing, and countermeasures should vary for each chemical material. Even the less toxic chemicals could cause a serious damage to environment if there is a high concentration exposure of them in a certain area. For this reason, safety and counteraction manual should be prepared for chemical material and distributed to related organizations so they can take proper actions when accidents take place. Work places that handle chemicals should be properly monitored and the supervisors should receive regular training so they can be aware of the importance of safety. It is not wise to call the doctor after dying. We need the wisdom to be fully prepared for disasters.",

We tend to focus less on what our bodies do for us, such as carry a child, perform labor, walk our dog, digest food, observe a beautiful sunset, read and comprehend the ideas in this workbook, engage in a deep conversation, enjoy a massage, hug the ones we love, feel and express empathy, heal us from illness, breathe in oxygen, keep our hearts beating, and more. In short, the functions of our bodies keep us alive – not just physically but also emotionally. Body functionality is everything the body can do or is capable of doing [1], and can be different for everyone based on physical abilities and limitations due to illnesses, injuries, development, aging, and surgeries.",

      "abstract": "The term aloneness may be understood in many different ways. In the simplest case, other people are physically absent. Despite this state of affairs, not everyone will experience a sense of aloneness, especially if other people are imagined or if the person has no desire to be with them at that moment. Similarly, a person may be surrounded by other people and still experience an uncomfortable sense of being alone, particularly if he or she feels excluded from participating with them in a meaningful way. Aloneness does not refer to an objective circumstance but to a psychological mode of being, and whether it is experienced as pleasurable or painful, problematic or liberating, always depends upon the meaning that each specific situation has for the person undergoing it.",

      "abstract": "Indicators with long social histories, such as the Consumer Price Index, often serve as nodes of calculative infrastructures. They create a field of social action, making some relations between people, institutions, and materials possible, and other relations less possible. By reflecting on two experiments in do-it-yourself sensor data, this article explores the tensions that occur when indicators have not yet become stable entities. When the conditions of possibility for the indicator's continued existence are less assured, the labor it takes to build numbers into something socially meaningful becomes surprisingly visible. This labor proceeds in stops and starts, as the various material and epistemological and social resistances reveal themselves. Sensors shape these starts and stops. Sensors give their users an indication of a possible whole entity whose contents they cannot fully imagine, and either must create or abandon. Far from producing certainty, sensor data often provokes a sense of vagueness that is worked on until it becomes either clarity or action, failure or indifference. Through this view of numbers in the making, we can see just how remarkable it is that indicators become part of calculative infrastructures at all.",

Though appearance is not a reference in a person. Sometimes appearance also shows the lifestyle and communication shown. Although the appearance will unwittingly become a reference for everyone to show their mood. From there appearance can be said as communication. Appearance is also the basis of one's personality that can be judged and seen by others. It turns out that the appearance is not only from clothes, but from the whole body starting from make up, body shape, and attractiveness. Nonverbal communication in this case arises from the characteristics of someone seen from his physical. Good appearance is given priority and is needed in business or employment. The reason is because appearance becomes the main thing in someone's opinion about the person that shows how to communicate each individual. A person's characteristics are certainly seen in non-verbal messages conveyed. One component that affects communication is returning to the appearance in communication. Good dress is very supportive of appearance and very harmonious appearance that will facilitate communication to each individual. Therefore, looking according to the cultural conditions faced in cross-cultural business negotiations and advocacy needs to be considered more deeply.",

      "title": "On R. Muth’s Impossible Dream: Trying to turn Subjective Probabilities into Objective Probabilities",
      "abstract": "R. Muth’s 1961 Econometrica paper is based on a fundamental and basic confusion on his part about the nature of subjective and objective probability that is impossible to remedy. A bifurcation occurred among scientists, mathematicians, and statisticians, starting in the mid 17th century with the work of Pascal, Fermat,and Cardano, about whether probability was subjective or objective. It could not be both. It had to be one or the other.Subjective probability always dealt with probability as being inside or internal to the human mind. It was a degree of belief of an individual based on his mental, personal, and psychological assessment of the data and factors he believed were involved in determining the behavior of the particular phenomena. On the other hand, Objective probability was always outside or external to the human mind. It was a part of the empirical, real world of phenomena that could be observed and was completely independently from any personal, emotional, mental, psychological or subjective factors. Objective probability was always a relative frequency in occurrence that would approach the true or correct answer in the limit as the number of observations of the particular phenomena approached infinity or some very large number that was an approximation of infinity. Historically, there are no adherents of the subjective approach to probability who accept the objective approach to probability and there are no adherents of the objective approach to probability who accept a subjective approach to probability. There is not, nor could there ever be, a subjective –objective hybrid theory because the definitions of subjective and objective probability directly contradict and conflict with each other.Muth had no historical knowledge of these two completely different definitions, forms, concepts and approaches to probability. Neither did the referees of his paper for Econometrica nor any proponent, advocate, supporter or user of what Muth claimed was the rational expectations hypothesis, which was that, for a given information set, the subjective estimates of probability (subjective probability distributions) were distributed around one single, objective, true, correct objective probability distribution. Muth apparently never realized that his definition was an oxymoron. It is impossible by definition. Nowhere in any of his references are there any that deal with the completely different theories of subjective and objective probability; there are no references to any sources in the history of science, history of probability, history of statistics, philosophy of science, philosophy of probability, or philosophy of statistics. There are no references to methodology or epistemology or to the philosophy of social science.Muth used the 1944 Von Neumann-Morgenstern approach to Expected Utility as the foundation for his theory of consumer and producer maximization of utility and profit in his 1961 article. However, it was made very clear by Von Neumann and Morgenstern that they were going to assume the use of objective frequencies only, because they were only going to deal with risk, where risk was defined to be based on known, objective probability. No subjective probability was allowed. Von Neumann had a completely different theory to deal with (complete) uncertainty when no probabilities were known, which he called min-max. Thus, the individual consumer-producer probability distributions would have to be objective, not subjective, in Muth’s paper in order to be consistent with the theory of risk analyzed by Von Neumann-Morgenstern in 1944. Out of nowhere, Muth starts talking about subjective probabilities (distributions) being distributed, for a given information set, around a true, correct, objective probability distribution. This is impossible and can never occur. There is absolutely no foundation at all in any theory of probability for Muth’s definition of rational expectations.The entire literature on the rational expectations hypothesis needs to be completely and totally reformulated and rewritten so as to be consistent with a foundation in either the subjective theory of probability or the objective theory of probability. Otherwise, rational expectationists need to state that they are not dealing with probability and statistics at all. They are simply assuming the very extreme position of complete knowledge from the Greenspan or Keynesian Continuum or spectrum that ranges from situations of complete ignorance to situations of complete knowledge. Currently, there simply is no foundation in any theory of probability for the rational expectations hypothesis, as defined by Muth in 1961 and accepted in the literature in economics since the Robert Lucas paper of 1972, which simply repeats all of the unsupportable claims made by Muth in his definition of rational expectations in 1961 that confused subjective and objective probability.",

Suffice it to say, consideration of such a broadly inclusive category would be well beyond the scope of this entry. But there is a far narrower subset of human action, to which the term has been applied and which will be the focus here. For our purposes, collective action will refer to emergent and at least minimally co‐ordinated action by two or more people that is motivated by a desire to change some aspect of social life or to resist changes proposed by others . By “emergent” I mean innovative lines of action that depart from taken‐for‐granted normative routines. “Co‐ordinated” simply means that the various parties to the emerging action are attuned to, and acting in awareness of, each other. Finally, the emphasis on change or resistance to change is intended to capture the adversarial or potentially contentious nature of “collective action.”",

      "abstract": "&lt;p&gt;In principle, the original spiritual movement is more a sociological symptom and leads to the religious. It happens not because of the great currents of foreign culture, but rather as a result of the daily routine of our lives that is rapidly changing from day to day. The very basic function of avoiding this negative attitude is perhaps to put forward the feeling and reasoning that in our own socio-politics and culture, it is not uncommon to give rise to the various social tensions that constitute the embryo of the emergence of spiritualism. And then who has the authority to judge about the phenomena of spiritualism, either the first or the second? Is there any religion in this phenomenon? The phenomenon of spirituality is essentially social in nature, but then why is spiritualism more individualistic, and ignorant of the problems of others? This is where the basic standard, which then used as a tool to measure the extent of the validity of the phenomenon of spiritualism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pada prinsipnya gerakan spiritualisme semula lebih merupakan gejala sosiologis dan bermuara ke arah agamis. Ia terjadi bukan karena arus besar kebudayaan asing, melainkan sebagai akibat dari corak rutinitas keseharian hidup kita yang cepat berubah dari hari ke hari. Fungsi yang sangat mendasar dari upaya menghindari sikap negatif ini adalah mungkin untuk lebih mengedepankan perasaan dan penalaran bahwa di dalam sosial-politik dan kebudayaan yang kita disain sendiri, tidak jarang telah melahirkan berbagai ketegangan-ketegangan sosial yang merupakan embrio munculnya spiritualisme. Dan selanjutnya siapa yang memiliki otoritas penilaian tentang gejala spiritualisme tersebut, baik model yang pertama ataupun yang kedua? Adakah andil agama dalam fenomena ini? Gejala spiritualitas itu pada hakekatnya pro sosial sifatnya, tetapi kemudian mengapa spiritualisme lebih cenderung individualistik, dan abai pada persoalan-persoalan orang lain? Disinilah standar mendasarnya , yang kemudian dijadikan alat untuk mengukur sejauh mana keabsahan fenomena spiritualisme tersebut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;",

      "abstract": "I argue that the construction of the social order, as shown by Adam Smith in The Theory of Moral Sentiments, depends on people’s ability to tame their inborn egoism. According to the philosopher’s anthropological assumptions a human being learns through life experiences how to control his selfinterest so that it does not threaten societal existence. During socialization, a human being – still an egoist to some extent – continues role-playing by the use of the psychological mechanisms of empathy and imagination. As a result he develops sympathy, at first, as a reaction to real people’s emotions experienced in a particular context. Finally, he naturally and more and more unconsciously takes under consideration the perspective of an impartial spectator. The gradually developing process brings about consequences that improve social morality, such as control over the expression of intense emotions, which is a condition for experiencing emotional harmony, or a refrain from pursuing one’s self-interest at the expense of someone else, so as not to become a subject of social contempt. One should also bear in mind that none of these consequences was carefully planned in advance nor purposefully executed.",

We constantly apply it in interactions between people, organizations, animals, and even artifacts. We use it instinctively and implicitly in closed and static systems, or consciously and explicitly in open or dynamic systems. An epitome for the former case is a small village, where everybody knows everybody, and the villagers instinctively use their knowledge or stereotypes to trust or distrust their neighbors. A big city exemplifies the latter case, where people use explicit rules of behavior in diverse trust relationships. We already use trust in computing systems extensively, although usually subconsciously. The challenge for exploiting trust in computing lies in extending the use of trust-based solutions, first to artificial entities such as software agents or subsystems, then to human users' subconscious choices.",

      "abstract": "Emotions are not merely physiological disturbances: they are experiences through which we apprehend truths about ourselves and the world. Emotions embody an understanding that is accessible to us only by means of affective experience. Only through emotions can we perceive meaning in life, and only by feeling emotions are we capable of recognizing the value or significance of anything whatsoever. Our affective responses and dispositions therefore play a critical role in our apprehension of meaningful truth—furthermore, their felt quality is intimately related to the awareness that they provide. Truthfulness is at issue in episodes of such emotions as anger, fear, and grief. Even apparently irrational emotions can show us what distinguishes emotion from other modes of cognitive activity: the turbulent feeling of being afraid <italic>is</italic> our way of recognizing a potential threat as such. What is disclosed to us when we experience fear can be either a misconstrual of something harmless as a danger or an axiologically salient fact about the world. Yet only a being able to perceive itself as threatened is susceptible to becoming afraid. So the later chapters of <italic>Knowing Emotions</italic> turn to the background conditions of affective experience: for instance, why it is only if we care about the life and well-being of a person that we are disposed to react with fear when that person is threatened? Our emotional dispositions of love, care, and concern serve as conditions of possibility for the discovery of significance or value, enabling us to perceive what is meaningful.",

      "title": "Punchinello or ‘on ambiguity’.",
      "abstract": "The relationship with emotionally symbolized “objects” underlying our relation with reality has connotations of ambiguity: a difficult daily mixture of emotions that lead us to experience the other as friend and  at the same time  as foe; as strong and  at the same time  weak;  as belonging within us, and  at the same time  as extraneous, outside us. We could go on and on.  Ambiguity, or rather what emotionally corresponds to what we call ambiguity, is the original mode in which the mind’s unconscious mode experiences the relationship. Friend and foe, outside and inside, powerful and weak, present and absent are, after all, descriptive categories that help us to talk, albeit in an approximate way, about emotional events that we are “forced” to communicate, even in this paper, through language. They are definitions, already organized and emotionally oriented, of what is experienced in the “logic of the emotions”, far removed from the logic that organizes language and gives it intention. The original ambiguity can induce anxiety; it justifies the propensity to “dissolve”, in one way or another, the ambiguous and therefore emotionally non-defined relationship with objects. Emotional acting out serves the purpose: when emotions are acted out, the object to which the acting out is addressed univocally becomes “friend” or “foe”, if the original ambivalence concerns this primitive symbolization pattern.  The dissolving of the ambiguity and the emotional acting out are temporally synchronic: there is no dissolution of ambiguity without emotional acting out; emotional acting out always entails a dissolution of ambiguity inherent to the symbolization of the object to which the acting out is addressed. If however the emotionally ambiguous symbolization is “thought”, then it is possible to elaborate an original ambiguity, and see its motivations, unravel its contradictions, construct a “dividing” idea which creates links between the various aspects of the originally ambiguous object. Accordingly, it can be said that the mind’s unconscious mode is manifested through emotional ambiguity, in the sense of an indefinite, contradictory emotional configuration of the objects one relates to. It is acting out, on the one hand, and on the other the thought that organizes and preludes to action, which lead to the emotional definition of objects and therefore to an organized relationship with them. It should also be remembered that original ambiguity is a resource for our knowledge of the object reality,  for a non-stereotyped adaptation that can relate to the ambiguous, and thus extraneous, object. Dissolving the ambiguity means transforming the object into an emotionally defined interlocutor, but at the cost of losing the possibility of exchanging with the extraneous. Dissolving the ambiguity means transforming the extraneous into an object that can be possessed, so there is a shift from exchange to possession. Tolerating the original ambiguity, associated with the objects of the relationship, is difficult. It entails the non-resolution of the object’s emotional indefiniteness, it therefore entails the capacity to establish relations with objects that have no definite configuration, from the emotional point of view, as “good” or “bad”, as “friend” or “foe”. The ritual components of cultures can be seen as ways of dissolving ambiguity in a reassuring style, channelled into common forms of relation, such as the ‘friend’ relationship. The difficulty of tolerating ambiguity is well-known in the psychoanalytically oriented psychotherapy relationship, where the analyst’s silence may be hard to accept for the patient who right from the outset of the relationship  wants  to place the psychotherapist in the friend-foe pattern. The eroticization of the relationship, for example, can be a way of emotionally dissolving the ambiguity of the object in psychotherapy.  In an interpretation using the categories under study, psychotherapy can be seen as the story of the different ways of dissolving ambiguity, acted out in the analytical relationship. But also the daily experience of each of us in relating socially can be read through the categorization of the various ways of dissolving ambiguity encountered in our usual relationships. The rules of the game in relationships, the social roles, the configurations of power in relationships, the categories of knowledge of the other, are all modes designed to dissolve emotional ambiguity in a reasonably stable way,  inevitable  in any experience of relating. If for instance, ambiguity is dissolved with a friend-foe type reading, then one can relate to the extraneous other, source of ambiguity, using modalities of attack-flight, of dependency or of coupling, to use the Bion’s basic assumptions model. If on the other hand one tolerates the original ambiguity of the other, one can go through an experience of exchange where the dissolution of ambiguity will gradually become the outcome elaborated in the exchange itself. Think for instance of the ambiguous relationship with food in a country extraneous to us, like India. There are people who dissolve the ambiguity towards unknown food with a simple, repetitive category: spicy means foe. Hence the search for food that is “not spicy” in the homeland of spices. Hence also the impossibility of knowing a complex and variegated culinary universe, with the sole objective of avoiding an aspect of estrangement  (the use of spices, the flavour of spices) symbolized as foe. These processes of drastic and pragmatically violent reduction of ambiguity, on the other hand, are present in the daily experience of social relations in all cultures; so much so, that it makes the acceptance of ambiguity, the tolerance of it in a relationship, seem  utopian . In this article I want to explore the figure of Punchinello drawn by Domenico Tiepolo, as the artistic expression of ambiguity which characterizes the mind’s unconscious mode of being.  I think Domenico Tiepolo’s Punchinello figures are in fact emotionally undefined “objects”, capable of representing the ambiguity, the emotional indefiniteness typical of the unconscious. I also think that many works of art can be seen as attempts to give emotional ambiguity a clear and explicit emotional dissolution; many others, instead, can represent the expression of ambiguity which has the effect in the viewer of suspending the participation in the emotional dichotomies of friend-foe, in-out, above-below, front-back, i.e. in the emotional dichotomies behind the most primitive dissolutions of ambiguity. Examples of the first function attributed to art can be found in works of religious divulgation, such as the frescoes on the walls of the cathedral of San Geminiano conceived to spread the knowledge of the new and old testaments to the faithful. But also the “didactic” and predicatory works of a certain type of contemporary art: just to take one example, garbage put up as an object to contemplate and meditate on.  Examples of the second function are found in artworks that do not provide an explicit or implicit emotional resolution, such as abstract art at its best, as in a Kandinskij and a Mondrian, in Malevich’s suprematism, but also in Arman’s  nouveau realisme  with his  assemblages  of broken violins, paintbrushes, clocks or tubes of paint. This is the Arman dear to Umberto Eco, who says that he “transforms the monody of the identical into the symphony of the heterogeneous”.",

      "title": "The Inevitable Pursuit of the Will and the Problem of Merit According to Thomas Aquinas",
      "abstract": "Man's will necessarily pursues what is in accordance with its nature, and accidentally pursues what does not. Since the will pursues whatever it does in accordance with the good or ultimate purpose, it inevitably pursues formal good in general or the ultimate purpose. And the will inevitably pursues existence, preservation of life, social cooperation, and the pursuit of truth according to man's nature. The methods for realizing these goals are chosen haphazardly. However, when the ends according to these natures are in conflict with each other, the will chooses and pursues one by chance. In particular, in the case of the ultimate goal, it includes not only the aspect of self-completion but also the method of realization, and the will has freedom of execution regarding which method of realization the ultimate goal includes. The will can pursue or reject an ultimate goal whose method of realization is worldly values such as pleasure or wealth, or an ultimate goal whose method of realization is goodness itself. In this way, the ultimate goal that the will knows with freedom of execution is inevitably pursued. Because the will has freedom of action in knowing this ultimate end, these activities can be the object of moral merit. Obtaining faith by God's grace and achieving beatific vision in heaven are also inevitably accepted by the will when God's help is provided. When the grace of faith is given, it cannot be refused, and the will cannot be given freedom of action when preparing to accept it. The human will cannot exercise any freedom of choice or action under these conditions. So, although ‘free will in a broad sense’ can be recognized in the will, it is difficult to give merit to such activities. In heaven, the beatified person does not reject the beatific vision but inevitably pursues it because he has a firm inclination toward goodness. However, in order for the beatified person to have a firm inclination toward goodness, a person must have faith and make efforts in accordance with the correct ultimate goal in this life. The virtue achieved through such efforts in this life is not only the grace of God, but also the freedom of practice as ‘free will in a narrow sense’. These activities can be a contribution to the beatific vision achieved in the afterlife. The degree of supernatural virtue and beatific intuition of the beatified person in heaven varies depending on the grace given initially and the merits formed afterwards.",

Firstly, psychosis is a reasonably common part of human experience, affecting something like 1 in 30 people in a typical population. Secondly, the major psychoses-schizophrenia and affective psychosis-consist of severe disruptions of cognition and emotion, which have a basis in the brain. Thirdly, the consequences of these disruptions are personally disastrous. They come on in the prime of life, and frequently lead to suicide, the loss of intimate relationships, and the loss of one’s capacity to provide for oneself. One can imagine no more severe impairment of social success than a major psychosis, short of actually dying. Fourthly, the liability to these disruptions is dependent on personality and, like other personality factors, it is substantially inherited in the genes.",

      "abstract": "The present study is a part of a long term (re)search focalized on a triad of concepts: {Knowledge Society, Consciousness Society, Learn to Live ‘Together’}. Each of the concepts of this triad has a specific autonomy and evolution – each of the concepts of this triad toward the other two concepts has mostly initial comprehended relations. But the extended-triadic relation or maybe relations is indebted or are indebted to a necessary to be revealed understanding mostly than to a current explanation. Into this future possible stance of realizing [or not] the hypothetically structural and functional essences of this triad of concepts could be acted by ‘complex cognitive objects’ and/or ‘creative-subjective inquiries’. These objects and inquiries maybe would contain and/or consist by limits, paradoxes and constrains. These objects and inquiries maybe would frame probabilistic, fuzzy or subtle statements. So, the foreseen - the foresight - and then the forecasting on the above introduced triad of concepts could be, again, necessary cognitive and praxis zones/directions of ‘revealed understanding mostly than current explanations’. All these could delimitate a long term (re)search.The present study as a PART of the above considered long term (re)search is focalized on the triad of concepts: {Knowledge Society, Consciousness Society, Learn to Live ‘Together’} - but is intended to ‘recursively’ and only ‘in PART’ to contribute by eliciting a ‘revealed understanding mostly than current explanations’. This intended contribution could stand ‘here and now’ by an enactment of aggregation of high science-technology contemporary topics (and other related topics) ‘towards, alongside and within’ a medium to a large scale two parts topic (‘recursively’ and ‘in PART’) re-entitled as:Does Collective versus Social (Societal) Intelligence Matter within Our (e-)World?LEARN TO LIVE ‘TOGETHER’ The paragraphs [A -:- H] and the three annexes are step by step tending to extend as much as possible the knowledge-borders related to the two parts of this just above re-entitlement of this present study: Does Collective versus Social (Societal) Intelligence Matter? It is an inquiring construct – focusing on the inner (internal state) objective of this study, as an intra-open stage of research and next praxis.LEARN TO LIVE ‘TOGETHER’ is a volitional construct. This study also stands as a pre-enactment to prove that this volitional construct is carried up by a collective AND social (societal) subject (actor, agent / multi-agent, ‘to do’ respondent). Let simple rename it as ‘Rational Subject’ within the context and the innovative matter of research and next praxis. And so, the ‘link’ between the two parts of this (initial) title of this study is here the ‘corner-stone’ and the implicitly emergent objective of research.Also, these [inquiring and respective volitional] constructs would elicit, will make possible to construct and consequently will make possible to act [by the Rational Subject] on the utility and upon the possibility of a NETWORK OF NETWORKS – a network of a ‘part’ of the worldwide existing networks, and of a ‘part’ of a medium term-next networks [considering the implicitly emergent objective of research as respondent of the respective actual and next ‘parts’ to be on role].",

The reasons for the evil eye can be diverse and they talk about the way in which certain qualities or attributions are perceived, the disenchantment describing sometimes a genuine ceremonial, meant to reestablish the initial order. The content of the disenchantment referrers to certain additional elements, certain plants with prophylactic valences, to specific attitudes. The particularities of these protective practices include either some references to the prophylactic, apothropaic elements – of keeping away the evil, of protection (not to catch it): garlic, basil or different practices meant to remove the evil eye. The typology of the disenchantment takes into consideration their destination, being either a remedy, either protection for the households. These former practices lead to a wide range of gestures orientated towards prophylaxis and remedies, an ensemble of attitudes that draw the attention of the researchers through the richness of their symbolism.\"",

In short the 11 rules of deontoutilitarianism are: 1) Human Beings have the duty of a) to preserve themselves and b) not attempt to destroy the lives of other human beings 2) Rule 1b does not apply if the human being starts an attack against other innocent beings 3) Rule 1a does not apply under extreme physical suffering 4) In exceptional circumstances, where there is conflict between 1a and 1b, it is possible to violate 1a or 1b. 5) Human beings should have plain reproductive freedom 6) Human beings should not discriminate against other human beings. 7) Human beings should never be cruel against other forms of life in the universe 8) Human beings should always protect life in the universe and never threaten other forms of life, except under certain conditions to be described 9) Human beings should not use other living beings as a food source, unless under certain conditions to be described 10) Research involving animals should always respect the 3R’s (Replace, Reduce, Refine) 11) Every human being has the right to know the truth about subjects affecting their personal lives, except when knowing the truth leads to a direct violation of rule 1. Next I apply these rules to examine the morality or immorality of behaviours such as suicide, euthanasia, animal welfare, stem cell research, selection of embryos, reproduction, population policies, immortality, enhancement, war and peace, lying and telling the truth.",

      "abstract": "Human beings are unique in their ability to think consciously about themselves. Because they have a capacity for self-awareness not shared by other animals, people can imagine themselves in the future, anticipate consequences, plan ahead, improve themselves, and perform many other behaviors that are uniquely characteristic of human beings. Yet, despite the obvious advantages of self-reflection, the capacity for self-thought comes at a high price as people's lives are adversely affected and their inner chatter interferes with their success, pollutes their relationships, and undermines their happiness. Indeed, self-relevant thought is responsible for most of the personal and social difficulties that human beings face as individuals and as a species. Among other things, the capacity for self-reflection distorts people's perceptions, leading them to make bad decisions based on faulty information. The self conjures up a great deal of personal suffering in the form of depression, anxiety, anger, envy, and other negative emotions by allowing people to ruminate about the past or imagine the future. Egocentrism and egotism blind people to their own shortcomings, promote self-serving biases, and undermine their relationships with others. The ability to self-reflect also underlies social conflict by leading people to separate themselves into ingroups and outgroups. Ironically, many sources of personal unhappiness — such as addictions, overeating, unsafe sex, infidelity, and domestic violence — are due to people's inability to exert self-control. For those inclined toward religion and spirituality, visionaries throughout history have proclaimed that the egoic self stymies the quest for spiritual fulfillment and leads to immoral behavior.",

I entertain death as a theoretical metaphor for ostracism and explore the degree to which they share key properties. Death is universal (we all die), caused (by some things and not others), totally non-functional (the dead cannot do or experience anything) and irreversible (death is permanent). Ostracism, in some of its forms, shares these key properties. If ostracism is social death then it follows that: (1) never being ostracised constitutes social invincibility, (2) pondering the reasons why one was ostracised constitutes a social autopsy, (3) receiving even trace amounts of acknowledgement, while being otherwise totally ostracised constitutes social necromancy and (4) being reincluded constitutes social resurrection. These four constructs are discussed along with new research questions and predictions that arise from them.",

      "title": "The Amygdala and Unconscious Fear Processing",
      "abstract": "Abstract In both animals and humans, immediate threats in the environment trigger a fixed pattern of physiological and behavioural responses known as ‘fear’. Since rapid and appropriate responses to external danger are advantageous for survival, neural mechanisms mediating fear responses will be subject to strong evolutionary selection pressure and show conservation across species (Darwin, 1872). The amygdala, an almond-shaped nucleus in the medial temporal lobe, appears to be a crucial component of this phylogenetically ancient ‘fear system’ (LeDoux, 1996). Electrical stimulation of the amygdala, whether in human, monkey, rat, or lizard, consistently evokes fear responses (Halgren et al., 1978; Greenberg et al., 1984; LeDoux, 1987). Destruction of the amygdala, on the other hand, typically produces placid, tame animals that no longer respond appropriately to threatening stimuli (Kluver and Bucy, 1939; Weiskrantz, 1956). The amygdala has also been shown to have a central role in ‘fear’ conditioning, i.e. the process by which a previously neutral object (conditioned stimulus or CS+) acquires fear responses (LeDoux et al., 1990; Davis 1992; Kapp et al., 1992).",

      "abstract": "From Plato and beyond, pleasure has been thought to be a basic, and sometimes the only basic, reason for doing anything. Since there are many forms that pleasure can take and many individual views of what pleasure consists in, much attention has been given to how pleasures may be distinguished, what their motivational and moral significance might be, and whether there may not be some objective determination of them, whether some may be good or bad, or some better as pleasures than others. But first there is the question of what pleasure is. It has been variously thought to be a state of mind like distress only of the opposite polarity; merely the absence or cessation of or freedom from pain; a kind of quiescence like contentment; or the experiencing of bodily sensations which, unlike sensations of pain, one does not want to stop. We also identify and class together particular sources of pleasure and call them pleasures of the table, company, sex, conversation, solitude, competition, contemplation or athletic pleasures. In this sense there may be some pleasures which we do not enjoy. But most generally pleasure is what we feel and take when we do enjoy something. This raises the questions of what is encompassed by ’something’, what it is to enjoy anything, and the extent to which theories of pleasure can accommodate both our passivity and activity in pleasure. The most influential theories have been those of Plato, Aristotle and empiricists such as Hume and Bentham.",

      "abstract": "Generally, when people speak of water as a resource, they are considering its good aspects and recognizing that it is essential for life and living. Sometimes or at some places or to some people, the same water may be annoying or unpleasant and thus a nuisance-for example, rain at a picnic, snow at any time except Christmas Eve, ground water in a basement, floodwater inundating personal property, and any water after it has been polluted by somebody else. For purposes of this circular, water as a resource will be defined more broadly and as a nuisance more narrowly. Water is part of the natural resource base including all aspects of the land, the air, and the water that must be considered in planning if an environment suitable for the well-being of all life is to be maintained. A nuisance, private or public, is a cause of annoyance, inconvenience, or injury that is an invasion or disturbance of the rights of some particular person or of members of a community, and it is punishable under the laws or customs accepted by the community. An activity harmful to mankind but widely practiced by the general public may be condoned by human laws and thus not be defined legally as a nuisance; the punishment for this activity is deterioration of the natural environment until it becomes unsuitable for living. The water resource, which is widely and irregularly distributed on earth, is available to man for such enjoyment and development and use as he sees fit, some use being essential to his existence. Natural variations in the quantity and quality of water are inevitable and, if they cause annoyance or injury to someone, are accepted as one of the hardships that this planet imposes upon its inhabitants; such variations are recognized as \"acts of God.\" However, if any man or society is partly responsible for these variations, which may cause such annoyance or injury, and may become a nuisance (an invasion or disturbance of the rights of others) such a man or society may perhaps be subject to injunctions and damage suits. Legal disputes over water as a nuisance are generally deeply involved with problems of the respective rights of plaintiff and defendant. These respective rights vary among the States.",

      "abstract": "I present a hypothesis concerning the neuronal, mental and behavioral effects of all kinds of affective (emotional) stimuli, i.e., of unpleasant and pleasant stimuli. I use the term stimulus in its broad sense. Affective stimuli evoke two associated percepts: cognitive and affective. A food in the mouth, for example, evokes the gustatory percept and the percept of pleasure. However, affective percepts are unstable parts of cognitive-affective compounds. Five types of affective percepts are pain, fear, pleasure, and appetite in the broad sense of these words. Desire is evoked by inadequate pleasant stimuli. Affective percepts are lower or higher. The latter are not directly associated with bodily needs. Esthetic and social percepts are higher, for example. Although pain and pleasure are essentially innate, they can be modified by sensory experience. Alimentary and esthetic preferences and social values are modifiable, for example. The neurons of pain and fear and of the unpleasant components of desire and appetite motivate four types of voluntary actions. These are, respectively, escape, avoidance, and approach actions. All these actions eliminate the motivating displeasure. In addition, avoidance actions protect from the signaled pain, optimization actions increase the existing pleasure and approach actions provide the signaled pleasure. Thus, voluntary actions associated with different percepts occur according to one universal principle. Voluntary actions are and behavioral. During internal actions a goal and then an action plan are decided. These actions often provide the images of the goal stimuli and of particular movements.",

Physicalism figures prominently in contemporary discussions of the mind-body problem, either as a doctrine to be defended, or rejected, or as the lesser or greater partner in a comparison with some or other alternative view. Colour experiences are subjective experiences, and subjective experiences pose a formidable problem for physicalism. Indeed, of all mental phenomena, they may pose the most formidable problem for that doctrine. Although the ontological status of metal is relevant to physicalism, it is arguably irrelevant to the mind-body problem.

In the Qur'an there is a change in the form of the word ummah, which shows ummatan wahidah, which shows a unity that is not divided because of differences in ethnicity, race and culture. Ummatan wasathan is a moderate ummah, khoiru ummah is a superior ummah, baldatun thayyibatun is a prosperous country, ummatan muqtashidah which describes an ummah that is not extravagant. The research method is a library research. There are four characteristics of library research, namely: 1) research deals directly with text (manuscripts) or numerical data and not with direct knowledge from the field or eye witnesses in the form of events, people or other objects, 2) library data is ready to use (ready mode), 3) library data are generally secondary sources and 4) library data is not limited by space and time because it is already \"dead\" data stored in written records. So in this study using library research. The personal application of Muslims as an ummah is to shape the personality of Muslim individuals so that they become human beings who are submissive and obedient to Allah, prioritizing His interests over other interests in the sense that they do not wish to become human beings who are negligent in remembering Allah SWT. So when a child lives in a religious family, of course, after joining the community, he is not easily influenced by the western lifestyle, because the values of Islamic teachings are instilled, which are guided by the Al-Qur'an and the Sunnah of Rasulullah SAW. Therefore, the Prophet recommended that in choosing a mate, Islam teaches to be selective because it will give birth to generations who are expected to become caliphs on earth, as servants who are submissive and obedient to the commands of Allah SWT.",

However, from a functional perspective, one might expect that an emotion that evolved to protect social bonds from interlopers might exist in other social species, particularly one as cognitively sophisticated as the dog. The current experiment adapted a paradigm from human infant studies to examine jealousy in domestic dogs. We found that dogs exhibited significantly more jealous behaviors (e.g., snapping, getting between the owner and object, pushing/touching the object/owner) when their owners displayed affectionate behaviors towards what appeared to be another dog as compared to nonsocial objects. These results lend support to the hypothesis that jealousy has some \"primordial\" form that exists in human infants and in at least one other social species besides humans.",

      "abstract": "WHAT, HOW AND WHY?In a world in which, as shown by today's networks of social and working relations, communication dominates and even determines the way in which we manage our personal lives, we find ourselves continually bombarded with more or less reliable messages that update us on the macroscopic and microscopic reality that surrounds us.In this context, news that claims to be \"absolutely true\" is often supported by data, or rather figures.This pattern is more evident when communication purports to become information: we are faced with mountains of figures, which certainly make the news more credible but unfortunately less understandable.In the field of scientific information, this method is a guarantee of quality since no phenomenon (whether presented as personal experience, reproduction or translation of the experiences of others, or evidence of the validity of these experiences) is considered worthy of attention unless it is somehow quantifiable.But what does it mean to measure a phenomenon?It doesn't take much for an experience (or experiment, if we want to remain close to the world of science) to be measurable: an object to be measured, a person to do the measuring, and an instrument through which to perform the measurement.It sounds easy put like that!In actual fact, this simple (or simplified) concept of \"measuring\" is riddled with pitfalls, especially when the action takes place in a field of investigation as variable, unstable and subjective as medicine.And naturally this includes orthopaedics.Let us consider, for example, the relationship between the subject doing the measuring and the object being measured.The interaction between these two elements becomes highly variable if they are both human beings subject to a vulnerability (and thus an instability) that is determined, for example, by expectations (personal and reciprocal), frustrations or discomforts that may be related to or independent of the phenomenon that is bringing them together in that specific circumstance.And what about the instrument used to do the measuring?We need to be certain that it really is able to measure, in the same way time after time, the phenomenon that we are investigating.Finally, we have to ask whether we can be sure that what we are seeking to measure really is measurable, or rather quantifiable.I could write reams about this, but fortunately there is already plenty of literature on this topic and excellent scholars, far more expert than me, who have made it their lives' work to try and clarify, predict and teach us how to limit the mistakes that can be made when measuring a phenomenon in medical research.Instead, I wish to draw the attention of our readers to three of the articles published in this issue of Joints, which are excellent examples of how to deal with the problem of measures in orthopaedics.The first, by Arrigoni et al., is a diagnostic study in which the biceps resisted flexion test (a new test for diagnosing long head of the biceps pathology) is described and analyzed for validity using the arthroscopic diagnosis as the gold standard.The second, by Blonna et al., analyses the validity and reliability of the SPORTS Score for shoulder instability in a cohort of athletes, using other validated outcome measures as reference standards.The third, by Boniforti et al., introduces an interesting and innovative measure of short-term outcome after total knee arthroplasty; using the EQ-5D-3L, a self-administered questionnaire, the authors analyzed patients' perceptions of their state of health during the first months following surgery.Works of this kind often provide interesting reading not just for their contribution to scientific literature, but also because they can provide an experimental model of reference that can be reproduced in future studies having similar objectives.I therefore advise the readers of Joints to approach the world of measures with interest and confidence, because it is one of challenge and never-ending discovery.",

Out of one system other completely new, never-before imagined systems can arise.

      "abstract": "Human beings have two basic kinds of emotional relations to nature: gratitude and a sense of peace, on the one hand, terror and stimulation on the other. Few who are concerned about conservation and the environment will suppose that the answers have to be exclusively human answers in the further sense that the policies they recommend should exclusively favour human beings. A sense that human beings should not see the world as simply theirs to control, is often thought to have a religious origin, and a 'secular' or 'humanist' attitude is thought to be in this, as in other respects, anthropocentric. The badness of environmental effects would then be measured in terms of the effect on human experience basically, our dislike or distaste for what is happening. Not all our environmental concerns will be grounded in Promethean fear.",

All lack a thing’s full identity over time: either they are instantaneous, or they have temporal parts, like a speech’s words, which stop them being wholly present at an instant; whereas things, which lack temporal parts, are wholly present throughout their lives. Events may be identified with two types of entity: facts, like the fact that David Hume dies, corresponding to truths like ‘Hume dies’; or particulars which, like things, correspond to names, for example ‘Hume’s death’. Which one they are taken to be affects the content of many metaphysical theories: such as that all particulars are things; that times, or causes and effects, or actions, are events; or that mental events are physical.",

      "title": "Death",
      "abstract": "This article concerns contemporary philosophical discussions of death. The philosophy of death attempts to determine what it is for people and other living things to die and to be mortal, how and the extent to which death, mortality, and posthumous events benefit or harm those who die, and the morality of killing. The issues that arise might loosely be classified as metaphysical, prudential, and moral. The metaphysical issues concern what death is, how it and mortality are related, and, by extension, what it is to be alive, what you and I are, and what the persistence conditions of living creatures are. (The former issues are covered under Nature of Death and Mortality, while the latter are covered under Life and Persistence over Time.) The prudential issues concern how and the extent to which death, mortality, posthumous events, and coming to be affect the welfare of those who die (covered under Mortal Harm and Posthumous Harm), and the time when those effects are incurred (covered under the Timing Issue). Finally, the moral issues concern how the prudential significance of death and posthumous events bear on the moral permissibility of killing. When killing is wrong, it is wrong primarily (even if not exclusively) because of the way death affects its victims. Its objectionableness may be due to the fact that it harms its victims or, in the case of some victims, such as moral agents, because killing them (without their informed consent) is inconsistent with the respect they are due. Philosophers of death attempt to work out whether and how the harmfulness of dying and consent to being killed bear on the wrongness of killing. (These moral issues are covered under Killing.)",

Furthermore, triggers are events, and events involve an object acquiring a property. This leads to a regress problem for pandispositionalism, the view that all properties are dispositions. Some dispositions need a stimulus in order to manifest, and some do not. Dispositions that manifest spontaneously and those that are constantly manifesting do not have triggers. However, some dispositions have a latent or dormant state, and only manifest in certain circumstances.",

Judgments of authenticity are inherently subjective. One kind of authenticity relates to whether the market offering has a factual and physical link with something important to the consumer. For example, an article of clothing may be deemed authentic because a celebrity actually wore it. Another perceived factual connection that influences perceptions of authenticity is between personality and behavior. For example, a product may be deemed authentic because it reflects the true personality of a company's founder. Products that are unique and/or consistent over time are also more likely to be viewed as reflecting the company's true personality. A second kind of authenticity relates to whether the market offering physically resembles something valuable to the consumer. Here, the connection is not physical but is perceptual. This meaning of authenticity is frequently used when describing replica art objects and facsimiles of brands and products.",

The material so separated and discharged is a secretion. Many of the secretions have special uses, which do not involve their discharge from the body. Others have no office to perform, but are separated from the blood to be discharged from the body; such may be termed excretions. Most secretions in a healthy body consist of certain well-known combinations, but when these combinations vary, or when new materials enter into their construction, the secretion may be considered abnormal.

      "abstract": "What is autonomy, given that it is undermined or nullified by a variety of circumstances—coercion, brainwashing, some forms of manipulation, oppressive socialization, posthypnotic suggestion, and the like? I argue that the usual answer, self-government, fails once we recognize that selves can govern in spite of defects that prevent the realization of an agent's deepest personal ideals and values. Definitions of autonomy in terms of self-realization are also rejected. A close examination of the inhibitory effects of oppressive socialization reveals the centrality of the idea of liberation to autonomy or, more specifically, authenticity. The liberation is to engage with features of the world relevant to the agent's desires, values, and commitments. It is a transfer of control from alien forces from without or within to the world. An agent's authenticity is guaranteed once causal pathways, linking the agent's goals with relevant features of the world, are operating in the service of an informed and competent agent. It is argued that sudden radical conversions and (hypothetical) total value reorientations, induced neurologically, do not inhibit the autonomy of a self, but rather involve the creation of new selves.",

In the social domain, they also categorize relationships, deceive competitors, and know what others see or intend to do.

      "abstract": "In response to a stimulus, a sensation is tridimensional: qualitative, quantitative, and affective. The affective part of sensation, pleasure or displeasure, depends on the qualities of the stimulus. Within a narrow range of intensity, chemical, thermal, and mechanical stimuli are able to arouse pleasure. In addition, pleasure depends on the internal state of the subject. This is easily observed in the case of temperature: pleasure is is aroused by a warm stimulus in a hypothermic subject and by a cold stimulus in a hyperthermic subject and by a cold stimulus in a hyperthermic subject. This property of given stimulus in a hypothermic subject and by a cold stimulus in a hyperthermic subject. This property of a given stimulus to arouse pleasure or displeasure according to the internal state of the subject is termed alliesthesia. Alliesthesia is also produced by chemical and mechanical stimuli. Acquired preferences or aversions for alimentary stimuli represent a case of alliesthesia. In the same way, the capacity of any indifferent stimulus to become rewarding, or punishing, by association with some reward or punishment, is also a case of alliesthesia. In all cases, pleasure is a sign of a stimulus useful to the subject; displeasure a sign of danger. Usefulness and danger are judged by the central nervous system with reference to homeostasis and the set point of the implied regulation. Pleasure and displeasure thus appear to motivate useful behaviors.",

      "title": "Experiencing a shame response as a precursor to violence.",
      "abstract": "The shame response is a primitive physiological response to a rejection of oneself by another. The discomfort of this response may vary from intense physical pain to one that is barely noticeable, if at all. When this pain is sufficient, it causes anger that may be directed outward against another or inward against oneself. The intensity of the shame response, hence the intensity of the pain and anger, is related to the significance of the other, the significance of witnesses to the rejection, one's vulnerability, whether or not the rejection is of oneself or an aspect of oneself, and if the rejection comes as a surprise. When most intense (i.e., most painful), the shame response may include a tightness of the throat, nausea, stomach pain, and a sense that the contents of one's chest and abdomen are collapsing, exploding, or imploding. In reviewing what preceded an act of violence, it is necessary to determine whether the assailant had experienced a shame response and how intense it was. Understanding that a shame response can lead to anger and violence allows for the prevention of violence. This requires that individuals do not experience rejections that are so painful as to lead to violence.",

      "abstract": "Psychological resilience refers to the individual’s tendency to remain steadfast and composed in time of adversity and pressure in addition to his ability to be actively compatible and to cope positively with traumatic states and pressures.\r\nConsequently, this is conducive to fastness in recovery and overstepping traumatic states. It also leads to the previous normal functional state, and therefore to considering the traumatic or pressing state an opportunity to empower and fortify one’s self against traumatic states and pressures in the future. \r\nThe “Meaning of Life,” as an idiom, is considered one of the concepts that has attracted the interest of researchers in the field of mental health. For the human being, the meaning of life relates to its value, his self-contentment and his self-appreciation in the sense that his life revolves around and within the role that he finds himself best in acting.\r\nFrankl(1974) asserts that the meaning of life, love and identity follows the traumatic experiences that the individual encounters through his life. Bad situations are considered an opportunity for the individual to grow. To achieve this, one must have faith in the future, and without faith, there is no meaning for life or reason for living. The flow state represents the crucial factor in constituting the meaning and goal of life, and making sense and value out of it. Hence, this state pushes those who cope up with it to be creative; nay, to the highest degrees of human creativeness. \r\nThis paper attempts to link the previous variables with the resilience of the Syrian Arab Army by approaching methodologically the elements of this research paper. This methodological approach depends on analyzing the literature of the subject matter by collecting and coordinating the theoretical writings and research studies in this domain, then analyzing them in order to illustrate their underlying implications, and therefore easing the task to know the secret of psychological resilience, flow, and meaning of life within the context of positive psychology. In order to excavate for this secret, one must look for the nature of these variable and its limitations, and applying them on the resilience of the Syrian Arab Army. Thus, the current paper relies on a description and explanation emanating from building a base of concepts, and the methodology here is closer to qualitative research. \r\nيهدف البحث الحالي إلى دراسة العلاقة بين عدة مفاهيم أساسية, تعكس مكامن القوة والضعف في الشخصية الإنسانية ومالها من دور مؤثر على الواقع النفسي والمادي للفرد, وهي الصمود النفسي ومعنى الحياة والتدفق من وجهة نظر علم النفس الإيجابي.\r\nويشير مفهوم الصمود النفسي إلى فكرة ميل الفرد إلى الثبات والحفاظ على هدوئه عند التعرض لضغوط أو مواقف عصيبة, فضلا عن قدرته على التوافق الفعال والمواجهة الإيجابية لهذه الضغوط وتلك المواقف الصادمة, وبالتالي سرعة التعافي والتجاوز السريع للموقف الصادم, والعودة إلى الحالة الوظيفية العادية, واعتبار الموقف الصادم أو الضاغط فرصة لتقوية الذات وتحصينها ضد الضغوط والمواقف الصادمة مستقبلا.\r\nوتحاول الورقة الحالية ربط المتغيرات السابقة بصمود الجيش العربي السوري, من خلال التناول المنهجي لعناصر الورقة البحثية الحالية, الذي اعتمد على تحليل أدبيات المجال, من خلال تجميع وتنسيق الكتابات النظرية والدراسات البحثية في المجال, وتحليلها, بهدف توضيح مضامينها بما يسهم في الكشف عن ماهية الصمود النفسي والتدفق ومعنى الحياة في سياق علم النفس الإيجابي من خلال الكشف عن طبيعة هذه المتغيرات ومحدداتها وتطبيق ذلك على صمود الجيش العربي السوري, وتستند الورقة الحالية على الوصف والتفسير المنطلق من بناء قاعدة مفاهيم, وهي منهجية أقرب إلى البحث الكيفي.\r\nوخلصت البحث الحالية إلى أهمية العلاقة بين هذه المتغيرات, وتم تحديد أهم ثمرات الصمود النفسي ومقوماته, وأهم خصائص الأشخاص ذوي الصمود النفسي",

It can be better defined as an unmotivated and quasi-ineffable constellation of feelings that convey a nebula of vague sensations and impulses, an uncomfortable feeling characterized by being sorrowful and indignant. The intentional structure that characterizes much of human emotional experience is absent in dysphoria. Emotions are fluxes of intentionality that innervate the flesh and connect it to the world. Dysphoria is an emotional state saturated with a brimming constellation of feelings without any explicit object or target, a state of tension that may lead to spontaneously vigorous outbursts as well as to pale stagnation or emotional depletion. Dysphoria is empty intentionality devoid of the moderating power of language and representation which fragments the person's representations of herself and of others and inducing painful experiences of incoherence and inner emptiness, threatening feeling of uncertainty and inauthenticity in interpersonal relationships, and excruciating sense of insignificance, futility and inanity of life. Dysphoric persons experience their own self as dim and fuzzy, and feel deprived of a defined identity and unable to be steadily involved in a given life project or social role. But it also entails a sense of vitality, although am aimless and explosive one – a desperate vitality. Dysphoria is felt as a disordered, overwhelming flux which is at the same time a disorganizing and compelling source of vitality. Dysphoria is felt as creative and destructive – a vigour that brings life as well as annihilation: a violent spasm that takes control of the body and a power that expresses vitality in touch with the source of all sensations.",

It contributes to the identification and recognition of food or food products, to their appreciation (pleasant/unpleasant), to the associated pleasure/displeasure and desire to eat, and therefore to the evaluation of their qualities (freshness, healthy character, caloric level, etc.). The sense of smell is also involved in overall perception – in particular, by aromas developed in the mouth that activate olfactory receptors through the retro-nasal pathway – and in other functions such as sensory-specific satiety. However, one of the most enigmatic properties of the sense of smell is undoubtedly the variation of its sensitivity according to our state of hunger or satiety. Obviously, smell is not the only sensory modality involved in food intake. In a state of satiety, sensitivity to bitterness was better than in a state of hunger.",

Sometimes the inducing stimulus or inducer may be very specific. A discrimination forms between two categories of stimuli, whether red-key views versus green-key views, food versus no food, or human versus non-human. Within a category, stimuli induce similar activity and may be called equivalent, or the activity may be said to generalize across stimuli. A discrimination consists of generalization within categories and differentiation across categories. Understanding that discrimination occurs between categories helps to understand complex discriminations such as relational discriminations.

Others are evaluative, like health is better than sickness, happiness better than misery, appreciation better than humiliation, peace better than war, and so on. Such assumptions are about the fundamental conditions of our lives and presupposed by how we respond to the world. Some of them may be mistaken, but if many of them were mistaken, human life would be endangered. We can then test our beliefs, emotions, desires, and evaluations by asking whether they conform to basic assumptions. Part of human wisdom is to know which of the many assumptions we make are basic, which are not, and how to avoid confusing strongly held assumptions, especially evaluative ones, with basic ones.",

The goal of the extension was to locate stimulus and subject parameters which might influence the relative strength of these two processes: self-persuasion from behavior or judgments based upon changing stimulus attributes. High tolerance subjects are expected to show the self-persuasion effect; they are relatively unafraid and insensitive to shock. Their escape behavior is likely to be salient to them. Self-persuasion from one's instrumental escape behavior occurs only for high-shock-tolerance subjects. Low-tolerance subjects show an opposite pattern—after choosing to escape a shock they rate it as less uncomfortable than a shock which is escaped without choice. The low tolerance subjects are relatively fearful and sensitive to the pain of shock. Thus, when the shock is escaped by choice one expects them to feel less discomfort than when the shock is terminated by chance.",

      "title": "Structural Violence",
      "abstract": "As we have now seen, any act of violence is a result of many factors in the perpetrator's life. The most obvious of them are immediate and concrete situational triggers such as a perceived insult or attack. The trigger here is proximal, closely linked in time and space to when and where the act of violence occurs. Such factors are usually not difficult to discern and their relationship to the act of violence is clear and specific, so they are relatively easy to identify, isolate, and address. But many other factors, just as important, are far removed in time and space from the moment when the violent act takes place. Time-wise, they may lie far back on a lifelong pathway of shaped behaviour, acquired beliefs and restricted choices. We have seen in the last chapter how developmental experiences set up some people for a future of potential violence. Attitudes, assumptions, emotional impulsivity, and violent tendencies all come from a person's history based on where they grew up and who, if anybody, cared for them. Space-wise, these factors form the micro- and macro-environment the person inhabits at the moment of violence and act as less obvious influences channelling, as Brecht says, the flow of behaviour. Poverty, gender, education, and inequality are not easily perceptible amid the firecrackers of the immediate violent encounter, but they are present nevertheless and play a crucial part in making violence almost inevitable in some circumstances and for some people.",

As the soma can be considered to be the \"service compartment\" of the germ cells, it loses its function once a species' phase of reproduction is over. Hence, there is an intimate relationship between reproduction and aging, and therefore also between a species' reproductive strategy and aging: there has been no selection for maintenance of the soma beyond the reproductive phase of life (when there is no reproduction, there is also no natural selection). As a consequence, mechanisms, important for maintenance of the soma during the reproductive phase, increasingly begin to fail once this phase is over, resulting in an accumulation of all kinds of pathology and genetic errors, rendering an individual increasingly more prone to a variety of (internal and external) attacks. In the end, the soma collapses, be it due to organ failure, a neoplasm or to a final external push, e.g., an infection.",

      "title": "Social Psychology and the Law",
      "abstract": "Virtually every aspect of legal rules and procedures relies on assumptions about human psychology — about how individuals think, feel, and make decisions. Economics focuses on how people behave and interact as economic agents; psychology also focuses on human behavior and interaction, with specific attention to the influence of social and mental processes. Sometimes the law implicitly or explicitly incorporates findings from psychological science. For example, the law of negligence accounts for some of the limitations of human judgment in hindsight (Rachlinski, 1998). Because the hindsight bias is part of folk wisdom, legal rules have responded accordingly, such as in patent law where non- obviousness is determined by reference to secondary considerations like commercial success to “guard against slipping into the use of hindsight” (Rachlinski, 1998). But sometimes folk wisdom misunderstands human behavior and decision- making processes. Thus, for example, most people deem it unthinkable that an innocent person would confess to a crime she did not commit, in the absence of physical torture. And when folk wisdom misses the mark, it is more likely that judges, legislators, and other legal actors will fail to account for what psychological science might tell us about the human behavior in question. As one pioneer of the field of law and psychology observed over a century ago, “[Jurists] go on thinking that their legal instinct and their common sense supplies them with all that is needed” (Münsterberg, 1908). This chapter examines some of the implicit psychological assumptions about human behavior embedded in legal rules and practices. We narrow our focus specifically to social psychology, which we define as the scientific study of the ways in which individuals’ thoughts, feelings, and behaviors are influenced by the real, implied, or imagined presence of others (Allport, 1924).",

      "title": "VI. POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE RELEVANCE",
      "abstract": "T F at some time a person's conduct can make -* the whole difference between probability = 0 and probability = 1 for the obtaining of some state of affairs S, then his conduct is relevant to (the obtaining of) S; or, as I shall sometimes say for short, he is relevant to S. One can also be rele? vant to S through affecting its probability less drastically than that. Everything I say here can take in that territory as well, but it is helpful to think mainly in terms of all-or-nothing relevance. A state of affairs may obtain (1) because some? body did such and such, or (2) because he did not do so and so. For example, the gate at the railway crossing was open (1) because he opened it, or (2) because he didn't close it. (2) doesn't apply unless he could have closed it: the Emperor of Japan didn't open the gate and couldn't have closed it, and so his conduct was not relevant at all to its being open. But I don't confine (2) to people who ought to have prevented S, or who had some duty or obligation to prevent it, or anything like that. I take someone's conduct to be negatively relevant to the gate's being open just so long as he could have closed it and didn't. That makes each of us negatively relevant to millions of states of affairs. But why not? I have been told: is not useful to make the notion of as weak as that. We should at least build into it that the person knew he could prevent S from obtaining. But if we do, we'll make some important truths harder to say, and thus harder to see. If I didn't know that I could have closed the gate, that may excuse me; and if I didn't know I was opening it, that may excuse me. It won't be easy to compare those two excuses if we work with a concept of ac? cording to which a person is not negatively rele? vant to S unless he does know what his conduct is leading to. It may be objected that the ignorance excuse falls very unevenly across the positive/neg? ative divide, being available a million times on the side for every one on the positive. But that doesn't mean that comparisons are not worth making; and in any case, you can't even state that objection without using negative relevance in my way. If we refuse to call someone's conduct negatively relevant to S unless he knew that he could make the difference to whether S obtained or not, we shall be definitionally abolishing the ex? cuse He was negatively relevant, but he didn't know, stamping into the ground an interesting and perhaps important difference between the two sorts of relevance. Similarly for the suggestion that we shouldn't call someone negatively relevant to S's obtaining unless it was his job to prevent it. We ought to be able to compare how the plea was not his spe? cial responsibility works on the side of the line with how it works on the positive side; but for that we need a concept of which allows the plea to arise on that side of the line.",

These determine its welfare level, whether over a brief interval of time or over a lifetime, which, in turn, determines whether something is overall good or bad for it. An event or state of affairs E is overall good (bad) for us just if, and to the extent that, the intrinsic value for us of the actual world, in which E occurs, is higher (lower) than that of the closest world in which E does not occur. If the intrinsic value for me of a world w equals my lifetime welfare level in w, then coming into existence, and coming to be responsive, was neither good nor bad for me.

Thus, denial of one’s role (e.g., motivated forgetting), minimization of harm or intentionality (e.g., automatism, dissociation), and offering “good” (e.g., a moral mandate) or “good enough” (e.g., revenge) justifications for one’s behavior can all be used to deflect the label. Alternatively, people may try to neutralize the label by pointing to their moral credentials prior to the incident in question (moral licensing), insisting that they are no worse than those who judge them (a form of normalization), or declaring that they are immune to others’ judgments (asserting interpersonal power).",

The main humorous characteristics of this concept are identified and analyzed. An axiological approach is used for constructing a humorous conceptual framework, because humor is one of the most important tools for forming values and anti-values of a certain culture. The ridiculed characteristics of gluttony are divided into the following two groups: those of process and result. The main characteristics of the process include improper eating of edible items and eating of inedible items. Improper eating of edible items is usually ridiculed through eating excessive amounts of food, eating food under inappropriate conditions, eating incompatible items. Eating of inedible items is mostly ridiculed through eating life-threatening objects, eating something unfit to eat, and eating excrements or other human waste products. The main ridiculed characteristics of the result include gaining excess weight, addiction to a certain food, illness/death of a person. This work also performs a detailed analysis of the anti-value concept of gluttony for the first time. The main linguistic means of representing the anti-value concept of gluttony in stand-up comedies and sitcoms are revealed. This article makes a significant contribution to constructing an axiological humorous framework of the concept, because gluttony is one of the basic anti-values in humorous discourse.",

In other words, since we have no means of going beyond the restricted window that our senses provide of reality, the latter is too complicated and substantially inaccessible to complete knowledge. All that we can do is to limit ourselves to constructing a representation of reality based on information gained from experience. In this vision, therefore, our knowledge is always relative to a perspective and is conditioned by a point of view, a product of the human mind, and not something inherent to the order of things. Science, therefore, does not study the physical world per se, but rather our way of depicting some regularities selected from our experience, that can be observed in certain conditions and from a particular perspective.",

Tastes are treated broadly and include attitudes and preferences, and the notion of an object is also broad, including anything that is evaluated qua object, meaning that even events or agents’ actions can be viewed as objects. Although issues pertaining to aesthetic judgment are raised, they are not the focus of Attraction emotions. The Attraction emotion identified depends on whether an object is evaluated as being appealing or unappealing and whether it is viewed as itself being capable of emotion. Crossing these dimensions leads to four emotion types: “Affection” and “Enmity” emotions, which pertain to emotion-capable (generally animate) objects, and “Appreciation” and “Distaste” emotions, which pertain to emotion-incapable (generally inanimate) objects.",

      "abstract": "Both not seeing what is perfectly visible and seeing something other than what is there are surprisingly common occurrences in our normal perceptual lives. One is a case of phenomenal invisibility, while the other is case of misperception. When we do not see what is there or see something other than what is there, it is frequently the result of the same visual processes that are responsible for our seeing what is there. These phenomena are discussed and the parallel between one of them, inattentional blindness, our failure to see what is there when we are not paying attention to it, is likened to our failure to see those we consider \"other\" revealing how our prejudices influence what we see and what we don’t.",

      "title": "Shocks in coupled socio-ecological systems: what are they and how can we model them?",
      "abstract": "Coupled socio-ecological systems (SES) are complex systems characterized by self-organization, non-linearities, interactions among heterogeneous elements within each subsystem, and feedbacks across scales and among subsystems. When such a system experiences a shock or a crisis, the consequences are difficult to predict. In this paper we first define what a shock or a crisis means for SES. Depending on where the system boundary is drawn, shocks can be seen as exogenous or endogenous. For example, human intervention in environmental systems could be seen as exogenous, but endogenous in a socio-environmental system. This difference in the origin and nature of shocks has certain consequences for coupled SES and for policies to ameliorate negative consequences of shocks. Having defined shocks, the paper then focuses on modelling challenges when studying shocks in coupled SES. If we are to explore, study and predict the responses of coupled SES to shocks, the models used need to be able to accommodate (exogenous) or produce (endogenous) a shock event. Various modelling choices need to be made. Specifically, the ‘sudden’ aspect of a shock suggests the time period over which an event claimed to be a shock occurred might be ‘quick’. What does that mean for a discrete event model? Turning to magnitude, what degree of change (in a variable or set of variables) is required for the event to be considered a shock? The ‘surprising’ nature of a shock means that none of the agents in the model should expect the shock to happen, but may need rules enabling them to generate behaviour in exceptional circumstances. This requires a certain design of the agents’ decision-making algorithms, their perception of a shock, memory of past events and formation of expectations, and the information available to them during the time the shock occurred.",

      "abstract": "Human trafficking still remains one of the most important problems of the modern world. It poses a threat to human life and health, it is also a crime that violates their rights. Human trafficking is seen as a modern manifestation of slavery, the exploitation of other people’s labor and the treatment of people as property over which one has fully unlimited power and the ability to decide its fate. In human trafficking, manifested is what is the worst in man, but also what is the weakest. On the one hand, we are dealing with a man who, in his humanity, treats another human being as an object, as a thing that can be bought, sold or borrowed. On the other hand, we are dealing with a man who, in his extreme weakness, whether social – caused by external circumstances or psychological – resulting from, for example, fear, is reduced to the role of an object and as such is completely enslaved, deprived of initiative and stripped of dignity. It can be said that in this situation we are dealing with the quintessence of evil in interpersonal relationships. The article presents problems related to the issue of trafficking in human beings, in particular the recognition of potential victims of this practice. Looking on the victims of trafficking in human beings trough the criminological prism gives a wide field for the analysis of the presented problem.",

We evaluate how well a person fares over an extended period when we speak of him as having a good day, a good year, or a good life, or when we speak of such a period as going well for him. We evaluate how a person fares at a particular moment when we say that he is doing well just then. We favor different idioms in these two kinds of evaluation: we are more inclined to speak of a person as having a good life than as having a good moment; and, conversely, we are more inclined to use the terms ‘welfare’ or ‘well-being’ to express how well things are going for him at a particular moment than to evaluate how well his life goes as a whole.",

      "title": "76. Killing of animals in science – is it always inevitable?",
      "abstract": "Within the ethical discussion of animal experimentation, the questions of why, how many, and under what circumstances animals are (or should be) used takes precedence over the fact that virtually all lab animals are killed after their scientific utility. When death is indeed an issue, the discussion often concerns the circumstances of death, from a welfare point-of view. This is a likely consequence of two factors: firstly, killing being seen as an inevitable consequence of animal use and, second, a predominantly 'welfarist-utilitarian' influence in the ethical and legal framework on the acceptability of animal research. While the former leads to the killing of laboratory animals being implicitly accepted along with the acceptance of animal research itself, the latter makes death a lesser issue (provided it is carried out humanely), as 'being dead' is not in itself seen as a welfare problem, and the early euthanasia of animal models of disease can moreover prevent avoidable suffering (i.e. by humane end-points). In this landscape, animal experimentation without the burden of killing animals seems unfeasible, if not undesirable. However, while acknowledging that most studies do require killing animals out of scientific (e.g. from the need to extract large-enough samples from small animals) or ethical (when animals would otherwise suffer needlessly) necessity, it remains to be ascertained whether: (1) this is true for all cases; or (2) that curtailing the life of laboratory animals is of little ethical importance. Accepting that – at least some – animal research is relevant, ethically acceptable and presently not replaceable, it should nevertheless be reflected upon whether there can be a scientific, ethical and legal framework within which a 'no-kill' approach may be equated, for some cases. A few examples are herein presented to discuss current possibilities and constraints, and help identify under which circumstances can a new set of '3Rs' – Re-use, Rehabilitation and Rehoming – be applied as an alternative to the killing of animals when their scientific usefulness ends.",

The food carries the body forward into its already implied next events. For example, the complexity of the body's implying makes a food-object with the environment's cooperation. The body's implying is always more than what occurs. The body's implicit organization is much more complex and capable of many more possible further events, than those that have ever occurred.

It may be an individual or a group, an obvious misfit or a concealed one, a temporary phenomenon or a permanent lifestyle (adopted willingly or unwillingly). The scapegoat makes it possible for man to live at peace with God, himself or his society by acting as symbolic recipient of qualities which man is unwilling to recognise in himself. The scapegoater by his treatment tries to reduce the scapegoat into something not human; for this reason a scapegoat which shows only small divergences from the norm evokes particular hostility. The individual scapegoat in a small group may accept his role fairly happily, but group scapegoats find few compensations. A variety of defence mechanisms will be adopted in these circumstances, but generally mature adjustment is impossible. The scientific and artistic achievements of scapegoats in the past have helped to liberalise society and extend the range of our compassion. So perhaps a society without scapegoats would lose its capacity for moral growth.",

      "title": "Prosociality, social cognition and empathy in psittacids and corvids",
      "abstract": "In the animal kingdom some species form complex social groups in which elaborated relationships between individuals occur. Prosocial behaviors, i.e. actions that benefit others, preferentially occur between closely affiliated individuals and may be driven by empathy, the ability to identify and share the emotional states of others. Birds, particularly corvids and parrots, are excellent candidates for investigating the link between social relationship and other-regarding behavior. They are long-lived and form long-term monogamous pair-bonds in which a high level of cooperation is seen throughout the year. The aim of this thesis is to study how the nature of a relationship (sibling, mate or friend) can modulate prosocial behavior and its underlying emotions in parrots and a corvid species. The approach was to study food-sharing or behavioral reactions to stressful situations such as distress call playback or exposure to novel objects, in different social contexts. Cockatiels (Nymphicus hollandicus) reacted more to the distress calls of a closely affiliated partner than to those of a non-partner, and they preferably shared food with affiliated, related individuals. Different species of parrots preferentially chose a prosocial option over a selfish one, but it remains unclear whether they took the other’s perspective into account. Confronted with intimidating novel objects, jackdaws (Coloeus monedula) spent more time in mutual proximity when paired with their mate than when with a familiar opposite-sex non-partner. However, they were not bolder when accompanied by their mate compared to a non-partner. These results suggest that an emotional link exists between affiliated individuals and that this special bond drives their prosocial and empathic behavioral responses.",

The characteristic traits of these links are a degradation of one of the members of the link’s narcissistic integrity, together with a weakening of self-esteem, as a result of constant humiliations. The pervert’s victim suffers from fainting fits, allergic reactions, gastro-intestinal or vascular disorders, joints pain, somatizations or psychosomatic disorders with an anatomical starting point. The pervert can, in turn, develop physical disorders when he loses his superior stand and can’t express his distress, rant or hallucinate.The bond between the subjects of the link is weak or non -existent. There is a lack of mutual acknowledgement: the victim is not considered as a person by the pervert, he has no empathy towards the victim. The victim may even react with pleasure to belittlements thus encouraging him. The physical fits seem linked to the powerlessness to get rid of theses chains. The forces which look after self-protection are weakened. PFT and PCT cases will throw a light on these ideas.",

Sound must be heard correct ly and then perceived correctly in order to listen, comprehend, and follow through with what was learned or asked. Not everyone has the same response to the sounds around them. Positive responses are noted as: feeling relaxed, being motivated, feeling energized, or being more focused. Negative responses can be demonstrated as: irritability, anxiety, avoidance of noisy situations, or difficulty listening in background noise. For the developing child, negative impacting sound can be demonstrated by: sensory overload, covering the ears, social withdrawal, temper tantrums, tuning out the world, or showing fear to sounds. Most people know that we process sound through the cochlea of the ear. However, we also process sound through our bone structure, sense of touch and body’s cell structure. Sound impacts the entire body. Our bodies first perceive sound stimulation and then respond to it. Some people respond more eff icient ly through the other modalities (bone, touch, or cell structure). This slower response creates poor listening, vestibular, and attention skills. People have to hear sounds correctly in order to process what is being received. This does not mean that the deaf do not perceive sound.

      "abstract": "We think of the world around us not as a mere assemblage of unrelated objects, events, and facts, but as constituting a system, something that shows structure, and whose constituents are connected with one another in significant ways. This view of the world seems fundamental to our scheme of things; it is reflected in the commonplace assumption that things that happen in one place can make a difference to things that happen in another in a way that enables us to make sense of one thing in terms of another, infer information about one thing from information about another, or affect one thing by affecting another. Central to this idea of interconnectedness of things is a notion of dependence (or, its converse, determination): things are connected with one another in that whether something exists, or what properties it has, is dependent on, or determined by, what other things exist and what kinds of things they are. It is in virtue of these dependency or determinative relationships that the world can be made intelligible; and by exploiting them we are able to intervene in the course of events and alter it to suit our wishes. Activities like explanation, prediction, and control would make little sense for a world devoid of such connections. The idea that real connections exist and the idea that the world is intelligible and controllable are arguably an equivalent idea. Causation is a preeminent example of what I am calling determinative or dependency relations; apart from those that are logically based, such as entailment, it is the only explicitly recognized and widely discussed relation of this kind. Causes determine their effects, and effects are dependent, for their existence and properties, on their causes. It is not for nothing that",

      "abstract": "This chapter is an attempt to bring Sartre into dialogue with Anglo-American philosophers of mind on the topic of pain.1One complication should be noted straight away. There is a rough tripartite distinction to be made between acute, long-lasting, and chronic pain, and the Anglo-American focus is almost exclusively on the first, whereas Sartre's focus is largely on the second.2 (Neither has anything to say about chronic pain as I shall be defining this.) By \"acute\" pain, I mean pain which is intense, sudden in onset, and of short duration (usually because easily treatable, or whose source does not require treatment). \"Long-lasting\" pain, by definition, lasts for days, weeks, or months; it may or may not have been intense and sudden in onset; it typically ebbs and flows over its course; and it has a \"biomedical\" explanation: a physiologically identifiable source (e.g., an ulcer, a broken bone) which is, however, difficult or time-consuming to treat. \"Chronic\" pain is identical to long-lasting pain in respect of the first three points; but, crucially, it is pain that lacks biomedical explanation, since the pain persists in the absence of, or after the removal of, identifiable disease or tissue damage.3 The distinction between them isn't rigide.g., what begins as an acute pain (due to a laceration on the foot, say) may develop into a long-lasting pain if the wound becomes infected; longlasting and chronic pain are typically characterized by episodes of acute pain; chronic pain may become long-lasting pain through a new biomedical diagnosis, and so on-but I will treat them separately, since they raise interestingly different issues.",

      "title": "The enigmatic phenomenon of loneliness",
      "abstract": "Much has been said and written on loneliness, which is a common human phenomenon that belongs to everyday existence, but few attempts have been made to capture the phenomenon and its existential meaning without reducing its complexity. This paper addresses the question: What is loneliness, what is its essence? The study practiced a phenomenological approach, called Reflective Lifeworld Research. Twenty-six interviews were analysed for meaning with the aim of describing an essential structure for the phenomenon, showing what loneliness is. The analysis shows that the phenomenon of loneliness stands out in meaning as “figure” against a “background” of fellowship, connectedness and context. One is lonely when important others are not there, because either one has rejected them or they have chosen to be rejected and left the person behind, feeling lonely. One can reject others in favour of another kind of connectedness. Such loneliness is restful and pleasant. It involves the lack of tangible context that other present people can offer, yet a context is not missing—in this instance there is a relationship to and one is part of something else such as nature or animal fellowship. Involuntary loneliness on the other hand involves a lack of context and connectedness. To be involuntarily lonely and not belonging to anyone is to lack participation in the world. To not be. Loneliness as a phenomenon is further characterized as transcending the present situation containing loneliness. One can feel lonely even if there are many people around, or one can be completely alone without feeling lonely. Loneliness can disappear with a sense of belonging, when one connects with someone who is miles away.",

      "title": "Explosive Contagion in Networks",
      "abstract": "Abstract The spread of social phenomena such as behaviors, ideas or products is an ubiquitous but remarkably complex phenomenon. A successful avenue to study the spread of social phenomena relies on epidemic models by establishing analogies between the transmission of social phenomena and infectious diseases. Such models typically assume simple social interactions restricted to pairs of individuals; effects of the context are often neglected. Here we show that local synergistic effects associated with acquaintances of pairs of individuals can have striking consequences on the spread of social phenomena at large scales. The most interesting predictions are found for a scenario in which the contagion ability of a spreader decreases with the number of ignorant individuals surrounding the target ignorant. This mechanism mimics ubiquitous situations in which the willingness of individuals to adopt a new product depends not only on the intrinsic value of the product but also on whether his acquaintances will adopt this product or not. In these situations, we show that the typically smooth (second order) transitions towards large social contagion become explosive (first order). The proposed synergistic mechanisms therefore explain why ideas, rumours or products can suddenly and sometimes unexpectedly catch on.",

Just as both seed and soil are necessary for plant growth (you won’ t get much plant unless you have both of these), so when we look at depression we need to look at both the seeds – the stresses or triggering events – and the nature of the child at the time these events occur.

It may be traced to the old phylogenetic submissive posture in animals, which is a pattern of behavior belonging to the group of survival instincts. Different forms of proskyneses and servility may emerge as an expression of psychotic behavior in man, reflecting a special stage of \"archetypical\" (C.G. Jung) consciousness. Archetypical conciousness is understood as a special step in the emergence of the human mind, thought and self-consciousness. The freedom of thinking--as the highest function of the human mind--is lost in every psychotic disorder. Archetypical consciousness with its lower stages of thinking may be typical for one kind of psychotic thinking disorder. Diagnostic problems may arise, if one does not recognize the drive of instinctive behaviour which lies behind the mere forms of human costums and religious rites.",

      "abstract": "Memory is a complex brain function to store and retrieve information. In humans, memories of life experiences collectively contribute to represent who we are. It is a function that helps us interact with our environment; similar situations evoke specific responses, known faces evoke reactions, and repeated stimuli help us how to learn and respond. Long-term memories divide into two different groups, procedural and declarative. Procedural memory involves certain activities we learn by practicing and repeated exposure to a series of motor outputs (for example, riding a bicycle or driving a car). Declarative memories, able to be consciously recalled, are comprised of two other groups: semantic memories representing discrete facts such as dates, word definitions, and learned concepts, and episodic memories that represent explicit experiences one has lived through, such as a special birthday or one’s wedding day. The literature sometimes refers to these two groups of long-term memories implicit or explicit, respectively, though these terms aren’t utilized as much because they are more ambiguous. Long-term memory is consolidated from short-term to long-term memories, primarily in the hippocampus and stored throughout the cortex. These interconnected structures help one interpret stimuli to act accordingly, either by retrieving old memories to help us navigate or by storing them so we can start learning more.",

At the theoretical level, most social scientists would agree that the subject-matter of all the specialized social disciplines is the same, namely human behaviour: in practice most specialists deal with some aspect or department or area of human behaviour, or human behaviour viewed from some “viewpoint.” This separation, however, into areas or aspects, convenient as it may be, or at least as it is asserted to be, for research purposes, is a somewhat arbitrary proceeding and it has resulted, among other things, in a breakdown of communication between the different social science compartments. Another result has been a less, not a greater, understanding of man. There is a strong case to be made, as Robert Lynd, for example, has made it, for the view that the social scientist is the worst example extant of the person who knows more and more about less and less. This is particularly sad when it is noted that less and less in such a context is the human animal, who is clearly a complicated and many faceted piece of work on any viewpoint or from any aspect.",

In contrast, an omission lacks a physical reality; it does not display any (causal) energy; it is, in this sense, simply non-existent.

Processes can be physical (such as atomic decay), biological (such as the growth of living things), artificial (such as building a house) and social (such as carrying out a criminal investigation). Much of what is said about processes can be said about sequences of events. The concept of event, however, suggests a separate occurrence, whereas that of a process suggests something which is ongoing. There are matters, such as development in organisms, where to see what is happening as part of a process has an advantage over thinking of it as an event. Causes are generally spoken of as events, but the more dynamic concept of causal processes may get nearer to expressing the transition between cause and effect. Moreover, to explain something as a stage in a process can take account not only of what has happened in the past, but of what might happen in the future. This may (but need not) involve purpose; with organisms it involves development through functionally interrelated activities. In some social processes there can be a practical, moral significance in seeing a situation as a stage in a process, since this can encourage us to look to a further stage where something constructive might be brought out of what could otherwise be seen as simply an untoward event or an unhappy situation.",

      "title": "On the effectiveness of Buddhist view of life and death in regulating mortality salience",
      "abstract": "Death is an inevitable fate for human beings. Awareness of death diminish personal sense of security, increase fear (1), and trigger death anxiety (2). Death anxiety profoundly impacts mental health and is a potential cause of mental disorders, significantly contributing to their persistence and recurrence (3). Thus, alleviating death anxiety is crucial for enhancing quality of life.Terror Management Theory (TMT), built upon Becker's ideas (4) and refined by Greenberg, addresses the emotions of fear and anxiety induced by death (5). According to it, death possesses two inherent characteristics: inevitability and unpredictability (6). The inevitability of death makes individuals aware of their \"certain end\", generating endless fear and anxiety (7). Its unpredictability fosters a sense of crisis and urgency, as individuals realize that death is beyond their control. So all human behaviors are, in a sense, efforts to resolve existential contradiction between life and death (8).The pursuit of survival and the escape from the inevitability of death are lifelong issues.Mortality Salience (MS), a core concept of TMT, directly addresses death anxiety. When individuals become aware of their mortality, death anxiety latent in daily life triggers MS which increases motivation to accept cultural anxiety buffer (9). Becker emphasizes that recognition of cultural value significantly impacts death anxiety (10). In the absence of cultural identification, individuals often feel more anxious. The enhancement of cultural worldview has a significant effect on alleviating anxiety (11), with self-esteem maintenance and intimate relationships also considered to be important factors influencing MS (12).Cultural worldviews shape individuals' perceptions of death and alter conditions under which MS operates (13), affecting the degree of death anxiety. For example, natural sciences view death as a natural process, Christians sees it as a gateway to another world, and Buddhists holds a perspective of reincarnation (14). As Christians and Buddhists do not view death as the end of the world for individuals, those believed in them experience significantly less death anxiety than those in the first culture (15,16). Moreover, strong religious faith or belief in an afterlife can reduce death anxiety (17,18). Cultural beliefs give meaning and purpose, helping individuals face death anxiety effectively as cultural anxiety buffers (19).Buddhism, a traditional culture of South Asia, will be explored in this paper to illustrate how its view on life and death could function as an anxiety buffer, and help individuals overcome death anxiety to maintain mental health.Buddhism teaches that all living beings are a continuity of life and death. If one believes that death marks the absolute end, this is a kind of \"nihilism\" that Buddhism opposes.According to Buddhism, when life ends, it will leave imprints, i.e., retributive consequence produced by Karma. The previous life is the cause, and the present life is the effect; the present life is the cause, and the future life is the effect. The chain of life and death is endless, with neither beginning nor end. \"Life and death coexist, like the two ends of a scale, rising and falling equally.\" (20) This teaching significantly reduces the crisis and urgency brought by uncertainty, enhances the sense of control, and mitigates death anxiety (7).When individuals face reminders of death, they feel the inevitability and unpredictability of death and seek a sense of existence, value, and meaning (6). The Buddhist view on continuity of life and death points out that the accumulated Karma of past lives shapes the present, and present actions shape the future (21). In other words, the inevitability of death does not render present life meaningless. Individuals should calmly accept death and strive for happiness in future lives.The concept of continuity provides a path for individuals to understand and cope with the trauma of death, imbuing current life with a sense of continued value and meaning, allowing a more composed approach to the heavy topic about death.In fact, almost all cultures consider death a taboo (22,23).The explanations of simultaneity and continuity of life and death allow individuals to routinely talk about this heavy topic, providing an entry for discussing life and death. According to psychoanalysis, talking about death inherently alleviates death anxiety repressed in the unconscious (24). Furthermore, Yen's research on attitudes toward death indicates that Asians can alleviate death anxiety through beliefs in fatalism and Karma (25). The continuity of life and death is an expression of fatalism: both life and death are inevitable (26). This view reduces the pressure on individuals in their current lives.Death is not the end forever but a new beginning. Wishes unfulfilled in this life can be pursued in the next.No life, no death. All living beings are emotional creatures, referred to in Buddhism as sentient beings, experience suffering, including death anxiety. While explaining the origins of death anxiety, the four noble truths also provide a method to manage it, proposing that through the practice of the path, individuals can reach a state free from death anxiety. This state entails not identifying the body, mind, or any unity as the self, thus eliminating attachment and craving, and attaining true freedom. William et al. has pointed out that death anxiety can be alleviated by overcoming their attachment to the body, which is one part of the self-attachment (33).With life comes death, but no life, no death. This idea offers a systematic explanation of the process of death anxiety, helping individuals confront this obscure theme. So individuals can better understand and cope with death anxiety.However, the truth of suffering implies the idea of escaping from real life, and Zen can be an effective supplement. Zen advocates an outlook on real life and does not require such forms as sitting in meditation, reading scriptures, or worshipping the Buddha; one can become a Buddha in daily life. Zen emphasizes a \"joy of life\" rather than a \"suffering of life\", which is very suitable for modern people (34).There is no life or death, only the Alaya-vijnana.Individuals often perceive life as linear, with a defined beginning and an inevitable end marked by death (35). This linear view of time leads individuals to see time as a finite and valuable resource that can be quantified, monitored, and managed (36). However, Yogacara Buddhism offers a different perspective. It denies the reality of life and death, suggesting that both the self and the external world are mere illusions projected by the Alaya-vijnana. \"Revolving into sentient beings, and revolving into dharmas.\" (37) \"You should observe the nature of the dharma realm, and everything is created only by the mind.\" (38)This teaching emphasizes the mind as the foundation of reality. More specifically, Yogacara Buddhism divides the mind into eight levels: seeing-vijnana, hearing-vijnana, smelling-vijnana, tasting-vijnana, kinetic-vijnana, vijnana, Manas-vijnana, and Alaya-vijnana. The first five vijnanas are within the scope of human perception, with distinctions depending on specific sensory organs. Vijnana, also known as the sixth consciousness, is the mental faculty. (21) Manas-vijnana, the seventh consciousness, continuously operates, mistakenly perceiving the perception of the Alayavijnana as a constant self, thus firmly believing in an eternal self. Consequently, it harbors four types of attachment: selfdelusion, self-belief, self-arrogance, and self-love. The activities of it are so subtle that man cannot perceive it.The root of death anxiety lies in Manas-vijnana. (21) Alaya-vijnana, the eighth consciousness, functions as a repository, storing all seeds of dharma (all phenomena). More specifically, it stores seeds (word representation) produced by the activities of the six vijnanas. Additionally, Alaya-vijnana can project the external world and sentient beings. In other words, all phenomena are manifestations or projections of seeds in Alaya-vijnana (21). Therefore, it is not a soul that traverses around the six realms, but rather the six realms are manifested in Alaya- Although Buddhism is primarily considered a religion, it must exert its power not through the path of religion, but through the path of philosophical thinking and philosophical life practice. In fact, many philosophers have proposed ideas to overcome death anxiety. For example, Plato held that the soul is immortal and only the body dies (43). The Epicureans claimed that at the time of death, since the senses have been lost, people cannot feel death, so there is no need to fear death (44). The Stoics proposed that unexpected things would bring a heavy burden to people, but if it is known that death is something that everyone will experience, then there is no need to fear death (45). Hadot insisted that death is not to be feared from the perspective of universality and objectivity (46). In Nussbaum's view, what needs to be overcome is not death anxiety, but the desire for immortality (47). But the Buddhism are different from them. It points out that death is not a real event but just an illusion; if people cling to the concept of self and being, then this illusion will torture them, otherwise they will be able to obtain true liberation.",

      "abstract": "Research findings in the field of clothing design underline that a garment must ensure a high level of comfort as it interacts with the shape of the human body, regardless of whether the person is in a static or dynamic state. For economic, medical and psychological reasons, it is essential that a garment fits well and adapts to the wearer’s body shape in terms of 3D geometry, volume and structure (there are areas where the garment is very close to the body and areas where it is away from the body). Several factors need to be taken into account when producing various soft goods, including garments: factors related to the client (age, posture, proportions and conformation, type and frequency of movements, medical problems, physical disabilities, etc.) and the product (destination, condition of use, characteristics of materials and accessories, etc.). This paper presents the influence of the biomechanics of the human body on the 3D shape of a garment. The geometry and the size of the garment patterns must be determined taking into account the details of the model (silhouette, destination, structure, types of materials, etc.) and, above all, the movement of the human body expressed in terms of the absolute values of the changes in its dimensions or dynamic effects.",

      "abstract": "abstract Variation in the passage of time is perceived against the backdrop of standard temporal units. Under certain conditions, we perceive time to be passing slowly. In other settings, our subjective temporal experience is roughly synchronized with the objective time of clocks or calendars. And given different circumstances, we perceive time to have passed quickly. Drawing from 740 narratives that depict distortion in the perceived passage of time, I formulate a theory that accounts for the full range of variation in temporal experience. This theory can be represented by an S-shaped figure. According to this theory, variation in the perceived passage of time reflects variation in the density of experience per standard temporal unit. In turn, the density of experience per standard temporal unit is conditioned by the dynamics of social interaction. In its original form, however, this theory assumes that one’s circumstances shape one’s temporal experience in deterministic fashion. Consequently, based upon interviews with 406 disparate people, I conceptualize time work (or temporal agency) as one’s efforts to control, manipulate, or customize one’s own temporal experience or that of others. I conclude with some directions for future research.",

They may also be bleak and even unfair or outright scary. But don’t expect everyone to notice the bad environments: recent studies demonstrate that patients with psychosis are far more likely to notice even subtle negative features in the environment than people without symptoms.

There are numerous Aayaat and Ahadith that attests to this.The Quran reads:“Allah does not charge a soul except its capacity”(Baqarah:286).Thus the Prophet Muhammad (sal allah alihi wsalam) said:“Surely the Deen (of Islam) is easy”(Bukhaari).If a person is unable to carry out what the Sharee‘ah (Islamic Law) expects of him/her, due to illness, injury,traveling, ignorance, or even old age, then the law grants a concession. There are certain principles based on Qur’aan and Sunan.  That promotes the easiness and leniency of Islam and its Sharee’ah. One such principle is as follows: “Difficulty warrants ease’’The above principle means that if difficulty exists then the law grants easiness in the form of a concession. An example of this principle is, if a person is on travel the Sharee‘ah allows that person to shorten his/her prayers or if the same person is fasting, he/she is allowed to break fast. The allowance is given mainly because the law recognizes the hardships/difficulties in travel and therefore wants to facilitate ease in worship. Concessions (rukhsah) in Islam are allowed to lighten ‘ibaadaat (acts of worship), mu‘aamalaat (transactional relationships), and other matters.Zarurah (necessity) and Hajah (need) is also the Maqasid al-Shariah protection tools in Islamic law.

In Marks (1984), Closet Corner (1987), and Hood Ornament (1992), I argue, the categories of the object and the subject vacillate in their distinctness, in such a way that the resulting work of art overtakes or undermines the integrity, or ontological safety, of the body that performs it. In Shoot Me (1992), however, becoming an object raises political questions about the uneven distribution of the right to full subjectivity and the threat or disaster of being turned into an object (for example, a corpse) against one's will. Arnold's performances therefore revel in the difficulties of approaching (or ‘pornotroping’) human subjects as mute or inactive things, and the vital, consequential liveliness of objects in performance.",

      "title": "FALSE RECOGNITION OF UNFAMILIAR PEOPLE: \"SEEING FILM STARS EVERYWHERE\"",
      "abstract": "Abstract A patient (MR) is reported who is able to correctly recognise famous people as being familiar but has a strong tendency to falsely recognise unfamiliar people as being familiar. False recognition does not depend on the type of person involved (contemporary, historical, fictional) or the modality in which it is presented (face, spoken/written name). False recognition does not extend to vocabulary knowledge, to other proper name categories (e.g. places) or to news events. Several hypotheses are considered but discounted. False recognition does not reflect reliance on familiarity associated with parts of the stimuli as opposed to the whole. False recognition, instead, depends critically on the nature of the referent (i.e. whether it refers to a person or not) and not on the nature of the stimulus material. Thus, MR will not produce false recognition when asked to search for names that refer to song or book titles even when, in all other respects, the stimuli resemble the names of people (e.g. Eleanor Rigby, David Copperfield). It is suggested that this disorder stems from a top-down failure to regulate the person recognition system, such that inappropriate information is retrieved. The category specificity may reflect inappropriate use of meta-memory knowledge concerning the rate of potential new exemplars from the category of \"people\" relative to other categories.",

They include a large variety of phenomena, encompassing hearing voices, seeing presences, communication with non-incarnated entities (including channeling), transpersonal experiences, out-of-body experiences, near-death-experiences, previous life memories, presentiments and precognitions, seeing at distance, mind interactions at a distance, mind-matter interactions at distance. We think that individuals experiencing NOMEs should not feel like they were outsiders or diseased; they should feel free to talk about their uncommon experiences and be listen to with an open, not-judging mind, respecting the patients’ experience and narration. In fact, NOMEs are non-pathological phenomena laying in a still misunderstood grey area between mental health and psychological or psychiatric disorders, while some of them suggest intriguing properties of human consciousness. Their ostensible incompatibility with some axioms and theories of consciousness, shows the inescapable epistemological implications of their proper investigation and understanding.",

      "title": "Stories in Pictures (and Non-Pictorial Objects) – A Narratological and Cognitive Psychological Approach",
      "abstract": "Narratological studies have quite frequently focused upon linguistic structures, considered to be paradigmatic cases of narrativity, whereas pictorial signs (such as icons and symbols) or indices have received comparably much less attention. In this paper, however, I intend to outline some basic and regularly occurring narrative aspects of pictures and non-pictorial objects. As a point of departure, I shall suggest (influenced by approaches from cognitive psychology, e.g. the work of Roger Schank) that cognition basically consists of the storage and retrieval of action scripts or schemata (i.e. narrative structures) which may occur on various levels of abstraction. These schemas incorporate generalized knowledge about event sequences (e.g. the order in which specific events will take place; causal, enabling, or conventionalized relations between these events, and what kind of events occur at all in certain action sequences). Moreover, there are also scene schemas which are rather characterized by spatial than temporal relations. This means that we have mentally stored inventory information, i.e. what kinds of objects normally appear in such situations, as well as spatial-relation information, i.e. concerning the usual spatial layout of a scene. Through previous experiences we acquire a large amount of such culturally based event and scene stereotypes (along with idiosyncratic variations), either due to our previously acquired, direct familiarity with instances of events, or due to our acquaintance with written, oral, and of course pictorial descriptions of them (e.g. religious or mythological tales). They include settings, sub-goals, and actions in attempting to reach specific goals. The production and comprehension of pictorial signs, as I will claim, is frequently based upon the existence and activation of such mentally stored action and scene schemas on part of the beholders. Actually, even things in general, whether artificial or natural objects, are capable of expressing or triggering such narrative structures, thus “telling us stories”. In this paper, I shall present some examples of pictures and non-pictorial objects where narrative structures become activated and, indeed, their recognisability and comprehensibility as such presupposes these structures.

      "abstract": "In our life, we usually see that people always do something to shape their target, all of their target usually have a relation with what they need in their life. And when they tried to involve their needs, there would a motif inside their mind to find any gratification. Motif comes from Latin language; “movere”, the meaning is to make a move or move to, in consequence motif which is interpreted as strength, is in organism in self pushing to do. Motif as impeller, generally does not stand up by it self, but related to other factors. Things could influence motif referred as by motivation. Motivation represents situation in individual in self or organism pushing behavior toward target. The appearanced of target, hence will yield gratifications at in self, gratifications mean all about positive things which felt in self after reached the target, such as; afective aspect, knowledge aspect, and others. In this research, researcher tried to look at into the problem. if there’s any influence of motivation of the audience cinema “Para Pencari Tuhan”, it will encourage the gratifications of the audience of cinema “Para Pencari Tuhan” at majelis taklim alAmin in sub-district Mekarsari. So, the question in this research was; Is there any influence of the audience motivation toward the gratifications of the audience of cinema “Para Pencari Tuhan”? From the question above, reseacher could make two hypothesis. Hypothesis represents a tentative answer in the research. Hypothesis colud be slice into two answers. First hypothesis represents a negative answer and the second hypothesis represents a positive answer. In this research, researcher made two hypothesis. The first hypothesis was; there’s no any influence of motivation toward the gratifications of the audience of cinema “Para Pencari Tuhan” at majelis taklim al-Amin in sub-district Mekarsari. And the second hypothesis was; there’s any influence of motivation toward the gratifications of the audience of cinema “Para Pencari Tuhan” at majelis taklim al-Amin in sub-district Mekarsari. This research based on the theory of uses and gratifications model. Uses and gratifications model explain about the audience, who always active using the media for get any needs. In this research, researcher used interview, documentation, and questioner for got many data. And for the analysis, reseacher used product moment formula to test the hypothesis. From the research, researcher got any result that there was an influnce of motivation toward the gratifications of the audience of cinema Para Pencari Tuhan in sub-district Mekarsari, but it didn’t significant. From the research we could take any conclusion and that is “the audience are always active using the media, they are not passive just like we know in others theory, such as bullet theory and hypodermic model. But not all of them really realize about media, sometimes it depends on how they put the media in the different way in their social structure, each other have a different perception.

      "title": "The Politics of Postmodern Jurisprudence",
      "abstract": "never-never land. In the reality of a concrete context, we are able to grasp the point of a text without slipping into an infinite regress bereft of meaning. 73 Moreover, neither traditions nor prejudices are mere mental forms or ideas that can be replaced by simply imagining different forms or ideas. Prejudices and interests often are learned or absorbed in a deep sense; they become in individuals. Prejudices and interests, then, are not like a pair of rose-colored glasses that can be removed and replaced with a pair of green-tinted glasses. To the contrary, once entrenched or learned, particular prejudices and interests are not easily changed or shaken, though they always remain contingent and potentially alterable.74 Additionally, prejudices, interests, and traditions arise from and are constituted by experiences that are mediated through language. And language, as a practical activity, is communicated through concrete experiences and actions.75 For example, a child learns through a multitude of social interactions the meaning of being a doctor in our society. The child might be a patient of a doctor who talks to and physically treats 73. At a particular point in time, a text can seem to have a multiplicity of meanings only if we imagine it as decontextualized, as existing in some abstract sense. But as Stanley Fish notes, we always encounter a text in a concrete context, and hence, the text always has a determinate meaning (though that meaning can change as the context changes). See Stanley Fish, Normal Circumstances, Literal Language, Direct Speech Acts, the Ordinary, the Everyday, the Obvious, What Goes Without Saying, and Other Special Cases, in INTaPREI1vE SOCIAL SCIENCE A READER, supra note 38, at 243, 256. 74. To me, Gadamer does not adequately make this point, although it is implicit in his approach. Pierre Bourdieu's notion of the embodiment of a practice suggests that prejudices and interests should be understood not merely as a state of mind, but as a state of the body. See PIERRE BoURDmu, THE LOGIC OF PRACTICE 68 (Richard Nice trans., Stanford Univ. Press 1990) (1980). In fact, Bourdieu writes that [1]anguage is a body technique. PIERRE BOURDIEU, LANGUAGE AND SYMBOLIC POWER 86 (John B. Thompson ed. & Gino Raymond & Matthew Adamson trans., Harvard Univ. Press 1991) (1982). Thus, we might understand language and tradition as being, in the words of Julia Annas, socially or embodied in various forms of social life. Julia Annas, Maclntyre on Traditions, 18 PHIL. & PUB. A-F. 388, 388-89 (1989) (discussing Alasdair Macntyre's notion of tradition); see Feldman, The Persistence of Power, supra note 5, at 2258-61 (criticizing Habermas's argument that we can separate symbolic reproduction in a lifeworld from material reproduction). 75. James Boyd White writes: [Olur acts of language are actions in the world, not just in our minds. Even when we think we are simply communicating information, or being rigorously and exclusively intellectual, or just talking, we are in fact engaged in performances, in relation to others, that are ethical and political in character and that can be judged as such.

      "abstract": "Abstract While agent responsibility appears to be one of the clearest examples of a human distinctive, practices of holding responsible are bound up with social expectations and emotional reactions, many of which are shared with other social animals. This essay attends to the ways in which what Peter Strawson first identified as the reactive emotions, including notably anger, resentment, and indignation, are key to making sense of both the shared and distinctive features of responsible human agency. Like human beings, other social animals express a range of reactive emotions in response to others’ conformity with or violation of implicit social expectations and norms; human beings sometimes reflect on these reactive attitudes and their justifiability, asking whether and when it is appropriate to hold others accountable, blame, and/or punish them. We should recognize that we often praise and blame others for attitudes and desires which they have not chosen and over which they have no direct control, and that this is appropriate.",

      "title": "The Nonperformativity of Antiracism",
      "abstract": "In this paper, I reflect on institutional speech acts: those that make claims \"about\" or \"on behalf' of an institution. Such speech acts involve acts of naming: the institution is named, and in being \"given\" a name, the institution is also \"given\" attributes, qualities, and even a character. By \"speech acts\" I include not just spoken words but writing and visual images—all the materials that give an institution interiority, as if it has a face, as well as feelings, thoughts, or judgments. They might say, for example, \"the university regrets,\" or just simply, \"we regret.\" More specifically, in this paper, I examine documents that are authorized by institutions (such as race-equality policies, which are often signed by, say, the vice-chancellor on behalf of an institution), make claims about the institution (for instance, by describing the institution as having certain qualities, such as being diverse), or point toward future action (by committing an institution to a course of action, such as diversity or equality, which in turn might involve the commitment of resources).Such speech acts do not do what they say: they do not, as it were, commit a person, organization, or state to an action. Instead, they are nonperformatives. They are speech acts that read as if they are performatives, and this \"reading\" generates its own effects. For John Langshaw Austin a performative refers to a particular class of speech. An utterance is performative when it does what it says: \"the issuing of the utterance is the performing of an action\" (1975, 6). For Austin, conditions have to be in place to allow such words to act, or in his terms, to allow performatives to be \"happy.\" The \"action\" of the performative is not in the \"words,\" or if it is \"in\" the words, it is \"in\" them only in so far as the words are \"in the right place\" to secure the effect that they name. Performatives succeed when they are uttered by the right person, to the right people, and in a way that takes the right form. As Judith Butler argues, \"performativity must be understood not as a singular or deliberate 'act', but, rather as the reiterative and citational practice by which discourse produces the effects that it names\" (1993, 2, emphasis added).The speech acts that commit the university to equality, I suggest, are non-performatives.1 They \"work\" precisely by not bringing about the effects that they name. For Austin, failed performatives are \"unhappy\": they do not act because the conditions are not in place that are required for the action to succeed (for example, if the person who apologizes is insincere then the apology would be unhappy). In my model of the \"nonperformative,\" the failure of the speech act to do what it says is not a failure of intent or even circumstance, but it is actually what the speech act is doing. In other words, the nonperformative does not \"fail to act\" because of conditions that are external to the speech act: rather, it \"works\" because it fails to bring about what it names. My paper will be structured by taking up four specific forms of institutional speech acts: admissions, commitments, performances, and descriptions.Second, in this paper, I want to suggest that the nonperformativity of antiracist speech acts requires a new approach to the relation between texts and social action, which I will be calling \"an ethnography of texts.\" Such an approach still considers texts as actions, which \"do things,\" but it also suggests that \"texts\" are not \"finished\" as forms of action, as what they \"do\" depends on how they are \"taken up.\" To track what texts do, we need to follow them around. If texts circulate as documents or objects within public culture, then our task is to follow them, to see how they move as well as how they get stuck. So rather than just looking at university documentation on diversity for what it says, although I do this, as close readings are important and necessary, I also ask what they do, in part by talking to practitioners who use these documents to support their actions. This paper hence draws on interviews with diversity and equal opportunities officers or staff from personnel units with responsibility for diversity at ten universities in the United Kingdom, an analysis of policy documents and my own participation in discussions within universities and policy conferences.The academic and political background to this research is provided by scholarship in critical race studies that has analyzed institutional racism in higher education in the United Kingdom, in all of its complexity (Modood and Acland 1998; Shiner and Madood 2002; Law, Phillips, and Turney 2004). My argument extends this work by pointing to a relationship between the new discourses of racial equality and the extension of institutional racism. In other words, rather than considering the turn to promoting racial equality as a sign of overcoming institutional racism, my argument will explore the \"terms\" on which this promotion is happening within higher education.In order to reflect on the politics of institutional speech acts, I want to think first about a politics of admission. I begin by analyzing the concept of institutional racism and the paradoxes that follow when institutional racism becomes part of institutional language. This has happened in the United Kingdom, where institutions (in particular, the police) have either recognized themselves as being institutionally racist or have adopted a definition of institutional racism within their race-equality policies. The Macpherson Report (1999) on the police handling of the murder of a young Black man, Stephen Lawrence, has been the key in this public turn. The Macpherson Report is an important document insofar as it recognizes the police force as \"institutionally racist.\" According to the report, institutional racism amounts to \"the collective failure of an organisation to provide an appropriate and professional service to people because of their colour, culture, or ethnic origin. It can be seen or detected in processes, attitudes, and behaviour which amount to discrimination through unwitting prejudice, ignorance, thoughtlessness, and racist stereotyping which disadvantage minority ethnic people\" (1).The language of institutional racism was not, of course, invented by the report, but it draws on a long history of Black activism and scholarship. How is this language used here? Defining an institution as racist involves recognition of the collective rather than individual nature of racism. Moreover, it forecloses what is meant by collective and institutional by seeing evidence of that collectivity only in what institutions fail to do. In other words, the report defines institutional racism in such a way that racism is not seen as an ongoing series of actions that shape institutions or the norms that get reproduced or posited over time. We might wish to see racism as a form of doing or even a field of positive action, rather than as a form of inaction. For instance, we might wish to examine how institutions become White through the positing of some bodies rather than others as the subjects of the institution (querying, for example, who the institution is shaped for and who it is shaped by). Racism would not be evident in what we fail to do, but what we have already done, whereby the \"we\" is an effect of the doing. The recognition of institutional racism within the Macpherson Report reproduces the whiteness of institutions by seeing racism simply as the failure to provide for non-White others because of a difference that is somehow theirs.It is worth noting that psychological language that creeps into the definition: \"processes, attitudes, and behaviour which amount to discrimination through unwitting prejudice, ignorance, thoughtlessness, and racist stereotyping\" (Macpherson Report 1999, 1). In a way, the institution becomes recognized as racist only through being posited as an individual, as someone who suffers from prejudice but who could be treated so that they would act better toward racialized others. To say \"we are racist\" is here translated into the statement it seeks to replace, \"I am racist,\" where \"our racism\" is described as a bad practice that can be changed through learning more tolerant attitudes and behavior. Indeed, if the institution becomes like the individual, then one suspects that the institution also takes the place of individuals: it is the institution that is the bad person rather than this person or that person. In other words, the transformation of the collective into an individual (a collective without individuals) might allow individual actors to deny or refuse responsibility for collective forms of racism.But there is more to understanding how institutional racism becomes an institutional admission. What does it mean for a subject or institution to posit itself as being racist? If racism is shaped by actions that do not get seen by those who are its beneficiaries, what does it mean for those beneficiaries to see it? I would suggest that such admissions might work both by claiming to see racism (in what the institution fails to do) and by maintaining the definition of racism as unseeing. If racism is defined as unwitting and collective prejudice, then the claim to be racist by being able to see racism in this or that form of practice is also a claim not to be racist in the same way.The paradoxes of admitting to one's own racism are clear: saying \"we are racist\" becomes a claim to have overcome the conditions (unseen racism) that require the speech act in the first place. The logic is, first, we say, \"we are racist,\" and insofar as we can admit to being racist (and racists are unwitting), then we show that \"we are not racist,\" or at least that we are not racist in the same way. What is important here is that the admission converts swiftly into a declarative mode: the speech act, in its performance, is taken up as having shown that the institution has overcome what it is that the speech act admits to. Simply put, admissions of racism become readable as declarations of commitment to antiracism. What does this conversion of admissions into commitments do?In the United Kingdom, there has been a proliferation of documents on race equality; we might even say that race equality is increasingly being documented or turned into documents. The circulation of race-equality documents in the public sector is a direct result of the 2000 Race Relations Amendment Act, which requires all public bodies to have and enforce a race-equality and action plan. This is an important piece of legislation insofar as race equality now becomes a positive duty; something that organizations must do. The first specific duty under the act for higher and further education organizations is that they must write a race-equality policy. The RRAA has fascinated me partly as it has generated a huge amount of documentation: the documentation is, as it were, one of the objects of the act, what it points toward.My own experience of writing such a document as part of a race-equality team was instructive. We adopted the Macpherson definition of \"institutional racism\" in the document, although we fell short of naming our institution itself as \"being institutionally racist.\" In working on this policy, we tried to bring a critical language of antiracism into the wording of the document. This meant that in the document we identified inequalities and racism as the history behind the document: in other words, we took up \"diversity\" and \"equality\" as terms within the document given that they do not describe the institution.I was taught a good lesson, which of course means a hard lesson: the language we think of as critical can easily lend itself to the very techniques of governance we critique. So we wrote the document, and the university was praised for its policy by the Equality Challenge Unit (ECU), and the vice chancellor was able to congratulate the university on its performance: we did well. At a meeting with staff, the vice chancellor praised staff for their excellent work, referring to the letter from the ECU. It was a feel good moment, but those of us who wrote the document did not feel so good. A document that documented the racism of the university became usable as a measure of good performance. Here, having a good race-equality policy quickly got translated into being good at race equality. Such a translation works to conceal the very inequalities that the documents were written to reveal. The document becomes a fetishized object, something that has value by being cut off from the process of documentation. In other words, its very existence is taken as evidence that the institutional environment documented by the document (racism, inequality, injustice) has been overcome; as if by saying that we \"do it\" means that's no longer what we do.Such documents function as statements of commitment to race equality: indeed, such commitments are often made in the first sentences of the policies. Having a race-equality policy, especially having a \"good race-equality policy,\" is about making an institutional commitment public. The documents are read as signs of commitment and in turn seem to commit the institution to doing something. Or do they?Let me quote from the opening paragraphs of two race-equality policies: The Race Relations (Amendment) Act 2000 (RRAA 2000) places a requirement on a wide range of public authorities, including all Further and Higher Education institutions, to promote race equality in a proactive way through all their functions and to publish a Race Equality Policy. This Race Equality Policy has been published to inform all [xxx] staff and students and all other partners of our institutional commitment under the requirements of the RRAA 2000. [xxx] recognises that by embracing diversity it can achieve its ultimate goal to become a 'world class University' and pursue excellence in research, teaching and clinical service.. . .[xxx] values its diverse community and is opposed to racism in all its forms. The [xxx] is committed to the fair and equal treatment of all individuals and aims to ensure that no-one in the [xxx] community is disadvantaged on the grounds of race, cultural background, ethnic or national origin or religious belief.These documents show the different ways in which the university is imagined as a subject with a commitment to race equality. In the first one, the policy begins with law: it frames the institutional commitment in terms of compliance with law. In a way, then, the document names its commitment by framing that commitment as a requirement: we commit insofar as we are required to do so. Commitment here is literally under the law. We might note that while this institutional commitment is named, it is not named as a commitment to something; we are simply committed to whatever the law commits us to do.The second quote seems to take us further, insofar as it names racism and declares the organization as being opposed to racism. At the same time, the statement also functions to bring the organization into the policy as being antiracist, a self-declaration that ironically can participate in the concealment of racism within the university. Declaring a commitment to opposing racism might function as a form of organizational pride: antiracism as a speech act might then accumulate value for the organization, as a sign of its own commitment. A university that commits to antiracism might also be one that does not recognize racism as an ongoing reality, or if it did recognize such racism, then it would be more likely to see that racism as coming from \"strangers\" outside of the institution rather than \"natives\" inside it. It is as if the university now says, if we are committed to antiracism (and we have said we are), then how can we be racists? Declarations of commitment can block recognition of racism. Paradoxically, the recognition of racism can be taken up as a sign of commitment, which in turn blocks the recognition of racism. The work of such speech acts seems to be precisely how they function to hinder rather than enable action. In other words, the failure, or the nonperformativity, of antiracist speech acts is a mechanism for the reproduction of institutional authority, which conceals the ongoing reality of racism.In one 2005 newspaper article about racism experienced by international students at Royal Holloway, we can see exactly this mechanism at work. Students from Korea complained about racism experienced on campus and about the failure of the college to respond adequately: \"Students, particularly east Asian students, feel fearful of these attacks and are deeply concerned that something should be done. But, they have no proper channels of complaint and are worried that too much noise would have a negative effect on their status at college\" (Pai 2005, 3). The article highlights the multiples ways that racism can affect the experiences of Black and Asian students: it can involve direct violence, and it also affects how students respond to such violence, fearing that reporting racism would lead to further marginalization. But the response of the college to this report was to deny the students' charges: \"Royal Holloway's spokeswoman said: 'This could not be further from the truth. The college prides itself on its levels of pastoral care'\" (Pai 2005, 3, emphasis added). In other words, organizational pride and the self-perception of being good block the recognition of racism. Organizational pride in being good at hearing messages prevents the message getting through. Such a speech act does exactly what it says that it does not do: it refuses to hear complaint in the very moment it says that it does hear complaint. If colleges have pride in their policies of pastoral care and antiracism, then they also fail to hear about racism. Being committed to antiracism can function as a perverse performance of racism: \"you\" are wrong to describe us as uncaring and racist because \"we\" are committed to being antiracist. Antiracism functions here as a discourse of organizational pride.As I have suggested, many of the race-equality documents function as statements of commitment and take a simple form: \"we are committed to. . . . \" Such statements of commitment might work to limit rather than enable action, insofar as they block recognition of the ongoing nature of what it is the organization is committed to opposing. However, we can still ask the question, what do statements of commitment commit institutions to do?When asking practitioners about this process of writing race-equality policies, I ask specifically about statements of commitment. What do they (or do they?) commit the university to do? In the following exchange between me and three interviewees from the personnel department of a university, we can see the hesitation that follows such a question.Question: It's a statement of commitment clearly as many of them are, do you feel that the statement itself commits the university to something?Responses:I would say yes but don't say why.Yes it does, but my angle, I suppose, is that you have to have reminders, examples, arguments all the time.And I think it's a good working document that people can take with them.But people don't like being told to read it.Yes they don't like it.We don't like being told we have to tick these boxes.It is true, but it exists, and I think it's a reference document and people will go back and read it if they wanted to find out something. But people don't want to be told to read it.If we took statements of commitment as performatives, we would say that they commit a person to something. But such performativity is not assumed by practitioners. The first response is that the statement of commitment does \"commit,\" but for unknown reasons. This uncertainty is itself telling, for it suggests that commitment is in some way mysterious and would need to be explained. In other words, the commitment does not simply follow the letter of the document. The word \"commitment\" does not do what it says. The second response also is a \"yes\" but a qualified one: the statement of commitment does commit, but it has to be supplemented by other forms of institutional pressure (reminders, examples, and so on). In other words, the commitment is not given by the document but depends on the work generated around the document. It is interesting that the next intervention begins with further qualification: \"but people don't like to be told to read it.\" If the statement of commitment does not necessarily commit the university to doing anything, then practitioners have to keep up the pressure; it is this pressure that can mean that documents do not work. This is a telling pressure for diversity workers: we have to put pressure on the document because it does not work, and the pressure on documents is what makes them not work. The compulsion to read the document means that it loses rather than gains currency. If people are required to read it, then they \"don't like it.\" Indeed, the following utterance moves from \"they don't like it\" to \"we don't like being told to tick these boxes.\" The commitment itself becomes a \"tick\" in the box. Now \"commitment\" is usually described in opposition to the \"tick box\"; a tick box approach to diversity would be where institutions go along with the process, but are not \"behind\" the action. For commitment to become a tick in the box is to suggest that \"being behind\" can itself be a matter of institutional performance. We create the illusion of being behind an action, even at the moment the action is not performed.The final utterance describes the statement of commitment as a \"reference document\" that people can use. This document then exists insofar as people refer back to it, as something that can help them to do things. Such documents by implication can only work if they are not obligatory: if people do not have to use them, then they might work. What this sequences of utterance shows is not only how documents of commitment are perceived as non-commitments in and of themselves but also how this lack of commitment in the document—which implies that we have to be committed to them to make them work—is what makes them less likely to generate commitment in others.The question then becomes where commitment is located, if it is not in the statements of commitment or in the people who generate such statements. Why does commitment matter so much to diversity and equality work, if it seems always not to be where it should be? I asked why statements of commitment matter to another practitioner: Oh that's hard. I think you cannot not have them, if you don't have them, well to me as a practitioner it's a starting point, again it's whether that gets fitted into practice. Commitments can't come without other actions. So the commitment to me is about what the institution believes in and what it intends to do—it can't stand alone, it has to come with how you're actually going to do it. I think if they weren't there then, well I refer to them quite a lot as you well know, if you're trying to, let's say there's an issue that's come up and somebody is not, maybe there's an issue and perhaps they're racist in what they bring up in their practice or something like that, and it's good to refer back to these documents, but actually you're an employee of the university and the university has made a statement about this. So in terms of watching the other members of staff and in my own experience, I've used it for that.The sentence \"commitments can't come without other actions\" is instructive because it suggests that commitment is an action, but it is one that does not act on its own. Instead, it depends on other actions, or on what is done with it. Commitment might be, in other words, a technology that can be used or deployed within specific settings. The work of commitment is how you act on the action: it is about what the action allows the practitioner to do. The statement of commitment is also described as a reference point, something you can use, when challenging how people act within the institution. In other words, the statement of commitment does not commit the institution to anything, but it allows the practitioner to support their claims for or against specific action. The statement functions as a supporting device.So although a statement of commitment can block action by constructing the university or organization as already committed to race equality, these statements also can support other actions precisely by giving this illusion of being behind. Practitioners use such statements to challenge people within the organization, by showing they are \"out of line\" with the direction of the organization, even if this line is itself imaginary and does not direct institutional action. Documents do not simply have a referential or descriptive function: it is not simply that they describe principles that a university already has. Indeed, in a way, the documents might even perform a lie insofar as they represent the university as if it has principles that it does not have. But this can be a useful lie: by producing the university as if it was a subject with such principles, the documents then become usable as they allow practitioners to make members of the university as well as the university itself as an imagined entity subject to those principles. Statements of commitment then might do something, not in and of themselves, but because they enable the exposure of a gap between what organizations say they do, and what they actually do: indeed, they might \"do something\" insofar as they fail to describe what organizations do.So what work are these documents doing in their failure to bring about the effects that they name? Such documents arguably are forms of institutional performance. They are ways in which universities perform an image of themselves, to be sure, but they are also ways in which universities perform in the sense of \"doing well.\" To return to my own experience of writing a diversity document: the document that documents racism becomes usable as a measure of good performance. What does it mean for \"equality\" and \"diversity\" to be seen as measurable in the first place? Are they becoming boxes to be ticked? Or a \"paper trail\" that goes nowhere?Diversity and equality are increasingly discussed in the United Kingdom through an emphasis on good practice. Although good practice is often seen as \"beyond the tick box\" (or rather, the tick box approach is seen as bad practice), I would suggest that \"the tick box\" and the \"good practice\" are part of the same vocabulary. The tick box shows we have done it (whatever we do) while the good practice shows we have done it (whatever we do), where the \"it\" is taken as a sign of good performance. Good practice guides and tool-kits are produced based on the principle that the best way of improving institutional performance is to share good practice. These documents too move around. An example can be taken from the ECU toolkit on communications, \"Good Talking: The HE Communicators Equality and Diversity Toolkit,\" which includes the following as an example of \"general good practice\": \"University of Southampton has produced institutional equality and diversity gifts and novelties that are in great demand.\" For diversity novelties to become a sign of good practice is clear evidence of how diversity is being repackaged, as if it was a property of objects that can be passed around. So an organization even gets a \"tick\" for its novelties.The RRAA signals a shift within the public sectors toward seeing equality and diversity as performance indicators, as things that can be measured. Heidi Mirza (2005) has described this as the \"bureaucratisation of diversity.\" Indeed, the RRAA has encouraged the shift toward seeing diversity and equality work as auditable. Audit culture not only measures performance but it depends on the reliability of such measurements. It also associates good performance with accountability, efficiency, and quality, assumed goals for organizations (Powers 1994, 1). Race equality would be something that could be measured, such that doing well would become an indicator of institutional good performance. In other words, race equality would be a sign of accountability, efficiency, and quality.Practitioners expressed mixed feelings about equality and diversity becoming auditable. Some suggested that to audit equality and diversity would be a good thing, as universities only take seriously the activities that are audited and attached to financial returns or penalties. As one interviewee describes, \"I think it would be useful in the HE sector because it wouldn't have been done, just thinking about how they could operate and how they've been lagging behind, it was the push, you know you had to do it.\" Audit becomes here a \"stick\" that would compel action, as a compulsion that energizes or creates an institutional drive. Others suggested that audit would not necessarily work, given how audit culture works as a kind of awareness of itself. As one director of personnel elaborates: An audit can establish if we have gone through processes, it can't really determine whether we are altering culture here. It can perhaps show whether we are reaching various targets, say you know, the same teacher of leadership staff who come from various backgrounds over time. But the trouble is when dealing with audit you tend always to respond in terms of process you know, we've done this report, we've got a plan out and all that sort of stuff. And I could see that you could get a rough idea if universities were putting effort into diversity by doing that, but the trouble is that in universities we've got an audit-aware culture in administrations. And so people are practiced at how to show auditors that processes are being gone through.So if diversity and equality were audited, then u",

However, Harmony is a ubiquitous principle based on Motivations arise from physiological need to preserve the integrity of the organism, via processes and the ways we process or react to our environment depends on our internal bodily state. For example, if we are thirsty or hungry, the manner in which we behave toward food stimuli differs and biases perceptions, hedonics, cognitions and memory. Motivations drive behavior, while changes in the internal state of the body anticipate, facilitate or accommodate the consequences of motoric action. The result is an individual system in a state of vibrant instability internally that contributed to physical and social interaction with the external environment. The individual make-ups of character and behaviors has emerged out of such patterns of chemical release. The mind is supposed to be a virtual entity, one that reflects the workings of the neural networks, chemical and hormonal systems in our brain. It cannot be localized to particular areas within the brain, though the entire cerebral cortex and deep grey matter form important components. Realization, sensitivity, conduct, intelligence, linguistic, impulse, energy, the urge to excel and intellect of the most complex kind are the product of the wide-ranging and multifaceted linkages between the different parts of the brain. Likewise, anomalies attributed to the mind, such as the spectrum of illnesses dealt with by psychoanalysts are consequences of widespread aberrations, often in the chemical processes within different parts of the brain.",

We are constantly sending out and responding to social signals. By measuring brain activity we find that most of these signals are transmitted and received without awareness, as in the contagious effects of fear, and in the mirroring of action and emotion. Contagious signals embed us in the social world and can make us behave in a more social manner, maximising gains for the group rather than for ourselves.However, higher level cognitive processes also have a critical role in social behaviour. Through mentalising, for example, we can take account the intentions and beliefs of other people. In particular, we can consider what other people think about us. The desire for a good reputation in the eyes of others also makes us behave in a more social manner.Failures of the social brain are evident in disorders such as autism and schizophrenia, which respectively have revealed under- and over-use of mentalizing. In autism, which is characterised by reduced contagion and lack of spontaneous mentalizing, more than one component of the social brain may be compromised. Nevertheless, some islets of social capacities are present even in this disorder. These hint at many layers in the complex networks of our social brain.

      "title": "Stories in Pictures (and Non-Pictorial Objects): A Narratological and Cognitive Psychological Approach",
      "abstract": "Narratological studies have quite frequently focused upon linguistic structures, considered to be paradigmatic cases of narrativity, whereas pictorial signs (such as icons and symbols) or indices have received comparably much less attention. In this paper, however, I intend to outline some basic and regularly occurring narrative aspects of pictures and non-pictorial objects. As a point of departure, I shall suggest (influenced by approaches from cognitive psychology, e.g. the work of Roger Schank) that cognition basically consists of the storage and retrieval of action scripts or schemata (i.e. narrative structures) which may occur on various levels of abstraction. These schemas incorporate generalized knowledge about event sequences (e.g. the order in which specific events will take place; causal, enabling, or conventionalized relations between these events, and what kind of events occur at all in certain action sequences). Moreover, there are also scene schemas which are rather characterized by spatial than temporal relations. This means that we have mentally stored inventory information, i.e. what kinds of objects normally appear in such situations, as well as spatial-relation information, i.e. concerning the usual spatial layout of a scene. Through previous experiences we acquire a large amount of such culturally based event and scene stereotypes (along with idiosyncratic variations), either due to our previously acquired, direct familiarity with instances of events, or due to our acquaintance with written, oral, and of course pictorial descriptions of them (e.g. religious or mythological tales). They include settings, sub-goals, and actions in attempting to reach specific goals. The production and comprehension of pictorial signs, as I will claim, is frequently based upon the existence and activation of such mentally stored action and scene schemas on part of the beholders. Actually, even things in general, whether artificial or natural objects, are capable of expressing or triggering such narrative structures, thus “telling us stories”. In this paper, I shall present some examples of pictures and non-pictorial objects where narrative structures become activated and, indeed, their recognisability and comprehensibility as such presupposes these structures.

The confusion is further compounded by the difficulty of defining an emotion. Different writers use the term in different ways. Literally, the word implies movement of some sort, thus, an emotion is clearly a manifestation, not a cause. Many authors, however, equate the term with a feeling state. To them, an emotion is a sort of sensation or at least an awareness which may be pleasant or unpleasant; for example, joy, satisfaction, hope, and appetite as well as fear, anger, and resentment fall into the category of emotions.

      "abstract": "The argument of Unfit for the Future 1 can be summed up as follows. It is easier for us to harm each other than it is for us to benefit each other. For example, it is easier for us to kill than to save life. As the progress of scientific technology has increased our powers of action, our capacity to harm has reached the point at which it is possible for us to undermine worthwhile life on Earth forever. This could be done by the use of weapons of mass destruction or by causing catastrophic climatic or other environmental changes. One central, neglected problem is that a significant cause of these problems is human behaviour, caused by limitations in our psychology as moral agents. Our moral psychology has been adapted to life in small, close-knit societies with primitive technology, in which human beings have lived for virtually all of their history. This is reflected in the fact that we are psychologically myopic, that is, disposed to care more about what happens in the near future to ourselves and some individuals who are near and dear to us. We are also incapable of responding adequately to the suffering of larger collectives. Due to the fact that it is easier to harm, we tend to have a moral reluctance to harm that is stronger than our disposition to benefit, but like the latter, it is largely confined to an …",

The sociological approach focuses on persons who seeks to connect with Allah, and asks about why they want to connect. They are mostly urban men of culture, education, and wealth enjoying public acclaim during, and also after, their lifetime. The second conclusion turns to the process, the search itself and asks if it is an existential process. It focuses on what is linked to Allah, and asks about the nature of the links. Its advocates dwell in the mystery of the Name. Allah exceeds the Name, even as the Name itself becomes a focus of attention on Allah as an immeasurable force, the source of life and death, good and evil, hope and despair. Yet neither the sociological assessment nor the existential response will satisfy the skeptic. The skeptic may be a believer or unbeliever, but they never cease to ask: where is Allah, and when does the quest end? They assert that Allah, or God, may not exist or may exist, but only as Being—infinite, timeless, and unknowable.",

Nonverbal communication consists of sending nonverbal signals through facial expressions, gestures, posture, dressing style etc. With nonverbal communication people in interaction show true emotions and thoughts that they experience in certain situations. Nonverbal signals such as facial expressions or gestures should not be studied separately, but one should look at the context of the situation in which certain signals appear. Gestures as part of nonverbal communication serve to people so that they can transmit an idea, intention or a feeling. Sometimes gestures replace verbal messages, regulate converation, maintain listener's attention, emphasize certain messages etc. As one must not ignore the context of the situatuion in which certain gestures appear, the meaning of the same gestures, but in different cultures, must not be ignored. Ignoring the meaning of individual gestures in foreign cultures can lead to very unpleasant situations. People should be aware of different interpretations of the same gestures, so it can extenuate mutual interaction.",

      "title": "LANGUAGE AND EMOTION: DISCOURSE-PRAGMATIC PERSPECTIVES",
      "abstract": "Some people might wonder if emotion has anything at all to do with language, or think that emotion cannot be a topic for serious scientific research.In fact, this has been a common belief for many years, even among linguists and other scholars.But fortunately, this was yesterday's news.Today's news is that emotion matters in every scientific field and in particular, in linguistics, because it is a key factor not only in understanding human nature, but also in the comprehension of human language and communication.Альба-Хуэс Л., Ларина Т.В.Вестник РУДН.Серия: ЛИНГВИСТИКА.2018.Т. 22. № 1. С. 9-37 10 Indeed, when people feel emotions they may not only show their internal states physically (e.g. by blushing or changing their facial expression), but also perform speech acts which are interpersonal in nature and have particular consequences.And by so doing speakers manifest, and at the same time affect, certain aspects of the cognitive, social and discourse systems they belong to.Indeed, emotion affects language and at the same time is affected by language: the way we feel may influence the way we talk and express those feelings, and at the same time, the way we name or talk about emotions can affect the way we feel such emotions.Perhaps nothing is more human than the verbal expression of emotion, for even though other animal species may express certain basic emotions in non-verbal ways, they certainly cannot talk about them (Alba-Juez & Mackenzie, 2016: 242).Sharing emotions is a crucial social activity which forms part of everyday conversation and interaction and helps us maintain both our mental and physical health.To express and understand these emotions appropriately is therefore important to interpersonal relationships and individual well-being (Fussell, 2002).Furthermore, it can be said that human emotion lies at the root of verbal communication.As Russian emotiologists suggest, in the beginning was not the Word, but the Emotion, because the basis of primary and secondary nominations from the very beginning were the emotions of a person, not yet Homo Loquens, but already Homo Sentiens (Shakhovsky 2008: 10).If we do not have the motivation to talk about something, our speech will most surely be very restricted (Foolen, 2015).As Stern (1965Stern ( [1931]]: 54) put it, \"If a thing were quite indifferent to me I would not say it\".Also, if a speaker feels that her interlocutor is not interested in what she is saying, it will be hard to continue speaking.Thus, emotion in communication works in both directions: not only the speaker has to have the motivation to speak, but the interlocutor should be willing (and therefore positively predisposed, showing a positive attitude) to listen; otherwise, communication will not take place.In the 20 th century, linguistics was mainly concerned with the referential function of language and the linguistic code per se.Language was seen as an abstract and logical instrument for dealing with factual information.The also true fact that language is strongly affected by and loaded with emotion was almost completely disregarded.But towards the end of the 20 th and beginning of the 21 st centuries, the world of scientific and humanistic research started to reflect upon the fact that language/discourse is much more than a code or some grammatical, morphological or phonological rules: the pragmatic, cognitive and emotive dimensions of human communication transcend the linguistic code, and this had to be reflected upon and shown in the research.Thus the world of linguistics geared towards what has now been called \"the emotional turn\" (Le Doux, 2000).Linguists started to study the phenomenon from a more objective, scientific point of view and thus came to the conclusion that indeed, as Ochs and Shieffeling had already pointed out back in 1989, \"language has a heart\".As several authors have now observed, emotion is undoubtedly a very important part of every kind of communication, and can be found at all the levels of linguistic description (Alba-Juez",

      "title": "Clothing",
      "abstract": "Clothing refers to skins or garments made from the manipulation of fibers or threads (i.e., woven, knitted, sprang, etc.), which cover the body in some manner. Adornment is another relevant term and refers to the temporary ornamentation of the body for a given occasion or event. It thus calls attention primarily to aesthetic qualities. The terms clothing and adornment almost inevitably introduce personal or social values. Hence, recently, scholars have opted for the broader term dress. Clothing is more specific than dress, which includes not only bodily coverings, but also jewelry, cosmetics, hairstyles, tattoos, or other manipulations of the bodily surface such as scarification. Dress is both noun and verb, or, put differently, both product and process. Dress as a noun is what is done to the body, and dress as a verb is how it is done. This article includes studies that address all three areas. The study of clothing has developed considerably in a number of disciplines. For historians, it began as a history of costume but has since evolved to include insights from social scientific fields such as anthropology and sociology. The latter two areas as well as other disciplines now boast a significant number of theoretical approaches to clothing and dress, examining them in light of identity (gender, religious, ethnic, cultural, political), power, embodiment, and how it functions as a communicator of subjective and social values, including notions of the self. Beyond its importance as a material artifact, dress has also been recognized as a reflection of mentifacts (values and beliefs that shape culture) and sociofacts (institutions and norms that direct human behavior). Moreover, the study of fashion and its significance for the study of contemporary culture, especially in light of Western commoditization, has emerged as a major area of interdisciplinary research. In Classics, analysis of dress has also witnessed a considerable upsurge in the last decade and deems it important for the study of societies, such as ancient Rome, in which “the gaze” is so important. Given the highly ideological nature of much of the ancient writing about clothing, archaeological studies and examinations of artistic remains are requisite. Such work must also remember, however, that art can be rhetorical, just as texts are. Of fundamental importance is the observation that items of clothing and ornamentation held tremendous material value in the ancient world, whether it is the Ancient Near East or the Greco-Roman context, and thus their economic, technological, trade, and social dimensions must be highlighted. The study of clothing in the Bible, ancient Judaism, and early Christianity is in its early stages. In biblical literature, symbolic and literal references to clothing, and dress in general, abound. Items of clothing take on legal, ritual, technical, and theological meanings in some biblical texts, while in others they serve as literary markers or motifs that underscore larger shifts within various narratives. In the New Testament and other early Christian literature, clothing imagery continues to convey theological and political meanings; it can function as a means of vilifying characters by associating them with luxurious dress, and it can assist in creating and maintaining identity.",

      "title": "Dynamic context discrimination : psychological evidence for the Sandia Cognitive Framework.",
      "abstract": "Human behavior is a function of an iterative interaction between the stimulus environment and past experience. It is not simply a matter of the current stimulus environment activating the appropriate experience or rule from memory (e.g., if it is dark and I hear a strange noise outside, then I turn on the outside lights and investigate). Rather, it is a dynamic process that takes into account not only things one would generally do in a given situation, but things that have recently become known (e.g., there have recently been coyotes seen in the area and one is known to be rabid), as well as other immediate environmental characteristics (e.g., it is snowing outside, I know my dog is outside, I know the police are already outside, etc.). All of these factors combine to inform me of the most appropriate behavior for the situation. If it were the case that humans had a rule for every possible contingency, the amount of storage that would be required to enable us to fluidly deal with most situations we encounter would rapidly become biologically untenable. We can all deal with contingencies like the one above with fairly little effort, but if it isn't based on rules, what is it based on? The assertion of the Cognitive Systems program at Sandia for the past 5 years is that at the heart of this ability to effectively navigate the world is an ability to discriminate between different contexts (i.e., Dynamic Context Discrimination, or DCD). While this assertion in and of itself might not seem earthshaking, it is compelling that this ability and its components show up in a wide variety of paradigms across different subdisciplines in psychology. We begin by outlining, at a high functional level, the basic ideas of DCD. We then provide evidence from several different literatures and paradigms that support our assertion that DCD is a core aspect of cognitive functioning. Finally, we discuss DCD and the computational model that we have developed as an instantiation of DCD in more detail. Before commencing with our overview of DCD, we should note that DCD is not necessarily a theory in the classic sense. Rather, it is a description of cognitive functioning that seeks to unify highly similar findings across a wide variety of literatures. Further, we believe that such convergence warrants a central place in efforts to computationally emulate human cognition. That is, DCD is a general principle of cognition. It is also important to note that while we are drawing parallels across many literatures, these are functional parallels and are not necessarily structural ones. That is, we are not saying that the same neural pathways are involved in these phenomena. We are only saying that the different neural pathways that are responsible for the appearance of these various phenomena follow the same functional rules - the mechanisms are the same even if the physical parts are distinct. Furthermore, DCD is not a causal mechanism - it is an emergent property of the way the brain is constructed. DCD is the result of neurophysiology (cf. John, 2002, 2003). Finally, it is important to note that we are not proposing a generic learning mechanism such that one biological algorithm can account for all situation interpretation. Rather, we are pointing out that there are strikingly similar empirical results across a wide variety of disciplines that can be understood, in part, by similar cognitive processes. It is entirely possible, even assumed in some cases (i.e., primary language acquisition) that these more generic cognitive processes are complemented and constrained by various limits which may or may not be biological in nature (cf. Bates & Elman, 1996; Elman, in press).",

      "title": "Magic, Sorcery and Witchcraft",
      "abstract": "Magic, sorcery and witchcraft-terms often used interchangeably-fulfill many emotional and practical needs in many cultures. Chiefly, magical thinking is a way of coping with uncertainty-to help abate anxiety by seeking the aid of supernatural forces to help solve problems. Magical ceremonies-for healing, to alter the weather, to produce good crops or a successful hunt, to punish wrongdoers, and so on-are part and parcel of the work of shamans, medicine-men and other healing practitioners. When illness strikes, shamans or other healers will invariably determine, before anything else, whether the patient has been subjected to witchcraft. Magical techniques are omnipresent in conventional religions of the world-gifts, offerings, or sacrifices, lighting candles, kissing icons. Magic is rightly feared because it can be used for antisocial or disruptive purposes-to cause illness, death, accidents or misfortune in others. Often the mere threat of sorcery or making known that sorcery has been practiced makes it surprisingly easy to settle a quarrel. A magical spell is said to work through the law of contagion-involving some “essence” or bodily residue of the victim, such as nail clippings, hair, food leavings, an article of clothing, etc. The spell works through the particular medium utilized so as to affect the victim. In many cultures people take great care not to leave nail clippings, hair or food leftovers where any enemy might utilize them for sorcery. It is commonly thought that the victim of witchcraft may well “deserve” the hex as just desserts for some transgression, such as refusal to pay a legitimate debt, unprovoked aggression, or a breach of charity or neighborliness. Accusations of witchcraft in cases of death or illness, may lead to a feud between the victim and the sorcerer, resulting in countermeasures or blood revenge. During the witchcraft trials of Europe, England and the American colonies, people believed that witches were in liege with the Devil, who in turn granted them powers to harm others. In many cultures, vampires and zombies are thought to be real entities. The belief in witchcraft is widespread in modern cultures-people will seek potions, candles and spells to help produce financial success, jobs or other good luck, or one can hire a witch or sorcerer for various intentions such as to attract love, to mend family problems, to cure addictions, to offer help in business, etc. Occult supply stores are found in every urban center selling magical robes, potions, herbs, books, incense, and talismans. In the Southern United States a “hexing culture” is widely prevalent.",

      "abstract": "The figures and speech of passion are clinically polymorphous and heterogeneous: from the baroque of the mystical ecstasy, the iconophily of religious and political ideologies, the collector's usual fetishism and the paranoiac insanity of hatred to the passions of knowing and loving. These are at the same time a passion for life as well as for self-destruction, for showing oneself as well for not knowing oneself, for representing oneself as well as for non representing oneself. Passion bares the impossible of mourning, its real point that gives a boost to the continual work. Passion confronts us to the essence of the being, to its fundamental distress. The being, whose shadow is projecting itself on the object of the passion, gives a name and a face to that object, and receives back its marks. That explains why passion is always accompanied by suffering. Moreover, passion is suffering according to its etymology: until the XVIth century, the word \"passionate\" meant somebody who suffered physically. The nature of the object of the passion (a relic, a part of a sentence, an indication, the track of an object or any other subject) changes nothing to the structure of the speech of passion.",

A's action is altruistic if and only if A's ultimate motive in performing the action is the furtherance of some other individual's (or individuals') welfare. A's action remains altruistic even if, as a matter of fact, the other individual receives no benefit (because of some unforeseen interference, say). And A's action remains altruistic even if, as a matter of fact, A (and A alone) benefits from the action, so long as that outcome was not A's ultimate motive. If A acts to benefit B but A's ultimate motive for doing so is that furthering B's welfare promises in turn to benefit A (via boosting A's reputation, say), then A's action is not altruistic but selfish. On the face of it, there is no reason to assume that this distinction is exhaustive. It seems possible that actions can be done for motives that have nothing to do with benefiting anyone, or can be done for mixed motives where benefits to both actor and other are important motivating factors but neither is ultimate.",

In the case of animals, a working definition has been proposed by Thaplyal and Misra (1996): 'animal health is a state of physical, physiological and behavioural wellbeing of animals, which lead to maximum possible levels of production, draught efficiency and economic benefit'. Any departure from this is then 'disease', which is a morbid state, affecting organs or systems of the host body and manifesting variously, such as a rise in body temperature, a loss of appetite, body aches, etc. It usually also results in the inability of an individual to perform normal physiological functions despite being in optimum nutritional and environmental conditions. Health is considered to be the result of a harmonious relationship of an individual with the environment. Any disturbance in this state of harmonious relationship brings about 'dis-harmony or dis-ease'.",

Clinical observations that provide instances of major focal injuries due to this mechanical factor, evoke an argument that other, minor, concealed, recurrent injuries exist. The cumulative effects of these recurrent mechanical injuries and the body responses to them cannot be totally chaotic and are bound to result in focal and/or systemic effects resembling those due to common non-communicable diseases. On the other hand, major environmental risk factors of common non-communicable diseases are found to be responsible directly or indirectly for forceful expulsion of materials from body orifices. Thus, because of the observed non-random pattern of relationships which are unlikely to be due to chance it is tempting to speculate that mechanical injury may be an important common pathway linking diverse environmental risk factors with common non-communicable diseases.",

      "abstract": "In ordinary use, the word ‘happiness’ has to do with one’s situation (one is fortunate) or with one’s state of mind (one is glad, cheerful) or, typically, with both. These two elements appear in different proportions on different occasions. If one is concerned with a long stretch of time (as in ‘a happy life’), one is likely to focus more on situation than on state of mind. If a short period of time, it is not uncommon to focus on states of mind. By and large philosophers are more interested in long-term cases. One’s life is happy if one is content that life has brought one much of what one regards as important. There is a pull in these lifetime assessments towards a person’s objective situation and away from the person’s subjective responses. The important notion for ethics is ‘wellbeing’ – that is, a notion of what makes an individual life go well. ‘Happiness’ is important because many philosophers have thought that happiness is the only thing that contributes to wellbeing, or because they have used ‘happiness’ to mean the same as ‘wellbeing’. What, then, makes a life go well? Some have thought that it was the presence of a positive feeling tone. Others have thought that it was having one’s desires fulfilled – either actual desires (as some would say) or informed desires (as others would say). It is unclear how stringent the requirement of ‘informed’ must be; if it is fairly stringent it can, in effect, require abandoning desire explanations and adopting instead an explanation in terms of a list of good-making features in human life.",

      "title": "A Traumatic Intrusion with Transgressive Possibilities power as a relational and discursive phoneomenon",
      "abstract": "Therapy in one way or other has always been about subversion - whether it was the undermining of symptoms, the provision of a transitional space for the considering of serious changes in one's life, a space for political conversations with social ramifications or more recently the co-creation of a space where the transformation of consciousness might take place. All of these aspects of therapy are about disrupting the habitual, the unseen and the conditioned in our personal and social lives. As such, one could posit that therapy, to be true to its spirit, is transgressive of the taken for granted - those conditioned responses which both keep us going and challenge us to transform. In that way, all change is in part a transgressive act. In our moves to evolve or co-evolve there needs to be a going beyond a previous positioning (Simon 2007). This special issue is a celebration of such an evolution and transgressions by many courageous beings in their own small and larger ways of living out a life of difference on the margins. Indeed this marginal siting cannot be but transgressive as they illuminate that which marginalises in the first place. This paper also relates to a transgression of a small kind. For many years I had worked with metaphors and experiences of marginalisation, power, gender inequality, abuse and victimisation. These categories seemed quite clear until the intrusion that is described here entered my life and home. What follows is my attempt at deconstructing previous clarities and restorying a lived experience of ambiguities in relation to power and powerlessness. I will explore a power saturated and personally traumatic event as a relational enactment. I have chosen to explicate my own experiences this time as for most presentations and papers, I speak as a professional working with clients who have experienced trauma. However, on this occasion I thought I would take a reverse position and address my own trauma which I first wrote about (for myself) in the immediate aftermath of the event described.",

      "title": "Bioevolutionary Ethics: A New Paradigm for Public Policy Making",
      "abstract": "The thesis I propose here is simple. Morality and ethics should serve as the basis for public policy; and biological processes lead to the formation of what E. O. Wilson calls our sensibilities. In other words, our notion of right and wrong naturally proceed from our biological evolution. Anything with which a consequence is associated also has an ethical component. This is most easily seen in three superordinate reference points that guide human behavior: (1) concern for individual survival; (2) concern for the survival of the entire culture: and (3) abstract or transcendent concerns that enhance the quality of life. We now understand that our individual survival, the survival of the culture as a whole, and our transcendent concerns are all inextricably bound to the survival of our planet from which we evolved or, more completely, the universe from which we evolved. These reference points that guide human behavior have associated with them a set of rules, moral principles and rights and wrongs that modify human behavior to insure that these reference points are sustained. Most of the time when we speak of ethics or morals it is understood by most to be in a religious context or in the context of some personal and subjective value system. The point of my brief introduction to bioevolutionary ethics is to establish that there is another alternative, one that is objective and rooted in an understanding of our bioevolution. This notion is not new. There are whole schools of thought and philosophy on the subject of ethics based in biology, particularly biological feedback loops. I hasten to add here that the assertion that ethics have evolved from our biological evolution has come and gone over the years and has been refuted by philosophical arguments rooted in David Hume's is/ought dichotomy (1) and G.E. Moore's naturalistic fallacy. (2) There has, in the past, been an inability on the part of evolutionary biologists to show the link between actions that promote survival and moral behavior. Since this is only a brief comment, I will not take the time to present counter arguments to these problems but will simply say that they are problems of language and the logical construct and no longer are valid. Returning now to biological evolution, an often--cited example to make this point is that there is a moral or religious reason to abstain from alcohol. However, the alternative view is that society has observed the negative consequences that overindulgence in alcohol brings, and it has developed a set of rules to govern its consumption. Is it immoral to drink and drive, or deleterious to society as a whole and therefore wrong? Or are they one and the same? The basis for the biological approach to right and wrong is rooted in feedback information given to all biological organisms to enhance survivability through modification of behavior. The human brain is the most efficient processor of information known, and it is, of course, biological. Most people are aware that our planet was threatened by our use of fluorocarbons. We were given the feedback that, if the use of these chemicals continued, our survival would be in jeopardy. Thus, we modified our behavior accordingly. The following story helps illustrate the point about moral intolerance versus biologically-based right and wrong. I lived with the Mennonites in Belize for a time and lived amongst a very strict sect that believed the use of modernisms, as they called them, was forbidden. They firmly held that the use of the internal combustion engine, chemicals, and such would eventually lead to the destruction of human kind and were therefore evil. Biologically-based ethics, on the other hand, would say that these Mennonites had enough cumulative experience to know that the nature of man was such that he would extract as much immediate advantage and gratification as possible from these new technological tools. Lacking wisdom, he would use the tools, blind of any negative consequences, and this would finally lead to his destruction. …",

      "abstract": "Abstract On the broad outlines of that analysis the great Victorian moral philosophers John Stuart Mill, Herbert Spencer,2 and Henry Sidgwick3-all seem agreed. It is the place of society to stop us from doing things that will harm others; it is not the place of society to stop us from doing things that will harm no one but ourselves. In Mill’s classic formulation: the sole end from which mankind are warranted, individually or collectively, in interfering with the liberty of action of any of their number is self-protection.... The only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others. His own good, either physical or moral, is not a sufficient warrant. He cannot rightfully be compelled to do or forbear because it will be better for him to do so, because it will make him happier, because, in the opinions of others, to do so would be wise or even right. These are good reasons for remonstrating with him, or reasoning with him, or persuading him, or entreating him, but not for compelling him, or visiting him with any evil in case he do otherwise The only part of the conduct of any one, for which he is amenable to society, is that which concerns others. In the part which merely concerns himself, his independence is, of right, absolute. Over him self, over his own body and mind, the individual is sovereign.",

      "abstract": "Predefinablessense: Things can be held or beheld, defined or dealt with, because they inhabit a sense-dimension. To see things is to see past them. The here and now are meaningful only in a distance and a span. The apparently immediate needs a medium in which to appear.excess: Things surpass their sense. They are more than the mediating dimension in which they are met. Their excess can elude definition, resist visibility, and solicit reinterpretation.Definitionsbeing: the sense of excess and the excess over sense. The concept of being indicates nonconceptuality: to grasp a thing as something that is (an entity) is to acknowledge that it surpasses the grasping. To recognize something as an entity is to experience it, within a sense-dimension, as exceeding that dimension.Being as such pertains to any entity that can be met in any way. Particular ways of being pertain to particular kinds of entities, with their characteristic senses and ways of exceeding sense.Scholium: As excess, being is often called existence. As sense, being is often called essence. The distinction is useful, but the experiences of existence and essence are normally interdependent.From a logical point of view, being appears as the separate functions of existential quantification and predication. But the capacity to make existential assertions (more broadly, to recognize excess) is tightly linked to the capacity to assign predicates (more broadly, to make sense of entities).emergency: a clash between sense and excess. An event in which excess challenges sense and resists being interpreted, so that sense has trouble getting a purchase on entities.The Emergency would be the primordial clash between sense and excess, the contest that generates the contenders as such, first establishing sense with excess as its counterpart.Unsettling emergencies are non-primordial emergencies, events in which some settled sense is unsettled by some excess.To emerge as emergent is to originate in a clash between sense and excess and call for an interpretation-to issue from an emergency and become an issue, hovering, unresolved and dissonant, demanding to be addressed.Scholium: What is most often called an emergency, the irruption of a threat that demands an immediate response, does not necessarily challenge sense, since the interpretation of the irruption may follow well-worn paths. But such an irruption always has the potential for trauma and surprise, so it can become an emergency as defined here.Emergencies as defined here are not necessarily threatening; they can bring pleasure and delight. Sense can be unsettled by an experience of wonder or rapture.Unsettling emergencies range from a passing confusion to a conceptual revolution to the shattering of a world. The degree to which an emergency can be understood within established sense-dimensions is a matter for judgment. Mature judgment develops through experiences of emergencies of various scopes.An emergent issue may hover in the background, even though it seems to have been resolved. The emergent is pacified when it takes the form of an answered question. It is dormant when it is not even recognized as a question.The Emergency can be defined in terms of sense and excess, as their origin; but it itself would be neither sense nor excess. To define it is not to understand it, nor to reduce it to the terms of the definition.Postulates 1. There are entities whose own being emerges for them. Call them we.1.1. Our excess over sense emerges for us. That we are here, that we exist and may not exist-regardless of how we may interpret our existence-has become an issue for us. We are faced with death as the ultimate excess, the extreme withdrawal from the sphere of sense. This issue can fade into the background as we take our existence for granted.1.2. The sense of our excess emerges for us. We are faced with the question of who we are, the demand to interpret ourselves as entities. …",

      "abstract": "Sighing and the interpretation of sighs in everyday life seem never to have been the subject of psychological research. A questionnaire study of sighing showed that people associate sighing mainly with negative, low‐intensity and deactivated emotional states. A second study investigated self/other differences in the interpretation of sighs in four hypothetical situations, revealing that sighs in other people are primarily perceived as signs of sadness, whereas own sighs are more often believed to express a state of “giving up” something or somebody. In a third experimental study participants worked on difficult (insoluble) puzzles, which generated many futile solution attempts, often accompanied by sighs. It is concluded that sighs are often unintentional expressions of an activity, plan or desire that has to be discarded, creating a pause before it can be replaced by a novel initiative.",

      "abstract": "A full description of the emotions does inevitably make reference to their intentional content. States such as joy, fear, anger, astonishment, sorrow, delight, and disappointment are all about things, and they all represent those things as having certain properties. The emotions, like cognitive states, do have intentional content, but it is equally plain that the emotions are not just special cases of propositional attitudes, but are distinctive types of mental state. What is it, then, that distinguishes the emotions from cognitive states? Part of the answer doubtless lies with the phenomenal feel that emotions exhibit. There is normally a particular way one feels when one is angry, joyful, jealous, afraid, or sad, whereas the propositional attitudes have no such phenomenal aspect. Although the occurrence of some phenomenal feel or other is characteristic of most emotions, phenomenal feel is a lot less central to the nature of those states than is often supposed. There is more to something's being a self than the collection of mental states it is in; those states must go together in a way that results in some characteristic unity and individuality. After briefly reviewing some general issues that arise in explaining consciousness, I put forth and briefly defend a hypothesis about what it is for mental states to be conscious and about how conscious mental states differ from those which are not. Using that hypothesis, then, I develop an explanation both of why all verbally expressed cognitive states are conscious and why affective states may well fail to be conscious even when verbally expressed.",

But they can all interbreed, like the different races ofHomo sapiens. 2.Any characteristic ofa biological population follows a statistical distribution curve: size, speed, endurance, enterprise, a capacity for mathematics, music, or hunting, anything that can conceivably be measured. 3.These distribution curves are not usually the same for different characteristics or different populations. 4.In any human population a man with any particular intellectual, social, athletic, emotional, or adventurous capacity is trained by the company he keeps toward marrying a woman, or the sister of a man, with diat capacity. Thus groups arise with specially developed mental, social, and physical characteristics; and diese are inherited. 5.Inherited racial differences obviously exist in man in respect of physical qualities. It is hard to believe that intellectual, emotional, and social differences are not based on qualities inherent in the nervous system (reacting of course with social and physical environment) and so can be passed on by inheritance and modified by selection. The only alternative is to suppose that die Creator standardized his invention at the start and has not since let selection work. None of this implies that racial differences imply moral superiority.

      "title": "Toucher sans toucher ou les contacts fictifs du \"corps symbolique de la cognition\"",
      "abstract": "Ghost touching. How the imaginary body of cognition makes invisible contact with people and things. Language provides humans with an imaginary physiology of thought and social interaction which is reflected in a number of fixed form expressions. Scenes of perception, socio-physical contact and interpersonal manipulation are routinely evoked in which humans interact with other humans or objects. The interactions are set in fictive conceptual or social space. Thus language makes it possible for speakers-cognizers to touch or make (physical, mental, social) contact with people and things (real or imaginary, concrete or abstract). A corpus study of the socio-physical uses of touch in English, and its derived adjectival or participial forms, reveals the extent to which primary sensory-motor scenes have been recruited to code other scenes in the pragmatic and epistemic domains. Language plays a crucial role in this socio-cognitive process since it is the symbolic apparatus of language that shapes and controls the idealized (or imaginary) body of cognition (IBC) -the invisible body involved in a repertoire of ghost perceptions and motions (like sensing, seeing, grasping, going, moving, shifting, etc.). Fictive acts of touching are part of this repertoire. Here as elsewhere, the imaginary sensory-motor activity of the IBC follows the strict stage-directions layed out by language. The moves and attitudes typically involve the hands, fingers, eyes and feet. After a detailed examination of lexical expressions coding socio-physical contact, the discussion shifts to grammatical manifestations of this cognitive mechanism with special attention devoted to the performative contact principle, as revealed by the syntax of pidgin or child language (e. g. Me do it !). The article closes with a demonstration of how scenes of manipulation and touching can be acted out to make sense of language structure and functioning.",

Phenomen.t, then, or appearances, as the word is literally rendered, are the sensible results of processes and operations carried on among external objects, or their constituent principles, of which they are only signals, conveyed to our minds as aforesaid. Now, these processes themselves may be in many instances rendered sensible; that is to say, analysed, and shown to consist in the motions or other affections of sensible objects themselves. For instance, the phenomenon of the sound produced by a musical string, or a bell, when struck, may be shown to be the result of a process consisting in the rapid vibratory motion of its parts communicated to the air, and thence to our ears; though the immediate effect on our organs of hearing does not excite the least idea of such a motion. On the other hand, there are innumerable instances of sensible impressions which (at least at present) we are incapable of tracing beyond the mere sensation; for example, in the sensations of bitterness, sweetness, &c. These, accordingly, if we were inclined to form hasty decisions, might be regarded as ultimate qualities; but the instance of sounds, just adduced, alone would teach us caution in such decisions, and incline us to believe them mere results of some secret process going on in our organs of taste, which is too subtle for us to trace. A simple experiment will serve to set this in a clearer light.",

One might argue that judgments as such are not experienced at all, but this is a quibble. We experience the world via our judgments, which is why it is said that our emotions are shaped or structured by judgments. Thus, an essential part of the experience of anger is the experience of being wronged or of having one's intentions frustrated. An essential part of the experience of love is the experience of finding another person attractive and desirable, being drawn to her or him, and later finding this person to be more or less indispensable to one's life. An essential part of the experience of grief is having suffered a terrible loss because one was (and is) bound to another person who is now lost. Again, each of these descriptions is not just a description of “items in our public world;” although, to be sure, it refers to those too. But the person who angers us, the person whom we love or for whom we grieve is not just a person in the world but the person as experienced from the peculiar perspective of the emotion and the person who has the emotion.",

      "abstract": "Abstract How is it that pride has gone from being one of the traditional seven deadly sins to becoming, in recent decades, the banner under which social movements have declared their objectives (Black Pride, Gay Pride, and so on)? How are we to understand the shift from a theology of sin to a politics of self-assertion (and an accompanying psychology of self-esteem)? Is it simply that times have changed? That, God having died, attitudes have changed—so that what once was thought to precede a fall now seems a condition of rising? Or is it perhaps that the nature of pride is to be understood differently in the two contexts? There may be an inherent ambiguity in pride: associating it on the one hand with arrogance, conceit, egotism, and vanity, and on the other hand with self-respect, self-esteem, self-confidence, dignity. (On certain readings, these may all be seen as different kinds or degrees of self-love.) Thus at different times, different aspects of the nature of the emotion come to be given prominence. Or is the difference in the objects? One place to start is with the recognition that the object, and the subject, of the traditional sin was the individual. The social movements that argue for pride are concerned with groups. How do individual and group identity come together in pride?",

Metaphysicians typically want to know what it is for one individual to be the same person as another. People undergo many changes over time, and some people resemble others quite closely The metaphysician wants to know, for example, what makes me—the chronologically challenged, mostly bald philosopher Stephen Braude—the same unique individual as the infant who appeared on the scene many years earlier, despite the considerable evolution in my appearance and in my psychology during the interim. However, epistemologists are concerned (at least sometimes) with a different problem: how to decide if an individual is the same person as someone else. For example, are these decisions rooted in judgments about physical continuity, psychological continuity, or both? In virtue of what, for example, do we identify a person as me, despite (so I'm told) my remarkable resemblance to other chronologically and follically challenged individuals? Granted, in real life this potential problem seldom stops us in our tracks. Although some have trouble distinguishing identical twins, and although we sometimes mistake a person for someone else, those problems are uncommon, and usually they are quickly resolved. In fact, that is about as difficult as it gets for everyday identifications.",

      "title": "The Nightmare of Health: Metaphysics and Ethics in the Signification of Disability",
      "abstract": "The Nightmare of Health:Metaphysics and Ethics in the Signification of Disability Scott DeShong (bio) Signification and Possibility Snyder, Brueggeman, and Garland-Thompson consider disability \"a fundamental human experience\" as well as \"the ubiquitous unspoken topic of contemporary culture\" (2). This is accurately stated but oblique, as it is ability, more precisely, that is the ubiquitous topic, and a topic not only difficult to recognize but even to speak—perhaps a topic that is unspeakable. The study of disability tends to suggest this reversal, while often reversing the way sociocultural articulations appear to work, such as when disability critiques seek to expose reification. Indeed, the theoretical study of disability is concerned largely with the assumption of ability, with ableist assumptions that emerge constantly, by which behaviors and conditions appear as if they were real or natural. Confronting discourses about defective eyes or legs, or about mental or emotional affliction—features that putatively cause one's inability to see or walk or cope—a disability critique will often recognize that, in the language of ability, seeing, walking, and coping are themselves being defined and thus emerge as at best interpretations of the supposed psychosomatic realities, realities that are revealed to emerge posterior to the always ad hoc, if naturalized, interpretive terms.1 Insofar as the study of disability becomes itself caught up in such a reversal, such study becomes defined according to what it does: not primarily concerned with the body or the mind, nor with specifically defined impairments, but rather with the discourse of the possible and the sociocultural context and ramifications of such discourse. [End Page 268] I wish to examine what disability means, what the study of it entails, in a way that moves beyond a critique of the word as joining with ableism, with the constitution of categorical human ability. As Peggy Phelan recognizes, any expression of disability—such as the categorical phrase \"people with disabilities\"—will tend to develop an ontology of central, standardized human ability, submitting performance to articulations of competence already established in the sociocultural imagination (322).2 Even in such expressions, however, we may hear inflections of radical difference, desire for the unnatural priority of ability to any conception of competence. Thus, we may consider how a virgule marks any expression of disability as dis/ability, marking the non-presence of ability by striking through the ostensibly simple dialectic of articulated competence and the lack of access thereto. Indeed, ability is never articulated and cannot be; all we have of ability is what we have through signification. As language provides the inevitable and impossible approach to its objects, the linguistic conditions of possibility for approach are also the conditions of impossibility, hence the im/possibility that marks dis/ability. It is redundant—if perhaps heuristically useful—to point out that nature, being, and ability are terms to be thought of as under erasure, caught as if logically posterior to incomprehensible referents, even as the referents themselves nevertheless cannot be thought of outside reference. As we view the discourse of disability participating in the sociocultural signification of ability, we concomitantly view ability as the possibility of signification. We undermine the naturalization of the sociocultural as the origin of articulation as we find articulation emerging in response to imperatives to articulate and to disarticulate. We find the imperative of overcoming the ontology of ability inherent in articulations of that ontology: we recognize the denaturing in the heart of naturalization. Of course, not only contemporary expressions of the notion of disability constitute the ableist articulation of ability. Historically, the expression of disability has articulated the recognition of categorical difference. \"Disability\" has usually indicated the emergence of specific problems inherent for a subject that are of another order than problems considered too general, pertaining to most or all subjects, or idiosyncratic, pertaining only to an individual. The characterization of deafness as involving ability different from hearing is a counterexample to commonly noted expressions of disability, expressions by which difficulty has typically been cited as the primary feature of a condition. [End Page 269] And whereas earlier in history—pre-Enlightenment, in the West—supposed difficulty, strangeness, and deformity may have aided in the development of centralized ideals...",

Land, stories, resources, equanimity, and loyalty are all examples of materially incommensurate things a person might possess. Even without material wealth, for example, one might be said to be in possession of a wicked sense of humor or a good memory or despite all else, one's own life story. Possessing one's own life story, however, is not a given. Thinking of one's life as a story, as something that can be narrated, involves social processes and conventions operative well beyond individual processes of reflection or experience. Narrating one's life, then, is to situate oneself and to be situated in dialogue with society. 1 As such, whether one's narrative is consensual with or contradictory to social norms, such narration signals possession of shared structures of possibility, including normative understandings of history, memory, knowledge, and truth. To narrate one's life is not just an issue of how, but also a matter of if .",

This book gives a full account of how emotions work in the mind and the body, according to both medieval and modern theories (Introduction, Saunders); how they function within a society or a group, notably that of the Round Table, or of the audience and readers of Arthurian literature (Gilbert, Lynch, Radulescu); the disjunction between emotion and effective action (Lynch); the mechanisms by which the emotions of a fictional character can be mirrored in a reader (Larrington); the capacity of sounds – even sounds with no semantic content – to convey feeling (Brandsma); and whether (or how far) emotions can be transferred across cultures (Rikhardsdottir). Their overlap and intersection with other schemata, of the passions or the vices, are discussed, along with the specific terms used to describe fear or anger or shame (Fuksas). The bodily expressions most commonly attached to specific emotions are explored, of going pale or red, changing expression, flinching or weeping. Medieval authors will typically portray emotions so as to suggest some kind of social function for their readers: how a king, or a knight, should act as well as feel. The model underlying all of these is the assumption that emotions are communicated socially. Even if the character feeling the emotion keeps it to him- or herself, the reader is granted privileged access to their unexpressed thoughts or feelings. Kings may be under an obligation not to be too open about their emotions (Baden-Daintree), but the readers will be shown what they feel; lovers may blush in public before retreating to their chamber or some other isolated spot to lament their state, as an abundance of Arthurian and other romances demonstrate, but the symptoms will be thoroughly familiar to readers trained to recognize them. But what happens when a bodily sign of emotion carries neither a familiar meaning nor an explanation within the text?",

      "abstract": "According to a Zulu proverb a human being can only become truly human because of others. Each person can only become more human, more himself- regardless of his sex - through the co-involvement of others. It is the love for one’s neighbour and the respect one has for him/her as a person which makes one consider the other party's feelings, viewpoints and circumstances. In order to arrive at a situation of peaceful coexistence it is important to realize that human attitudes and a mature life style evolve through a process of learning and interaction with others. It is a timeconsuming and costly process which starts at infancy and continues throughout someone's life. Instruction concerning interpersonal relations and the teaching of respect cannot be confined to individual lessons or working sessions at home or in school. Discussions and conversations concerning interpersonal relations need to form an integral and natural part of a child’s life within the home environment and throughout the pupil's school career. It is senseless if educators talk about the importance of teaching respect only to reveal disrespectful behaviour themselves, or to talk about the importance of self-esteem in the paying of respect whilst causing children to feel negative about themselves. To be able to express respect to other human beings, one needs to be respected. A child needs to experience how it feels when homage is paid. The following rule of life applies in this regard: one can never give if one has never received respect.",

      "abstract": "An occupational accident is an unpleasant “event” which occurs unexpectedly and causes injury or damage. Accident also denotes a range of different phenomena such as fate, coincidence, luck, misfortune and thus is a vague term. The word injury means a harm, wound or trauma done to a person9s body. Our aim is to highlight the somewhat erroneous use of the word “accident” instead of injury. Methodically it is important to know what are we measuring? In case of occupational diseases a cogent distinction is globally accepted. Exposure measures are not disease measures. Similarly, an accident statistic is not necessarily an injury statistic. In medieval times, Black Death was a phenomenon that was poorly understood and was explained as punishment for our sins. However, modern science distinguished between the cause (Y. Pestis) and the outcome (Bubonic Plague) and measures to prevent the outcome followed. History shows that successful prevention mandates a demarcation between the preceding event and the following outcome. An occupational car accident implies both event and injury. The extent of the injury is a result of the car crash which could be restricted by airbags. Isolation of the event (car crash) and the outcome (injury) is therefore critical to prevention technologies. All potential causes of the injury may be impossible to eliminate, but the outcome could be modified by targeted interventions. “Incident” is perhaps a precise term instead of accident for epidemiological applications. Regardless, if the word accident is indispensible, we recommend a more appraised use of the words accident and injury in epidemiology.",

Whereas the “hydraulic” domination-inhibition process that underlies extremism can be observed across levels of phylogeny, the motivational imbalance in those cases is typically brief in duration. In the case of humans, however, participation in violent extremism can be long lasting, due to its facilitation by a compelling narrative” that ties violence to the attainment of significance, and is embraced by a “network” of trusted others (individuals’ friends and relatives) who validate the narrative and bestow significance on individuals who implement its dictates.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, we show that organisms can be modeled as hierarchical Bayesian control systems with small world and information bottleneck (bow-tie) network structure. Such systems combine hierarchical perception with hierarchical goal setting and hierarchical action control. We argue that hierarchical Bayesian control systems produce deep hierarchies of goal states, from which it follows that organisms must have some form of 'highest goals'. For all organisms, these involve internal (self) models, external (social) models and overarching (normative) models. We show that goal hierarchies tend to decompose in a top-down manner under severe and prolonged levels of stress. This produces behavior that favors short-term and self-referential goals over long term, social and/or normative goals. The collapse of goal hierarchies is universally accompanied by an increase in entropy (disorder) in control systems that can serve as an early warning sign for tipping points (disease or death of the organism). In humans, learning goal hierarchies corresponds to personality development (maturation). The failure of goal hierarchies to mature properly corresponds to personality deficits. A top-down collapse of such hierarchies under stress is identified as a common factor in all forms of episodic mental disorders (psychopathology). The paper concludes by discussing ways of testing these hypotheses empirically.",

This applies to the word both as a verb: to oppose, I object to [x], and as a noun: a “tangible thing, something perceived with or presented to the senses.”[1] In both cases, the definition of ‘object’ invokes a relationship between ourselves and the thing itself, in our sensing or perception of it. Perhaps because of this, it is easy to infer a human-centred definition in which the object is defined by our perception and exists for us; physical objects stop us, present obstacles for us to manoeuvre around, much like an objection: an argument presented in opposition. But what if objects are not obstacles, are not in opposition to us, are not primarily defined by our sensing or perception? My preference is for the latter half, the thrown-ness, jacere, of this etymology; objects present themselves to our senses, they throw (jacere) themselves in front of (ob) us. This definition accentuates an animacy in materiality, and an energetic lived relationality to all matter — if objects throw themselves in front of us, they arrive at us just as much as we arrive at them. Our senses are constantly being presented with objects, whether we register them or not. John, Virginia Woolf’s character in “Solid Objects,” is presented with objects (beach glass, broken porcelain, meteorite) that influence the course of his life. My visual art practice engages deeply with objects, and, like John, objects have influenced the course of my life. For this reason, object-theory resonates with me, as do stories like that of Woolf’s character for whom life is, in a sense, a series of object-relations. In this paper, I formulate a conceptual framework for an ontology of vibrant things to explore what I intrinsically already know: all matter is active, fluid, non-hierarchical, and in relation. I describe a shift where I theoretically and physically orientate myself to objects as vibrant things, speculate on how this orientation might be queer, and recount how these relations are registered in my art practice and research methodology through the process of casting.

However, one might think that, strictly speaking, the perceptual language here is misleading. One might, that is, think that when we say things like this, we do not really mean that the other's state of mind is perceptible in the same way that ordinary objects in our visual field are perceptible. Rather, to say, ‘I see the anger in his face’, is to offer a kind of shorthand for something like this: I see him make a facial expression that people commonly make when angry, and so infer that he is angry. So, ordinary locutions such as ‘I see the anger in his face’ are misguided. They imply that emotions, like ordinary objects, are perceptible, and that behaviours that express our emotions enable non-inferential knowledge of them by others. But in fact there is no literal perception of emotions; at most what is perceived are behaviours that express the emotions, and our knowledge of others’ emotions is always mediated by our knowledge of other things, so that, even in paradigmatic cases where we take ourselves to recognize someone's emotion in their behaviour directly, what we do is infer the presence and character of the emotion on the basis of behavioural evidence.",

      "abstract": "All human beings experience life’s givens or the ultimate concerns of death, isolation, freedom, and meaninglessness. Whether there is awareness or not, these givens influence how individuals interact and relate to self, others, and the world. Failure to understand these existential concerns can lead an individual to behave inauthentically in relation to her core values. This article will illuminate the role of existential psychotherapy in revealing the effect of life’s givens on an individual’s lived experience. First, this article will ground existential therapy within its philosophical roots. Second, it will highlight the use of the phenomenological method in existential psychotherapy as a means of building a strong therapeutic alliance between therapist and client. Attention to the client’s lived experience in a value-free way will provide space for the client to work through his or her existential anxiety toward authenticity. The client, in feeling deeply understood will be able to respond more authentically to the therapeutic relationship and by extension to others in his or her world. A framework for understanding how life’s givens can manifest across the physical, personal, social, and spiritual life dimensions are presented. This framework is used to conceptualize a case study of a client struggling with existential issues.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Objectives This review will describe how human exercise performance at the highest level is exquisitely orchestrated by a set of responses by all body systems related to the evolutionary adaptations that have taken place over a long history. The review will also describe how many adaptations or features are co-opted ( exaptations ) for use in different ways and have utility other than for selective advantage. Methods A review of the literature by relevant search engines and reference lists in key published articles using the terms, performance, limitations, regulation, trade-offs as related to exercise, indicates that there are at least three areas which could be considered key in understanding the evolutionary basis of human exercise performance. Results First, there is a basic assumption that exaptations have limitations or capacities which cannot be exceeded which in turn will limit our physical performance. Second, it is thought that some biological systems and tissues have additional capacity which is rarely fully accessed by the organism; referred to as a safety factor . Third, there are biological trade-offs which occur when there is an increase in one trait or characteristic traded for a decrease in another. Conclusions Adaptations have resulted in safety factors for body systems and tissues with trade-offs that are most advantageous for human performance for a specific environment.",

It consists of words said or written in the form of dua or dhikr for the purpose of protection or cure. It is sometimes accompanied by other actions, such as blowing or wiping over the thing which it is applied to. \"It should be done by reciting the words of Allah, may He be exalted, or His names and attributes, and in Arabic or in a language the meaning of which is understood, and with the belief that ruqyah has no effect in and of itself; rather it is only effective by the will of Allah, may He be exalted.\"[2] Ruqyah practice can improve one's calmness, spiritual quality, and happiness, as a characteristic of an individual's mental health. Ruqyah practices are an effort to restore human nature (fitrah) that has inner peace and happiness.[3] The Quran says, \"Without doubt in the remembrance of Allah do hearts find satisfaction.\"[4] Herein, we presented the use of ruqyah as shifa (cure) in patients with neuropsychiatric disorders to draw attention to the importance of ruqyah applications in clinical practice.",

      "abstract": "The focus of another person's gaze is an important cue in social interactions, helping us to understand others' intentions, predict their behavior, and allocate our own attention appropriately. The perception of gaze vergence provides information about the distance at which another person is fixating, but has yet to receive much empirical attention. Here, we report that observers display systematic biases when perceiving others' gaze vergence and depth of fixation. Specifically, they perceive others as having convergent gaze and fixating at closer distances, especially when gaze is directed downward or observed under conditions of sensory uncertainty. These biases may reflect the predominance of convergent over divergent gaze in everyday social interactions and implicit knowledge of the physical structure of the environment, in which objects below our line of sight are typically closer. These findings demonstrate the sophistication of social vision, in which our visual perception of others is shaped by statistical regularities, and help to establish the perception of others' gaze vergence and fixation distance as a subject of psychological investigation.

[expecting] uncertainty rather than deterministic outcomes...; [taking] uncertainty or “fuzziness” . . . to be inevitable and, to some degree, omnipresent; [seeing] ambiguity . . . pervade the entire system, and . . .

[T]he underlying notion [in their professional culture] is that no amount of rules and data can completely and reliably capture the actual complexity of the system . . .

[They] tend to be very wary of [the pressure to intervene], primarily because it runs counter to a basic attitude of conservatism fostered by their culture: “when in doubt, don’t touch anything.” Their reluctance to take any action unless it is clearly necessary arises from the awareness that any operation represents a potential error, with potentially severe consequences.

Ecologists, as we have seen, frequently describe the ecosystem in just such terms: it responds to external disturbances, the whole system is more than the sum of its parts, it displays nondeterministic behavior, its complexity can never be fully captured and, therefore, management is extremely challenging, with managers always reluctant to intervene—at least in major ways—in ecosystems they do not know, because this potentially creates more problems than it solves. However, ecologists are not the group being described, and here is the surprise. Though the quoted phrases are almost textbook ecology material, the professional culture discussed here is in fact that of line operators in high reliability organizations (HROs).",

      "abstract": "The Konjaku monogatari-shū (1120s) is a Buddhist setsuwa collection especially interesting when being put into the context of concepts, which go back to the texts of the Canon. These concepts are considered to the everyday life of the Japanese sangha. One of these concepts is yoi, “intoxication”(Skt. mada). Traditionally, it is being interpreted literally (an intoxication achieved by an intake of alcohol, dope etc.) and in a figurative sense (a human’s consciousness obsessed by a passion). In Konjaku, the intoxication is the main motive for the maki 28. This text is usually read as a set of stories, which are considered as comic regardless of their quite serious end. By succumbing to passion, a person not only acts to his detriment, but also looks ridiculous to others. This means that by getting inebriated he puts himself into such a circumstance when other people start making fun of him. An emotional relationship between a drunk person and the society looks ambiguous: on the one hand, it is harmful for an individual (mocking, people lie, commit cruel acts, etc.), and on the other, it is useful if it reveals a common understanding of the concept of funny. This is a constant value, which is one of the few things to be relied upon in the volatile world. The article includes translations of several stories from the 28th maki of Konjaku. The author declares that there is no conflict of interest.",

      "title": "Flooding or Response Prevention or Detainment or Forced Reality-Testing: A Note on Nomenclature",
      "abstract": "The extinction of avoidance behavior has received widespread attention, both clinical and experimental. Techniques which hasten the cessation of avoidance responding in animals during extinction have been developed, and clinical analogues have been employed. One tcchnique which has been thoroughly investigated is known as (or or or reality-testing; see Baum, 1970). In this note I discuss the various labels attached to or used to describe this technique and attempt to justify the adoption of the standardized term flooding. Flooding involves exposure to the stimuli which the organism fears. When the avoidance involves an element of active flight, then entails thwarting or blocking the avoidance response, detaining the organism in the presence of the feared stimuli for some length of time. Hence, the labels response prevention or deta i~lent For this technique. However, the technique can also be employed in the case of the extinction of passive avoidance responding as well. Thus, an animal can be trained to run down an alley-way for food and then punished for running. This animal will learn to avoid punishment passively by ceasing its alley-running behavior. When punishment has been removed and we wish the passive avoidance to extinguish, would entail forcing the animal to move down the runway in the absence of any punishment, so that its previous behavior of alley-running would be re-established. Obviously, the rerms response prevention or detainment would be misleading in this case. Flooding is thus the term which is most appropriate, since it is applicable to the extinction of both active and passive avoidance responding alike. The term forced reality-testing has also been used interchangeably with the rerm flooding. However, [he former term has clinical connotations which may be inappropriate in purely experimental work. Sidestepping these connotations, the term also conveys the notion that it must be an unusually strong emotional experience for an organism to undergo exposure to something ic fears and has been accustomed to fleeing in some way. In the clinical situation, the exposure generally occurs through the use of the patient's imagination rather than in real life. For such flooding in imagination, the often used term implosion has been suggested as the standard term (Baum & Poser, in press).",

Gottwald on His Sixty-Fifth Birthday, p. 148 [cited under New Testament: The Evil Eye and John H. Elliot]). This belief has been referred to by many names: ayin ha-ra (Hebrew), baskaino (and related terms, Greek), invidia or fascinus (Latin), ‘ayn (Arabic), mal occhio (Italian), mal de ojo (Spanish), böser Blick (German), and so forth. However, it is commonly referred to in English as the “evil eye.” The belief is typically connected to envy and often emerges in cultures that believe in an extramission theory of vision (see Theoretical Explanations), that is, one in which the eye is understood as an active organ, capable of emitting light from it. Women and outsiders, in particular, are thought capable of casting the evil eye, and those who are beautiful, healthy, wealthy, or young are especially vulnerable to it. Yet, it is believed that individuals can protect themselves against the negative influences of the evil eye by wearing amulets and reciting certain incantations (see, e.g., Gideon Bohak‘s Ancient Jewish Magic: A History [cited under Ancient Near East], E. A. Wallis Budge‘s “The Evil Eye” in Amulets and Superstitions [cited under General Overviews: Classic Overviews], Christopher A. Faraone‘s “The Amuletic Design of the Mithraic Bull-Wounding Scene\" and James Russell‘s “The Archaeological Context of Magic in the Early Byzantine Period” [both cited under Greece and Rome: Artistic and Archaeological Representations], James N. Ford‘s “Ninety-Nine by the Evil Eye and One from Natural Causes: KTU2 1.96 in its Near Eastern Context\" [cited under Ancient Near East]. The scholarly study of the evil eye is vast. Siegried Seligmann‘s Die Zauberkraft des Auges und das Berufen: Ein Kapital aus der Geschichte des Aberglaubens, a classic survey (cited under General Overviews: Classic Overviews), lists more than 2,100 scholarly treatments, and, today, more than three thousand separate examinations of the phenomenon are found around the world. This article thus provides a selective list of relevant scholarship on the evil eye belief in the Hebrew Bible/Old Testament, the New Testament, Rabbinic Literature, and Early Christian Literature. Views from the Ancient Near East and Greece and Rome on the evil eye are included as background for the belief in biblical communities, as is a survey of scholarly explanations (Theoretical Explanations) for the belief around the world. Since a growing number of scholars are interested in the relationship among Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, scholarship on the evil eye belief in Islam is also included. The relevance of the belief for the history of Biblical Reception is also noted.",

Recent evidence suggests that more everyday experiences can also evoke mild feelings of awe, and that these feelings can have benefits for people's lives. Accumulating evidence suggests that awe has several benefits for physical health, and might reduce the likelihood of developing chronic conditions. Awe also tends to prompt self-transcendence, resulting in the sense of a \"small self\" that shifts people's focus towards others and the world around them. People who have experienced awe are more prosocial and helpful. They are also more creative and less likely to use stereotypes in their decision making. Over time, there is evidence that awe can improve well-being and satisfaction. Considering the grandness of the emotion of awe, it does not seem intuitive to establish a connection between awe and a relatively ordinary workplace setting. However, this chapter reviews several directions for organizations and individuals to improve their work environment and climate by fostering a sense of awe in the workplace.",

      "abstract": "The nature of an individual, of a self, is defined by autobiographical memories unique to that person. Memories, however, may also be shared across individuals who have experienced the same or similar events. Moreover, personal knowledge abstracted from experience, autobiographical knowledge, may be unique to an individual or may generalize more widely within social groups, societies, and cultures – for example, in life scripts (e.g., Berntsen and Bohn, 2009; Berntsen and Rubin, 2004) and representations of lived history (e.g., Brown, Lee, Krslak, et al., 2009; Brown and Lee, 2010; Brown, Hansen, Lee, et al., this volume). Autobiographical memories and knowledge are conjoined in acts of remembering (Conway, 2009) and form mental constructions that the individual experiences as memories – that is, for which they have conscious recollective experience. We conceive of this complex form of cognition as occurring in what we have termed the self-memory system (SMS). The SMS contains conceptual representations of the self, goal structures, autobiographical conceptual knowledge, and highly event-specific episodic memories (Conway, 2005, 2009; Conway and Pleydell-Pearce, 2000). In this chapter we briefly review the SMS and link it to more recent developments in understanding conceptual autobiographical knowledge and especially to cross-cultural aspects of autobiographical remembering.",

      "abstract": "1. In the ordinary theory of statistical correlation, normal or otherwise, we are always supposed to be dealing with material susceptible of continuous variation, or at least of variation by a considerable number of discontinuous steps. The correlations of lengths or measurements on portions of the body form examples of the first kind; of numbers of children in families, petals or other parts of flowers, are examples of the second. Certain practical cases arise, however, where either no variation is thinkable at all, or else is not measured or possibly measurable. We may class a number of individuals into deaf and not deaf, blind and not blind, imbecile and not imbecile, without attempting to go further (although gradations of deafness, blindness, and imbecility occur), and demand on the basis of the enumeration a discussion of the association of the three infirmities. Or again the data may be the mortality from some disease with and without the administration of, say, a new antitoxin, the statistics giving number who died to whom antitoxin was administered, number who died to whom antitoxin was not administered; number who did not die to whom antitoxin was not administered, number who did not die to whom antitoxin was administered; and from these data a discussion of the value of the cure is required. Here there is no scale of “death”; there may be a scale of “antitoxin” if the dose varied, but not otherwise.",

      "title": "Dominant Ideas in the Formation of Indian Culture",
      "abstract": "EVERY ADJECTIVE and noun in this title needs definition, and most if not all could be variously defined. For the purpose of this paper I shall use the following definitions, without meaning to deny the possibility of others. An idea 1 is a word or a phrase. A phrase is a group of words forming a syntactic unit; in the sense here used, it includes sentences. A dominant idea, in a people's culture, is a word or phrase which occurs, in approximately identical or semantically equivalent forms, frequently in texts of the language or languages of that people, and which appears to have been regarded by the authors of those texts, and by their cultural kinsmen and successors, as important for its bearing on human life and conduct. (In the case of living people, oral speech may take the place of texts as source material.) Definitions of culture are especially numerous and variant. I shall understand it here as meaning a total way of human life viewed as a norm, and as such approved or at least tolerated, by a people as a whole, or by its articulate representatives generally. Indian culture is the norm of human life approved or accepted generally by the civilized inhabitants of India (Hindus) since roughly round about four or five hundred B. C. Its classical expression is found in literature from about that time on, in the Sanskrit, Pali, and Prakrit languages, and later in other languages, some IndoAryan, some Dravidian (especially Tamil 2 and Telugu). It may properly be spoken of as approximately a unit in some important respects, and in most of these respects it is still the dominant cultural pattern over the greater part of India. It was however preceded by at least one earlier pattern of which we have a good deal of knowledge. I shall call this latter the Vedic culture. It was rather different from 'Indian' culture in some of these important respects. The word formation I take to mean historic origin. In short, then, I shall suppose that I am asked to pick out words and phrases which, in my opinion, have been regarded by Indians since some centuries B. C. as specially important in their bearing on the conduct of human life, viewed as a norm; and to suggest how I think they were related to earlier words and phrases, or to the same words occurring in earlier phrases and perhaps bearing different meanings. At the very outset this quest is complicated by a striking dichotomy in Indian culture. There are two radically different norms of human life and conduct, both at least tolerated, indeed in some sense accepted and approved, each in its own sphere. I shall call them the ordinary and the extraordinary norms. One strange thing is that one of them seems to involve a complete negation or rejection of the other as an acceptable norm. The first is the only one possible for the great mass of mankind, short of some future spiritual regeneration of the entire race. In this ordinary way of life, Hindu texts constantly speak of three broad aims, or aspects of the cultural norm, all of which are normal and acceptable, and which include everything that a normal man can, or at any rate ought to, aim at. These are, in Sanskrit, dharma, artha, and kIma; they are called the Group of Three, trivarga. Dharma is propriety, socially approved conduct, in relation to one's fellow men or to other living beings (animals, or superhuman powers). Law, social usage, morality, and most of what we ordinarily mean by religion, all fall under this head. Artha is profit, worldly advantage and success. It includes personal advancement in wealth, politics, business, professional and social activities of all sorts. Kdma is love: success in dealing with the opposite sex. In each of these three departments we have many extensive treatises called sastras, at the same 1 Cf. Leonard Bloomfield, Language or Ideas? in Language 12. 89-95 (1936). The title of my paper was not formulated by me; I hope my interpretations are not too far from the intent of its proponents, the Program Committee of the Centenary Meeting. 2 Some Tamil literature may be older than much which is called Classical Sanskrit.",

      "title": "Nature and Object of Faith",
      "abstract": "Abstract The term “faith” is frequently used in a generic sense without any religious or theological significance. Philosophers and others use it to mean the acceptance as true or real of anything that is not immediately evident or demonstrable. In this sense faith is an ingredient in virtually all human knowledge and activity. Whenever I read the newspapers, speak about history or science, and in fact whenever I get on a train, eat a meal, or perform many other ordinary actions, I am implicitly making acts of human or natural—that is to say, non-theological—faith. In so doing I may be following a spontaneous instinct, an acquired habit, or a free, voluntary decision. I may be said to be exercising faith in my senses, in my memory, in the reliability of a machine, or in the competence and integrity of other persons. The term “faith” is especially appropriate in the case of firm beliefs involving implicit trust in another person or other persons. Faith in this case is closely connected with love and loyalty. The English word “believe” is etymologically connected with the word “love,” just as the Latin credereimplies a gift of the heart (cordare). Faith normally leads to faithful action, which is a matter of”keeping faith” with persons or living up to one’s commitments. When a person is said to have or profess a faith, the reference may be to a com­prehensive vision that serves to give an interpretation of life as whole, including a scale of values. For convinced adherents, philosophical systems such as Platonism and ideologies such as Marxist Communism serve as faiths of a quasi-religious type. Faith in the theological sense includes everything connected with the secular meaning of the term. But over and above this, it is a response to God as he acts and manifests himself in the world and in human consciousness.",

      "title": "Shame and Other Cases of Modularity without Modules",
      "abstract": "On the surface, self-centred emotions like shame or pride are related to subtle understandings of one's own identity and relevant objects (Taylor 1985; Ben Ze'ev 2000). Changes of beliefs about these objects often result in changes in the related emotions. If I am very proud that, on the first of April, I won the Jacques Chirac Prize for moral philosophy and then realize that it was just an April Fool's joke, my pride will probably vanish. I will probably be ashamed that I believed it. Cases like this support the idea that having beliefs is a necessary condition for feeling pride or shame. If this is true and if we endorse Jerry Fodor's views about modularity, it follows that shame can't be modular because, according to these views, no beliefs or other central mental processes are supposed to be involved in the operation of modules (Fodor 1983). Further, contempt, derision, or avoidance are supposed to be typical causes of shame, but they may trigger other emotions as well: hatred, anger, self-pity, or sadness, etc.",

      "abstract": "Under various circumstances and in different species the outward expression of learning varies considerably, and this has led to the classification of different categories of learning. Just as there is no generally agreed on definition of learning, there is no one system of classification. Types of learning commonly recognized are: Habituation, sensitization, classical conditioning, operant conditioning, trial and error, taste aversion, latent learning, cultural learning, imprinting, insight learning, learning-set learning and instinct. The term memory must include at least two separate processes. It must involve, on the one hand, that of learning something and on the other, at some later date, recalling that thing. What lies between the learning and (he remembering must be some permanent record — a memory trace — within the brain. Memory exists in at least two forms: memory for very recent events (short-term) which is relatively labile and easily disruptable; and long-term memory, which is much more stable. Not everything that gets into short-term memory becomes fixed in the long-term store; a filtering mechanism selects things that might be important and discards the rest.",

      "title": "De gevel – een intermediair element tussen buiten en binnen: Over het tonen en vertonen van het twintigste-eeuwse woongebouw in Nederland",
      "abstract": "This study is based on the fact that all people have a basic need for protection from other people (and animals) as well as from the elements (the exterior climate). People need a space in which they can withdraw from the rest of the world. The two states, inside and outside, public and private, contact with, or isolation from, the outside world, are relevant in fulfilling this basic need. People also want their home to have a certain appearance or status which they can identify with and which they can present to the outside world. This can also often be derived from the façade. The façade which is on a side which can be seen by the general public can be seen by the most people. Protection and appearance/status are two important characteristics of the façade. The term social filtering is used in this study to mean protection and face or mask to mean appearance/status. The means which can be used for protection embrace a broad spectrum, of which a fence, the doorstep (threshold), the door and shutters are just some initial examples. The means which can be used to lend status to a house are just as diverse. It is impossible to make a strict distinction between the means of social filtering and those of the face or mask and they often fulfil both functions. The façade as social filter and as face or mask of the residential building is the starting point of this study. Both the roles, as social filter and face of the home, have undergone great change as a consequence of the accommodation of several homes in the one building. The history of homes in the Netherlands shows that the individual house has only been one of many dwelling possibilities since the nineteenth century ; the ‘stacking’ of homes on top of each other in larger buildings, described as residential building, became a necessity in the cities. This is why this study is focussed on the residential building and its façade in the city in the Netherlands. Two questions formed the starting point for this study: 1. How can information about the need for contact or isolation, and the need for status, be read from the exterior of a house? 2. What happens to the face and the social filter of a building when we no longer look at it as a house for just one social unit but as a residential building which accommodates several homes? The two questions resulted in an investigation into the aspects by which the social filter and the face of a façade can be read. Residential buildings designed as such to meet the demand in cities began to appear more often in the second half of the nineteenth century. Initially, they were cheap and hardly innovative. By the start of the twentieth century, the entrance to homes in the residential building, an important element of the social filter, had become a subject of study for architects and various solutions were developed. The appearance of the residential building showed, on the one hand, pragmatic approaches, but on the other, architects tried to develop a face or mask for this relatively new type of building. Throughout the twentieth century, the period covered by this study, the residential building and its façade have undergone great change. This change reflects the cultural, social, technical and economic factors which have had an effect on the design of the residential building and the significance of the façade with its social filter and its face or mask. Today, the façade of the residential building has reached a freedom which reflects the possibilities, the architect’s creative expression and the client’s commercial needs. The façade hardly contributes to the communication between life outside and the resident and his or her home inside. Social filtering, which often takes place in a dynamic way between the exterior and the interior, is still important, but now takes place to a large degree behind the façade. The face shown is neutral, if not anonymous, and hides the number of homes behind the screen. In order to follow the changes in the residential building and its façade through the twentieth century and to understand with what means architects have developed the façade in particular, the research question has been formulated as: What factors and architectonic means have been decisive in the Netherlands in the twentieth century for the façade of the residential building as an intermediary element (as face/mask and social filter) between the exterior and the interior? The aim of this study is to learn more about the factors which lead to the decisions about the design of a façade and to understand the architectonic means which are applied to make a façade readable. This study also has the aim of providing an analytical approach to looking at a façade and making a contribution to the design of buildings and a broader study of the relationship between buildings and their façades. The study is organised in a theoretical framework and the analysis of ten projects. The theoretical framework in respect of façade, face and mask (chapter 4), a historical context of residential construction (chapter 5), a context of the development of public, exterior living (chapter 6), and private, interior living (chapter 7) are included in the theoretical framework. The analysis of the ten projects is presented in chapter 8. The framework and the analysis form one whole. The analysis of the case studies demanded a method which would illustrate the façade as social filter and face or mask. In order to make the role of social filter more comprehensible, the transition from the public space in front of the main entrance to the entrance to the home has been illustrated by means of two isometric drawings. The public space of the steps from the doorstep or pavement to the private home is also documented in a diagram, and the architectonic resources which make up this transition are recorded with photos. For the analysis of the façade as a face, the parts of the human face which are easily included visually are used metaphorically. The eyes are openings, the mouth is an entrance or door, the nose is a vertical feature, the head shape of the face is the most easily read form of the building and the profile supports the information because it shows depth. Visually striking aspects of the face which protrude, recede, frame or divide can be translated in the façade as, for example, bay windows, balconies, beams, framing lintels or windowsills. Visually distinguishing lines of profiles can be seen in the form of balconies or, for instance, a switch in material. In order to use the metaphor of the human face as the foundation for an analysis in architecture, an analytical framework has been assembled. The Gestalt laws, applied to buildings by Niels Prak, demonstrate how we visually perceive the built environment. The head shape and horizontal and vertical parts and sections are perceived faster than free forms or a complex picture with a lot of different information. These laws justify the choice of the subjects for analysis which have been drawn in a reduced form. The subjects for analysis for the façade as face are: the head shape, the profile, the openings for light and for the entrance (door), visible constructional elements in the façade (horizontal and vertical), decorative parts, protruding and receding parts, material and colour. In the analysis, the sociocultural background of the project will be described, summarised as building assignment, and all the architectonic aspects will be shown which make up the social filter and appearance, summarised as building form. Façade definitions (chapter 4) The term façade means the vertical exterior of the building, just as the face practically vertical is. The roof is governed by its own principles and is not always a part of the façade unless it can be seen. The horizontal roof, like the crown of a head, cannot easily be seen. The term façade carries several meanings. The façade is something that is presented to its surroundings and that is why it is often associated with the face. The term façade (Latin facies = face) makes the connection with the metaphor of the face clear: the façade of the building is meant to be the presentable side which is shown to the public. The human face communicates non-verbally by means of expression. The façade does not have this movement and can only be called a face metaphorically. The façade can still show what happens behind it to a degree, however, what the building is for, for example. The façade can also exhibit an idea or represent an illusion; the façade is then a mask. The term garment is used for both the protective and aesthetic role of the façade. A garment keeps you warm and protects, but it can also be decorative and the status of the person wearing it can be clear if the code included in the decoration is understood. The façade therefore also fulfils this role as the conveyor of information. The degree to which the façade has a filter role is determined by the degree to which it allows things to pass though it: light, air and temperature but also people and animals. This ability to allow things to pass through it is dynamically regulated depending on the means used. Depending on the building’s spatial configuration, there may also be a front façade, rear façade or side façade. The historic context of the residential building (chapter 5) The urban house changed almost imperceptibly until the nineteenth century into a building which accommodated several homes. The construction of the residential building designed as such intensified in the second half of the century, however, when the increasing demand for housing meant that it was necessary to provide more options. The ‘stacking’ of homes in such a building meant another means of entering the building. The immediate entrance to the home increasingly withdrew from the street and communal entrances and stairwells appeared. The most important change from the individual house to the shared building was the entrance. Architects often lent expression the communal entrance, perhaps to help the resident and visitor become more familiar with its new communal aspect. Various changes to the residential building and its façade can be seen throughout the twentieth century. While architects like Hendrik P. Berlage and his followers in the first two decades enriched the façade with details and news ideas for communal entrances arose, functionalists like Willem van Tijen designed residential buildings in the thirties and during the post-war reconstruction which showed what their function was without any embellishment. Architects reacted to social, economic and technical factors. Where the first residential buildings consisted of six to eight homes per staircase per floor, the introduction of galleries and then, in the fifties, the lift, meant that many more homes could be accommodated. This was particularly the case in the sixties after the first wave of post-war reconstruction. The residential buildings were so big that it was barely possible to see the whole form. They were also a product of mass production. The seventies, with the focus on individuality and consultation, saw the production of homes shift towards small-scale neighbourhoods with façades which made small groups of homes readable. The last two decades of the twentieth century were characterised by more sober façades and larger residential buildings. The façades project neutrality and the anonymity of living in the town or city. The diversity of the façades and the choice of material have increased dramatically and are also used to express the luxury of living in the city. The façade and the public (chapter 6) The gradual transition from street to house in the town or city in the Netherlands has been present for centuries. The border between the two was vague, people worked both in front of, and in the house. An important change for living in the town or city was the disappearance of city walls and gates after 1874 as a consequence of the vestigingswet [‘Settlement Act’], which allowed non-residents into the city or town without checks, and when the front door was established as the border between the public and the private. The façade became a necessary border between the public and the private. The street lost its importance as public space for those living on it as traffic increased. The introduction of the residential building only increased the distance to the street. The anonymization of the street also played a large role throughout the whole of the twentieth century. The functionalists rejected the street and wanted to connect homes with recreation and green spaces. Urban blocks of buildings were opened up as was the layout of residential buildings. This resulted in residential buildings which had several façades which were visible to the public. In the seventies, some architects, like Herman Hertzberger, returned the street to the resident and a pedestrian friendly zone in front of homes (the woonerf) was created. The house façades on the residential areas allowed openness and space to be seen, fusing the public and the private. This approach was quickly followed by a reintroduction of a distance to the street. The last two decades of the twentieth century were characterised by a withdrawal of the social filter role to behind the façade. The street’s role as part of the home can only be found in very protected environments. The façade and private living (chapter 7) Private living was initially led by an increasing embarrassment and hygiene. The need to retreat further into the house gave rise to a more differentiated layout even in the traditional house and this can be read from the façade. In the second half of the nineteenth century, the privacy of the home was lost when it was housed with several others in the one building and by the internal entrance in a relatively open landing on the upper floors. The first two decades of the twentieth century saw various entrances which made privacy possible such as the entrance stairwell and the gallery. The homes received their own front doors with a hall behind them. At subsistence level, privacy was reduced to a very small space and this would only change after the Second World War; regulations for minimum surface areas in the fifties contributed to this. Economic growth in the sixties and seventies allowed a need for individual development and private space within the family. Increasing preferences for homes resulted in a greater diversity but also in neutral houses which could be adapted. The façade reflects this. Privacy at the end of the twentieth century meant freedom of choice. The residential building showed the consideration for this freedom in a neutral façade. The case studies (chapter 8) The case studies reflect the various phases of the changes in the residential building and its façade. The ten projects chosen can be found in the Dutch town or city and have all been designed as homes.

Berlage 1918-22 – Justus van Effen Complex, Rotterdam, architect M. Brinkman 1925–26 – Residential building Oldenhoeck, Amsterdam, architect P.A.

Hertzberger 1994–98 – City block De Landtong, Rotterdam, architect CIE, F. van Dongen The first two cases just have six to eight homes per staircase per floor and their entrances are richly decorated while the Justus van Effencomplex and, in the sixties, Het Breed project with a gallery bring many more homes together and their entrances are less expressively designed. At the end of the twentieth century, the Landtong connects the homes visually with each other by means of an internal corridor with a void allowing the other floors to be seen. The expression of the collective and the individual through the century is very different; the home cannot always be read from the façade. Conclusion The most important conclusion from this research is that the social filter between the public and the private today often lies behind the screens, so that the transition between the public space and the façade is less gradual and the expressiveness of the façade is different and achieved by other means. The façade is more of a mask to protect the anonymous home than a face that exhibits it. The line between a façade as a face or a mask is not always clear, however, because the perspective of the person looking at it can change. A façade can create an illusion in the distance, but show the home from close by.This study demonstrates the development of the residential building and its façade in the Netherlands with the focus on their development in the twentieth century. The relationship of the façade with the immediate public space surrounding the home and the relationship of the façade with the private home have been important starting points for this study. It places the façade as an important element in protecting the home and as well as an expression of it. The study demonstrates a way of looking at the façade which is very important for design decisions for new construction but also for maintenance and conservation.",

      "abstract": "The making of, any mark upon any surface by direct human agency, as a means of communicating information to a fellow-man, is (in a broad sense) handwriting; this may include engrossing and drawing, and even painting. Nevertheless, in its popular acceptation, the term is limited to that form of freely written characters usually adopted by one person in sending messages to another person. In its restricted sense, therefore, handwriting may be considered as the written speech of the individual; like his oral efforts-and, indeed, like his every act-it soon becomes impressed with characteristics peculiar to himself, and tending to differentiate him from all other individuals. This establishes for him a customary and distinctive style, in writing, which may be more or less varied, from time to time, by accidental causes, such as haste, carelessness, position in writing, excitement, weakness, or disease. A writer's style gradually becomes so much a part of his nature that the physical act of writing is then scarcely a conscious effort on his part, but is rather an automatic production, resulting from his mere mental determination to write. This almost unconscious production includes (inter alia) two distinct parts, viz.: the physical method of performing the act, and the pictorial forms resulting from such performance; of these two divisions, ordinarily but few of the details of the first are (or can be) known to the person using them, and many of the details of the second are also unknown to him.",

And it is not uncommon for such people to argue against the destruction of human embryos by invoking the claim that the destruction of human embryos is morally on par with killing the following humans: (A) the standard infant, (B) the suicidal teenager, (C) the temporarily comatose individual, and (D) the standard adult. I argue here that this claim is false and do so as follows. First, I provide an account of the prima facie wrongness of killing individuals (A) – (D). Briefly, I contend that individuals (A) – (D) have a certain property in common, that of having a future of value. An individual who has a future of value has the potential to (i) value goods of consciousness when he will (or would) experience them and (ii) do so as a psychologically continuous individual.",

      "abstract": "Animals are amongst the most vulnerable of all sentient beings. Animal neglect and abuse may involve a single animal and one person, or hundreds of animals and many people. Animals and people are victims of the same types of fatal injury and severe neglect; however, the anatomy and physiology of different animal species and even breeds of animals are a unique challenge for veterinary pathologists. Identifying and describing external lesions of blunt force trauma and projectile wounds requires that the entire skin be reflected from the animal because fur and feathers partially or totally mask the injuries. Because quadrupeds or birds may react differently to the same traumatic force applied to bipedal humans, extrapolating from medical forensic pathology must be done with caution. Animal abuse, however, does not occur in a vacuum. An established link exists between animal abuse, interpersonal violence, and other serious crimes. Using examples, this paper describes specific injuries in abused and neglected animals in the context of domestic violence, interpersonal violence, mental illness, and drug addiction. Medical examiners should be aware that animal abuse affects not only the animal, but individuals, families, and society as a whole.",

Only when the ‘reductive’ explanation is (1) treated as excluding others, and (2) so chosen as to make a moral point by illicit means. (1) is never legitimate; different kinds of explanation all have their place and do not compete. It is made to look plausible by (2), which can occur in many situations, but is usually called reduction only when it involves the physical sciences. Two different dangers follow—reduction to the unknown entities of physics is chilling, but fortunately seems to have no particular moral consequences. Biological reductions often sound less remote; e.g. when sociobiologists talk of people as ‘survival machines’ for genes. The trouble here is not ‘biological determinism’ but fatalism, with apparent moral consequences, namely, the endorsement of universal competition. This idea is bad biology, compounded by illicit rhetoric. Biology itself cannot be a threat. The biological causes of human behaviour, including those found by sociobiologists in their calmer moments, are perfectly proper material for the social sciences.",

      "title": "Is There an Ocular Self",
      "abstract": "Whenever we refer to ourselves by means of token-reflexive pronouns, ‘I’ in case of English, the problem is that we tend to assume it yields the same referent both for the narrator and the narratee. But the fact is that the subject is a subject to, and of, others; in fact, it is often an ‘Other’ to others, which also affects its sense of its own subjectivity. Second, the subject is also a subject of knowledge, most familiarly perhaps of the discourse of social institutions that circumscribe its terms of being. Third, the subject is a body that is separate (except for those pregnant) from other (non-)human bodies; and the body, and therefore the subject, is closely dependent upon its physical/cultural environment. The problem with consciousness is that it, unlike all other states, viz. the physical, chemical, biological etc., can be known from the inside as well as from the outside, which is to say some knowledge about ‘I’ is amenable to myself only, while some others to others.This paper examines the ‘gap’ in the dichotomy between the Self been thought of as Heideggerian Dasein – the resolute way of emerging from the anonymity of the mass of ‘they’ – and, as the changing but distilled core of essentially embodied experiences. Now that we are all ‘cyborgs’ (c.f. Harraway) and ‘quasi-objects’ (c.f. Latour), is object-oriented ontologizing of the Self the answer to reducing the Self to objective, non-culturally embedded, neuro-biological generalizables based on a bundle of corporal matter(s)? The Self is not material, but understandably material-dependent. Again, the Self is not entirely subjective/experiential either, but understandably conditioned upon embodied experiences. In that case, the paper speculates the (im)plausibility of an ocular Self: the impact of the ocular on (the materiality of) the Self.",

      "abstract": "Abstract : The use of the term stress in behavioral and biological sciences probably derives from the physical sciences, where usage has specified that stress is a force which is exerted on some system in such fashion as to deform, alter or damage the structure of that system, while the resulting deformation is described as strain. The stress-strain concepts are thus relatel in stimulus-response fashion. In our fields, there is no ready agreement on formal definition, but a common sense emerges as to the phenom- ena under consideration. There are statements which define stress in terms of stimulus properties; others in terms of particular responses; and other definitions in interactional terms. Perhaps the simplest way out of a definitional conflict is to assert that stress -- as noun -- describes an organismic state. Those events which provoke it are stress situations (or stimuli); the resulting behavioral alterations which occur are stress reactions.",

      "title": "Moved by Emotions: Affective Concepts Representing Personal Life Events Induce Freely Performed Steps in Line With Combined Sagittal and Lateral Space-Valence Associations",
      "abstract": "Embodiment approaches to cognition and emotion have put forth the idea that the way we think and talk about affective events often recruits spatial information that stems, to some extent, from our bodily experiences. For example, metaphorical expressions such as \"being someone's right hand\" or \"leaving something bad behind\" convey affectivity associated with the lateral and sagittal dimensions of space. Action tendencies associated with affect such as the directional fluency of hand movements (dominant right hand-side - positive; non-dominant left hand-side - negative) and approach-avoidance behaviors (forward - positive; backwards - negative) might be mechanisms supporting such associations. Against this background, experimental research has investigated whether positive and negative words are freely allocated into space (e.g., close or far from one's body) or resonate with congruent (vs. incongruent) predefined manual actions usually performed by joysticks or button presses (e.g., positive - right; negative - left, or vice versa). However, to date, it is unclear how the processing of affective concepts resonate with directional actions of the whole body, the more if such actions are performed freely within a context enabling both, lateral and sagittal movements. Accordingly, 67 right-handed participants were to freely step on an 8-response pad (front, back, right, left, front-right, front-left, back-right, or back-left) after being presented in front of them valence-laden personal life-events submitted before the task (e.g., words or sentences such as \"graduation\" or \"birth of a child\"). The most revealing finding of this study indicates that approach-avoidance behaviors and space-valence associations across laterality are interwoven during whole body step actions: Positive events induced steps highly biased to front-right whereas negative events induced steps highly biased to back-left.",

      "title": "Eating and the brain: Food for thought",
      "abstract": "Event Abstract Back to Event Eating and the brain: Food for thought Per Møller1 1 University of Copenhagen, Faculty of Science, Denmark Eating and drinking are, together with breathing and sexual activity, the most important human behaviours. Even though the fundamental reason why we (need to) eat is to supply energy and nutrients to the body and brain, macro- and micro-nutrients are not sensed directly. What we sense directly is the “taste of foods” or more precisely their flavours. Four different senses, taste, smell, touch and chemesthesis (perception of hot spices, pain) contribute to flavour, with vision and audition occasionally modulating what we perceive when we eat. The sense of smell increases enormously the dimensionality of the perceptual space defined by the 5 basic tastes (sweet, salty, bitter, sour and umami) and chemesthesis, since the human olfactory system can distinguish an almost infinite number of (food) aromas/smells. Our brains solve a major multisensory binding problem when we experience the “taste” of our food and drink. We don’t all like the same foods. Why is that? People in Korea like different foods than people in Greece etc. Only very few food preferences are genetically determined. Most notably, all humans seem to be born liking sweet and fat tastes. This is a ‘clever trick’ of nature, or put differently, humans would be in great trouble if this wasn’t the case, considering the taste of the food we all lived from the first half year of our life. There is one taste humans are born with a strong dislike for: bitter. As with sweet and fatty tastes, this makes much developmental sense, since many poisonous plants in nature taste bitter. We need to ‘learn’ to appreciate bitter tastes. This explains why you didn’t enjoy the first beer you drank or why many young people drink their coffee with sugar and cream. If the overwhelming majority of what we like or accept to eat is not genetically determined, it must be learned. This also explains the very many different culinary traditions in the world and why the human species has been very successful in spreading all over the world. We can live anywhere and eat what nature has to offer wherever we are. This is unlike the Panda bear, who can only live from bamboo! In humans, a range of conditional learning mechanisms shape which foods we like and accept. Since eating is crucial for survival, very strong motivational mechanisms control intake. Food reward (liking, wanting, satisfaction) relies on similar mechanisms as some types of (unwanted) addictions. It has been argued that reward obtained from eating is to a large extent responsible for the obesity epidemic. It might appear intuitively obvious that people eat more of a food if it tastes well. Or it might be the other way around, that if foods are bland, we don’t get enough satisfaction from eating and as a result eat larger portions. Some recent studies of food reward suggest that food satisfaction might be the solution, not the problem, in curbing overeating. That is, that ‘food quality’ can replace ‘food quantity’. Eating behaviour raises many basic and applied neuroscientific problems in perception, cognition and emotion. In this way, it can act as a vehicle for better understanding of the workings of the brain.

      "abstract": "The origin of the concept of stress in biology and medicine is unknown. Investigations of stress rise from the recognition by Claude Bernard in 1878 that all living processes exist in a \"milieu intériuer.\" Walter Cannon elucidated the mechanisms of maintaining physiological factors within certain limits and coined the term \"homeostasis.\" As the homeostasis is constantly threatened by internal or external adverse factors, stressors, stress is usually defined as a state of threatened homeostasis. There are physical stressors such as cold, trauma, fever, and infection; psychological stressors such as social subordination, anxiety, and depression. The individual reaction to such stressors is highly dependent on the stressful stimulus, as well as the capability to habituate or adapt to the situation, so-called coping (1).",

      "title": "SOME PHYSIOLOGICAL CHANGES DURING FRUSTRATION1",
      "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to determine what physiological changes occurred during experimental frustration and to correlate these changes with measures of the individual's adjustive pattern. The measures of physiological changes are most valuable because they give absolute and objective measures of emotional reactions. The concept of the role of frustration in the determination of behavior, both normal and abnormal, has been accepted by most psychologists. It is generally assumed that frustration is accompanied by physiological tensions and that these tensions are essentially emotional in nature. In normal emotional behavior the tensions, which include visceral and skeletal activity, disappear within a relatively short time, that is, as soon as overt or covert activity re-establishes equilibrium. In situations of frustration, however, the tensions are more severe and prolonged because of the lack of solution of the frustrating problem. The overt activity of an individual in one situation is determined by his past behavior in similar situations. Physiological activity, on the other hand, is not entirely dependent on past experience; thus it is relatively similar in different individuals. Because of this relative internal consistency, physiological processes are probably a better measure of the individual reactions to frustration than are the more variable overt responses. The tensions resulting from frustration lead to overt or covert activity, but the form of this activity is socially determined. In this respect the physiological tensions are motivators of activity but they do not determine the form of the behavior.",

      "abstract": "This paper addresses the nature of pathologization in general and the pathologization of love in therapeutic care in particular. “Pathologized or pathologization[u1] ,” means an event, person, action, thought, feeling, or circumstance that is de-valuated as “less than,” as compromised or broken, and unwittingly (ironically, in the name of love) demeaned, belittled, ignored, jettisoned or ostracized for its not-enough-ness, its incorrectness, or its inadequacy in light of rank-ordered scales of measured worth. The pathologist presumes an essentialist hegemony [ctsq2] should be healthy love, consequentiality, views any expression less than this prescription as a privation or pathologization of healthy love, and is thus immature, ill, or unethical. Common ways therapists pathologize love in therapeutic space include the use of a modified against nature argument; which today is reframed as an against the status quo argument. The use of inflection and body language that communicates disapproval are, enacting[u3] ideologies of deficit-correction that inherently stigmatize, interpreting expressions of love “as other than it is,” or, “as nothing but something else,” such as adoration interpreted as really dependency or teenaged pining as merely raging hormones. Essentialist rank-ordered scaling inherent in these forms of pathologization is deconstructed, then explored in terms of the impact of this deconstruction in therapeutic care. The essay is concluded[u4] with suggestions of how to care for expressions of love in non-pathologizing ways within therapeutic space.",

      "title": "Retinal vessel tree as biometric pattern",
      "abstract": "In current society, reliable authentication and authorization of individuals are becoming more and more necessary tasks for everyday activities or applications. Just for instance, common situations such as accessing to a building restricted to authorized people (members, workers,...), taking a flight or performing a money transfer require the verification of the identity of the individual trying to perform these tasks. When considering automation of the identity verification, the most challenging aspect is the need of high accuracy, in terms of avoiding incorrect authorizations or rejections. While the user should not be denied to perform a task if authorized, he/she should be also ideally inconvenienced to a minimum which further complicates the whole verification process Siguenza Pizarro & Tapiador Mateos (2005). With this scope in mind, the term biometrics refers to identifying an individual based on his/her distinguished intrinsic characteristics. Particularly, this characteristics usually consist of physiological or behavioral features. Physiological features, such as fingerprints, are physical characteristics usually measured at a particular point of time. Behavioral characteristics, such as speech or handwriting, make reference to the way some action is performed by every individual. As they characterize a particular activity, behavioral biometrics are usually measured over time and are more dependant on the individual’s state of mind or deliberated alteration. To reinforce the active versus passive idea of both paradigms, physiological biometrics are also usually referred to as static biometrics while behavioral ones are referred to as dynamic biometrics. The traditional authentication systems based on possessions or knowledge are widely spread in the society but they have many drawbacks that biometrics try to overcome. For instance, in the scope of the knowledge-based authentication, it is well known that password systems are vulnerable mainly due to the wrong use of users and administrators. It is not rare to find some administrators sharing the same password, or users giving away their own to other people. One of the most common problems is the use of easily discovered passwords (child names, birth dates, car plate,...). On the other hand, the use of sophisticated passwords consisting of numbers, upper and lower case letters and even punctuation marks makes it harder to remember them for an user. Nevertheless, the password systems are easily broken by the use of brute forcewhere powerful computers generate all the possible combinations and test it against the authentication system. In the scope of the possession-based authentication, it is obvious that the main concerns are 6",

      "abstract": "Direct reciprocity, indirect reciprocity, and reputation are important interrelated topics in the evolution of sociality. This non-mathematical review is a summary of each. Direct reciprocity (the positive kind) has a straightforward structure (e.g., “A rewards B, then B rewards A”) but the allocation might differ from the process that enabled it (e.g., whether it is true reciprocity or some form of mutualism). Indirect reciprocity (the positive kind) occurs when person (B) is rewarded by a third party (A) after doing a good deed towards somebody else (C) — with the structure “A observes B help C, therefore A helps B.” Here too, the allocation differs from the process: if there is underlying cognition, then indirect reciprocity is based on some ability to keep track of the reputations of others (to remember that “B helped C”). Reputation is a kind of social impression based on typicality, derived from three channels of experience (direct encounters, bystander observation, and gossip). Although non-human animals cannot gossip verbally, they can eavesdrop on third parties and learn vicariously. This paper ends with a proposal to investigate the topic of social expertise as a model for understanding how animals understand and utilise observed information within their social groups.",

Here we focus on a different structural feature, their connection to a person's self-concept. In 6 studies, we predict and find that people's most enduring regrets stem more often from discrepancies between their actual and ideal selves than their actual and ought selves. We also provide evidence that this asymmetry is at least partly due to differences in how people cope with regret. People are quicker to take steps to cope with failures to live up to their duties and responsibilities (ought-related regrets) than their failures to live up to their goals and aspirations (ideal-related regrets). As a consequence, ideal-related regrets are more likely to remain unresolved, leaving people more likely to regret not being all they could have been more than all they should have been.

As the material self cannot be disentangled from networks that are simultaneously economic, political, cultural, scientific, and substantial, what was once the ostensibly bounded human subject finds herself in a swirling landscape of uncertainty where practices and actions that were once not even remotely ethical or political matters suddenly become so. Trans-corporeality is a new materialist and posthumanist sense of the human as substantially and perpetually interconnected with the flows of substances and the agencies of environments. Activists, as well as everyday practitioners of environmental, environmental health, environmental justice, and climate change movements, work to reveal and reshape the flows of material agencies across regions, environments, animal bodies, and human bodies—even as global capitalism and the medical–industrial complex reassert a more convenient ideology of solidly bounded, individual consumers and benign, discrete products. Even though the recognition of trans-corporeality begins with human bodies in their environments, tracing substantial interchanges renders the human permeable, dissolving stable outlines. Tracing these connections discourages us from taking refuge in the fantasies of transcendence and imperviousness that make environmentalism a merely elective and external enterprise.",

Protection of the environment is therefore only a means to an end — this means that if there were alternative and less painful ways to achieve the same goal, then we might opt for those other ways to preserve humankind. The aesthetic approach, on the other hand, treats environmental protection as an end in itself. This is because certain aesthetic moods, feelings, or mental states can only be created by the objects we attend to; these objects (in this case the natural environment) are therefore unique, and their destruction must mean that we can no longer enjoy that peculiar feeling which it (and on ly it) will evoke.",

Beside changes of external fortune (victory, poverty, freedom, power, etc.), man is subject to changes in his own person, different states of body and mind. The narrow band is more fitted to inescapable outward fortune or to hampering of body or mind, the wide band or cloak, wrapping, to more pervasive states of body or mind.

It may signal aggresive or dominating intent, as in a staredown, or it may convey an impression of close bonding, intimacy, or a request for aid, depending on how actors define the situation. Some theories of nonverbal communication assume that mutual gaze is physiologically arousing and that this arousal accounts in part for the efficacy of eye contact as a communication channel. The first experiment reported here shows that mutual gaze does indeed cause more physiological arousal than control conditions of nonmutual gaze. The second experiment demonstrates that an actor can communicate with another person by gazing in such a manner that he can manipulate that person's physiology. A third experiment demonstrates that a subject's response to a mutual gaze is a good predictor of his or her degree of influence (dominance) in subsequent social interaction. These results emphasize the rapid emergence of status differentiation in face-to-face interaction between strangers.",

      "abstract": "Synergy (from the Greek word synergos), broadly defined, refers to combined or co-operative effects produced by two or more elements (parts or individuals). The definition is often associated with the holistic conviction quote that \"the whole is greater than the sum of its parts\" (Aristotle, in Metaphysics), or the whole cannot exceed the sum of the energies invested in each of its parts (e.g. first law of thermodynamics) even if it is more accurate to say that the functional effects produced by wholes are different from what the parts can produce alone. Synergy is a ubiquitous phenomena in nature and human societies alike. One well know example is provided by the emergence of self-organization in social insects, via direct or indirect interactions. The latter types are more subtle and defined as stigmergy to explain task coordination and regulation in the context of nest reconstruction in termites. An example, could be provided by two individuals, who interact indirectly when one of them modifies the environment and the other responds to the new environment at a later time. In other words, stigmergy could be defined as a particular case of environmental or spatial synergy. The system is purely holistic, and their properties are intrinsically emergent and autocatalytic. On the present work we present a \"machine\" where there is no precommitment to any particular representational scheme: the desired behaviour is distributed and roughly specified simultaneously among many parts, but there is minimal specification of the mechanism required to generate that behaviour, i.e. the global behaviour evolves from the many relations of multiple simple behaviours.",

There are two important points Goody conveys here. First, doubt – that is, reluctance or resistance to adopt received wisdom (see Box 53.1) – exists in all societies. Second, doubt does not exclusively spring from some internal faculty, but rather is the output of a complex set of inputs to an organism that produces, manipulates, and transmits ideas. In other words, doubt emerges as the product of a systemic process. One implication of this view is that doubt can express itself differently across contexts; if humans' social and natural environments vary, it follows that doubt – as rising from their interaction – should exhibit itself in a corresponding fashion.",

Although this tripartite division is arbitrary and, therefore, not imposed by the nature of logic or by the nature of things, most of the basic philosophical questions can be brought under one or another of these three generic problems. Epistemology, as a division of the field of philosophy, is concerned with man as a knowing or would-be knowing creature. If men did not wish to know, if men did not make cognitive claims of one kind or another, or if men were not aware of cognitive wishes or cognitive claims, then for philosophers there would be no epistemological problems. Not only do men exist, but men are capable of making cognitive claims, or so it would appear; and thus the epistemologist finds himself with a subject-matter. The epistemologist raises, with respect to this whole matter of actual or possible cognition, at least three fundamental questions: (1) Is human knowledge possible, or is what we call knowledge indistinguishable, in principle, from what we would otherwise call opinion, belief, or conviction? (2) If human knowledge is possible, what are its sources and by what marks, standards, criteria, or methods do we distinguish between what we call knowledge and what we do not or should not call knowledge?

The idea has come to be applied to conditions (that is, physical, environmental, and social status or circumstances) rather than resources and to specific and not only general circumstances, and therefore can be distinguished from the concept of poverty. The former sure enough can't be context free; it applies to specific circumstances and physical, environmental, and social conditions. Material deprivation is a complex phenomenon, as it concerns multiple aspects of reality and can be measured in different ways. In this paper, our aim is to highlight the most important elements of deprivation, as well as the analytical assumptions (often underlying and overlooked) that constitute the cornerstone of his study.",

Subjects selected their attributions from a menu that included religious causal agents (God, Satan), several naturalistic causes (e.g., the protagonist's characteristics, other actors), and nonreligious-supernaturalistic causes (fate, luck). As predicted, attributions to God were most commonly made when the event was a life-altering occurrence having positive consequences. Attributions to Satan, rarely made, were prompted by life-altering events having negative consequences. As for whether subjects exhibited a God-of-the-gaps pattern of causal reasoning, the evidence was mixed but tended to support the conclusion that they did not.",

In this essay, we show that unrecognised cultural phenomena are sustained by a special form of indirect social learning (ISL). ISL occurs when an individual B learns a behaviour from an individual A through something produced by A. A’s behavioural products can be chemicals, artefacts, but also, we argue, behaviours of another group or species that are the consequence of A’s actions. For instance, a behaviour—guiding a blind person—can be transmitted from dog A to dog B, because the fact that dog A learns the behaviour creates in the mind of the trainer representations about the efficacy of the training practice that can be transmitted to another human, who can then train dog B. These dog behaviours have all the properties of standard cultural behaviours and spread in some dog populations through the exploitation of the social learning capacities of another group/species. Following this idea requires a change in perspective on how we see the social transmission of behaviours and brings forward the fact that certain cultural practices can spread among animals through a cultural co-evolutionary dynamic with humans or other animals.",

      "abstract": "Human being can be defined in several ways. These are biological, psychological, social and religious, ethical and philosophical aspects. The first two viewpoints refers to the intrapersonal aspects and the last two viewpoints deals with the interpersonal aspects. There have been numerous thoeries and hypotheses to explain the human behavior and psychopathology, but the author does not find any theory or hypothesis to integrate the biological and psychological viewpoints. In addition, The author does not find any theory to integrate the intrapersonal and interpersonal aspects in interpersonal relationships. Thus, the author proposed one model to explain the human behavior. In proposing this theory, the author has the following hypotheses：1) All human being can not exist by oneself. 2) The ultimate goal of all human being is to achieve 'Survival'. 3) There are four kinds of survivals and they are biological, psychological, social and religious, ethical and philosophical survivals. 4) Power and control are two prerequisites for survival and there are four kinds of power and control. 5) The four elements of power and control are biological, psychological, internal and external ones. 6) The conflict between buman being can also be explained in terms of power, control and survival. 7) Normality and abnormality of human behavior can be explained in terms of the harmony and balance among the powers and controls.",

Individuals who experience presence may feel as if they are located in or connected with others in the medium as if it were real life. People may experience different types of presence, including social presence, spatial presence, and self‐presence. Social presence refers to a sense of interacting with another entity (person or virtual reality character), fostering feelings of togetherness. Spatial presence positions individuals within the mediated environment as though they were actually there. Finally, self‐presence occurs when an individual assumes the role of the character or avatar as if it were themselves. Although the term presence is most frequently used for virtual reality and video games, presence or immersion can be experienced across a wide variety of mediums such as books and movies.",

To identify is to allow discrimination — friend or foe? — the former classification being non-dangerous (potentially unharmful), the latter classification being dangerous (potentially harmful). For this, friend and foe must have distinguishable characters and the organism must both detect these characters, and know which characters are likely to associate with non-danger (friend) and which characters are likely to associate with danger (foe). After this discrimination, there must then be a response (either non-alarm, or alarm) that, in turn, would Icad to a variety of other responses of an adaptive nature (e.g. escape from, or destroy, the foe).",

      "abstract": "People are fundamentally social beings and enjoy connecting with others. Sometimes, people reach out to others-whether simply to check-in on how others are doing with brief messages or to show that they are thinking of others by sending small gifts to them. Yet, despite the importance and enjoyment of social connection, do people accurately understand how much other people value being reached out to by someone in their social circle? Across a series of preregistered experiments, we document a robust underestimation of how much other people appreciate being reached out to. We find evidence compatible with an account wherein one reason this underestimation of appreciation occurs is because responders (vs. initiators) are more focused on their feelings of surprise at being reached out to. A focus on feelings of surprise in turn predicts greater appreciation. We further identify process-consistent moderators of the underestimation of reach-out appreciation, finding that it is magnified when the reach-out context is more surprising: when it occurs within a surprising (vs. unsurprising) context for the recipient and when it occurs between more socially distant (vs. socially close) others. Altogether, this research thus identifies when and why we underestimate how much other people appreciate us reaching out to them, implicating a heightened focus on feelings of surprise as one underlying explanation.

      "title": "Splash - Eye movements during unexpected material behaviors",
      "abstract": "To anticipate sudden actions in our environment is an important ability based on prior knowledge and experience. Anticipation and prediction allow the visual oculomotor system to reduce inherent sensory processing delays and to produce eye movements to the right location at the right time to optimize sampling of visual information. Most events follow predictable patterns in space and time, but not everything is predictable. Over our lifetime we have learned, what to expect when objects made from different material are exposed to different forces (Alley et al., 2020). But how does visual sampling behavior change if the associations of material properties are violated? We compare eye movements of 14 observers while watching movies which showed eight familiar everyday objects (e.g., chair or teacup) falling from a fixed distance to the ground floor in a virtual room. Upon impact, objects showed either expected or surprising material deformations. For example, a falling chair could tip over but stay solid (expected) or it could splash like milk into little droplets and splatter on the ground (surprising). To test the effect of context cues, and therefore the strength of expectations about an object’s material properties, objects either appeared with the look of their typical optical material properties (rendered) in a natural room or as white high contrast shapes in front of a black background. We found that in the surprise-condition eye movement patterns deviated systematically: after the impact initial fixations were shorter but the next fixations were prolonged and located closer to the object center compared to the fixation pattern of the expected condition. This effect on fixation behavior was stronger for the rendered objects. Therefore, when confronted with unexpected material behavior eye movement strategies are rapidly adapted to maximize information about the material behavior of the object.",

Aims are broad or general statements of what you would like to achieve.Animism is the tendency to give life-like qualities to non-living things.Anonymity means not sharing someone's name.If you keep a reflective diary or write documents at work, you may be expected to anonymise your papers by using fake names, for example.Anti-discriminatory practice is a way of working that aims to challenge and diminish the causes and impact of discrimination.ix Anti-oppressive practice is a way of working that aims to reduce the structural, personal and cultural systems that create oppression.Assimilation is part of Piaget's theory of cognitive development and refers to the adaptation process that takes place when we are introduced to new ideas or experiences: instead of changing completely to accommodate the information into our ideas and schemas, we subjectively modify the information in order to fit in with our already existing ideas and schemas.Association is a term used most often by youth workers.It aims to highlight the importance of young people having a space to go to 'hang out' with their peers and some key professionals as well as to learn and engage with activities.Attachment theory is the theory that concerns the attachment between one person and another.An au pair is a young person who normally comes from a different country in order to help with childcare and housework in exchange for pocket money, food and board.Bilingual means the ability to speak two languages.A bilingual person may not necessarily be as competent in both languages.Biological construction is the notion that, for example, gender is a biological or natural occurrence.You can see the gender of someone; it is therefore determined by nature rather than made by humankind (socially constructed).Black and minority ethnic (BME) is a term used to describe people from minority groups.Minority groups within the UK consist of people who would not describe themselves as 'White British'.Boundaries determine the limits that you can go to.It gives a dividing line that should not be crossed.This dividing line separates the personal from the professional.",

      "title": "ON THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN INDIVIDUAL AND SCIENTIFIC CONCEPTS ABOUT HUMAN IN CONNECTION WITH INCREASING DIFFICULTY OF PATIENT CARE. INTRODUCTION",
      "abstract": "Ideas about a person help you understand or explain your own actions or the actions of others. Individual and scientific images of a person are transmitted through upbringing and education, possibly also through \"genetic\" memory. These images of people form the structure of human perception. Human actions are ultimately based on this perception. Thinking about one's own image of a person and deciphering other people's images of a person always have a reductionist character. This may explain why action-oriented disciplines such as a doctor, psychologist or nurse have a specific view of the person. The successes of individual scientific disciplines are the result of a deep division, or rather, the dismemberment of the whole in order to supposedly better explain or understand a person. But putting the pieces back together is often overlooked. The process of disassembling or deepening and thus constantly recognizing the essence of a person is an ongoing task. However, people often make decisions against the background of current (everyday) observations. But this also means that before making decisions for the future, we must think in advance about their consequences for a person. The formulation of such foresight or scenarios of the future must be made on the basis of the perception of the entire human being, and not only take into account the consequences for partial concepts of the human being. In the health care system, patients, professions and institutions meet each other. These professions, equipped, by the way, with an excellent repertoire of scientific discoveries made for humanity within the framework of individual sciences, are faced precisely for this reason with conflicting images and perspectives of humanity. The latter influence practical actions. Parallel to this, a growing individualization of therapeutic therapies can be observed in practice. This increases the complexity of the activity. It also means the development or, rather, a clearer differentiation of subjects into specialists and generalists. In other words, we are talking about processes based on the division of labor, in which the specialist receives a higher status in terms of competence in decision-making, economics and social power. The article examines the subjective orientation in the treatment of diseases and the need for care, the consequences of a supra-institutional perspective of therapeutic processes and the solution of the problem of divergence of competencies and interests of actors through the perspective of a person in his essential unity.",

      "abstract": "The aesthetic appearance of beauty is intertwined with the experience of looking: and this opens up exciting paths for us to explore within the space of the complex dimensions of learning. The act of “taking something of beauty” (or something related to beauty, including its opposites) is driven by curiosity and desire but accompanied by a sense of fear and paralysis; that which attracts us may become monstruously or terribly beautiful, or – to draw on the lexicon of excess associated with beauty – “too beautiful”. There is a sort of unsustainability inherent in beauty. This text explores the dimension of envy, so understood, starting from its ethical declension, bordering with the dimension of justice; in this case, envious glance is rather a questioning look; it wonders, that's to say, how the merit of other's success happened. Envy produces questioning not as about the effects, as about processes. But often the destroying power of the envious glance reaches instead the need of an act of power (a visual one or trough the vision) of the action of other's beauty. It may be the subject of the educational relationship or the subject of learning. These declensions of the envious glance are analysed starting from literature, from myth and from the iconography connected to the power of looking.",

Although these selves are rarely experienced as distinct (because they are held together by specific forms of stimulus information), they differ in their developmental histories, in the accuracy with which we can know them, in the pathologies to which they are subject, and generally in what they contribute to human experience.",

This is borne out by everyday clinical experience. A person may be at one moment conscious of one thing and at another moment conscious of another, but on each occasion he is equally conscious. Moreover, the content of consciousness may be impaired by disease, as when a patient loses part of a visual field or sensation over part of the body. Nevertheless, such a person remains fully conscious. On the other hand, a person may be completely unconscious, and between full consciousness and unconsciousness there are states in which he is partially conscious, that is, he has some degree of awareness of his surroundings, but it is incomplete.",

      "title": "Bioethicists must rethink the concept of death: the idea of brain death is not appropriate for cryopreservation",
      "abstract": "Death has historically been believed to be an event that coincided with the onset of clinical death. It is now understood that death is a series of physical events, not a single event, and that the determination of permanent death is dependent on other factors beyond the simple cessation of breathing and heartbeat. We may need to accept the concept of the life cycle assessment introduced by nanotechnology or astrobiology, a process that is often called transhumanism (1). Cryopreservation is the use of antifreezing solutions and proteins or cryoprotectants and cooling to very low temperatures for the long-term storage of human bodies, animals, organs or tissues, typically at liquid nitrogen temperatures (-196˚C). Cryopreservation is not freezing. At these low temperatures, any biological activity, including biochemical reactions that would lead to cell death, is effectively stopped. However, when cryoprotectant solutions are not used, the cells being preserved are often damaged when approaching low temperatures in the freezing process or when being warmed to room temperature. To be biologically useful, cryoprotectants must easily penetrate the cells and not be toxic to them. Cryopreservation is used for embryo storage, for example, when in vitro fertilization has produced more embryos than are needed at a given time. Semen can be successfully used almost indefinitely after cryopreservation, with successful storage reported for as long as 21 years. Oocyte cryopreservation is a new technology in which eggs are extracted, frozen, and stored. They may later be thawed, fertilized, and transferred to the uterus as embryos. As of 2010, there were more than 200 people in cryogenic storage, all of them in the United States or Russia. Most are stored in the Alcor and the Cryonics Institute, but more than ten are in Russia, and two are in Trans Time. All modern cryonics organizations require full payment for all future costs associated with storage ‘‘in perpetuity’’ before patient cryostorage. The costs of cryonics vary significantly, ranging from the basic fee of $10,000 for neuro(head or brain only) cryopreservation at the European cryonics company KrioRus to more than $200,000 for whole-body cryopreservation by Alcor (this value includes overseas and last-minute fees). Alcor’s neuropreservation (head only) is priced at $80,000 (2).",

Since the human brain is very immature at birth, lacking the anatomical and physiological elements prerequisite for mental functions, the mind does not yet exist at the moment of birth. Freedom is an aspect of mental activity requiring reception of information, internal processing of data, and output of behavioral manifestations. Thus, freedom may be curtailed by (1) privation or distortion of information, (2) alteration of intracerebral processing, or (3) inhibition of expression due to environmental factors such as coercion and punishment. Freedom involves learning of intellectual skills. The degree of freedom attained will be directly related to the amount of effective training or behavioral controlprovided by those in charge of education. Freedom may be considered a general purpose cerebral mechanism which increases the number and quality of available behavioral options. Human dignity, self-realization, happiness, and personal freedom are products of mental activity which should have priority in present educational systems.",

      "abstract": "Interpassivity is a widespread, but mostly unacknowledged form of cultural behavior. It consists in letting others (other people, or animals, machines etc.) not work, but consume in one’s place. When certain people, for example, take care that others drink their beer for them, fotocopy or print texts out instead of reading them, let recording devices watch TV programmes in their place, use ritual machines that pray or believe for them vicariously, or are happy that certain TV-comedies already laugh about themselves, we have to speak of interpassivity. These actions are based on certain subjects’ preference to delegate their enjoyment instead of having it themselves. This, obviously, raises a number of quite uncanny, fundamental questions: Why do certain people do not want to have their enjoyment? And why do they, if the do not want to enjoy, go to such great pains in order to ensure that somebody else enjoys in their place? The theory of interpassivity has had considerable impacts on several disciplines such as philosophy, art theory, psychoanalysis, media theory, political theory, anthropology, theory of religion etc. This volume assembles essays that reach from the fundamental philosophical questions, concerning the paradoxical pleasure gained from delegated enjoyment, to their most current consequences: for example concerning interactivity and participation in the arts and in politics, generosity in culture, the status of belief, ritual and magic, cultural capitalism, civilized urban role-play etc.",

      "title": "Generics",
      "abstract": "Generics are statements such as ‘dogs are mammals’, ‘a tiger is striped’, ‘the dodo is extinct’, ‘ducks lay eggs’ and ‘mosquitoes carry the West Nile virus’. Generic statements express general claims about kinds, rather than claims about particular individuals. Unlike other general statements such as ‘all dogs are mammals’ or ‘most tigers are striped’, generics do not involve the use of explicit quantifiers (such as ‘all’ or ‘most’ in these examples). In English, generics can be expressed using a variety of syntactic forms: bare plurals (e.g. ‘ducks lay eggs’), indefinite singulars (e.g. ‘a tiger is striped’) and definite singulars (‘the dog is a mammal’). (Sometimes, habitual statements such as ‘Mary smokes’ or ‘John runs in the park’ are classified as generics, but we will not follow this practice here.) The truth conditions of generics have proved quite puzzling for theorists. For example, ‘dogs are mammals’ seems to require for its truth that all (possible) dogs be mammals. ‘A tiger is striped’ or ‘ravens are black’, however, are somewhat more forgiving, since they are compatible with the existence of a few stripeless albino tigers, and white albino ravens. ‘Ducks lay eggs’ and ‘a lion has a mane’ are more forgiving still; these generics are true even though it is only the mature members of one gender which possess the relevant properties. This truth-conditional laxity is limited in scope, however: we do not accept ‘ducks are female’ or ‘lions are male’, even though every egg-laying duck is a female duck, and similarly mutatis mutandis for maned lions. Finally, we accept ‘mosquitoes carry the West Nile virus’, even though fewer than 1 per cent of mosquitoes carry the virus, while also rejecting ‘books are paperbacks’, when over 80 per cent of books are paperbacks. The correct analysis of the truth conditions for generics is a matter of great controversy among theorists working on the problem.",

There are many situations like these in which harm flows from an action which, in contrast to an error, is quite deliberate in its conceptualisation and execution, even though no harm was intended. We have said that errors are entirely involuntary. The moral implications of an injury are quite different if some element of choice by the actor was involved in the actions which led to its causation. A mistake (mistakes being that subset of errors in which the flaw lies in the decision or plan) is defined as an error precisely because the actor believes that the action is an appropriate way of achieving an objective safely. He or she is acting in good faith, trying to do the best possible thing, but failing. A decision or plan can no longer be considered a mistake (or any other kind of error under the definition in chapter 3) if the person concerned knows that there is a more acceptable alternative, or an alternative more likely to achieve the given objective safely, and yet deliberately chooses the less satisfactory alternative.",

      "title": "Behavioral Regulation of the Milieu Interne in Man and Rat",
      "abstract": "In regulating the internal homeostatic environment mammals, by necessity, employ behavioral strategies that differ from the tactics used in coping with contingencies in the external environment. When an animal consumes a meal, the palatability of that meal is automatically adjusted in accordance with the ultimate internal effects of that meal. If the meal causes toxicosis, the animal acquires an aversion for the taste of the meal; conversely, if recuperation follows ingestion of the meal, the taste of that meal is enhanced. Unlike the learning that occurs when externally referred visual and auditory signals are followed by punishment in the form of peripheral pain or reward in the form of food in the mouth, conditioning to the homeostatic effects of food can occur in a single trial and rarely requires more than three to five trials, even though the ultimate effects of the meal are delayed for hours. Paradoxically, the animal need not be aware of the ultimate internal effect in the same sense that it is aware of external contingencies. For example, an aversion can be acquired even if the animal is unconscious when the agent of illness is administered. Thus, the way in which food-effects are stored in memory may be fundamentally different from the way in which memories of specific time-space strategies devised for external contingencies are stored. This separation of function is indicated by limbic lesions which disrupt conditioning to a buzzer that is followed by shock and facilitate conditioning to a taste that is followed by illness. Operationally speaking, one can describe both aversion conditioning and buzzer-shock conditioning in the space-time associationistic terms of classical conditioning. However, psychologically speaking, one must realize that in aversion conditioning the animal does not act as if it were acquiring an \"if-then\" strategy. It acts as if a hedonic shift, or a change in the incentive value of the flavor were taking place. Such hedonic shifts are critical in regulation of the internal milieu. When an animal is in need of calories, food tends to be more palatable; as the caloric deficit is restored, food becomes less palatable. If the animal's body temperature is below optimum, a warm stimulus applied to the skin is pleasant. When body temperature is too high, the converse is true. In this way, homeostatic states monitored by internal receptors produce changes in the incentive values of external stimuli sensed by the peripheral receptors, and guide feeding behavior. In mammals at least, the gustatory system, which provides sensory control of feeding, sends fibers to the nucleus solitarius. This brainstem relay station also receives fibers from the viscera and the internal monitors of the area postrema. Ascending fibers bifurcate at the level of the pons and project toward the feeding areas of the hypothalamus and the cortex. The olfactory system which primarily projects to the limbic system does not play a primary role in adjusting food incentives. Rather, it plays a secondary role in the activation of feeding, as do other external sensory systems. This specialized conditioning mechanism, which specifically adjusts gustatory hedonic values through delayed visceral feedback, is widespread among animals, including man and rat. These two species are remarkably similar in their thresholds and preferences for gustatory stimuli. The behavioral similarities are based on the animals' having similar gustatory systems, similar convergence of gustatory and internal afferents to the nucleus solitarius, and similar midbrain regulatory mechanisms. Thus, it is not surprising that the feeding of obese rats with internal hypothalamic damage resembles the feeding of obese human beings insensitive to the internal signs of this caloric state. Obviously, man has a highly specialized form of symbolic communication and the rat does not, yet man's cognitive specialization does not prevent him from developing aversions to food consumed before illness even when he knows that his illness was not caused by food.",

      "title": "Housing and the domestic environment",
      "abstract": "Too often the words 'house' and 'home' are used as if they are synonymous, and the word 'housing' (as a noun) is used to imply a group of houses. Before discussing the importance of house, home, and housing and the relationship these have with 'health' and 'well-being', it will be useful to give definitions for the purposes of this chapter. (Where a word or term has a specific definition for a particular purpose, such as for the interpretation of legislation, this will be made clear and the particular definition given.)The World Health Organization, Europe (WHO) considers housing to be a broad concept involving four interrelated elements – the house (or dwelling), the home, the immediate environment (or neighbourhood), and the community. The house or dwelling is the physical structureproviding shelter with the necessary space, facilities and amenities for the occupant(s) or intended occupant(s). A house is also a financial asset, mainly a personal, individual asset, but a national asset as well. As an asset, there will be a psychological significance to the owner (or person purchasing, perhaps through a mortgage), but the degree of this significance will vary depending on whether the house is intended to provide accommodation forpersonal occupation, or for renting. More relevant to this chapter is the primary purpose of a house or dwelling – that of providing somewhere to establish a home. To this end, it should be designed, constructed and maintained to provide a safe and healthy environment for the occupant(s) and any visitors. However, it is not possible to provide a completely safe and healthy dwelling – we need hazards such as electricity, stairs, cooking facilities, windows and doors – and so any necessary and unavoidable hazards should be as safe as possible. A dwelling should provide protection from the local climate, it should allow for the normal day-to-day activities of the occupant(s) throughout the year without problems, and its condition should be such that it does not interfere with the occupant(s) establishing a home. It should have sufficient space to allow for the inter-relationship between the members of the household and also allow individuals the opportunity for privacy. It should also be affordable, both in terms of the rent or mortgage repayment and in terms of the 'running-costs' – the costs of local taxes, of energy, of water, and of maintenance. The home is the social, cultural and economicstructure created by the individual or household. It is the structure that gives a human refuge from the outside world, enables the development of a sense of identity and, for a household, a sense of attachment. The home creates an environment where one can be, and develop, oneself.",

      "abstract": "Self-defense and its close relative, defense of others, are uses of force against another person — Attacker — for the purpose of preventing Attacker from harming another’s person or property. These uses of force are called self-defense (SD) when employed by the one whose person or property is threatened (the Victim, or V); they are called defense of others (DO) when employed by a non-threatened third party who is not in V’s family (TP).SD and DO are preemptive uses of force because they occur before the acts they are intended to prevent occur. They thus belong to the family of preemptive measures that harm people or restrict their liberty in order to prevent them from harming others in the future. Examples of preemptive measures other than SD and DO include preventive detention, restraining orders, gun control laws, and similar laws making possession of certain items illegal for fear of their misuse.Because SD and DO are preemptive, they operate in the realm of epistemic uncertainty. V and TP can never be certain the feared acts will occur. They can never be certain that if the acts occur, what their consequences will be. They can never be certain what alternative to SD and DO for averting the feared harms exist. And they can never be certain what the status of the presumed Attacker is — that is, whether the presumed Attacker is culpable or nonculpable.

Behavior essentially, therefore, possesses a social quality which need not be existent in conduct, although Dewey regards conduct as \"A social reaction in and because of environment.\" Whether behavior is regarded as action or reaction, it is patent that it must depend on at least two elements dealing with human organization. Behavior must be viewed in terms of structure and function.

      "abstract": "If we understand death as the irreversible loss of the good life, we can give meaning to the idea that for suffering patients in the end stage of their illness, life may become an evil and death no longer a threat. Life may lose its good already in the living person. But what does the good of life consist in, then? I defend an internalist view according to which the goodness of life is intrinsically related to the attitudes, concerns, interests and experiences of the person who is leading the life. This results in the contention that the core of what we understand as the value of the person's life is to be identified with what makes life go well for the person living the particular life. This internalist view does not presuppose (or imply) hedonism or mentalism, nor does it pose an experience requirement. Something may be good for you, because it is valuable as seen from your authentic viewpoint, even if you do not actually experience this goodness, or think otherwise because you are mistaken about your own well-being. To test this position, and the authenticity-requirement it includes, I discuss three cases of patients who are persistent in denying that in their life any value is left and who contend that death is not worse than further living. Internalism acknowledges that in the life of these patients there may be 'functionings' and 'beings' that are worthwhile, where the test of value is at least partially independent of subjective assessment. Still, internalism claims that something truly valuable can only contribute to the good of one's life of it has positive meaning as seen from the attitudinal viewpoint that identifies oneself.",

      "abstract": "To speak of sensuous geographies as Other geographies is problematic. The senses do not work independently of culture and the sociopolitical implications of cultural identity formations—far from it! The senses are deeply implicated in the ways in which we make sense of the world as social beings: the way we understand or agree to understand—or compel each other to understand—the world. We sort stimuli according to the values or ideologies that govern our perception of reality. Ideas are in this way, literally, incorporated into the body’s perception of the world. We see and hear and smell what we think we see and hear and smell, or what preconceived Ideas of right and wrong, good and bad tell us that we see, hear, smell, taste, or touch. As the body and the sensory apparatus are generally made to operate in the service of shared sociocultural beliefs and political regimes of thought, the sensory world appears more often than not as a material confirmation of preconceived systems of meaning and value investments. Consider, for instance, the way certain smells may carry positive associations in some cultures and negative in others, or the way the perception of colors, like dark brown and light pink (or black and white), may be mediated by pre-perceptual values of good and bad, superiority and inferiority1—or how our minds can instruct our bodies to perceive a certain image or sound or smell or touch as a sensory signal that an abstract border is in operation or has been crossed.",

It appears then that, in common language, instigation carries the negative connotation of influencing somebody to do something bad or inadvisable. And indeed, similarly, the concept of instigation has been applied in the prosecution of international crimes in order to capture the criminal responsibility of those who, even though not carrying out any elements of the crime themselves, have psychologically prompted other people to perpetrate such crimes. In international criminal proceedings, the same idea has also been expressed with concepts like soliciting and inducing, or incitement.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Our basic assumption is that children’s talk about the mind can reveal their conceptions of the mind. Specifically, we assume that at least some uses of terms such as think, know, and want can reveal the speaker’s understanding of beliefs and desires, core concepts in an everyday theory of mind. An example might be Mark’s statement above that “he thought there were haunted things in his house.” Of course, charting children’s concepts by examining their everyday language is not simple. On the one hand, children (and adults) may use terms like think, know, or want without any conception of, or reference to, beliefs and desires. For example, they might learn to say “Know what?” to gain a listener’s attention without any deeper understanding of notions such as knowledge or knowing. Or they might say “I don’t know” in a ritualistic way, as perhaps Ross does above. On the other hand, children might understand something of beliefs and desires but never talk about them. Or they might talk about such mental states but never use conventional terms like think and want. In these ways, among others, children’s language might underestimate or overestimate their understanding.",

      "title": "The Aesthetics of Dress",
      "abstract": "This book explores the relationships between how the body appears and feels in everyday life through aesthetics. The recent shift away from Kantian aesthetics towards a more enacted route places at its core the realization that the world is experienced as possibilities for action, and critical to this understanding is how the body’s movement generates multiple pre-linguistic experiences and meaning. This route therefore realizes the importance of the body’s role in working in conjunction with cognition in generating these experiences. Nevertheless, this attention has predominantly focused on how the body ‘feels’ through engagement, rather than how it appears. This might be problematic as it is essential to appreciate that the body is not naked in everyday life, and therefore through dress we look to restore the balance between appearance and feel.\r\n\r\nWe ‘dress’ our bodies to communicate – to express our confidence (or not), identity, status, aspirations, affiliations etc. We dress according to the situation/audience etc. It might be to attract attention, to protect or to hide the body. It might be to accentuate height, or religious belief, or simply to shock or conform. Essentially, it is not simply clothing that we wear that achieves this – for example, hair, makeup, jewellery, handbags, shoes, piercings, tattoos – cumulatively these constitute how we ‘dress’ our bodies. Thus, the appearance (as well as the feel) of the body is significant if we are to appreciate an enacted approach to aesthetics.",

One is a case of phenomenal invisibility, while the other is a case of misperception. When we do not see what is there or see something other than what is there, it is frequently the result of the same visual processes that are responsible for our seeing what is there. These phenomena are discussed, and the parallel between one of them, inattentional blindness, our failure to see what is there when we are not paying attention to it, is likened to our failure to see those we consider \"other,\" revealing how our prejudices influence what we see and what we don't.",

      "abstract": "Although we tend unreflectively to think of interpretation as carried on in language and as applied to linguistic expression in oral utterance or in text, interpretation can in fact be much larger than language in human life. In a quite ordinary and straightforward sense, to interpret means for a human being to bring out for another human being or for other human beings (or for himself or herself) what is concealed in a given manifestation, that is, what is concealed in a verbal statement or a given phenomenon or state of affairs providing information. We can interpret anything that provides information: not merely a verbal statement but also a sunset, a rumble in an automobile transmission, a gesture, a performance of instrumental music, a person’s gait. The terms “concealed,” “manifestation,” and “revealed,” just used, betray that we are thinking of knowledge here, as is common, by analogy basically with the sense of vision, rather than of hearing (voice-and-ear) or smell or taste or the manifold senses we group under “touch” (hot-cold, wetdry, rough-smooth, soft-hard, resistant-yielding, and so on). Interpretation could be considered with regard to knowledge conceived by analogy with one or another of these other senses, too, but to do so would make a long, long story, and we can forego such considerations here. As interpretation can apply to any sort of phenomenon, so it can be expressed in all sorts of human ways, not merely verbal but also nonverbal—for example, by raised eyebrows, a wave of the hand, a thumbs-down gesture, a knowing grin, or in non-gesticulatory ways, as by a grumble or by the clothes one wears or by a fireworks display. These nonverbal interpretations are always to some degree dependent on the culture in which the interpreters live, but some are also to some degree common to all human cultures. Thus, there are different kinds of smiles",

Antibiotics, antidepressants and painkilling opioids are most commonly pre­scribed, their study found. Twenty percent of patients are on five or more prescription medications, according to the findings, pub­lished online in the journal Mayo Clinic Proceedings.These num­bers are staggering. Our perspective on health is very limiting. The worldwide wellness industry is a $4.2 trillion market and rapidly growing. The future of health lies in becoming aware of health that takes into account body, mind and soul. We are not just flesh, bones, blood put in a body. We have emotions, thoughts, values, memories and more. These affect health. In a simple model, we can say we have four bodies, one seen and three unseen. These are physical body, emotional body, mental (thoughts) body, spiritual (values) body. All of these bodies have to be healthy for a person to enjoy good health. Stress, Pain, Depression some of the leading health issues are related to our thoughts, emotions and values.",

It is the purpose of this chapter to look at a number of social and other conditions, largely external to the individual, which facilitate or hinder the development of genius. It is not always easy to say whether these conditions have a direct causal influence on the production of works of genius, or the development of the genius himself. In epidemiology we distinguish between risk factors and causes. Risk factors are variables which are significantly correlated with specific diseases, but may not be causally related to them. Causes must be shown to be necessary and sufficient for the disease to develop. Koch's famous postulates were enunciated to give precision to this distinction, and make it clear just what was needed for a particular factor (such as the tubercle bacillus) to be regarded as a cause of tuberculosis, and not just as a risk factor.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Do nonhuman animals (henceforth, animals) have emotions, and if so, are these similar to ours? This opinion piece aims to add to the recent debate about this question and provides a critical re-evaluation of what can be concluded about animal and human emotions. Emotions, and their cognitive interpretation, i.e., feelings, serve important survival functions. Emotions, we believe, can exist without feelings and are unconsciously influencing our behavior more than we think, and possibly more so than feelings do. Given that emotions are expressed in body and brain, they can be inferred from these measures. We view feelings primarily as private states, which may be similar across closely related species but remain mostly inaccessible to science. Still, combining data acquired through behavioral observation with data obtained from noninvasive techniques (e.g., eyetracking, thermography, hormonal samples) and from cognitive tasks (e.g., decision-making paradigms, cognitive bias, attentional bias) provides new information about the inner states of animals, and possibly about their feelings as well. Given that many other species show behavioral, neurophysiological, hormonal, and cognitive responses to valenced stimuli equivalent to human responses, it seems logical to speak of animal emotions and sometimes even of animal feelings. At the very least, the contemporary multi-method approach allows us to get closer than ever before. We conclude with recommendations on how the field should move forward.",

      "title": "Time and the Unconscious Mind",
      "abstract": "Most of us think we know some basic facts about how time works. The facts we believe we know are based on a few intuitions about time, which are, in turn, based on our conscious waking experiences. As far as I can tell, these intuitions about time are something like this: 1) There is a physical world in which events occur, 2) These events are mirrored by our perceptual re-creation of them in essentially the same order in which they occur in the physical world, 3) This re-creation of events occurs in a linear order based on our conscious memory of them (e.g., event A is said to occur before event B if at some point we do remember event A but we don not yet remember event B, and at another point we remember both events), 4) Assuming we have good memories, what we remember has occurred in the past and what we don not remember but we can imagine might: a) never occur, b) occur when we are not conscious, or c) occur in the future. These intuitions are excellent ones for understanding our conscious conception of ordered events. However, they do not tell us anything about how the non-conscious processes in our brains navigate events in time. Currently, neuroscientists assume that neural processes of which we are unaware, that is, non-conscious processes, create conscious awareness as a reflection of physical reality (Singer, 2015). Thus, if we wish to understand how events unfold in time in the physical world, we would do well to attempt to get some hints about how these events are navigated by non-conscious processes.",

      "title": "The Epistemology of Religion",
      "abstract": "Entertaining a proposition normally exposes our mind to a range of psychic states, ranging from involuntary to voluntary states, depending on the irresistibility of the proposition in question. There are some propositions which are too certain to entertain without believing them, and some too vague, too suspicious to hold without some degree of doubt. Normally, we relate to any matter we consider in one of these three different propositional attitudes: (dis)belief, acceptance (or rejection) or suspension of judgment. Though religion cannot be confined solely to acceptance of or a belief in the theistic God, as religions like Buddhism and Hinduism demonstrate, it is commonplace in ordinary language to think of religion in terms of having a belief in a transcendent being, a deity, at least in the Christian, Jewish or Muslim cultures. Most religions assert themselves as an account of the universe, human condition or their nature. Some people believe its explanations, some merely accept them. That is, religion can be a belief-system about the universe. But it may lack such belief-system, and could be a matter of mere acceptance. There are people who do not believe religious explanations about the origin of life or the universe, but they still accept them as a way of life. In this article, I aim to analyze the psychological bridge, in the way of belief and mere acceptance, between us and the idea there is a God in light of the existing evidence for and against the existence of God, assuming that we are dealing with rational agency.",

      "abstract": "Like most words, consciousness does not admit of a definition in terms of genus and differentia or necessary and sufficient conditions. Nonetheless, it is important to say exactly what we are talking about because the phenomenon of consciousness that we are interested in needs to be distinguished from certain other phenomena such as attention, knowledge, and self-consciousness. By consciousness, I simply mean those subjective states of sentience or awareness that begin when onenuAbove all, consciousness is a biological phenomenon. We should think of consciousness as part of our ordinary biological history, along with digestion, growth, mitosis, and meiosis. However, though consciousness is a biological phenomenon, it has some important features that other biological phenomena do not have. The most important of these is what I have called its subjectivity. There is a sense in which each person's consciousness is private to that person, a sense in which he is related to his pains, tickles, itches, thoughts, and feelings in a way that is quite unlike the way that others are related to those pains, tickles, itches, thoughts, and feelings. This phenomenon can be described in various ways. It is sometimes described as that feature of consciousness by way of which there is something that it is like or something that it feels like to be in a certain conscious state. If somebody asks me what it feels like to give a lecture in front of a large audience, I can answer that question. But if somebody asks what it feels like to be a shingle or a stone, there is no answer to that question because shingles and stones are not conscious. The point is also put by saying that conscious states have a certain qualitative character; the states in question are sometimes described as qualia. In spite of its etymology, consciousness should not be confused with knowledge, it should not be confused with attention, and it should not be confused with self-consciousness. I consider each of these confusions in turn.",

Hate is often seen as “evil,” especially when manifesting as hate speech or hate crimes. Because people generally do not want to be seen as evil, haters are often reluctant to own the experience unless they can justify it—by labeling the target “evil,” for example. Hate that cannot be justified is sometimes disguised, as when intimate partner violence, stalking, and other mate retention tactics are labeled “jealousy” or even “love” by perpetrators (and sometimes victims). Whether disguised, or fleeting, or a means to some other end such as revenge or the temporary quashing of fear of abandonment, the desire for harm to befall another qualifies as hate.",

      "title": "Suffering is bad: experiential understanding and the impossibility of intrinsically valuing suffering",
      "abstract": "Abstract Suffering, I argue, is bad. This paper supports that claim by defending a somewhat bolder-sounding one: namely that if anyone—even a sadistic ‘amoralist’—fully understands the fact that someone else is suffering, then the only evaluative attitude they can possibly form towards the person’s suffering as such is that of being intrinsically against it. I first argue that, necessarily, everyone is disposed to be intrinsically against their own suffering experiences, holding fixed their specific overall degree of emotional aversiveness , because any evaluative attitude other than ‘being against’—including mere indifference—would in certain key circumstances make our suffering less emotionally aversive and thus different from the suffering experience (stipulatively) at issue. Second, fully understanding that someone else is having a given experience—Mary’s experiencing a vividly blue sky, say, or Job’s experiencing heart-rending grief—requires that we represent experientially their very instance of that experience-type (it requires, in other words, token phenomenal concepts ). The result is that what goes for our own suffering goes for others’, too: maintaining an accurate experiential representation of the fact that someone else is having a suffering experience with a specific degree of overall emotional aversiveness is only compatible with coming to be intrinsically against their suffering. So suffering is—‘objectively’—bad: it’s only possible to respond with indifference towards anyone’s suffering if we don’t fully understand that they are suffering in the first place.",

As a result, the term has acquired varied meanings. This analysis of novelty makes four claims. First, the specific state of uncertainty that a novel event creates depends on its origin. Second, unexpected events that alter the immediate stimulus surround (called stimulus novelty) should be distinguished from those that are inconsistent with an agent's long term knowledge (called conceptual novelty). Third, the critical features that render an event novel can vary with the agent's intention to classify or to act on an object and the balance between these two frames changes with development. Finally, the state of uncertainty created when an agent must choose one response from two or more alternatives differs from the states provoked by stimulus and conceptual novelty.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The ways in which people come to see themselves as unwell, sick, unable to function normally, and so on has varied enormously by time and place but has never been straightforwardly reducible to the concepts of local healers. Of course, there always exists an ongoing “dialogue” between communities and their healers, but community or “lay” perspectives invariably have lives of their own. It was in recognition of this that sociologists like Freidson, writing of modern Western medicine, attributed considerable importance to a distinction between “illness,” on the one hand, and “disease,” on the other. Illness, Freidson suggested, might be used to refer to everyday or lay understandings of abnormalities of body or mind perceived as salient by those affected or by kin and consociates around them. Disease might be reserved to denote professional (scientific, expert) perspectives on interruptions to health and well‐being. Illness was deemed to be subjective, disease objective: disease, after all, was defined in terms of textbook signs and symptoms.",

      "abstract": "When an individual suffers from living, when he questions the meaning of existence, when he is obsessed by feelings of worthlessness, he becomes a sufferer. Perhaps invisible for a long time and initially covered by somatic events, suffering from living finally manifests itself with its real face--not simply illness but being ill. This exceeds biologic organic processes, and a sheer medical approach to depression is no longer adequate. Other explanations will be needed. What discriminates a spiritual view e.g. from biomedical approaches to understand depression is the attitude taken towards the existence of a spiritual reality and towards the forces from deep within (inner resources). This means that spiritual and religious impulses and aspirations are deemed equally fundamental as other manifestations of life. Using a real case history, the path of suffering and recovery of a woman is presented.",

      "abstract": "The function of REM sleep dreaming is still unknown. We situate our approach to understanding dream phenomenology and dream function within that part of evolutionary theory known as Costly Signaling Theory (CST). We contend that many of the signals produced by the dreaming brain can be and should be construed as “costly signals”—emotions or mental simulations that produce daytime behavioral dispositions that are costly to the dreamer. For example, often the dreamer will appear in the dream as handicapped in some way (i.e., no clothes, no ID, no money, is under attack, being chased etc.). The dreamer, during waking life, is then influenced by the carry-over effect of the unpleasant dream content. The informational and affective content of the dream creates a mental set in the dreamer that operates during the daytime to facilitate the signaling of a “handicapped” Self. The subtle signaling effect might be via display of the intense emotions or physical demeanor that had first appeared in the dream. When the dreamer shares his dream with others the dream has a more direct impact on waking life and social interactions. In effect, the dreamer uses his or her dreams to adopt a self-handicapping strategy when dealing with significant others. The increased use of costly signals (the self-handicapping strategy) during the daytime then facilitates some vital communicative goal of the dreamer.",

      "abstract": "As an operative force, the well-known mechanism of catharsis (cleansing, elimination, purification, purge, purgation of emotion, epuration...) can easily be used or misused, depending on the context of its appearance. A mediating question would be whether this mechanism is set in motion spontaneously, or if it must be seen as almost always assembled and constructed. What are the conditions in which it appears? Can it be elicited anywhere, at any moment? Can it be set in motion by anyone? In order to fulfill its purpose as an artistic practice, and thus to have a far-reaching impact, it needs to be conceptually unobtrusive and inconspicuous. Conversely, with its improper use, any content aiming to convince, to leave an impression or an imprint of authenticity, can be viciously exposed to ridicule or scorn. Worse, it can lose its credibility altogether. Briefly, my thesis is that the use or misuse of the mechanism of catharsis (I would dare to contend – even of affect itself as the power of performing) is directly tied to the functionality or disfunctionality of a community, which in our case means a community with democratic aspirations.",

The recommendation of neutrality has been a source of much discussion within the psychoanalytic community, and there are views that it may not be achievable or desirable. Those who come for psychoanalysis or psychoanalytic therapy have, of necessity, resorted to ways of protecting themselves: through depression, self-sufficiency, compliance, drugs, perversions, or violence, to name a few. They have, in a very general sense, however, reached a point when the old ways are no longer serving them. One is the self-analytic element as an inner experiencing of oneself as an analyst, and the application of mind to such inner experience. The analyst must, therefore, constantly be attending to inner reactions to patients. Under the domination of their internal objects, analytic survival may pose a threat to their fragile internal world.",

The question is vital to all of us; furthermore, our knowledge may influence our philosophy of life. However, more frequently perhaps, our views of life affect our convictions about heredity and environment. The politically conservative will perhaps doubt that life experiences are able to change human nature: “Wars have always taken place”. The politically radical on the other hand will tend to deny the biological limitation of the human mind: “There are no limits to human progress”.

      "abstract": "A necessary condition for the existence of conscious ability in the way of correlative correlation between the planes of mental acts (noesis) and content-meanings (noema) – is an activity. Despite the communicative content of other activities, there is actually a communicative activity – communication, the leading motive of which is communication itself. Psychological and physical contact with the object of such communication is a self-sufficient goal for the subject. The emotional-dispositional basis of his motivation is all kinds of love and amicability. Deprivation of communication causes serious damage to the mental health of almost all people. Therefore, communication is a basic condition and a way of normal functioning of human conscious ability, the main factor of mental development of speech as a basis for this ability of infants and young children, who desperately need communication, full of expressive manifestations of love and tenderness. Children, who suffer from the deprivation of such communication, noticeably lag behind in development: their own speech and understanding of what is addressed to them, intelligence, self-awareness, adequate emotionality, social activity and adaptability. Mechanisms of social-psychological interaction are gradually “connected” to the process of intuitive “interiorization” of infants and young children, the essence of which is that in the noems of the subject’s conscious ability, the attitude to him, to other people, to the world of authoritative and referent for him individuals and groups is reflected. The most powerful subjective factor of the effectiveness of a child’s personal development is authentic activity through the volitional effort required to follow the rules of the game that attracts and captures it. Children benevolently accept the restrictions required by the rules of the game and are happy to follow them, because these are the conditions for testing their mental and somatic life potential, because in the process of the game «play» the vital forces of the child that please her. Such pleasure is the emotional-motivational basis of any real game and the deep foundation of the psychological affinity of game self-limitation and self-overcoming with the morality and spirituality of a personality, and thus a subjective factor in the development of his spiritual-moral conscious ability. At the same time, its aesthetic sensitivity develops due to the fact that the rules of the game form the harmonious system that gives the aesthetic impression of the beauty of the game. The deep basis of motivation of artistic-figurative activity (creation and perception of works of art) is a secret human desire – freedom of spirit, liberation from the shackles of its biological and social “handcuff”. Therefore, the ideological-emotional core of the images of high art is the freedom-loving human spirit, which is subject to the urges caused by the biological nature of human and social taboos and imperatives that oppress him. In the process of artistic-figurative activity, the subject empathically identifies with the struggles of the spirit of the art works’ heroes. These empathic shifts of one’s own spiritual-moral ability delight the subject, who develops the emotional-dispositional foundations of corresponding noems of his conscious ability. Cognition requires a serious attitude and hard work, which is most motivated by interest in its content. An effective way of such interest is the game psychological content of teaching. In general, the question of including the game into cognitive activity makes sense only as a fulfillment of the learning process with game psychological content. To organically combine the hard efforts of students, which requires knowledge and assimilation of scientific truths and spiritual values with game attractiveness - is not easy, but possible, especially concerning subjects of artistic-aesthetic cycle due to the semantic affinity of motivation of game and artistic-figurative activities. A necessary condition for the humanistic mission of sport is that it must be a noble competition, that is, a real game.",

However, immunity is also continuously influenced by hormetic effects of environmental [chemical (pollutions), physical (background irradiations and heat), etc.] and medical (drugs and therapeutic irradiations) and food interactions. In contrast to earlier beliefs, the no-threshold irradiation dogma is not valid in low-dose domains and here the hormesis concept is valid. Low-dose therapeutic irradiation, as well as background irradiations (by radon spas or moderately far from the epicenter of atomic bomb or nuclear facilities), is rather beneficial than destructive and the fear from them seems to be unreasonable from immunological point of view. Practically, all immune parameters are beneficially influenced by all forms of low-dose radiations.",

      "title": "The Analogy between Tinnitus and Chronic Pain: A Phenomenological Approach",
      "abstract": "Tinnitus is an auditory sensation without external acoustic stimulation or significance, which may be lived as an unpleasant experience and impact the subject’s quality of life. Tinnitus loudness, which is generally low, bears no relation to distress. Factors other than psychoacoustic (such as psychological factors) are therefore implicated in the way tinnitus is experienced. The aim of this article is to attempt to understand how tinnitus can, like chronic pain, generate a ‘crisis’ in the process of existence, which may go as far as the collapse of the subject. The main idea put forward in the present article is that tinnitus may be compared to the phenomenon of pain from the point of view of the way it is experienced. Although the analogy between tinnitus and pain has often been made in the literature, it has been limited to a parallel concerning putative physiopathological mechanisms and has never really been explored in depth from the phenomenological point of view. Tinnitus is comparable to pain inasmuch as it is felt, not perceived: it springs up (without intention or exploration), abolishes the distance between the subject and the sensation (there is only a subject and no object), and has nothing to say about the world. Like pain, tinnitus is formless and abnormal and can alter the normal order of the world with maximum intensity. Finally, tinnitus and pain enclose the subject within the limits of the body, which then becomes in excess. Tinnitus may be a source of suffering, which affects not only the body but a person’s very existence and, in particular, its deployment in time. Plans are thus abolished, so time is no longer ‘secreted’, it is enclosed in an eternal present. If the crisis triggered by tinnitus is not resolved, the subject may buckle and collapse (depression) when their resources for resisting are depleted. The path may be long and winding from the moment when tinnitus emerges to when it assaults existence and its eventual integration into a new existential norm where tinnitus is no longer a source of disturbance.",

That we often derive sorrow from the sorrow of others, is a matter of fact too obvious to require any instances to prove it; for this sentiment, like all the other original passions of human nature, is by no means confined to the virtuous and humane, though they perhaps may feel it with the most exquisite sensibility.

      "abstract": "This paper discusses the properties and communicative effects of Find + Oneself + Complement (FOC) construction. Firstly, the paper refers to one of FOC’s properties:[-intentional]. The complements of FOC tend to express unintentional situations, such as emotions like get irritated, or physical reactions like trembling. One cannot control emotions or physical reactions, so they are unintentional. Undesirable outcomes like bankrupt also are unintentional. However, even intentional actions such as stare at somebody can become unintentional in FOC. Next, another property of FOC: [+surprising] is examined and the discussion leads to whether the recognition is expressed in real time or not in the scenes presented. Non-real time recognitions are situations expressed in negatives, interrogatives, and subordinate clauses, and hypothetical or generalized situations. In FOC, it is not the speaker but the subject that recognizes the occurring situation, which effectively gives some reality to the sentence.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Inasmuch as emotions are expressions of living beings and not abstractions (of real people rather than the reified beliefs and conventional wisdom that comprise the social order), feelings are generally synonymous with life not law, freedom not facticity. Hence, for Kuranko, wale (duty or work) is \"that which you have to do\", by contrast with desire, which is what you might want to do. To express one's feelings or speak one's mind without taking into account the feelings or thoughts of others, is frowned upon; but so too is slavish adherence to social norms. Accordingly, a viable social life consists in making emotionality serve rather than subvert the common weal, a matter of giving equal expression to freedom and restraint. For Kuranko, this involves a continual adjustment of the bush (associated with antinomian impulses) and the village (associated with law and order).",

      "title": "S. Voeneky, P. Kellmeyer, O. Mueller and W. Burgard (eds) Cambridge Handbook of Responsible Artificial Intelligence: Interdisciplinary Perspectives",
      "abstract": "Over the millennia, people have developed normative standards, legal frameworks, personal capabilities and moral theories for assigning responsibility to a complex interacting web of humans, as well as the groups they form.Where responsibilities lie is not always straightforward, partially because responsibility may include different concepts.Nicole Vincent (2011) distinguishes six responsibility concepts in her taxonomy.First, virtue responsibility, where calling someone responsible is to say something that is good about their character, as exemplified in their reputation for doing what is seen to be the right thing.Second, role responsibility, which can be seen as someone's obligation, given the social or institutional role they have taken on, or that has been assigned to them.Third, outcome responsibility, where being responsible would imply that someone is blameworthy for their actions and/or the outcomes of their actions.Fourth, causal responsibility, whereby to be responsible is to cause or to create the conditions for various outcomes.Fifth, capacity responsibility refers to an individual's mental cognitive and volitional capacities, which determine their moral agency and the extent to which they can be held responsible for their actions.Finally, liability responsibility refers to the act of holding someone responsible for what happened.Holding someone responsible 'refers to the things that someone must do, or how they should be treated, to set things right' (Vincent, 2011, p.18).Increasingly rapid developments in machine learning (ML) have focused the public's interest in the current and future impact of artificial intelligence (AI).Technological advances have led to the emergence of new autonomous AI agents, which, once developed and deployed, will behave in ways that cannot be predicted by their developers and users (Russell, 2019).Unlike previous expert systems, modern statistical AI is based on representational learning methods (LeCun et al., 2015).These methods allow developers to 'feed' algorithms unstructured data, which enables deeplearning algorithms to learn, resulting in the emergence of behaviours which often exceed human ability.Representational learning is implemented via a black box -one can view its input (data) and output (behaviour), but not its internal workings (Castelvecchi, 2016).Therefore, AI agents can behave in ways which are autonomous and unpredictable.AI introduces a novel societal issue -the responsibility gap -where the designer and user of AI are not fully capable of predicting the AI's behaviour (Matthias, 2004).Although AI may have causal efficacy, it is not clear who should be held responsible.In the Cambridge Handbook of Responsible Artificial Intelligence, Silja Voeneky, Philipp Kellmeyer, Oliver Mueller, and Wolfram Burgard have edited a volume which addresses the most urgent societal, philosophical, ethical and legal challenges brought about by problems surrounding AI responsibility.It comprises contributions from different disciplines and sectors, which is necessary given the breadth and scale of the task at hand.The book is in eight parts.It starts with the fundamentals of responsible AI and then explores the present and future strategies for AI governance in the US and Europe.In parts III and IV, the book delves into liability frameworks and addresses the central issues of fairness and non-discrimination in AI systems.Part V explores responsible data governance methods more closely.Parts VI and VII discuss appropriate governance approaches for specific AI system sectors, such as financial services and the healthcare industry, which includes neurotechnology.The final section confronts particularly complex and such contentious topics as AI use in security applications and armed conflicts.",

      "abstract": "Haematophagous black flies (Diptera: Simuliidae) seek mammal and bird hosts as blood sources and are responsible for significant human and animal hardship and economic loss due to annoyance, effects of biting and disease transmission. Simuliids locate and choose their hosts by orienting to host-originating chemical, visual and temperature stimuli. Little is known about the nature of the stimuli involved as chemical mediators though carbon dioxide is influential and certain other breath and body odours also clearly play roles. Effects of visual stimuli are limited to the effective visual range of the host to the fly which is determined by host size and environment. Vision appears to take precedence over olfaction when the host-seeking fly makes visual contact with the host. Landing and biting site choices appear to depend on a combination of visual and skin-associated chemical and thermal stimuli. Black fly responses to potential host stimuli seem dependent on the context in which the stimuli are received. Some stimuli (e.g. warmth) induce landing or biting for flies in the host seeking mode (or context) but induce escape reactions for non-host-seeking flies. Host choice (or rejection) may be based on the ability of these host stimuli, encountered in an appropriate sequence, to sustain the host seeking mode up to its consummation (blood feeding). Research on black fly host seeking has been slowed by the relative difficulty of doing meaningful behavioural experiments in the lab with this group, by the dearth of lab colonies and the difficulties and costs of maintaining them and by the lack of adequate field tools and experimental approaches.",

These have to do with the contributions of a given stretch of discourse to the communication of which it is part. For example, verb forms may distinguish whether a sentence is to be understood as declarative or imperative. The key characteristic of the signaling function is that meaning is directly encoded in, and read off of, some aspect of the form of the utterance. Second, however, there are what might be termed the goal functions of discourse, the ways in which speech, as a form of social action, is used to accomplish particular ends that the speaker has (cf. Silverstein 1976). For example, it may be used to build a social alliance or to provoke or to obtain information. One characteristic that differentiates goal functions from signaling functions is that the goal function is usually not itself independently specified in the form of the discourse. We must infer such functions from observation of the role of discourse in ongoing social life.",

(سامية بوشاشي، 2013، 103)\r\n کما أشار علماء الإجتماع إلى أن التوافق ينظر إليه من خلال مظاهر السلوک الخارجي للفرد الذي عادة مايلجأ للإنقياد للجماعة وإطاعة أوامرها لمقابلة متطلبات الحياة اليومية وتحقيق التوافق بمعنى أن التوافق هو قدرة الفرد على التفاعل مع الهدف الذي يسعى إلى تحقيقه في الوقت الذي يستطيع فيه الفرد أن يقوم بعلاقات منسجمة وسوية مع الظروف والمواقف وأفراد البيئة المحيطة به. (نصيرة لعباس، 2012، 70)\r\n اما نظرية التعلم الإجتماعي يرى أصحابه وعلى رأسهم (باندورا) أننا نقلد سلوک الآخرين عندما نرى أن سلوکهم هذا يعزز أو يدعم من خلال الآخرين، أو إذا کنا نحب أونعجب بسلوک الأفراد الذين نلاحظهم. بمعنى آخر، أننا نتعلم السلوکيات الحسنة وغير الحسنة من خلال الملاحظة والتقليد. (بدر إبراهيم الشيباني، 2000، 66)\r\nثالثا: النظرية النفسية Psychological Theory:\r\n1- نظرية التحليل النفسي: Psychoanalysis Theories:\r\nان هذه النظرية أشارت إلى أن التوافق السوي يحدث من خلال إشباع الغرائز، وتقليل العقاب والشعور بالذنب، ومن ثم تعلم کيفية التعامل مع الصراعات الداخلية (أوهام نعمان ثابت، 2009، 43) .\r\nأ‌-     سيجموند فرويد Sigmund Freud:\r\nيرى (فرويد) أن الشخص المتوافق هو من تعمل أجهزته النفسية الثلاث (Id، Ego، Super Ego) بإنسجام وأن تکون الأنا قوية وأعتقد أن عملية التوافق الشخصي غالبا ما تکون لاشعورية، أي أن الأفراد لا تعي الأسباب الحقيقية لکثير من سلوکياتهم. ويرى (فرويد) أن العصاب والذهان ما هي إلا عبارة عن شکل معين من أشکال لسوء التوافق ويقرر أن السمات الأساسية للشخصية المتوافقة والمتمتعة بالصحة النفسية تتمثل في ثلاث سمات هي: أ- قوة الأنا. ب- القدرة على العمل. ج- القدرة على الحب. (صالح حسن الداهري، وهيب الکبيسي، 1999، 204) .\r\nويعتمد التوافق لدى (فرويد) على الأنا، فالأنا تجعل من الفرد متوافقا أو غير متوافق فالأنا القوية التي تسيطر على الهو والأنا الأعلى وتحدث توازن بينهما وبين الواقع، أما الأنا الضعيفة فتضعف أمام الهو فتسيطر على الشخصية فتکون شخصية شهوانية تحاول إشباع غرائزها دون مراعاة الواقع أو المثل مما تؤدي بصاحبها إلى الإنحراف وعدم مراعاة الواقع ينعکس عليها سلبا ومن ثم إلى الإضطراب وأما أن تسيطر الأنا الأعلى فتجعل الشخصية متشددة بالمثل إلى درجة عدم المرونة وتکون بکبت الرغبات والغرائز الطبيعية أو تشعر بالذنب المبالغ فيه وتؤدي إلى الإضطراب النفسي وسوء التوافق (نبيل سفيان، 2004، 164) .\r\nواهتم (فرويد) بدراسة المراحل الأولى في حياة الفرد وکذلک بکشف ودراسة العمليات الشعورية واللاشعورية وتأثيرهما على الشخصية والسلوک الإنساني (کامل محمد عويضة، 1996، 73) .\r\nيتکون الجهاز النفسي عند (فرويد) من عدة مکونات هي: الهو، الأنا، الأناالأعلى\r\n تنقسم الحياة النفسية عند فرويد إلى ماهو شعوري (يعيه الفرد) وماهو لاشعوري (لايعيه الفرد) . وتوجد درجتان من اللاشعور وهما: ماقبل الشعور، ويتضمن ماهو کامن ولاشعوري ولکنه متاح الحصول عليه بالطرق العادية، ومن السهل إستدعاؤه مثل الذکريات الشخصي للفرد. أما اللاشعور (العميق) فيتضمن الأمور أو الخبرات المکبوتة التي يتطلب إخراجها إلى الشعور جهدا تحليليا خاصا لما يحتويه من خبرات غير مرغوبة أو مؤلمة، ويظهر أحيانا في الأحلام (اجلال محمد سري، 2000، 107)",

The disgusting part may be split off and projected onto some other person or some other part of the self. The affect of disgust has been relatively little examined in the literature and yet it is very common in everyday life. Susan Miller attributes this to the fear of contamination that is central to disgust reactions. Disgust is an affect probably originally founded in response to bad tastes and smells with their link to spoiled food and over the ages generalised to certain tactile experiences, sliminess for example, and further extended to thoughts of something expected to be disgusting. If the perceived failing is split off and projected outwards it can produce disgust towards the object which is the recipient or, if split off and internalised, it may act as the focus for disgust with self.",

      "abstract": "Jealous love and morbid jealousy, although inextricably linked, cannot be considered the same: jealous love (trait jealousy) is the behavioral and cognitive-affective precondition of morbid jealousy (state jealousy). Love is jealous when it is devoured by the desire for the exclusive and total possession of the partner, whose unconditional and continued presence is avidly requested. This type of love, in addition, is permeated by the need to know what the other is thinking, in order to scrutinize every minimal flaw in the faithfulness of the partner even in his or her innermost thoughts and fantasies; in it, jealousy is virtually always present, even in the absence of a triggering event, because captative love, by its very nature, includes the expectation of a conflict which inevitably actually takes place in reality. Finally, jealousy emerges as an emotional event (jealous flash) in response to a more or less significant change in the behavior of the partner, and reveals to the jealous individual a dimension which was previously latent or inexistent. This intense and brief experience, leaves a more or less blurred memory behind, and tends to progressively repeat itself and take root as a feeling.",

      "title": "The Value of Judgments Regarding the Value of Animals",
      "abstract": "Contemporary skepticism concerning the mental within philosophy of mind and psychology certainly seems to have created hard times for ethics. Eliminative materialists like Stich (1983) attack the very foundation on which moral theories are based. Since moral theories assume a certain amount of intentionality as a building block for their legislation ofrights and obligations, any positions that could demonstrate in some form that such an assumption is unwarranted, in that beliefs, desires and mental states in general cannot be shown to exist, would seem to spell death for the ethical realm. Ifmoral theories require realism about cognitive elements and their states yet are unable to present us with the evidence that will support this requirement, then they must either give up this requirement, and accept the view that moral agents and subjects no longer have any sure footing with regard to their claims concerning moral behavior toward themselves and others, or recognize some other way on which to ground their views. Does it have to be the case, for instance, that consciousness and sentience are the only conditions on which moral status can be ascribed to beings? Or can we refer to some other condition or set of conditions? Can we perhaps expand our concept of morality to include animals yet without necessarily raising the problems associated with attributions of intentionality? The general focus of this paper, then, concerns my interest in the conditions that make moral judgments about animals true. Hence, I am concerned with moral epistemology, not axiology. In Part I, I present a cursory analysis of Stich's view concerning ascriptions of beliefs to humans as well as to animals. In Part II, I analyze Regan's arguments for why certain animals ought to be regarded as moral subjects as well as his response to Stich's position. My intention behind presenting Regan's position is twofold: (1) to show that Stich's position creates some difficulty for Regan's ultimate goal of ascribing rights to animals and (2) to point out that the comparison of animal to human belief structures is not an effective way to ground what possible claims they may have against us. I conclude on a somewhat Heideggarian note in Part III. I argue that animals and nature itself may be deserving of some moral recognition just by virtue of the fact that they afford us possibilities with respect to what we can and do become. Value, in a certain sense, is to be found external to ourselves.",

      "abstract": "Human behavior frequently involves planning in relation to interpersonal events scheduled to occur in the near future. A person may be required publicly to commit himself to participate in an impending event at some preferred point in time; thus, for example, he may freely elect to postpone his response rather than perform it immediately. One would generally expect postponement behavior to bear predictable relationships to the strength of relevant motives, particularly when these motives are incompatible with each other. This paper tests two deductions drawn from application of Miller's (1944, 1959) conflict model to postponement behavior. Specifically, the stimulus-similarity axis of the conflict model is identified with the future time dimension, along which some conflict-evoking event may be located. The hypotheses concern S's tendency to postpone his voluntary participation in the event, as a function of the strength of conflicting motives. In order to derive specific testable hypotheses consider first that S commits himself, in the immediate present, to take part in an event which is to occur at some point in futur'e time, and that he may either participate immediately or postpone his participation to some specified degree. Consider also that chis event will be both rewarding and punishing to respective degrees explicitly stated beforehand by E. If it is assumed that a temporal gradient of reward exists, then, the more imminent the event, the stronger will be the acquired approach to it al the instant of commitment.

      "title": "Discrimination Forms in the Professional Area 1",
      "abstract": "Relevant theoretical background for approaching the discrimination phenomenonDiscrimination (Latin discriminatio - separation) a concept closely related to the one of difference. The original meaning of separation has the significance of a neutral act, even a passive one of establishing a difference - which closely linked to the identification process. Territoriality the one determining individuals to notice the presence of a different being in their proximity and, in the identification process, to adopt an attitude against this being, either aggressive or non-aggressive. Hence, when a group, irrespective of the species, uses elements/signals of identification between its members and ones of differentiation against one or more individuals for adopting a certain delimitation attitude, we deal with discriminatory behaviour, which does not presuppose moral connotation. Thus, identity represents a posture adopted for the duration of an interaction, a possibility of an individual, (or of a group of individuals) to organise relationships against one another (...) From this perspective, the individual not perceived as determined by his belonging because he the one which gives a significance to the latter! (Ogien, 1987, p. 135)In the fifties, under the influence of social movements, the negative connotation developed with respect to the term of discrimination. The initial, neutral meaning, synonymous with the distinction, took over a pejorative connotation. Now, it about differentiation actions either abusively or illegally, by separating a social group and treating another in a disfavouring manner, one way or the other. At the same time, the term of non-discrimination emerges, with the entire associated conceptualisation.There are differences in the social contexts in which individuals practicing discrimination function. In the case of Europe, we might talk about a shared common definition of discrimination, and of its institutionalisation/regulation by laws, actions of repression taken by authorities against discriminatory acts. However, there are outside the democratic states, governments openly legitimising, in the name of morality, religion, or ideology, forms that we call discrimination. Examples therefore are the laws limiting fundamental liberties of women, or that deny the rights of indigenous people; it a type of discrimination depriving de facto individuals from the viewpoint of human rights. As result, defining discrimination related closely to the values of the societies. Some individuals may be discriminated based on the complex of elements constituting their identity, such as the case of an indigenous woman - she can be discriminated as woman, but also as person belonging to the indigenous populations.According to the sociologist Mihailescu loan (1993), discrimination represents difference, restriction, exclusion, preference or differing treatment which disadvantages an individual/group, as compared to others in the same situations, or the use of unequal treatment against a person or against a group of persons in relationship with other categorical features: racial, ethnic or religious belonging, or class attachment. The term is used for describing the action of a dominant majority in relationship with a minority and involves a prejudice caused to an individual or to a (Mihailescu I., in Zamfir and Vlasceanu, 1993, p. 177).The discrimination represents, consequently, the differentiated treatment applied to an individual by its inclusion into a certain social group. Discrimination an individual action, but if the members of the same group are treated similarly, then it represents a social model of collective behaviour (Banton, 1998). In social sciences, the term refers to the differentiated treatment against the large majority, with negative effects on the individual exposed to it.The United Nations Organisation includes in discrimination any conduct based on the distinction operated in relationship with certain natural and social categories and which not related to the individual capacities and merits, or to the actual behaviour of an individual. …",

In the current study we tested whether dogs disobeyed a prohibition to take a treat (i) in the presence of the communicator of the ban, (ii) after a temporary absence of the communicator, and (iii) in the presence of a novel person. Dogs disobeyed the rule significantly more often when the communicator left the room for a moment or when they were faced with a new person, than when she stayed present in the room.

      "title": "Individual Autonomy and a Culture of Narcissism",
      "abstract": "Autonomy, self-determination, self-affirmation, emancipation: all these words refer to an ideal that orients the way in which our contemporary culture speaks about many moral and political problems. The importance of this ideal for us can be seen in the way we accept as obvious a number of ideas that follow from it. Most of us would certainly tend to accept that no universally valid answer can be given to the question of what kind of human life is truly meaningful or valuable and that, because of this, people should be granted as much freedom as possible to pursue a life that best corresponds with their own personal tastes and preferences. Many would go a step further and claim that people should also be encouraged to live as much as possible according to what they have themselves chosen, and that they should give up traditional forms of life and role patterns. One aspect of this cult of individual freedom or autonomy is the idea that we should develop a critical attitude towards anything established, accepted or traditional: every form of power or authority, prevailing moral norms and educational customs, traditional role patterns, etc. A further feature of this is the tendency to describe any improvement in the fortunes of the weak, the vulnerable and the less well off as an ‘emancipation’. The idea that the poor, the handicapped and the elderly should receive more support, assistance, respect and attention is translated by the assertion that they, too, should be ‘liberated’. The ideals that we associate with words like ‘emancipation’ or ‘self-affirmation’ were at one time innovative and revolutionary, but they gradually became established as accepted ways of thinking and thus became part of a new common sense. Nowadays, anyone wanting to be provocative will attain their goal more easily by scoffing at everything falling under the rubric of emancipation than by speaking out in its defence. This fact is characteristic of an ambiguity in our culture. While the ideals of self-affirmation and emancipation enjoy enormous popularity, in certain intellectual circles they are treated with suspicion. At stake here is the general image of humanity associated with these ideals. Thinkers such as Wittgenstein, Heidegger, Lacan, Derrida or Baudrillard have, each in their own way, attacked the idea of the autonomous subject and stressed that people’s most intimate thoughts and desires are determined by something that transcends them: by the language they speak or the culture to which they belong. Rejecting the idea of the autonomous subject is usually one aspect of a more general critique of ideas inherited from the Enlightenment. The question whether and to what extent this critique is justified occupies a central position in many contemporary philosophical discussions, and much of what goes on in contemporary philosophy can be described in terms of the opposition between those who would defend Enlightenment ideals (often indicated by the terms ‘humanism’ or ‘liberalism’) and those who would reject or cast doubt on those ideals. What I would like to discuss here undoubtedly fits into a framework that could be called ‘antiliberal’ or ‘anti-humanist’. However, it is certainly not my intention to criticize humanism or liberalism directly and systematically. In what follows, I will attempt to show that the unity or cohesion suggested by the term ‘autonomy’ does not in fact exist. It will turn out that this term is actually associated with three ideals which are not only distinct, but which are in relations of mutual opposition or tension. In addition, I would like to develop the idea that at",

On the other hand, chronicity revives the psychiatrist's curiosity and interest in discovering more affective means to counteract a process which seems, apparently, inevitable. The author, after demonstrating that chronicity cannot be defined in accordance with psychiatric nosology, not simply in opposition to an acute state, proposes a definition that takes into account the process as one developing in the interaction between the patient, his environment and his therapist. This long and morbid evolution, which we call chronicity, corresponds to the patient's existential equilibration which is characterized by dependency and ruptures with his personal history, where the perception of time is altered and where all desires are given up. The true representative of this state can thus be perceived only through the relationships that are established. The author therefore defines this evolution as a process developing in the interaction with a given environment (hospital or other), and/or the therapeutic relationship. It becomes thus necessary to question the structures that generate chronicity, whether it be the hospital, the social services which might foster child-like dependance, chemotherapy, or negative attitudes resulting from a therapeutic relationship. A more adequate healing attitude permits a modification of the precarious compromises which the patient tends to establish, and serves to encourage his possibilities to gain more freedom of action.",

The immediate cause of stammering is lack of co-ordination between mind and body, as anxiety makes the mind race ahead of the speech and think about everything which has to be said, in an effort to predict problems in saying forthcoming words. Stammering has a tremendous emotional impact upon a person's life, because the debilitated speech severely restricts freedom of communication. Stammering is a faulty and incorrect mode of speech, which lacks shape, form and continuity. The stammerer is constantly trying to avoid stammering in speaking situations, attempting to transfer the information required with the least amount of stammering possible.

      "abstract": "ions of the mind, as Plato did so long ago, is a disservice because it asks us to reject This is not meant to diminish the fact that some people do feel trapped in their body either because of the extreme pain or because it feels like the wrong body for one reason or another. I would suggest, however, that perhaps much of this imagery of feeling trapped is due to the dissociation that is taught in a dualistic society (or even that dissociation which is necessary to survive mentally in a dualized community that is itself rejecting). Perhaps this dissociation makes people believe that not only are the two parts separable, but that the body is generally responsible for their negative experiences. Less dissociation and more acceptance of people as whole and situated individuals, might well lessen these experiences which mirror this artificial but current state of the society generally–but such is only possible in a world that accepts bodies and human variation. 77 important aspects of ourselves, of others and our connections to them, and makes it impossible for us to come to terms with ourselves as whole, integrated and bodily beings. The fact that dualisms still exist may seem unimpressive to some, just as the believed existence of yin and yang does not seem especially problematic to some Eastern thinkers. The point that women are associated with one side of this dualism, the side that is less valued, is unfortunate for them but does not in itself adequately refute dualism as a concept and means of understanding the world, such thinkers might argue. I think there is sufficient evidence that the harm dualism does, and the inequalities it produces, is at least adequate to challenge its usefulness and fairness. Even those readers who might reject these points surely could not easily maintain that dualism is an accurate account of human experience as it exists in the world. Granted many people believe that their mind and body are quite separate in some way, but the opinions of the masses are not in themselves adequate proof, one might think. However the average person does not experience their body as radically separate from themselves. One does not generally seek out or welcome a means of killing the body such that their immortal mind might be free to do more important things than the material tasks of maintaining a body. People experience their bodies as themselves. When physical pain is experienced–it is not just reasoned away and when psychic or emotional pain is experienced, often the body reflects that anguish. It is not just my mind that decides if I feel happy today but also my body which is me as well. The next chapter will discuss",

      "abstract": "All life on our planet is surrounded by radiation.Human life takes place with a certain level of radiation.The term psychologically is used primarily to explain the emotional reactions of the public, on issues in relation to which one should have a rational relationship because every story about radiation causes fear and rejection in an \"unprofessional\" and \"conscientious\" citizen.Over the past seventy years, a general opinion has been created through the mass media about the deadly effects of radiation.Apart from the real fear, which arises from the feeling of ecological endangerment, and which is based on the objective dangers of modern technologies, irrational fear is inevitably born.It is a generalization of all human subjective sufferings within the framework of \"overestimated\" reality.The feeling of fear that we are exposed to radiation can have far greater consequences than the actual harmful effects of physical radiation.The aim of this paper is to identify the psychological effects that radiation can cause in humans and how to overcome fear and stressful situations caused by radiation and the effect of psychosocial factors on human behavior, but also elements for prognosis and prediction for their behavior in similar situations.There is a justified concern when the risk of radiation appears, but the reality is far from the amount of panic that is spreading in the public and the media when it comes to these phenomena.We can conclude that people are generally afraid of radiation because their beliefs are dominated by misconceptions, delusions, or opinions that are the product of errors of judgment or are based on false premises.",

      "title": "Modes of Identity: Attaleiates, Komnene, and Psellos",
      "abstract": "Traditionally, the author of a history or saint's life identifies him or herself in such a way as to authenticate the truth and quality of the material. Positioning counts: that of a courtier or family member or disciple or army-follower. The writer claims to know the subject but modes of asserting this may vary: education, intellect, access to written sources, may count or, in the case of hagiography, may be discounted in favour of a different familiarity. The claim may of course be tacit, as when a writer continues someone else's work and inherits his authority by default. In a well-functioning work, the self-identifying trope is tacitly or overtly matched to need, and this remains largely true of those sophisticated eleventh-century and twelfth-century histories where the historian freely writes himself or herself into events. The difference is that options have increased; the self-identifying can take as many forms as phases of the narrative require and any of these may function in more ways than one. Of course, some functions may be extra-textual: they may be personally or politically driven, as when Michael Attaleiates lauds Botaneiates, or Michael Psellos idealizes Michael Doukas and his son, or when Anna Komnene shakes her fist at Alexios's successors. In this chapter, I shall leave those to one side and consider modes of self-identification in these Middle Byzantine authors, which work towards a larger textual purpose.",

      "abstract": "PERSON, says Hobbes, i s he, whose words or actions are considered, either as his own, or as representing the words or actions of another man . . . whether truly or by fiction. When they are considered as his own, then is he called a natural person: and when they are considered as representing the words and actions of another, then is he a feigned or artificial person. 1 Hobbes' distinction between the two forms of personation may serve set forth the common ground, as well as mark the boundary, between two modes of theatricality: the sustaining of a feigned person-or mimicry-and the emphatic maintaining of one's own person, or self-manifestation. The Oxford Dictionary supplies similar coordinates for the verbs and act, which may mean either sustain a feigned character, make a pretence, act deceitfully -i. e., engage in mimicry or hypocrisy -or, more neutrally, pursue a course of action, to perform a function -to go about one's business in a normal manner. A man who has played his part has done what was expected of him; he has fulfilled the obligations contracted by performing similar actions in the past. But most men play their parts somewhat inexpertly; they fail coincide exactly with their assumed roles. And our language contains various expressions of disapproval for those who too grossly misplay themselves. Terms like showing off, playing the gallery, upstaging, making a scene, making a spectacle of oneself, all refer an insistence on being at the center of attention. The same notion appears in other languages: in Italian, for example, sta sempre sul podio -he's always on a platform -refers bitingly the man who cannot do without an audience. To make a spectacle of oneself means that one is affording undesirable amusement others, though not necessarily by de-",

Mortality is the yard-stick and survivors merely the fraction that did not die. After an arbitrarily selected interval the experimental material is categorized as dead or alive, with sometimes an intermediate group such as “subnormal” inserted. This third class is often essential, for its members do not properly qualify as dead or alive, terms that imply totality. It is also a nuisance, for several reasons: (1) it blends gradually into the other two categories so that classification itself is subject to errors of judgment; (2) its numerical uncertainty affects the other categories not only at the time of initial classification but also later by the death or total recovery of some of its members; (3) as long as any treatment-effect persists, the situation remains quantitatively incomplete.",

      "title": "Experiencing a Shame Response as a Precursor to",
      "abstract": "The shame response is a primitive physiological response to a rejection of oneself by another. The discomfort of this response may vary from intense physical pain to one that is barely noticeable, if at all. When this pain is sufficient, it causes anger that may be directed outward against another or inward against oneself. The intensity of the shame response, hence the intensity of the pain and anger, is related to the significance of the other, the significance of witnesses to the rejection, one's vulnerability, whether or not the rejection is of oneself or an aspect of oneself, and if the rejection comes as a surprise. When most intense (i.e., most painful), the shame response may include a tightness of the throat, nausea, stomach pain, and a sense that the contents of one's chest and abdomen are collapsing, exploding, or imploding. In reviewing what preceded an act of violence, it is necessary to determine whether the assailant had experienced a shame response and how intense it was. Understanding that a shame response can lead to anger and violence allows for the prevention of violence. This requires that individuals do not experience rejections that are so painful as to lead to violence.",

      "abstract": "Our knowledge in biology and especially about order and organisation in organisms is based on observational and experimental evidence. This evidence is used to derive connections among properties (parameters, traits, functions, etc.) – a central goal of science. Certain such connections are discussed here. Often in biology, (1) correlations are pointed out, whereby properties that appear or change simultaneously are connected. Infrequently, the connection has a (2) causal basis; examples can be found in physiology. (3) Ad hoc connections, which are based on plausible narrations about adaptations, can be found in evolutionary biology. The (4) morphological connections are again of a different sort because they are based on hermeneutics. (5) Connections that are based on parallel or analogous appearances are exemplified by computer simulations. They are contrasted by (6) connections through building, where also the mechanisms that produce a phenomenon or function are similar to those in the natural system. All the connections are used to derive explanations and predictions. Due to the different basis of the connections, the derived explanations and predictions differ with regard to their degree of certainty. Hence it is useful to consider the differences of the connections. Clear distinctions between the types of connections (and their basis) can help to reduce the risk of misunderstandings.",

      "title": "Gaze cueing is tuned to extract the mind behind the gaze: Investigations of 'gaze deflection'",
      "abstract": "The most salient 'social' visual stimuli we encounter are faces, and perhaps the most informative features of faces are eyes. Indeed, other people's eyes seem to be particularly meaningful to us, and perceived gaze can rapidly and automatically cause shifts of attention, as in the phenomenon of gaze cueing. But why is eye gaze so important? Presumably, gaze is meaningful not because of what it reveals about another person's eyes, but rather what it reveals about the mind behind the gaze — e.g. about what someone is attending to, or is intending to do. When you turn to look at something, however, it is not always because you are attending to it. Consider, for example, the familiar but unexplored phenomenon of 'gaze deflection' — when you are surreptitiously looking at someone and then suddenly look away when they catch you staring. In these cases, the 'deflected' gaze is not directed at anything in particular, but is only directed away from something (or someone) else. Do such 'deflected' gazes still orient other people's attention? To find out, we had subjects view videos of a person turning her head to look in a specific direction either to attend in that direction (Intentional gazes) or because she had just gotten caught staring at someone else and was looking away from that person (Deflected gazes). Gaze cueing (measured by the ability to identify a briefly flashed letter in the direction of a gaze) was stronger for Intentional gazes than for otherwise equivalent Deflected gazes — and this difference disappeared in control videos in which gaze did not appear to be 'deflected', even while controlling for other low-level visual properties. This shows how the process of gaze cueing is especially sophisticated — insofar as it is well-tuned to extract the 'mind' behind the gaze. Meeting abstract presented at VSS 2018",

      "abstract": "Atypical exemplars of taxonomic categories (e.g., clothing, furniture) differ from more typical exemplars along figurative dimensions of perceptual and contextual similarity. The advent of operational thought might be expected to facilitate category acquisition because it engenders a competence to suppress figurative dissimilarities and focus on nonfigurative similarities (e.g., common function). Age- and grade-equivalent preoperational and concrete operational groups were given oddity, sort, and category membership tasks with pictorial stimuli. Concrete operational subjects showed a greater appreciation than preoperational subjects for taxonomic relations involving atypical exemplars. Subjects of both cognitive levels could appreciate taxonomic relations involving strictly typical or moderately typical exemplars of a category. Results are interpreted as supporting a contention that meanings become more general with the emergence of operational thought. Superordinate concepts are abstract organizations such as clothing, furniture, fruit, and animal, having basic object concepts (e.g., skirt, pants; chair, table; apple, banana; bird, fish) as exemplars. The basic object level of a conceptual hierarchy is the most inclusive level at which the exemplars of a concept share a large number of features (Rosch, Mervis, Gray, Johnson,",

      "abstract": "Animals exhibit species-typical adaptations of behavior and may suffer stress in captivity if they are prevented from performing these patterns of behavior. This article considers whether these particular 'needs' rely on cognitive processes or are performed without complex cognition despite their appearance of behavioral complexity. Emotion and cognition in animals are also discussed, particularly whether animals can feel emotions and, if so, what ranges of emotions they might feel. Cognitive capacities that would contribute to suffering include empathy with the suffering of others, memories of negative events and suffering in anticipation of future events. Cognitive bias of individual animals toward positive or negative feelings is related to dominance of the left or right hemisphere, respectively. These biases might be reflected in the animal's preferred limb to pick up food. Hence, limb preference could be a useful measure of cognitive bias. Post-traumatic stress disorder is a cognitive condition that, it is suggested, might involve dominance of the right hemisphere. This debilitating condition is experience-dependent and not infrequently seen in animals in captivity. In conclusion, it is argued that there is an obvious need for more research on cognition as it relates to animal welfare and as a basis for changing legislature to protect animals from suffering.

      "abstract": "The proposition of the author is that sentences about sentences (meta-sentences or sentences of the 2nd order) about physical phenomena are examples of conscious thinking, i.e. the elements of consciousness. The argument is that psychical phenomena (acts of thinking or imagination) are phenomena of the second logical type: phenomena of phenomena. In other words, the individual psychical world (the world of individual consciousness) is described by a meta-theory of physics (meta-physics), while the social world (the world of social culture) can be described by a meta-meta-physics, i.e., by doubled-type description by means of sentences two logical types higher than those of the physical world. The objects in the physical world (particles, bodies, animals, persons, etc.) are defined as open systems, relatively isolated in a hypothetical physical closed universe, i.e., open systems having internal and external energy of interaction. The role of subconscious activity of the brain is also considered and explained, as well as the importance of genes and hormones for an emotional proto-language in animals and humans, and of the human language as a social software being the base for proper human consciousness. The aspect of open systems is here only slightly touched. It will be discussed in more details elsewhere.",

In inhabiting diverse environments, the human species has been forced to confront such limitations (of form and function), and develop resourcefulness to survive in the niche(s) we occupy. And, as in other species, our survival is dependent, at least in part, upon the ability to maximally adapt to, and/or compensate for, both biological and environmental constraint(s). Yet, as evidenced by history, human beings are achievers. This is shown by the artifacts of our existence: social structures, tools, and implements that represent a striving to overcome our (self-apparent and/or self-declared) frailties and shortcomings. In short, humans show a trend toward not merely surviving, but flourishing (Gow 2002).",

Dugas calls intimidation, to distuinguish it from reflective timidity, is ' due to the distress arising from the realization of the lack of sympathy between ourselves and our environment.'Reflection is apt to create a certain exaggeration of this feeling, so that the person affected ' begins to despise himself, to exaggerate his perplexities, and to pet his anger.'He is apt to isolate himself intellectually.While his thinking may be original, it will lack social adaptiveness.On the affective side there is a tendency to conceal sentiments of his own, and to distrust the sympathy of others.Hence the reserve that is characteristic of timidity.He may be further affected by a certain maladie d'iddal, or tendency to despise the things of ordinary life in comparison with his fancies.On the volitional side his acts are apt to be impulsive, and are often incomprehensible to himself, mainly because he no longer has the power of deliberate judgment.Finally, in its spontaneous form timidity marks a normal state in mental growth, that stands midway between the pure reflex life of the child and reflective mental life.Between the more abnormal form and genius a possible relation is suggested.The exclusiveness which the timide seeks, while it cannot of itself inspire art, may give occasion for its development.",

      "abstract": "Behavioral pediatrics begins, as a discipline, with at least two important assumptions: (1) that all human experiences have psychosocial as well as biological or organic contexts; and (2) that the biological substrate with which the child is born is modifiable. Thus, behavioral pediatrics, by its own definitions and assumptions, initiates research questions at the biobehavioral interface.1 This paper attempts to delineate a number of research directions that may be used to investigate the complex relationships between behavioral and biological factors in behavioral pediatrics. Research investigating biobehavioral processes can be approached on a number of different levels. The research can be organized in terms of the following specific causal assumptions relating behavioral and biological factors: (1) a parallel model; (2) a causal model in which behavioral factors influence biological factors; (3) a causal model in which biological factors determine behavior; and (4) a causal model in which there is bidirectional causality. 1. Parallels Between Behavior and Biology. This model assumes that there is no directional causality. Behavioral and biological factors represent parallel systems sharing a common underlying organization. Behavioral and physiological variables may be viewed as different levels of the same system, mediated by central nervous system processes. Various screening methods are based on this model. Research questions dealing with this model focus on indexing and predicting developmental outcome. Techniques such as the Neonatal Behavioral Assessment Scale2 or the identification of sleep patterns3 evaluate behavioral patterns and attempt to identify neurophysiological or neurological dysfunction. Similarly, physiological response patterns such as infant cry patterns4 or heart rate variability measures such as cardiac vagal tone5 have been used to predict developmental outcome when the behavioral repertoire is too limited to be useful in predicting subsequent behavior.",

      "abstract": "Scorn and disdain can hardly be distinguished from contempt, excepting that they imply a rather more angry frame of mind. Nor can they be clearly distinguished from the feelings discussed in the last chapter under the terms of sneering and defiance. Disgust is a sensation rather more distinct in its nature, and refers to something revolting, primarily in relation to the sense of taste, as actually perceived or vividly imagined; and secondarily to anything which causes a similar feeling, through the sense of smell, touch, and even of eyesight. Nevertheless, extreme contempt, or, as it is often called, loathing contempt, hardly differs from disgust. These several conditions of the mind are, therefore, nearly related; and each of them may be exhibited in many different ways. Some writers have insisted chiefly on one mode of expression, and others on a different mode. From this circumstance M. Lemoine has argued that their descriptions are not trustworthy. But we shall immediately see that it is natural that the feelings which we have here to consider should be expressed in many different ways, inasmuch as various habitual actions serve equally well, through the principle of association, for their expression.",

      "title": "Effects of postnatal light environment on the development of the mouse stress system",
      "abstract": "The postnatal period is a critical time for development where external influences can help shape the long-term structure and function of the brain. Adverse experiences or stressors during the postnatal period, such as abuse or neglect, can have huge consequences on the long term function, health and susceptibility to disease. One environmental factor, whose importance is becoming increasingly more recognised for normal development, is light. Abnormal light during the first three weeks of life has been shown to have long term effects on the circadian system of rodents. On the other hand, the effects of abnormal light during the postnatal period on the stress system have yet been relatively unexplored. Therefore the aim of this thesis was to assess if altered postnatal light environment, such as that a preterm baby might be exposed to, has any long-term effects on the stress system.Mice were raised under constant light (LL), constant darkness (DD) or a normal 12:12hr light:dark cycle (LD) for the first three weeks of life from postnatal day (P)1 up until P21. From P21, all mice were then housed in LD conditions and the stress system was assessed by looking at several different levels of the HPA axis including neuropeptide expression in the brain, body and adrenal weight, and plasma corticosterone levels under both basal and stressed conditions. Learning and memory, anxiety-like behaviour and circadian output rhythms were also evaluated. Finally, mother-pup behaviour and maternal HPA axis were assessed to see if maternal care was changed by altered postnatal light.Both LL and DD rearing caused changes in the HPA axis of offspring with LL raised mice showing alterations in neuropeptide and glucocorticoid receptor expression in the brain. Postnatal DD resulted in a blunted corticosterone response to a stressor in females but had no effect in males. In terms of behaviour, LL raised mice had increased depressive-like behaviour. In contrast, postnatal light appears to have no effect on learning and memory or anxiety behaviour. When we looked at circadian output rhythms, we found that LL rearing appears to confer resilience to the rhythm disrupting effects of LL later on in life as seen by the maintenance of locomotor activity, body temperature and plasma corticosterone rhythms in LL. Maternal care and maternal stress systems appeared unaltered under the different postnatal light environments suggesting that the changes we see in the offspring are attributed to mechanisms other than alterations in maternal care.",

      "abstract": "In summary, then, moods are ordinary psychic phenomenon which serve important unconscious functions. Like the dream, a mood has a kind of necessary autistic structure to it: people who are in a mood, like persons who are asleep, are inside a special state where a temporal element is at play. They will emerge, like the dreamer, after the spell is over. Some moods, particularly those that are a part of a person's character, are occasions for the expression of a conservative object, as a conservative object is that internal self state that has been preserved intact during childhood often upon some breakdown between the child in relation to his parents. When a person goes 'into' a mood he becomes that child self who was refused expression in relation to his parents for one reason or another. As such, moods are often the existential registers of the moment of a breakdown between a child and his parents, and partly notate the parent's own developmental arrest, in that the parent was unable to deal appropriately with the child's particular maturational needs. What was a self experience in the child, one that could have been integrated into the child's continuing self development, was rejected by the parents, who failed to perform adequately as ordinary 'transformational objects', thereby destining a self state to be frozen by the child into a conservative object that fated such a state of being to be subsequently represented only through moods.",

      "abstract": "Placebo effects are traditionally viewed as standalone phenomena, that is as discrete human or perhaps mammalian systems 'switched on' by environmental cues and thereby changing perception and/or behaviour. But as Emma Cohen (Chapter 5) has noted, they are likely integrated into a far broader self-regulatory milieu. Placebo effects are also often considered in the cognitive domain; for example, new information about a treatment or technology is received, that information is consciously processed, thereby changing the way we think about the situation, and a revised interpretation of the balance between demands and resources emerges, leading to a modification of one or more resource allocation strategies, either consciously (e.g., motivation, pacing) or unconsciously (e.g., modulated neurotransmitter signalling, modified pain or fatigue thresholds). This is a reasonable account. But when placebo effects are viewed not through the lens of cognition but through that of emotion, an equally reasonable account emerges; that the new information changes the way we feel about the situation, and those changes – evident in new emotions – modify homeostasis to facilitate the optimal response to the environment, which is arguably one of the core adaptive functions of emotion. In fact, arguably – and especially given the crossover in mechanisms and effects – placebo effects are a special case of emotions, a special case in which the emotion is defined by a deceptive or erroneous input that nonetheless leads to a more positive status for the person.",

      "abstract": "Six accidental cases caused by overlooking latent environmental danger were analyzed and the geneses and mechanism of the human error involved were discussed. In all cases detection of the danger was easy or indications by some warning were distinct. In a typical case, a lineman, after cleaning the insulators of a suspended line, proceeded toward the danger zone of another line charged with current on reaching the ground. He disregarded the warning flag, and received a shock and fell to the ground. It was also common in all the other cases that victims were conducting relatively easy or habitual activities and responded, being almost unaware of the unusual physical characteristics of the environment, to its more apparent aspects. These errors were relevant to experimental results by the author that subjects had great difficulty in identifying the rule of presentation of signal figures if the key item and the rule, either serial or positional, were different from foregoing trials. It is suggested that an individual fails to see an external object that has little function value in regard to the content of the current behavior under influence of personal habitual experiences and the theories of human error need to be reconstruct as the basis of ecological knowledge about them.",

      "title": "Expressions: Embodiment in the experience of design",
      "abstract": "EXPRESSIONS: EMBODIMENT IN THE EXPERIENCE OF DESIGN Products are not just objects by means of which we get things done. Apart from bringing aesthetic pleasures, for instance, they may also embody values we hold dear, communicate our fine taste to others, and help us define who we are. These widely varying functionalities are rooted in our capacity to perceive essentially lifeless forms as dynamic objects expressive of basic human experiences. This expressiveness forms the starting point for this thesis. Perceiving products as expressive in most cases comes most natural. One may readily perceive one object as distant, another as involved, and yet another as humble or proud, for instance, and at the same have an intuitive sense of what it is in a products appearance that contributes to a particular expression. However, the moment one questions why specific product features connote the expressive or figurative meanings they do, one often finds that accounting for a products expression is not always that easy or straightforward. In this thesis, we therefore seek to account for the relations between a products appearance and its expressiveness. In the first chapter different perspectives on expression are presented. This discussion revolves around the tendency, common among researchers studying product expression, to focus primarily on either the object perceived or its perceiver. In the former approach figurative or expressive characteristics are considered authentic and objective qualities, conveyed by perceptual features such as shape and size. In the latter approach these characteristics do not belong to the object but rather to the perceiver. In this line of reasoning, the objects expressiveness is primarily seen as a mental construction. Although studies originating in these approaches in one way or the other acknowledge the importance of both constituents, American philosopher John Dewey, as early as 1934, pointed out the necessity of simultaneously taking into account the contributions of both object and perceiver in studying the objects expressiveness. His notions lie at the basis of a relatively new approach that seeks to account for figurative or expressive meanings in terms of spatial-relational structures characterizing interactions between people and their environment. Since these interactions are constrained by the peculiarities of the human body, studies originating in this approach view such meanings as essentially embodied. Central to this interactional approach is the notion that specific types of interactions give rise to particular kinds of experiences. Interactions characterized by a sense of containment (e.g., seeking shelter from the storm inside a cabin, or taking refuge inside ones office to get some work done) may give rise to a sense of safety or security (for reasons of protection from threatening or disruptive influences), but at the same time to a sense of isolation from others (i.e., a container separates those inside from those outside) or constriction (i.e., a container limits ones freedom of movement). The spatial-relational structure these interactions have in common (in our example all interactions involve a bounded space in which one can be in or out) is referred to as an image schema. The central assumption of this thesis is that products can make reference to such spatial-relational structures through their visual-spatial appearance. This perceived congruence is expected to lie at the basis of the understanding of products as expressive. (Arguably, a product making reference to the containment schema is for that reason perceived as expressing degrees of security, isolation, and constriction.) In the second chapter we put this claim to a first test. Regardless of the manner in which products make reference to an image schema, ratings of products on experiences arising from the same type of interactions should be highly related. Products generally rated high on secure, for instance, should also receive high ratings on constricting (i.e., both experiences arise from interactions characterized by a sense of containment). The results of a study in which 10 chairs were rated on a wide variety of expressive characteristics were in line with this prediction. Following this confirmation, in the third chapter we explore the manner in which a product can make reference to spatial-relational (i.e., image schematic) structures through its form features. Based on a tentative discussion of the manner in which chairs and bus shelters can embody image schematic structures, in the third chapter form features of two everyday products (a jug and an alarm clock) are manipulated on the basis of the spatial-relational structure of three image schemas. Following our line of reasoning, we should be able to predict the effects of these manipulations on the objects figurative or expressive meanings. Secondly, the effects of these manipulations might be expected to show considerable consistency across cultures since interactions between people and their environment are highly similar, regardless of the region in which they take place. Our bodies, that is, show little variation, and the same applies, at least to some extent, to the environment we interact with. The results of the two experiments testing the first claim (one involving students of design, the other involving participants who had no background in design) were largely in line with our predictions. The findings from the same experiment conducted in Brazil, testing the second claim, were only partly as predicted. Having established a solid scientific basis for our project, in the fourth chapter we set out to make our approach actionable. That is, how can the insights be of practical relevance for designers intent on creating a particular expression? To provide an answer to that question we explored different ways to study the spatial-relational structures characterizing interactions giving rise to a particular experience. In one such study 11 designers were asked to design a public smoking object with a particular expression. Did these designers think of the guidelines as inspiring and useful? In order to answer these questions we discuss a questionnaire that revealed that the designers had thought of the guidelines as both inspiring and useful. However, comparison of the results of these designers to those of 11 designers receiving no special guidelines failed to confirm our prediction that the latter would be less successful in creating a particular product expression. In closing this chapter, possible explanations for this lack of differentiation are discussed. In the fifth and final chapter the most striking findings and implications of the studies discussed in previous chapters are reviewed. A large part of this chapter is devoted to a discussion of metaphor. The understanding of product expression discussed in previous chapters is metaphorical in so far as products are understood in terms of experiences that have their origin in embodied interactions in and with the environment. But not all metaphors are of this embodied type. Next to making a distinction between two types of metaphor (i.e., embodied metaphors and metaphors not, or to a lesser degree, grounded in embodied interactions), we elaborate on a fascinating aspect characterizing our understanding of the embodied metaphors discussed throughout this thesis. This understanding, we argue, presupposes an identification process by which we project our own embodied experiences onto the object via perspective taking. In closing this thesis, directions for further research are suggested. In addition, we speculate on the relevance of our findings for studies addressing facets of product experience not or sparsely discussed in this thesis, such as the expressiveness of product- materials or sounds, and the role of contextual factors.",

The essential message to understand is that the behaviors commonly considered as indications of stray voltage are general behavior responses. These changes should not be considered specific to stray voltage. This is particularly relevant in cases where stray voltage is resolved, but abnormal behaviors do not decrease.&#x0D; Abnormal or undesired animal behaviors usually have their origins in the very basic psychological makeup of an animal.

      "title": "Not all perceptual experience is modality specific",
      "abstract": "Humans see, hear, touch, smell, and taste. Episodes of human sensory perceptual experience accordingly are associated with several ways or modes—modalities— of perceiving. Perceptual experiences may be visual, auditory, tactual, olfactory, or gustatory. If there are more or fewer modalities, name them and adjust accordingly. Individual human subjects commonly see and hear at the same time; or hear and smell; or see, hear, and smell; and so on. Most times while you are awake, your perceptual experience is associated with more than one modality. Perceptual experience is, in this minimal respect, multimodal. 1 Recent science demonstrates that the senses do not act merely in parallel or in isolation from each other. Different senses interact and influence each other, and this affects perceptual experience. 2 For instance, cross-modal perceptual illusions occur when stimulation to one sensory system impacts experience associated with another modality in a way that leads to misperception. The ventriloquist effect, for example, is an auditory spatial illusion generated by the visible location of an apparent sound source. It does not follow that perceptual experience fails to remain modality specific. Sensory processes might interact causally while all perceptual experiences nevertheless belong to particular modalities. One sense might causally but not constitutively impact perceptual experience that is associated with another. 1 If it were associated at most with one modality at a time, human perceptual experience at a time instead would be unimodal. See Spence and Bayne (this volume). I resist the unimodal experience view for the following reasons. The view is most plausible if (a) consciousness requires attention and if (b) attention is restricted to a single modality at a time. However, (a) is controversial, and it is possible that we do perceptually experience things that are outside the focus of attention. Even so, there are good arguments for rejecting (b) and holding that attention can range over more than one modality at a time. For instance, it is plausible that there can be multimodal objects of attention (see x2.2; see also, e.g., Karns and Knight 2009). Nevertheless, even rejecting all of this, it is plausible that the temporal grain of the experienced present is coarser than that of conscious shifts between modalities, and that there are no temporal gaps between experiences of distinct modalities, which implies that there are times during which experience is at least minimally multimodal. 2 See O’Callaghan (2012) for extended discussion.",

The key notion of the given study, accessories in particular, enjoys frequency of occurrence in daily speech due to the necessity to refer to various objects for some reasons: 1) to assist activity, to add something for improving the process, e.g. skiing accessories for implementing skiing and making it safer; 2) to complete an outfit, e.g. bag, necktie, gloves, hat, shoes; 3) to make something useful or good-looking, e.g. shoulder strap, battery charger, probing accessory (the later means contact measuring devices). As a rule, asking for or searching for some object, there is no need to say accessories, the word with the general meaning, since it’s easier to deliver a message clearly if we mention an object required by the situation, e.g. a belt instead of vague fashion accessories.",

      "title": "The concept of a human action",
      "abstract": "This analysis of the concept of a human action takes its point of departure in the fact that actions are things done by persons. But people do many things which do not qualify as actions. A necessary condition for calling something done an action, is that the agent intends or means something by it, in the sense that the agent has some specific end in mind. Thus an action may be said to be the externalization, realization, or expression of the agent's meaning. But what precisely are such meanings or intentions that are given expression in actions? How are they to be distinguished from other mental contents ? The author tries to answer these questions by distinguishing them, on the one hand, from experiences, sensations, feelings, and, on the other hand, from other thoughts and meanings that do not find expression in the action. It is claimed that this account of action explains many characteristics of actions: that actions are appraised, not described (because meanings are evaluated), that an action is regarded as a unity (because the meaning is a unity), that the intention and the performance are not causally related, but related as are the content and expression of linguistic utterances, etc.",

      "title": "Eunuchs in the Byzantine Empire",
      "abstract": "By the term eunuchos, as well as by the terms thladias (a man whose testicles were intentionally crushed), spadon (a eunuch due to natural reasons), and ektomias (a castrated man), which designated different types of eunuchs, the Byzantines identified any male person deprived, fully or in part, of his genitals. This may have occurred in early childhood or at a later age, of his own will, through natural processes, or by the acts of others, and it may have happened for moral, medical, or economic purposes. A eunuch could also be any person who, for natural reasons, a lack of hygiene, or other reasons, had become permanently or temporarily unfit to procreate, or even, in some cases, to sexually perform. These terms also appear in theological contexts to reflect the situation of pre- or post-lapsarian man, as well as to sometimes denote the angels. Therefore, as a concept expressed through many terms, eunuch referred to a variety of cases and people, situations, and behaviors; at the same time, it alluded to the biblical imaginary and the theological symbolism established upon it. However, the secondary literature dedicated to eunuchs has until now mainly focused on the ektomiai, or castrati, and the roles they assumed in Byzantine society. The history of the study of eunuchs in Byzantium closely follows and, in a way, exemplifies the ways in which modern historians have viewed Byzantium itself more generally (i.e., in close relation to the values of their own societies). In general, moving past the strongly orientalist perspective which prevailed in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, scholars proceeded to study the role of eunuchs in the administration of state and Church. Eunuchs are treated in these approaches as a separate category of people or as influential individuals who were sometimes even worthy of a biography. In recent years, eunuchs have begun to be treated as sexual beings and a discussion has arisen concerning the question of whether they constituted a third sex or gender or whether they remained within the margins of the sexual dimorphism that was seen as a divinely established ‘reality.’ These approaches, which appeared successively, are now studied in a comprehensive fashion and have given rise to a fairly diversified bibliographical landscape, where the study of the political role of eunuchs coexists with that which focuses on their sexual identity. An openly orientalist (and regressive) approach nevertheless remains present in publications for the general public and in historical novels.",

      "title": "Moral Traces and Relational Autonomy",
      "abstract": "One feature of James Childress's approach to ethics is the experience of \"moral traces\" that agents ought to feel in situations of conflict after they have overridden one strong value for the sake of another.1 This experience grasps at something intuitive about the moral life, that in situations of intense moral conflict when we are faced with a choice to act in a way that goes against a deeply held value, it is morally important that we feel and respond a certain way. At the most immediate level, this might entail privately mourning or grieving that we had to violate the value. Doing so would affirm that we care about the overridden value, and by acknowledging such a care we would feel that our moral integrity has been protected. But shouldn't the concept of moral traces entail more than a private process of grief? Shouldn't it have an effect on our relations with others? Moral traces ought to obligate us to act toward others in certain ways, and in that sense it is a concept quite distinct from the pangs of conscience we feel when we have behaved badly. At the very least, these traces ought to press us to offer an explanation or justification to others for why we acted against an important moral value, especially if those others were affected negatively by our action. In more extreme cases, we might even be compelled to make amends or offer reparations to the one or ones who were harmed by our action.2In this article I am interested in sorting through the ways that moral traces function in the moral life, especially in terms of the work they do in maintaining and building social and institutional relationships. I want to suggest that moral traces are more than an internal attitude that pertains to individual flourishing; they are also integral to communal well-being. By pointing to a contrast between moral traces as important for individual flourishing and moral traces as conducive to increased communal well-being, I also hope to expand our thinking about the liberal principle of autonomy that is central to Childress's approach. I am motivated in this article by a worry that some might use the appeal to moral traces to reinforce an individualistic, psychological notion of the self. This is clearly something that Childress does not do, as can be seen in his 1970 Soundings article, \"Who Shall Live When Not All Can Live?\" There he tethers the equitable distribution of scarce medical resources firmly to the maintenance of relationships of trust. In later writings, he explicitly outlines the obligations to others that emerge in situations when an important value has been overridden. Relationships of trust and the obligations to others incurred by moral traces both point to a conception of agency that is relational.In what follows, I hope to suggest the broad contours of an account of moral traces that highlights its relational features. Looking at moral traces through a relational lens accentuates, and perhaps even intensifies, the obligations that they incur. Put differently, relational conceptions of autonomy require a more careful account of moral traces—one that focuses on what we owe one another. By a relational conception of autonomy, I mean a view of agency that sees the choices we make as shaped by our relations with and commitment to others. Highlighting moral traces as central to the moral life is a way to recognize the importance of human accountability, which ensures that we are always fully aware of how our actions affect others. Ultimately, the significance of the effect of moral traces does not lie simply in protecting an agent's integrity or sense of herself as morally whole but rather in how it promotes the building and maintaining of relations.Annette Baier makes this point eloquently in her critique of Michael Stocker's account of moral guilt—a concept that, while not exactly synonymous with moral traces, does share a family resemblance. She notes that although Stocker is concerned about the effects of moral dilemmas, his \"attention is given to the emotions of choosers, not to the feelings of the victims or beneficiaries of their choices\" (1992, 363). At another point, Baier refers to the \"dirty hands\" metaphor as pushing us \"into a Lady Macbeth frame of mind, obsessed with our own stained character rather than what we have done to others and how that felt for them\" (363).3 It is precisely this sense of how those harmed by our actions might feel that makes moral traces such a central component of a relational account of morality. Baier writes, \"Without a moral psychology that puts informed empathy and willingness to listen to others' point of view squarely in the center of our moral-psychological capacities, without a social interactive account both of rationality and of morality, the constraints that moral psychology can put on what counts as 'a more acceptable version of ethics' will be merely formal and very limited\" (365).While Childress does not use the term moral traces in his early Soundings article, he does offer some brief thoughts that hint at its further development in later writings. His short mention of moral guilt in this article serves as an impetus for my reflections about how moral traces can serve a relationship-building or maintaining purpose. I begin by assessing what he says in the Soundings article, especially as it relates to the view of the theologian Helmut Thielicke, whom Childress discusses in this article. I then look to Childress's discussion of moral traces in later writings on war, bioethics, and public health. Finally, as a way to further examine the relational implications of the concept, I turn to two fairly recent concepts in the bioethics literature: moral distress in nursing ethics and \"the patient as victim and vector model\" in public health ethics. While certainly not identical to Childress's conception of moral traces, these concepts reinforce a similar sentiment about relationality and our obligations to others in difficult moral cases. They also help us see that moral traces are not only located in the individual conscience or in the moral universe more generally; their effects are also embodied in institutional procedures.4 This echoes Childress's sentiment in the 1970 Soundings article that one of the tasks of social ethics is \"to propose relatively just institutional arrangements within which self-interested and biased men can live\" (Childress 1970, 342).In the 1970 article \"Who Shall Live When Not All Can Live?,\" James Childress makes a passing reference to a concept that forms a connective tissue through the corpus of his work in areas as diverse as conscience, war, and bioethics. He suggests that the allocation of scarce lifesaving medical resources (SLMR) presents us with \"'borderline situations' which inevitably involve guilt\" (1970, 175). He borrows the phrase \"borderline situations\" from the German theologian Helmut Thielicke, who had only recently addressed the issue of allocation of scarce lifesaving resources at a symposium held in Texas. It is not fully clear in his brief discussion of Thielicke whether or not Childress believes that decisions about allocating scarce medical resources must involve guilt.5 He writes, \"Even if all actions in SLMR should involve guilt, some may preserve human dignity to a greater extent than others\" (347). What is clear, however, is that he distances himself from Thielicke's view that the best humans can do in the face of these borderline situations is \"to understand and endure—not 'solve'\" them. By contrast, Childress believes that one can make discriminating judgments using the tools of ethics so that even our choices about \"who shall live when not all can live\" are informed by the notion that some decisions may \"preserve human dignity to a greater extent than others.\" For him the preservation of human dignity is achieved through a careful evaluation of the factors and norms in a given situation. Thus, whereas for Thielicke, any ethical judgment in such situations is flawed, Childress holds more optimistically that reasoned ethical judgments are possible. For both of them, however, the agent's realization that she is affected in some way by such difficult moral choices is important to her human flourishing. What is unclear in this brief reference is the nature and extent of this effect on the moral agent. Does it morally obligate her to make some sort of amends, or does it simply do its work on a psychological level in terms of ensuring that the overridden principle does not lose its potency?Thielicke's ideas about moral guilt are both deeply existential and deeply theological. For Thielicke, the guilt that results from moral dilemmas is debilitating to the point that it leaves the Christian moral agent with very few viable options. Indeed, he does not see the task of evangelical theological ethics as providing easy answers or solutions to ethical problems.6 Roman Catholic casuistry and its legalistic and naturalistic theology falls prey to this temptation. He uses the term \"borderline situations\" (Grenzsituation) to depict what he calls \"abnormal cases,\" ones that involve \"transitions or complications\" (Thielicke 1966, 578).7 The prime example of such a situation for Christians, according to Thielicke, is when they must use the methods of their evil opponent, as in the case of the duty to fight oppressive tyrannical dictatorships. Thus the individual Christian, especially if he holds political responsibility, is \"ineluctably forced into a situation in which he must act within a framework of injustice\" (585). What such situations teach Christians is that the world is fallen: \"man has perverted his world, and no man is exempt from sharing responsibility for this human character of his world, this demonic humanizing of the world. No man is merely the object of a conflict situation. We are all part of the human subject that helped to bring it about\" (597). Thus what is communal about this guilt for Thielicke is that the difficult moral conflict serves to remind Christians of their ongoing guilt as children of Adam. The borderline situation has its \"origin in a communal guilt which already stands behind our situation and which we for our part ever increase and intensify…. We are both channels and perpetrators of cosmic guilt\" (602).Borderline questions, according to Thielicke, \"preclude the possibility of any final answers.\" He writes, \"The questions must remain open\" (1970, 147). The impossibility of any final answers to difficult moral dilemmas is firmly grounded in certain theological presuppositions, such as human sinfulness. Thielicke understands the human condition of sin as a usurpation of man's limits—a going beyond the limits to which humans are destined. Put differently, it is that man \"has placed himself in sinful contradiction to the destiny for which he was created\" (154). In essence, human creativity—the ability to transform nature into culture—is always tainted by humanity's inability to accept its destiny as God's creatures. Humans are always pressing the boundaries of their creatureliness. He contrasts the Christian view that identifies suffering with human guilt and responsibility to secular ideas that attribute life's tragedy to the structures of the world. He writes, \"In myth … this world which is no longer whole tends to be regarded as something given, an intact structure in which guilt and fate are inseparably interwoven. The Bible, on the contrary, looks instead at man. It sees not the structure, but this personal representative of our disjointed world\" (156).Human sinfulness is not manifested in particular actions. Rather it is the very structure of human existence that is the root of human guilt. In essence, for Thielicke, there is no possible choice that a human can make in the face of any moral decision that would relieve her of this existential guilt: \"It is a matter of being, not action\" (164). Yet there are certain types of situations in which human decisions and human actions can bring about greater guilt. Indeed it is the experience of guilt that is a measure of the person's moral health and well-being. Like a wound that cannot be allowed to heal, the guilt one feels when making difficult moral decisions such as allocating scarce medical resources is difficult. In contrast to the utilitarian who is able to make a decision with clear-cut objective criteria, the moral person must suffer the anguish of the \"impossibility of the task.\" Her suffering is felt in \"pangs of conscience\" that are \"a kind of gauze placed in the wound to prevent its healing in the wrong way.\" Continuing with the metaphor, he insists that while the wound must not be closed, it must not be allowed to infect the moral actor: \"The pus of the insoluble dilemma must have some way of escaping. Otherwise, the very humanity of the physician himself becomes infected; he succumbs to the illusion of the easy solution\" (173). Only by keeping the wound open does Thielicke believe that humans can arrive at an awareness of the very essence of what it is to be human.The most obvious contrast between Thielicke and Childress in the Soundings article is that Childress's view of human guilt is not explicitly connected to theological and existential ideas about the ongoing guilt of humans before God. Thielicke's view of cosmic guilt undermines his confidence that any method of deciding how to allocate scarce lifesaving devices can ever really be justifiable. He invokes casting lots, but unlike Childress, his endorsement of it is lukewarm at best. He sees it as an unsatisfactory option but perhaps the best one humans have available to them in such a situation.There are two points from the Soundings article that are relevant to my attempt to rethink the concept of moral traces. First, while Childress's view about guilt in \"borderline situations\" is not explicitly developed in the article, his engagement with Thielicke is illuminating because I believe it foreshadows his later emphasis on moral traces. Thielicke's insistence that the \"wound\" should not infect the actor supports my contention that moral traces ought to do more than simply affect the individual; they must incur some sense of obligation to others. Second, Childress bases his strong support of random selection on the belief that it is the best option for maintaining human dignity, equality, and trust. All three of these values are, in his view, important for building and maintaining relationships. Childress is explicit about this in several places in the article. Quoting Paul Ramsey, he describes equality of opportunity \"as the ethical substance of the relations of those individuals to one another\"(Childress 1970, 348). In another passage, he describes trust as \"an attitude of expectation about another,\" namely, the expectation that one will be treated with respect (349).When we turn to Childress's 1978 article on just war in Theological Studies, we begin to see the full development of the concept of moral traces. In this more extended discussion, he situates them within \"the logic of prima-facie duties.\" Relying on the moral philosopher W. D. Ross, he argues that prima facie obligations are more binding than relative principles that function like rules of thumb, and less binding than absolute principles that can never be overridden. Thus, a prima facie obligation is \"intrinsically binding, but it does not necessarily determine one's actual obligation\" (1978, 430). A central component of the logic of these conflicting obligations is that \"an overridden or outweighed prima-facie obligation continues to function in the situation and the course of action one adopts\" (431; emphasis mine). Childress explicitly uses the phrases \"moral traces\" and \"residual effects\" in this article to describe how the outweighed obligation \"continues to function.\"He also turns to A. C. Ewing, who specifies more clearly how the overridden obligation continues to have a hold on the moral agent. For Ewing this hold results in a \"mental attitude\" that evokes regret, but even more important, that ought to affect the agent's future actions. Ewing writes, \"My omission to fulfill my prima facie duty to him in this case will increase the force of any prima facie obligations I may have to him as regards future actions. And even if it did not affect overt action, the existence of a prima facie obligation not to do it should always affect our mental attitude towards an action.\" Ewing describes the mental attitude as \"a positive thing even if not translated into action\" and writes further that \"a good man will at least regret the violation of prima facie duties\" (1959, 110). In a footnote, Childress comments that for W. D. Ross, the appropriate response to an overridden obligation is not shame or repentance but rather compunction.Childress's views about the intensity of this mental attitude after a moral conflict are not fully developed in this discussion. Yet he manages to introduce a broad array of terms to describe it: residual effects, regret, shame, repentance, compunction. He seems to favor the terms—traces and residue—that suggest a less intense effect on the moral agent. Elsewhere in the article, he claims more directly that guilt is not the appropriate emotional attitude in such cases. He supports, without fully developing, a notion of \"creative regret\" that he borrows from Albert R. Di Ianni (Childress 1978, 433). However, in discussing the jus ad bellum criterion of \"right intention\" as the maintenance of proper motives, he states \"an attitude of regret, if not remorse, is appropriate when a prima-facie obligation is overridden\" (438). Such a clear statement equating moral traces with regret is not typical of his discussions in later work, such as Principles of Bioethics (PBE).Nevertheless, in his view, overriding a principle does lead to specific obligations. These are most explicit in his discussion of the jus in bello criteria—the criteria that govern how to conduct war. His primary point is that even though a just war requires one to overrule the prima facie obligation not to injure or kill another, the hold that the obligation has on the moral agent is not \"overruled.\" In other words, the agent still must discharge some obligations to the other—and these obligations require that (1) the immediate object of war is not to kill or even injure, (2) one ought not directly target noncombatants, (3) one cannot impose \"unnecessary suffering,\" and (4) any effect (even if only indirect) of war on civilians \"must be justified by the principle of proportion\" (441). By connecting moral traces to the jus in bello criteria, Childress reinforces a notion that these traces are more than just an internal wound or disposition, and instead constitute an attitude that necessarily entails an obligation to minimize the harms caused by overriding a prima facie duty.When we turn our attention to Childress's later work, especially in PBE, we see that moral traces play a significant role in two ways: to remind the agent that prima facie duties are not neutral values and to highlight the centrality of conscience and integrity as virtues in the practice of medicine. The account of the logic of prima facie duties in PBE follows quite closely the account presented in the earlier just-war article. For example, Childress and his coauthor, Tom Beauchamp, argue that when overriding a prima facie obligation, there will always be traces of \"regret and a sense of moral residue.\" They write, \"Moral residue results because an overridden prima facie obligation does not simply go away when overridden\" (Beauchamp and Childress 2009, 19). While overlapping in some ways with their discussion of conscience, the two concepts remain distinct. Childress describes conscience as \"an internal sanction that comes into play through critical reflection.\" While this sanction may have different forms, he notes that it \"often appears as a bad conscience—in the form of feelings of remorse, guilt, shame, disunity, or disharmony—as the individual recognizes his or her acts as wrong\" (44). The sanction of a bad conscience is different from the feeling of moral traces, because with the former, the agent feels that the act she performed is wrong. Moral traces, by contrast, imply that one has \"residual obligations\" or that one needs to at least acknowledge internally that an important obligation or value has been sacrificed, but not that the act itself is wrong. Nevertheless, moral traces share with the conscience the ability to help repair any disunity or disharmony that the agent may have experienced in the context of the difficult dilemma.One final example of the role of moral traces in Childress's work comes from his writings on the moral foundations of public health. Along with several colleagues, he has suggested that public health officials must satisfy five justificatory conditions when choosing to override individual liberty or justice. These are effectiveness, proportionality, necessity, least infringement, and public justification. It is the last of these that I think illustrates most clearly the connection between moral traces and obligations. In particular, the public health setting provides an example of institutional obligations that result from acknowledging that an important value has been overridden. The responsibility that public officials have in this regard is \"to explain and justify that infringement, whenever possible, to the relevant parties, including those affected by the infringement.\" They must offer moral reasons because they are required to \"treat citizens as equals\" (Childress et al. 2002, 173). This activity of accountability to the public is, in Childress's words, \"indispensable for engendering and sustaining public trust, as well as for expressing justice.\" It involves actively seeking ways to engage the public with the decisions being made on its behalf. This engagement involves seeking out the public's input, maintaining transparency about the process, and providing relevant information to the public. Although Childress and his coauthors do not use the language of moral traces in this discussion of public justification, their appeal to the obligations that public authorities have when they have infringed upon or overridden important moral values is a by-product of the traces. Childress's emphasis on ongoing obligations illustrates his belief that difficult moral decisions do not come to an abrupt end; they do not disappear. Rather, responsible moral agents ought to continue to act and feel in ways that acknowledge the ongoing implications of these decisions.What can we conclude about Childress's view of moral traces from this quick summary of his work? First, it seems clear that he does not see moral traces as identical to moral regret. Individuals can experience moral traces while being sure that they made the right decision in difficult moral situation. In other words, they are not wishing that they had done something else.8 Rather, they are taking the implications of what they did seriously. Second, his view of moral traces as incurring ongoing obligations supports an account of agency that is relational. This conclusion runs counter to prevailing critiques of Childress's \"principlism\" that depict it as grounded in a conception of the agent as an isolated, atomistic individual.Accounts of personhood as relational have become fairly commonplace in normative ethical discussions, especially ones that are informed by feminist, virtue, narrative, or communitarian visions. The \"relational self\" is usually posited over against the individualistic moral agent believed to be prevalent in certain liberal philosophical approaches. This individualistic vision of autonomy is also commonly associated with bioethics discourse, especially with Childress's approach.9 Critics of autonomy worry about the tendency to see the self as independent and separate from the discursive contexts that shape our commitments and values. They think a more accurate description of moral agency is one of responsiveness to the particularities of situations and to the network of dependencies that enable individuals to flourish. While the emphasis on particularity and dependency has been appealing to many feminist theorists, some have rejected a wholesale abandonment of autonomy as potentially antithetical to feminist political goals. They are skeptical of views that mistakenly stereotype individual autonomy as fundamentally individualistic and rationalistic. Thus they want to salvage autonomy because of the central role they believe it plays in feminist analyses of oppression, subjection, and agency. The model of relational autonomy has emerged as a useful hybrid that takes the concerns raised by critics of autonomy seriously without abandoning the important function of respect for the dignity of the individual.10The principle of autonomy is clearly central to Childress's ethics. Even in the Soundings article, we can see that he supports random selection for the allocation of scarce medical resources because it preserves respect for dignity and autonomy. Yet it is important to note that for Childress this respect for autonomy does not preclude attention to relationships. Indeed, it is intimately tied to the attitudes of trust necessary for society to function. Trust provides us with one example of a deeply relational concept that is intimately tied to respect for autonomy, insofar as it reflects our ultimate respect for the other's dignity and humanity. Childress's emphasis on moral traces and the obligations they produce also supports a concept of autonomy that is attentive to human relationships. While Childress avoids pressing moral traces and regret into the stronger realms of remorse or guilt, his emphasis on residual obligations in the contexts of war, bioethics, and public health suggests that the effects of moral traces extend beyond individual conscience. They require the moral agent to attend to the impact of her act on human relationships, both private and public. This suggests that for Childress, no moral decision exists in an isolated vacuum. We cannot thus speak of individual autonomy apart from the broader social contexts that all humans inhabit. As Courtney Campbell reminds us, certain elements of Childress's theology—namely, his claims about humans created in God's image—provide the basis for a view of autonomy that goes against certain secular notions of autonomy that privilege individualism and self-determination. Childress's theologically informed view of autonomy, according to Campbell, \"must be qualified by considerations of dependence, sociality, and finitude\" (Campbell 1989).Moral traces result when one voluntarily makes a choice to act in a certain way, but recognizes that in one's doing so, an important moral principle or value is threatened or even sacrificed. But what about cases in which the choice to act is not completely voluntary, when the agent is constrained by institutional pressures? These cases are captured by the terms moral distress and moral residue—terms that have come to be associated primarily with nursing ethics. The discussion of these terms is not always very precise in the literature, where we often see the terms conflated. It is useful, however, to get a sense of how these concepts work and to ask whether they offer any useful insights for thinking about the relational component of moral traces.The appeal to the language of moral distress and moral residue in nursing ethics refers to a much more intense sentiment than Childress's appeal to moral traces. Indeed, at times it sounds like a radically different phenomenon—something that results from forced violations of moral values, rather than from genuinely dilemmatic situations. In that sense, it is more like situations that involve violations of conscience and integrity. Recall that in PBE, Beauchamp and Childress distinguish moral traces from conscience. Nevertheless, discussions of moral distress can show us how internal reflections about our moral choices can and should have an effect on our obligations to others. More particularly, they draw attention to the implications of moral traces on institutional structures and procedures.Jameton's pioneering article on the issue of moral distress in nursing makes an important distinction between moral dilemmas (which Childress believes gives rise to moral traces) and moral distress. Moral dilemmas occur when \"it is clear to the nurse that different and important values conflict, but no choice presents itself that preserves both\" (Jameton 1993, 542). In contrast, distress is what occurs when a moral agent is unable to act on a judgment as a result of institutional or professional constraints. For Jameton, moral dilemmas present interesting material for students of philosophy to ponder, but in reality, they are rare and, in his words, \"are bad news and to be avoided\" (543). By dismissing moral dilemmas as rare occurrences, Jameton pays little attention to the experiences of moral regret or guilt. He worries, however, that nurses often conflate or confuse dilemmas (in the philosophical sense) with the experience of moral distress. In other words, when asked to describe their experiences, nurses often characterize the distress they feel at not being able to act on their judgments as dilemmatic. Although he acknowledges that distress can and often does give rise to \"second-order\" moral dilemmas, it is a mistake to view situations when one's choices are constrained institutionally as dilemmatic. To do so leads nurses to unnecessarily blame themselves for situations over which they have little control. I think Jameton's point is pertinent because I take him to be saying that when nurses view their actions as resulting from genuine dilemmas instead of from unjust institutional structures, they will experience the wrong kind of guilt. What really matters for nurses is that institutions treat them justly by allowing them opportunities to participate fully in the decision-making process. Jameton is worried about the conflation of dilemmatic situations and situations of moral distress because of its implications for moral responsibility. The importance of the category of \"moral distress\" is that it draws attention to how nurses are often forced to act in ways that violate their deeply held beliefs and commitments. This violation leads to a significant moral crisis that can potentially paralyze the agent. In other words, unlike moral traces, moral distress does little for relationship and community building. Indeed, it leads to disintegration. The \"distressed\" nurse is isolated and finds herself alienated from her institutional and professional role. In the end, while the literature on moral distress often seems to be referring to something different from moral traces in the sense that Childress uses the term, it can offer us some useful insight about relationship/community building in the aftermath of difficult moral problems. In particular, it helps us to think about how moral traces in Childress's sense ought to lead to just social and institutional arrangements.Margaret Battin's recent contribution to public health ethics offers us more resources for thinking about moral traces and their relational features. She intends her work as an intervention in bioethics and public health ethics—one that attempts to undermine the notion of the self that underlies these approaches. Her approach is animated by several concerns. One has to do with a failure of bioethics to account for infectious disease as a defining feature of human experience. For Battin, this seemingly minor oversight overlooks something very important about our nature as human animals. She writes, \"Infectiousness is an especially direct reminder of how misleading the paradigms of individualism can be\" (Battin et al. 2009, 78). Battin's overarching goal, however, is to develop a more sensitive account of public health ethics. While she does not explicitly address the ideas of regret, remorse, or conscience, I believe her reminder about our biological reality as deeply interconnected creatures serves as a useful impetus for thinking about the implications of relational autonomy.Battin describes the self as a \"way-station,\" and \"embedded\" self, a vision of subjectivity that resonates with many feminist critiques of autonomy.11 Battin's important insight is that to speak of persons as shaped and constituted by and through their webs of relations is to speak about something physical and biological. She visualizes, rather than a romantic vision of relationality as constituted merely by friendship and familial relations, the individual as a \"launching pad and breeding ground for trillions of organisms that move from one human being to another, either directly or by way of intermediate vectors\" (462). This biological view expands the feminist account of relational autonomy. She writes, \"Attention to social locatedness is not enough. Physical locatedness … is critical as well\" (78).While clinical medicine has tended to see the patient primarily as a victim, public health has seen the patient primarily as a vector. Battin urges public health and bioethics to view patients as both simultaneously, \"an account in which the patient can be seen as both victim and vector at the same time, a person simultaneously occupying both morally relevant roles\" (87). Another way to put this is that we need to think of ourselves not only in terms of the threats to us but also in terms of the threats we potentially pose to others. This, according to Battin, draws a more nuanced and complex picture of moral agency. In particular it complicates notions of responsibility and blame that posit that we can always know who is to blame and for what. The biological view of ourselves as victims and vectors of infectious disease acknowledges that we cannot always know with certainty who is to blame (who harms and who is harmed).This view of the self provides an interesting grounding to the notion of moral traces as a relational concept. Agents in a dilemmatic situation are never fully relieved of the traces of guilt or sorrow for what they have done, and that is a good thing. It serves as a reminder of our shared vulnerability and woundedness as human subjects. In other words, our actions have effects and the virtuous agent is sensitive to these effects. In the image of Battin's way-station self we see how we are all biologically connected in pathways of disease. In a similar way moral traces remind us of our roles as both subjects and objects.We can see the implications of Battin's metaphysical view in her treatment of the ethics of distribution of scarce medical resources in cases of pandemic emergencies. She concurs with the pandemic triage plans put forth by Canada, Tennessee, and Utah that all base their allocation decisions on \"medical criteria of survivability and need\" (397). However, she notes that the patient as victim and vector (PVV) perspective draws our attention to two additional points. First, these plans fail to give an adequate account of what kind of care those who are \"deprioritized\" receive, and second, existing injustices in health care are exacerbated by these allocation criteria. Consequently, Battin argues that the plans must be clear about the obligation they have to care for those who will not be first in the queue to receive care in such an emergency. The issue of injustice only makes clear that we have an obligation to attend to health care inequities before such emergency situations strike. These conclusions illustrate the importance of the residual obligations incurred in situations of moral conflict. Like Childress's views about the necessity of the jus in bello criteria, and about the importance of public justifications in public health, Battin affirms that overriding a principle leaves traces that are not only wounding to the moral agent but also damaging to the relationships of trust that enable communities to exist and flourish.Without a strong sense of moral traces or even moral regret, we are left with a view of an agent who is not fully accountable to others—who can override important moral norms without having to incur any costs. Moral traces acknowledge the vulnerability and limits of our humanity. Yet it would be a mistake to stop there by allowing such an acknowledgment to turn us inward by focusing exclusively on whether our integrity has been damaged. Moral traces ought to do more than just make us feel bad. They are the impetus for broadcasting our accountability to others by offering reasons for our actions. In the case of the allocation of scarce medical resources, that accountability is necessary for extending and maintaining trust between health care providers and patients. Childress argues that randomness and chance are \"most in accord with this relationship of trust\" (1970, 349). Decisions about who should receive lifesaving treatments based on social worth are not attentive to the long-term effects of our actions on the fundamental relationships that form the basis of our society.",

      "abstract": "Every person’s life is like Kurukshetra; their good qualities are like friends, and their bad qualities are like enemies. Life itself is like a battlefield where we have to make the right decisions to achieve our goals. Seldom does the mind become confused regarding right and wrong, and it wanders; in the meanwhile, we make the wrong decision. As a result, there is a struggle between good and dreadful, false and truth, and true and evil. The term “Dharmakshetra” refers to this. When one is surrounded by unfavourable gesture impressions of the outside world or one’s own physical possessions, the mind is triggered to defend the originality of the intrinsic self, which prevents one from making the optimal decisions. When the mind is surrounded with detrimental gesture impressions of the environment or one’s own belongings, it triggers a lot to sustain the originality of the intrinsic self, which prevents one from making the optimal decisions. Our current field, whether it be tangible or incorporates different facets of life, including the job, family, business, or the social, political, economic, and moral domains in which we are pursuing our vocations, is becoming more and more like “Kurukshetra.” We all need the knowledge that Krishna imparted to Arjuna on the battlefield upon the soul and its features as well as God and his attributes, just as Arjuna required Lord Krishna’s advice in the Gita. Therefore, in order to maintain a peaceful, enjoyable existence free from hardships and ill luck, it is essential to do yoga and to be aware of both God and thyself. We compare the many viewpoints of the Gita via that of Brahma Kumari, who has deep ideas and whose opinions are very identical, in an effort to make the readers feel more secure and conscious of both God and oneself.Similar to this, there are several parallels between the soul, the absolute soul, and yoga, including the Bhagavad-Gita’s philosophical lines and spiritual content. According to the Indian poet and mystic Kabir of the 15th century believed that “(Kudh) ko jano tho khuda ko janenge,”1meaning that “Aatma anubhuti sey Eashwar anubhuti.”Brahmakumaris 2godly version says that “The self is the ultimate reality, and realising it is the key to liberation,” according to the B-Gita. “Tat tvam Asi” 3(you are that) can be seen in the Chandogya Upanishad. Self-realization is the sole path to nirvana, according to Adi Shankaracharya’s4. non-dualism doctrine from the eighth century, “Aham Brahmasmi Advaita Vedanta,” that he laid out in his work Atma Bhoda.",

      "abstract": "The words sound and noise are used interchangeably in acoustics, electronics, and physics, but have different connotations when applied to listeners. Sound is defined as vibrations that travel through air or another medium that can be heard when they reach a person's or animal's ears. Noise is defined as unwanted sound. In engineering, noise has the additional connotation of signals varying over time without meaning, whereas sound connotes meaningful signals. Unfortunately, the phrase unwanted sound implies that noise is merely a nuisance, ignoring what is now known about the harmful effects of noise on people and animals. It also implies a value judgment about noise, with a subjective component to the judgment of the listener complaining about noise. Often, there is an additional implication that those who complain about noise are neurotic, weak, self-centered, or have some other psychological or psychiatric problem that for them magnifies the impact of \"harmless\" sounds that don't bother others. This latter implication is incorrect. Desired sounds can cause auditory damage, and unwanted sound is harmful. Evidence-based noise levels affecting human heath and function are well known. That is why I propose a new definition of noise: Noise is unwanted and/or harmful sound.",

      "abstract": "Disasters, often being sudden-onset and destructive events, produce unpredictable consequences that frequently lead to the separation of family members. People mention that separation from family members is one of the most stressful aspects of such events. Hazards may restrict physical access to an area, both during the threat period and afterwards due to the loss of transport infrastructure (e.g., roads), and communications may be disrupted directly or indirectly through loss of power. As a result of this disruption to people's ability to communicate with each other, many emergency management systems recognize the importance of reuniting families separated by disaster, and therefore provide a means for people to reunite (e.g., Safe and Well operated by the American Red Cross). 2 The term \"reunification\" is commonly used in the emergency sector. In this chapter, it refers to the point when someone becomes aware of their family member's status and whereabouts (e.g., through phone contact, word of mouth, Internet, face-to-face, or through the Red Cross); it does not necessarily involve being brought together in the same physical location. Despite the rationale for reunification services being supportive for people's wellbeing, there is little empirical evidence relating to the short-and longer-term psychosocial impact of separation from family members during and immediately after a disaster event.",

      "abstract": "It is commonly said that we human beings have five senses - touch, taste, smell, vision, and hearing. This classification of senses depends on the fact that a human being has five kinds of sense organ - skin, tongue, nose, eyes, and ears. However, synesthesia in language indicates that we have additional senses. This study examines synesthetic metaphors in Japanese. Synesthetic metaphors are expressions in which the words or phrases proper to one sense describe the experiences of another sense. When we describe our experiences of one of the five senses, we can use three types of expressions. Words proper to that sense, explanatory expressions such as “nakitakunaru-yohna iro”（＝a color which makes me cry), and synesthetic metaphors (that is, words which originally relate to another sense). Some words like “hukai” (＝deep), “hageshii” (＝violent), or “sabishii” (＝lonely) describe the experiences of some of the five senses, like “hukai oto” (＝deep sound), “hageshii iro” (＝violent color), and “sabishii iro” (＝lonely color). But they do not originally relate to any of those senses, and are not explanatory either. These expressions are synesthetic metaphors and the adjectives must be words of some senses other than the five. The existence of these synesthetic metaphors proves that we have three more senses other than the five, at least in Japanese, - “dimension,” “movement,” and “mood.”",

      "abstract": "Modern understanding of stress stems from classic work in the 1930s by Hans Selye, who developed the notion of the general adaptation syndrome (Selye, 1936). Selye posited that the body shows a common, integrated set of responses in an attempt to adapt to many different kinds of stress. Until his work, many scientists viewed different kinds of stress as having different effects on the body; for example, the effect of exposure to severe cold was thought to be very different from the effect of blood loss. Indeed, each particular type of stressor does have unique effects. However, Selye showed that different severe stressors also have common features. He identified three stages. First is the shock (or alarm) phase, involving decreased blood pressure, body temperature, and muscle tone (the reader has no doubt experienced at least some degree of shock following a minor or not so minor injury, particularly if blood loss occurred). Selye termed the second phase of the adaptation response the stage of resistance, when the body fights back. If the stress is severe and continues for a long period, the body defenses break down and the third stage, exhaustion, ensues. Among other things, this stage includes a marked impairment of the immune system.",

When we consider leisure as activity, we often list hobbies or pastimes that we choose to be involved in because we value and enjoy them. Leisure may offer means of diversion separate from non-leisure activities such as work, or an opportunity for self expression or self-development. To that degree, leisure is not a purposeless activity. It is said that leisure is a state of mind or mental condition in which we find freedom in a freely chosen activity that we undertake for its own intrinsic reasons. In other words, leisure is in the mind of the participant, and it is activity that is chosen primarily for its own sake. However, in contemporary concept, it is clear that leisure includes some ideologies in which there are educational and social purposes intentioned to control people. In this sense, the most important meaning of leisure is that leisure is not just free time, rather it is closer to social welfare aspect in contemporary society. Leisure does not exist any more as traditional concept.",

      "abstract": "The word ‘cool’ has entered in the currency of language, especially that of young people. The term enjoys a distinct and well defined meaning in dictionary. In denotative sense it is related to the degree of temperature of a liquid or object or a body. It implies a state when something is ‘neither warm nor very cold or is moderately cold’ 2. Often ‘cool’ is also used in contexts other than relating to temperature, when it signifies character of a person, place or brand. Anything that is considered to be cool enjoys attraction and hence enjoys customer following. However, a perception of ‘un-cool’ has a value robbing effect from a product, place or phenomenon. If being cool can possibly give competitive edge in terms of customer desirability and following, it assumes significance from marketing perspective.",

The individual's lifestyle, which is the result of interaction between his innate qualities and life experiences, determines whether he will attempt to deal with threats, his fear and/or anger, and the resulting anxiety in an objective or pathological manner. This formulation underscores the need to learn methods of coping with anger and fear from early childhood, so that they do not develop into pathological behavior patterns.",

      "abstract": "In Gestalt therapy, good psychological health implies good contact with oneself and with others. Contact, with awareness and experiment, is one of the basic terms in gestalt therapy. It is defined as a relationship between oneself and the other (the environment or internal aspects such as alienated parts of self, blocked emotions, thoughts, memories, or anything that is not integrated into a person, and is not perceived as “I” but as “the other”). To be able to contact others and their hearts, we must first be aware of our heart – its condition, needs, and desires. We usually become aware of our heart when some negative emotion arises or when its rhythm changes, which is characteristic of the broken heart syndrome. This condition manifests with abnormal chest pain and/or lack of air, preceded by strong emotional stress that is most often associated with anxiety and/or panic attack. The paper describes the process of development of the broken heart syndrome, as well as possibilities of treatment. Finally, we can conclude that the broken heart syndrome is a paradox: it is an expression of vitality but also a defense against vitality; the manifestation is a “problem” but also a means of solving it. The primary purpose of suffering and negative experiences is healing: suffering can be a tool that  helps us become complete.  True healing always implies the spread of the heart and the expansion of consciousness. Ultimately, every successful healing of the broken heart will result in an emotional-spiritual growth and development.",

      "title": "Egosystem and EcosystemMotivational Perspectives on Caregiving",
      "abstract": "In this essay, we consider the motivations people have for caregiving, and the consequences of these motivations for the self and others. We argue that there are at least two fundamentally different views, or motivational perspectives, that people can have about caregiving. Caregiving in the egosystem is viewed as a means for people to satisfy their own needs and desires; although their behavior may appear selfless or self-sacrificing, they provide care because of what they will obtain, or what it means about them. In contrast, caregiving in the ecosystem results from genuine concern for the well-being of others; although such caregiving often has benefits for the self, those benefits are not the primary reasons why people provide care. These two motivational perspectives on caregiving have paradoxical effects; we describe evidence that caregiving in the egosystem, which aims to obtain benefits for the self, actually undermines the support the caregiver receives from others, undermines relationship quality, decreases the caregiver’s self-esteem and mental health, and even decreases the regard the care recipient has for the caregiver. Because caregivers often are unaware of these paradoxical effects, when they feel that their needs are not being met, they can persist with giving care in the egosystem, creating just the opposite of what they really want. In contrast, caregiving in the ecosystem, actually does benefit the self, in the form of increased support received from others, increased self-esteem and mental health in the caregiver, and increased regard the recipient has for the caregiver.",

Accordingly, one might come to believe that ‘The Attention’ names the capacity to harbour events of the specific idiosyncratic type, noticing. In fact it signifies an experiential mental space to which objects can come in perception and, which can contain experiences. After all, many mental phenomena other than perception require awareness if they are to so much as exist, e.g. emotion and thought, thanks to being experiences. That experiential space is of limited extent, for at any moment the mind can experience so much and no more. Indeed, the space is no more than the existence of such a limit, and has no autonomous existence other than the fact of that limit, and it is a dangerous illusion to hypostatize the limit as a real space, leading one to misunderstand what it is to experience an experience. Then there is reason for supposing that the experiences of the moment constitute a system. This circle or centre of awareness is the Attention. And it is to this Attention that perceived existents come—as object. This happens when a noticing or perceiving occurs.",

An extreme situation which sometimes arises is the complete evisceration and/or consumption of all major cavity organs. Search of autopsy files at Forensic Science South Australia was undertaken for examples of this phenomenon. Although such a finding at autopsy may suggest the actions of larger animals such as dogs or sharks, it may also occur when groups of smaller animals, such as cats, act in concert. Complete loss of organs may also occur if significant insect activity accompanies decomposition. Empty body cavities may therefore result from of a wide variety of animal activities involving a range of species in quite different environments. A significant problem once organs have been removed or consumed is in identifying or excluding natural diseases or injuries that may have played a role in the lethal episode.",

      "abstract": "The familiar idea we have about privacy is the separation from others eyes or concern. But, in 1970s Irwin Altman, social psychologist, defined privacy as process of interpersonal boundary regulation. He interpreted it as a dialectic process, which involves both a restriction of interaction and a seeking of interaction. An optimum state of privacy is reached when the desired privacy is equal to the achieved one. If achieved privacy is lower than desired privacy, there comes the sense of crowding. In case of contrary situation, we feel isolated. Desired privacy changes over time depending on situation and a person continue feedback loop until desired privacy is achieved. Under difficult condition, this process requires much energy expenditure. If the same status lasts, diverse physiological and psychological problem shall occur. Single-person household rapidly growing in recent years has a difficulty in the regulation of privacy. Because the environment surrounding their house does not have spatial layers which allow to choose different social interactions depending on their psychological conditions. The Sense of isolation coming from the failure of privacy regulation results in elevated stress, cardiovascular diseases, or lowered attention span. Therefore, the existence of public spaces such as parks is important. Because agreeable public spaces can give a place of mind to single residents, so they can expand their boundary of interaction with outer circumstances at residential areas. As well, oxytocin is a hormone to relieve the above-mentioned symptoms by either smoothing mind or forming fellowship. Studies on space to stimulate the release of oxytocin could be one of solutions to lessen the sense of isolation.",

      "title": "Muscular tension: An explanation from a methodological behaviorism.",
      "abstract": "Operant conditioning represents a unique data language that describes the lawfulness of behavior as derived from the cumulative record over time of consistent correlations between the universally observed or 'public' form or topography of behavior and its consequences. Operant conditioning procedures are based upon methodological principles, wherein reliable behavioral consistencies or 'laws' are derived using a data language that precisely maps to the universally agreed upon facts of behavior. As a form of methodological behaviorism (Pavlovian or classical conditioning is another example), the experimental methodology of operant conditioning directly measures and manipulates only publicly observable behavior. Grasping, walking, talking, etc. are operant behaviors because they are correlated with or are 'reinforced' by specific discrete outcomes. Because these behaviors uniformly engage a specific organelle of the body, namely the striated musculature, a common presumption is that operant conditioning primarily reflects the conditioning of these muscles. Of course, convulsions, startle reactions, etc. do involve the striated musculature and can be mediated by neurological rather than purely cognitive causes, but in general muscular activity is guided by its functionality as consciously perceived. It is commonly assumed that if striated muscles are activated, they are publically observed, and hence may be subsumed entire under an operant analysis. Yet only a fraction of striated muscular activity is observable publicly or privately. That is, the musculature may be activated yet not result in publicly observable responses, and neither may it be consciously or privately perceived by the individual. Ironically, the private activity of the musculature has long been made public through resolving instrumentalities (e.g., SCR, EMG) but rarely if ever has an operant analysis been employed to explain this behavior. Rather, tension has generally been construed to be an artifact of autonomic arousal that is elicited due to psycho-social 'demand'. This interpretation regards muscular tension as subsumed under different motivational principles that do not incorporate contingency, such as the reflexive or S-R responses entailed by a fight or flight response, stress reaction, etc. (Marmot & Wilkinson, 2006). In this case, inferred mediating processes take the place of observed correlations between behavior and environmental events. However, this conclusion may remain uncontested not because the relationship between tension and its governing contingencies is disproven, or because the relevant data are unobtainable, but because of a common misinterpretation of the semantics of 'demand'. The purpose of this article is to argue that the same data and data language used to establish the concept that tension is reflexive or is a respondent can be reinterpreted to unequivocally demonstrate that muscular tension is an instrumental or operant behavior. The Striated Musculature Although the activity of the striated musculature comprises the majority of behavior as we understand it, its psychophysiology is not widely known. Muscle are categorized into slow-twitch fibers and fast-twitch fibers (Squire, McConnell, & Zigmund, 2003). Slow-twitch (also called 1 muscle fibers) activate and deactivate slowly, but when activated they are also very slow to fatigue. Fast-twitch activate and deactivate rapidly and come in two types: 2A muscle fibers which fatigue at an intermediate rate, and 2B muscle fibers which fatigue rapidly. These three muscle fiber types (Types 1, 2A, and 2B) are contained in all muscles in varying amounts. Muscles that need to be activated much of the time (like postural muscles) have a greater number of Type 1 (slow) fibers. When a muscle begins to contract, primarily Type 1 are activated first, followed by Type 2A, then 2B. Type 1 are often monotonically activated because of psychosocial 'demand' that in general does not engage fast twitch fibers. …",

It concerns the difference between what, in technical language, are called manifest variables and latent variables. A variable is any quantity which varies from one member of a population to another – height and hair colour in the case of human populations, for example. A variable is manifest if it is possible to observe it and to record its value by counting or by using a measuring instrument like a ruler, clock or weighing machine. Thus, any variable whose magnitude can be observed and expressed in units of number, length, time or weight is a manifest variable. A great many variables which appear in social discourse are of this kind. The idea can be extended to cover anything calculated from a set of manifest variables, like an average, for example. In that sense IQ is a manifest variable because, as we have seen, it is something calculated from manifest test scores and is, therefore, itself, observable.",

      "title": "Zoomorphism and anthropomorphism: fruitful fallacies?",
      "abstract": "Abstract Zoo- and anthropomorphism may both be scientific heresies but both may serve as a basis for thought (and real) experiments designed to explore our ability to assess quality of life as perceived by another sentient animal. Sentience, a major contributor to evolutionary fitness in a complex environment, implies ‘feelings that matter’. Strength of motivation is a measure of how much they matter. Since humans and most domestic animals share the property of sentience, it follows that some aspects of feeling may be similar, and where we differ, the differences may be of degree rather than absolute. One of the assumed absolutes that I shall challenge is the concept that non-human animals live only in the present. I explore how domestic animals may experience the feelings of hunger, pain, fear and hope. Hunger is indisputably a primitive sensation. Pain and fear are primitive sensations with emotional overtones. The problem is to discover how they may affect quality of life. Acute pain and fear are positive signals for action to avoid harm. These actions and their consequences (‘how well did I cope?’) will be committed to memory and affect how an animal feels when they recur, or it fears they may recur. Hope (and its antithesis, despair) are considered by many philosophers (who do not own dogs) as emotions restricted to humans since only we can imagine the future. However, by application of zoomorphism we may classify hope with hunger as a primitive feeling of dissatisfaction with the status quo . Either may lead to action directed towards the goal of feeling better or encourage the belief that things will get better (food will arrive). Both are feelings of expectation for the future modulated in the light of past experience. With all these four emotions quality of life may be expressed in terms of how well the animal feels it can cope, both in the present and in the future. When it feels it cannot cope, then it will suffer.",

      "title": "How voluntary control over information and body movements determines \"what it's like\" to have perceptual, bodily, emotional and mental experiences.",
      "abstract": "Two very fundamental aspects of phenomenal experiences underlie the fact that they seem to have “something it’s like”. One aspect is the fact that experiences have a locus: they can seem “external” (perceptual), “internal” (interoceptive, bodily or emotional) or “mental”. A second fundamental aspect is the imposingness of experiences. They can seem “present” to us in different ways, sometimes seeming displayed before us with “spatio-temporal presence”.Both these aspects of “what it’s like” can be identified with the degree to which we can voluntarily control what we are doing when we engage in an experience. The external/internal/mental dimension is determined by how our voluntary bodily actions can influence the sensorimotor flow of information. The degree of imposingness of experiences and their “spatio-temporal presence” is determined by how our voluntary actions are impeded or assisted by innate, attention-grabbing mechanisms.By elucidating these two most fundamental aspects of “what it’s like”, and taken together with prior work on inter- and intra-modal differences in experiences, this article suggests a path towards a scientific theory of the “hard problem” of phenomenal consciousness, explaining why experiences feel like something rather than feeling like nothing.",

Consequently, in late racialised capitalist culture, looking, being looked at, and generally looks (and inevitably subjectivities), cannot but become commodities, given that scopophilia4 4.

The Article employs two cases as emblematic of commoditisation in late global capitalist culture: a research fragment about a father who disapproves of his dead son's dress choices; and second, the media-conveyed controversy around the athlete Caster Semenya. These are approached through constructionist and psychoanalytic registers, here taken as complementary approaches to a critical project on sexualities and gender. The Article demonstrates that the father seems to have looked upon his son as a man in the ‘wrong’ clothes, while Semenya is consciously or otherwise constructed in the media to be a woman in the “wrong” body. These constructions are grounded in the pleasure of looking or being looked at.",

      "title": "Visual perception of surprising materials in dynamic scenes",
      "abstract": "Many objects that we encounter have material qualities: spoons are hard, pillows are soft and jelly dessert is wobbly. Over a life time of experiences, strong associations between an object and its typical material properties may be formed, and these associations not only include how glossy, rough or pink an object is but also how it behaves under force: we expect knocked over vases to shatter, popped bike tires to deflate, and gooey grilled cheese to hang between two slices of bread when apart. Here we ask how such rich visual priors affect the visual perception of material qualities and present a particularly striking example of expectation violation. In a cue conflict design, we pair computer-rendered familiar objects with surprising material behaviors (a linen curtain shattering, a porcelain teacup wrinkling, etc.) and find that material qualities are not solely estimated from the object9s kinematics (i.e. its physical (atypical) motion while shattering, wrinkling, wobbling etc.); rather, material appearance is sometimes pulled towards the native motion, shape, and optical properties that are associated with this object. Our results, in addition to patterns we find in reaction time data, suggest that visual priors about materials can set up high-level expectations about complex future states of an object and show how these priors modulate material appearance. Understanding how high-level expectations are integrated with incoming sensory evidence is an essential step towards understanding how the human visual system accomplishes material perception.",

Most functions of the body have circadian variations, one can mention, for example, metabolism, body temperature, the activity of the nervous system, secretion of hormones such as melatonin and cortisol. Circadian rhythms were also found in human behavior, for example: in sensory activity, motor activity, reaction time, visual perception, auditory perception, time perception, attention, memory, arithmetic calculus, and executive functions.

      "title": "Transformative Experiences",
      "abstract": "Transformative experiences are experiential states that radically alter a person in some way, such as what the person can know or understand, their core values or preferences, their overall outlook on the world, and so on. Notable historical examples plausibly include the Apostle Paul's epiphany and sudden conversion to Christianity on the road to Damascus, St. Augustine's moral and spiritual transformation after the death of a close friend, and similar transformations by the Buddha and Muhammed. Such experiences have been argued to pose philosophical challenges for rational choice, as it appears unclear how one can make rational life‐choices about experiences one does not understand or which otherwise fundamentally transform oneself or one's values. Some theorists argue that rational choices involving transformative experiences are impossible. Others argue that transformative experiences instead pose a challenge to making choices that are both rational and authentic. Others still are unconvinced that transformative experiences pose any serious or unique problems to rational choice, contending that the problems they present are either exaggerated or reducible to problems unrelated to transformative experience. Finally, many solutions have been advanced for resolving the problems that transformative experiences are alleged to pose, including that transformative experiences can be chosen for their own sake, chosen on the basis of objective evidence such as statistics and testimony, chosen on the basis of imaginative comparison to relevantly similar past experiences, or, alternatively, be rationally grappled with by the development of internal mastery such as personal resilience or through moral behavior.",

I argue that schizophrenic depersonalization/derealization is based on a disorder of common sense epitomized by the hendiadys “deanimated body”—the experience of feeling distant and lifeless—and “disembodied spirit”—the sharp awareness of observing that appears separated from the experience of existing. This basic disturbance is sometimes experienced by persons with schizophrenia, some other times it may pass un-experienced, and can be rescued via phenomenological analysis. This basic disturbance is typical of persons with schizophrenia in the sense that it contributes to a clear-cut differentiation—better than surface signs and symptoms—between schizophrenia and other forms of psychotic existence.",

      "abstract": "1. There are, in the world, a large number of cooperative work settings where multipleactors interact through a collection of artifacts of some kind. An actor may for exampleplace a document in a location where others can see it and read it. The actor may placeit there for his or her own later use, but at the same time others may access it too. Or theactor may place it there deliberately for the benefit of others. Or the audience is notknown yet. Anyway, whatever the reason for putting it there, since others have access tothe document, other actors may retrieve and use it at some point in time, perhaps forpurposes or in contexts that are quite different from those of the originator. It may alsobe the case that another actor may change the content of the document, change itslocation, rename it, delete it, etc. Such settings are ubiquitous in cooperative work.2. The location of the collection may be a particular shelf, rack, room, or building, orthe collection may be distributed over a number of shelves, racks, room, and buildings.The collection may comprise digital artifacts as well as paper and other physicalartifacts. The items of the collection may be documents such as books, reprints ofscientific papers, technical reports, invoices, design specifications, software code,blueprints, etc. Or the collection may contain parts and sub-assemblies, zoological orgeological samples, forensic evidence, etc. Or the collection may be a heterogeneousassembly of such artifacts. However distributed and heterogeneous the collection maybe, in their cooperative activities actors will (to some degree) interact and coordinatetheir activities through this collection, by changing its state.3. Such collections of artifacts have been termed ‘common information spaces’ with arather problematic choice of words. The term ‘common’ may give the impression thatthe artifacts in the collection mean the same to all actors and are used in the samemanner. The problem arises from using the word ‘common’ as an adjective to‘information space’. What is meant is that the items in the ‘information space’ are used‘in common’ (that is, in the same sense as ‘the commons’ in English villages before theIndustrial Revolution). The term ‘space’ may similarly give the impression that thecollection is in a room or some other kind of unitary location but using the term todenote a distributed assembly of items makes some sense. The term ‘information’,however, not only ambiguous and overworked; it is outright misleading, as it gives theimpression that a ‘common information space’ denotes something like a ‘sharedunderstanding’ or a ‘shared culture’. The problem here is that the constitutive role of theartifacts is lost when the term ‘information’ is used as the key term.",

To begin with, an example, which it seems that knowing something is not as simple and unambiguous a condition as one might imagine: A businessman is talking about his partner and friend of many years. He chooses his words carefully. With obvious reluctance, he says that it is possible that this man has been cheating him. He is silent for a moment, then he says quietly that he thinks he has known this in a way for a long time. Finally, he adds, But you don't know it until you say it out loud. Thus we learn that there are two kinds of knowing: knowing in a way and really knowing. Furthermore, the transition from one to the other occurs upon saying it out loud. The difference, other words, is not a matter of acquiring additional information, but of conscious articulation of what was already some sense known but not articulated. One might call it a process of consciousness raising. The earlier state was one which the speaker did not know (and did not want to know) what he knew; the final state was one which he realized what he knew, admitting it to his listener and to himself at the same stroke. It appears, therefore, that there is a distinction between what one feels or believes about something and what one imagines oneself to feel or believe.'

      "abstract": "Ten domestic dogs (Canis familiaris) of different breeds and ages were exposed to 2 different social cues indicating the location of hidden food, each provided by both a human and a conspecific (for a total of 4 different social cues). For the local enhancement cue, the approached the location where food was hidden and then stayed beside it. For the gaze and point cue, the stood equidistant between 2 hiding locations and bodily oriented and gazed toward the 1 in which food was hidden (the human also pointed). Eight of the 10 subjects, including the one 6-month-old juvenile, were above chance with 2 or more cues. Results are discussed in terms of the phylogenetic and ontogenetic processes by means of which dogs come to use social cues to locate food. The use of social cues to locate food and other important entities in the environment is a skill with obvious adaptive benefits. For example, an informant may look toward an entity, and this look may be accompanied by both head and body orientation to the same location and sometimes by other behaviors such as vocalizations or travel toward the target location. The ability of observer individuals to exploit social cues of this type enables them to benefit from knowledge possessed only by specific groupmates. Despite the potential importance of this social ability for the foraging of many highly social species such as mammals, there has been very little systematic research in this area. Virtually all of the relevant research has been conducted with nonhuman primates and their skills of gaze following. There are two basic experimental paradigms, and these have produced different sets of results. The first paradigm is simple gaze following in which 1 individual orients its head and eyes in a certain direction (sometimes accompanied by gestures), and another individual either does or does not orient itself similarly. For example, Itakura (1996) had a human approach nonhuman primate individuals and either look or look and manually point to the right or left. Many of the 11 different nonhuman primate species tested visually tracked the pointing gesture, but only 1 (an orangutan) visually followed gaze direction by itself. Using a similar methodology, Povinelli and Eddy (1996a) also found positive results for 6 juvenile chimpanzees following the gaze of",

      "title": "Chapter I: A Plethora of Evils: Introducing the Negative Characters",
      "abstract": "In reality, however, every ego, so far from being a unity is in the highest degree a manifold world, a constellated heaven, a chaos of forms, of states and stages, of inheritances and potentialities.1The names of the characters in English and Dutch drama of the late medieval and early modem eras make it clear that there was a proliferation of negative conceptual characters.2 These names by themselves give little further information as to the kind of character involved: it could be a protagonist, a minor vice, a devil, or, depending on whether it is an English or a Dutch play, a Vice or a sinne ken. The distinction between these various kinds of characters resides to some extent in their dramatic function: the protagonists tend to be victims whereas the vices, Vice, and sinnekens tend to be instigators of the action. Another distinguishing factor is the prominence given to characters: the Vice and sinnekens generally have more lines and more stage presence than the minor vices. Their theatricality can also tell us something about the characters: the Vice and sinnekens are normally more entertaining and memorable than the other characters. The distinction between the devil on the one hand and the Vice, sinnekens, and minor vices on the other seems to have been primarily one of costume. The other element of difference lies in the fact that the devil is not a personification but rather a 'theological-mythological being' unlike the other kinds of negative characters who are personifications of negative human characteristics and who are to some degree represented as humans.3Three forms of personification are particularly important for the moral plays under discussion.4 Firstly, there is personification or prosopopoeia, i.e. 'the translation of any non-human quantity into a sentient human capable of thought and language, possessing voice and face', as Reason in Medwall's Nature. Secondly, characters can be formed by isotyping, i.e. 'the representation of a collective where there is only a quantitative difference between the abstract personified and its personifier', which is used in the everyman figure. Thirdly, there is typification leading to 'exemplary property characters', that is 'characters who exemplify the abstract qualities reflected in their names', such as Den Daghelicxschen Snaetere (The Daily Chatterbox) in Everaert's Tspel van dOnghelycke Munte (The Play of Unequal Coinage). Typification is a variety of isotyping, and I shall use the term type to describe characters based on either personification strat egy. The main distinction between personification, on the one hand, and isotyping and typification, on the other hand, is that the former tends to lead to unchangeable, immortal characters - even if they are visually represented as humans -, whereas types tend to be changeable and mortal.Minor vices, the Vice, and sinnekens typically are personifications whereas the protagonists are normally types. However, this distinction is not always maintained. In the Dutch plays there tends to be a great deal of emphasis on the personified nature of especially the sinnekens: they are represented as eternal, general evils and they do not fear death. In the English plays, on the other hand, the supposedly immortal and unchangeable characters can be susceptible to death: Newguise in Mankind escapes being hanged and Courage in The tyde taryeth no man (henceforth Tide) is taken off to his execution at the end of the play.5 They are occasionally changeable: Perverse Doctrine in A new Enterlude ... entituled New Cusiome (henceforth New Custom) converts.6 Given the fact that the Vice and sinnekens and the minor vices normally belong to the same personification category, and given the oscillation between different personification strategies in the English tradition, the personified status of the Vice and sinnekens cannot be used to distinguish them from other vice characters. The boundaries between the various kinds of negative characters are not firm or clear in either the Dutch or the English plays and perhaps it would be foolhardy to define the different characters rigorously as this would go against the fluidity exemplified in the plays. …",

      "title": "Application of Environment Capability Theory in Formulation of Qualitative Parameters in Designing Educational Spaces",
      "abstract": "This research identifies and classifies environment capabilities by reviewing environmental psychology as well as analyzing and defining environments based on different theories. Identifying and applying these capabilities in designing ideal and high quality educational environments in terms of structure leads to a deliberate and thoughtful architecture. To briefly explain the concept of capability, it can be said that environment capabilities are the physical configuration belongings of a behavioral object or place that makes it usable for certain activities. Some demands are met by an environment or object, live or cultural, easier than others; some activities which are formed in a specific configuration of environment meet some people needs and do not others. The important thing is that the capabilities of a physical environment, whether good or bad, is what the environment suggests with its configuration characteristics and materials it is made of. It seems that the quality of an object can be defined as “a set of specific characteristics or traits which distinguish one object from others and enable us to judge about superiority, similarity or inferiority of something in comparison to something else, and from esthetical aspect judge and give a verdict about being ugly or beautiful, good or bad, as well as its goodness or badness and efficiency or inefficiency with regard to functionality. In this article, by studying environment elements and capabilities and reviewing some qualitative elements and parameters in designing educational spaces and urban environments, we attained two generalized models for environmental capabilities and qualitative parameters in designing educational spaces. Finally, in the first model, two series of indicators were categorized in form of a single model including principal environment capabilities and environment physical capabilities. In the second model, qualitative parameters of environment design are divided into superficial, real and mental components and according to the obtained results, the environment receives mental qualities from environment only if the capacity components are considered in designing correctly and with high quality.",

      "abstract": "Imagine entering a room for the very first time (Fig. 26.1) and then being asked to look around and to see what is in it. The first glance already tells you what kind of room it is (in our case it clearly is a scene set in a museum); immediately afterwards you begin to notice objects in the room (the prominent statue in the foreground, several other statues on pedestals, paintings on the walls, etc.). Your attention might be drawn more towards certain objects first and then wander around taking in the remaining objects. Very rarely will your visual system need to pause and take more time to investigate what a particular object is – even more rarely will it not be able to interpret it at all (perhaps the four-horned statue in the back of the room will be confusing at first, but it still can be interpreted as a type of four-legged, hoofed animal). The remarkable ability of the (human) visual system to quickly and robustly assign labels to objects (and events) is called categorization.",

      "abstract": "Anonymous authorship can be defined as encompassing any publication that appears without the author's name printed either on the title page or in any other paratext such as a preface or dedication. Pseudonymous authorship, it follows, is a form of anonymity; the author's name is concealed, while a false name is presented to the public. Anonymity, in this definition, is constituted formally by the absence of a name, or the presence of a false name, in the medium of publication. Friends, family, colleagues, editors, and publishers, naturally, are frequently aware of the identity of an anonymous author (but they are also frequently kept in the dark). The anonymity of a publication, as I define it, is not affected by whether a few people are in on the secret, or whether the identity of the author is in fact an open secret to many. For example, consider a first edition that has been published anonymously while the second edition has been signed; the author is now known, but the first edition continues to be an anonymous publication.",

The latter may be human beings, animals, or even inanimate objects (e. g. aircraft), and the decrements considered may range from marriage to‘write-off’. N evertheless the assumptions made are, for the most part, analogous and the technique adopted is broadly the same in every case: the decrements are assumed to be random (in the technical sense) and they are related to the body in which they have occurred (the so-called‘exposed to risk’) in order to obtain a relative frequency, or‘rate’, of decrement.",

      "abstract": "Causal theories of action are attempts to develop an account of actions in terms of events (typically bodily movements and their effects) which have the right kind of causal ancestry. The causal ancestry must be traced back to some kind of intentional state (or combination of intentional states) in the agent, such intentional state (or states) must have the right kind of content, and it must cause the bodily movement (or other effect) in the ‘right’ way. Causal accounts differ on the nature of the intentional state, the nature of the content it must have, and the specification of the ‘right’ kind of causal connection to bodily movements or other effects. Causal accounts also differ on the identification of the action itself. Some acounts say that the action is the bodily movement, provided that it was caused in the right way and had the right kind of effects. Others identify the action with the triggering intentional state (called a volition or trying), provided that it has the right kind of effects. Yet others identify the action with the composite event of the intentional state's causing the appropriate effects. Finally there are those which fail to identify the action with any of these events or combinations of them.",

      "title": "Time in Human Life",
      "abstract": "Time is among the most stubbornly abstract and concretely relevant aspects of human life. Our everyday awareness is permeated with thoughts of time, and this awareness is reflected in such ordinary objects as clocks and calendars as well as in such ordinary expressions as “time flies,” “spending/ wasting/losing time,” “time heals all wounds,” and so on. Even if we had neither clocks nor maxims, there would still be the human experience of birth and death, daily and seasonal change, and the linguistic markings of a now, a before, and an after. Human beings regularly experience changes in tempo where they, or the events to which they are present, speed up or slow down and/or change from being maddeningly predictable to maddeningly unpredictable. If this were not enough, our reflections on time range all the way from the incomprehensible – eternity – to the more mundane – seconds, minutes, days, weeks. Time has been characterized as a “structural coordinate” of reality (Keen, 1970), as the “currency of life” (Hale, 1993), and as a major existential ground to human existence (Pollio, 1982). Perhaps some unknown graffiti artist put it best: “Time is nature's way of keeping everything from happening at once.”",

      "abstract": "Click to increase image sizeClick to decrease image size Résumé Il suit de l'histoire et de la logique que la vérité, comme nous la connaissons, est une croissance sujette au changement, et est le résultat, dans la dernière analyse, du jugement individuel. Même “le test objectif de la vérité” se réduit au test par “l'expérience fondamentale individuelle,” c'est-à-dire, la douleur, le toucher, et la vision. Ni le groupe social, de l'un côté, ni un composant quelconque de l'individu, tel que l'organe ou la cellule, de l'autre côté, ne peuvent être ainsi fondamentaux à la vérité; parce que, malgré les similarités entre les organisations de l'individu, de la société, et des composants de l'individu, respectivement, il y a des différences importantes. Les individus peuvent vivre en dehors de la société, comme la société ne peut pas vivre et comme les composants de l'individu peuvent rarement vivre en dehors des individus eux-mêmes; les composants des individus, bien qu'essentiels au développement de la vérité, ne sont pas encore ceux qui tiennent la vérité; et la société en elle-même ne peut voir et jouir de la vérité. Cette vue permet les vérités acceptables, en effet, les vérités socialement acceptables, pourvu que leur test définitif soit admis comme individuel; et la vue permet l'organisation collective, la “décision,” et l'action; car la vue donne à entendre et la liberté intellectuelle pour les individus, et l'intérêt individuel dans les intérêts communs. Referat Dass die Wahrheit, wie wir sie kennen, eine Entwicklung ist, die Veränderung ausgesetzt ist, folgt aus der Geschichte und der Logik. Sogar der “objective Prüfstein der Wahrheit” lässt sich auf den Prüfstein der “individuellen Grunderfahrung” zurückführen, d.h. Schmerz, Tast, und Gesicht. Weder die soziale Gruppe einerseits, noch irgendeine Komponente des Individuums, wie ein Organ oder eine Zelle, andererseits kann die Grundlage der Wahrheit sein, weil es trotz den Ähnlichkeiten zwischen dem Aufbau des Individuums, der Gesellschaft und der Komponenten des Individuums wichtige Unterschiede gibt. Individuen können von der Gesellschaft getrennt leben, wie die Gesellschaft nicht leben kann, und wie die Komponenten des Individuums selten von den Individuen selbst getrennt leben können; Komponenten der Individuen, obgleich sie zur Entwicklung der Wahrheit wesentlich sind, sind nicht die Besitzerinnen der wahrheit; auch kann die Gesellschaft für sich die Wahrheit nicht wahrnehmen und geniessen. Diese Ansicht gestattet natürlich annehmbare Wahrheiten, ja sozial annehmbare Wahrheiten, insofern ihr Urmerkmal anerkanntermassen individuell ist; und die Ansicht gestattet Gruppenaufbau, “Entschluss,” und Tätigkeit; denn die Ansicht schliesst in sich sowohl die intellektuelle Freiheit für die Einzelwesen als auch individuelles Interesse an gemeinsamen Interessen.",

      "title": "'Doing Ngoma': a Dominant Trope in African Religion and Healing",
      "abstract": "A widespread ritual institution in Central and Southern Africa is often referred to, or carries the name, of ngoma, at once the term for drum, as well as drumming or other musical instrumentation, singing, dancing, and the complex of constituent behavior and concepts. Particular manifestations of the institution often carry names denoting a regional or local variant that emerged at a certain time and spread into neighboring regions. Across the region where ngoma type rituals are located-much of Central and Southern Africa, and certain areas of Equatorial Africa-common characteristics include recruitment of those afflicted by a disease, chronic handicap, or social pathology; an initiation-like therapeutic course of several months or years leading from novice to fully-qualified healer status; a redefinition of the self or social group that has been defined as sick, and subsequently stabilized; an etiology of spirit possession that may occasionally be reflected in overt trance, but is often merely hypothesized and dealt with analytically; the tendency to think of the process of going through affliction and healing as a kind of legitimation for other leadership positions in society. This set of features, occasionally in association with the notion ngoma, has usually been studied and presented by scholars as a local, or tribally-particular phenomenon. This view distorts and trivializes the institution. The present paper is a distillation of a decade-long study of ngoma that has been historical and comparative in scope. This work will be published shortly in a complete monograph.1",

For these discoveries suggest to them that personality is wholly determined by factors of heredity, physique or environment; and therefore that particular actions, since they are in turn only the expressions of personality or character, must likewise be completely determined. The consequences for morality are well known and paradoxical. A man's faults and assets lie not in himself, but in his glands or his school teachers. As there is not much he can do about those things, why should he be commended for his achievements or blamed for his misdeeds?",

      "title": "Do toddlers reason about other people’s experiences of objects? A limit to early mental state reasoning",
      "abstract": "Human social life requires an understanding of the mental states of one’s social partners. Two people who look at the same objects often experience them differently, as a twinkling light or a planet, a 6 or a 9, and a random cat or Cleo, their pet. Indeed, a primary purpose of communication is to share distinctive experiences of objects or events. Here, we test whether toddlers (14-15 months) are sensitive to another agent’s distinctive experiences of pictures when determining the goal underlying the agent’s actions in a minimally social context. Across seven experiments (n = 206), toddlers viewed either videotaped or live events in which an actor, whose perspective differed from their own, reached (i) for pictures of human faces that were upright or inverted or (ii) for pictures that depicted a rabbit or a duck at different orientations. Then either the actor or the toddler moved to a new location that aligned their perspectives, and the actor alternately reached to each of the two pictures. By comparing toddlers’ looking to the latter reaches, we tested whether their goal attributions accorded with the actor’s experience of the pictures, with their own experience of the pictures, or with no consistency. In no experiment did toddlers encode the actor’s goal in accord with his experiences of the pictures. In contrast, in a similar experiment that manipulated the visibility of a picture rather than the experience that it elicited, toddlers (n = 32) correctly expected the actor’s action to depend on what was visible and occluded to him, rather than to themselves. In a verbal version of the tasks, older children (n = 35) correctly inferred the actor’s goal in both cases. These findings provide further evidence for a dissociation between two kinds of mental state reasoning: When toddlers view an actor’s object-directed action under minimally social conditions, they take account of the actor’s visual access to the object but not the actor’s distinctive experience of the object.",

They perform their duties without any interior spirit, without relish and without fruit. These are in danger of mortal sin. Sometimes they are in a state of sin without realizing it, because they never seriously enter into themselves and their examination of conscience is extremely superficial.

      "abstract": "DEFINITION OF LONELINESS Described in the scientific literature more than 30 years ago, the feeling of being lonely is characterized as feeling socially isolated or on the social perimeter [3]. It is noteworthy that feeling lonely does not necessarily mean being physically alone. Loneliness corresponds to a discrepancy between the relationships one wants and the relationships one has, so one can feel socially isolated even when they are among “friends.” As the celebrity, George Clooney, said: “Anyone would be lying if they said they did not get lonely at times. The loneliest you will get is in the most public of arenas: you will go to a place and end up in the smallest compartment possible, because it is a distraction to everybody, and you end up not getting to enjoy it like everyone else.” Although loneliness makes people feel sad, it has another, less obvious effect on our brain and biology: it triggers a sense in which the world is unsafe, and the brain tilts toward a self-preservation mode.",

Presumably faith in God is usually meant, but all too often God drops out of the picture, and it seems that all we need is faith, not faith in anything or anyone, but just faith. We are thus encouraged to add what seems to be a magic ingredient to our lives, which can transform everything. Perhaps at the back of such thinking lies some Calvinist notion of the corrupt character of human reason. As a result it may seem that we cannot rely on our judgment, which is the product of the fallen and sinful nature of humanity. Instead we must depend on ‘faith’ which may, or may not, be given us by the grace of God.",

      "title": "Constructions of speech and thought representation",
      "abstract": "A lot of what humans communicate about concerns cognitive contents of various kinds produced by others or themselves: speech, thought, writing, emotional states, attitudes, hopes, and the like. Languages have developed specialized ways to structure the representation of such contents, especially in various dedicated forms of speech and thought representation. Represented content can also include embodied behavior, such as gesture, whether in cospeech gesture or in sign language. What is represented need not actually have been previously produced: represented contents can be future, hypothetical or nonexistent, and forms of so-called fictive interaction can be used in which the model of face-to-face interaction is used to talk about a variety of other meaning types. Speech and thought representation presupposes the existence of two speech events-a current and a represented one-and each comes with a speaker, defined linguistically in terms of their central deictic coordinates, I-here-now. The interplay of deictic features and different forms of structural integration can define specific types of construction, showing different degrees of access to the embedded mental space of the represented speaker's speech or thought, such as direct, indirect, and free indirect speech or thought. Social media forms of direct speech or thought merit separate investigation, as do subjective uses of reporting clauses such as I think, which form a distinct construction type, using a subset of the grammar of speech and thought representation for different purposes.

      "abstract": "The word empathy has been used as a label for many different phenomena, including feeling what another person is feeling, understanding another person’s point of view, and imagining oneself in another person’s situation. Perhaps the most widely researched phenomenon called “empathy” involves an other-oriented emotional state that is congruent with the perceived welfare of another person. Feelings associated with empathy include sympathy, tenderness, and warmth toward the other person. Other manifestations of empathic emotions have been investigated, too, including empathic joy, empathic embarrassment, and empathic anger. As was the case with empathy, the term altruism has also been used as a label for a broad range of phenomena, including any type of prosocial behavior, as a collection of personality traits associated with helpful persons, and biological influences that evoke protective behaviors toward genetically related others. A particularly fruitful research tradition has focused on altruism as a motivational state with the ultimate goal of protecting or promoting the welfare of a valued other. For example, the empathy–altruism hypothesis claims that empathy (viewed here as an other-oriented emotional state) evokes an altruistic motivational state. Empathy and altruism, regardless of how they are construed, have important consequences for understanding human behavior and social relationships.",

      "abstract": "Barking bouts by muntjacs are given most often when visibility is reduced due to environmental conditions. Some individuals bark more readily than others, and various parameters associated with barking bouts overlap considerably among individuals. Barking in muntjacs probably does not function in the contexts of food procurement, reproduction, or maintenance and monitoring of individual movements. Rather, barking occurs primarily in two major contexts: during certain social encounters and when novel or inconspicuous stimuli, such as a hidden predator, are detected in the environment. Barking appears to have evolved via individual selection. Although the physical properties of barking bouts are such that they may make a muntjac more conspicuous and easily localized, this response to potential danger may act to deter predation. The underlying causal factor linking the two major contexts in which barks are given may be an internal state of anxiety. Anxiety, and hence barking, occurs more often in muntjacs which are characterized by specific behavioral profiles. Barking is proposed to be better termed a distress call than an alarm call.",

The answer seems self-evident: language is for communication. But, for human beings, communicating is never merely a question of conveying information. Often we talk for the sake of talking, or we say the opposite of what we mean, or say something the addressee already knows. A good deal of the information we convey, moreover, is implicit: that is, it is absent from the message itself. Indeed, people speak for all sorts of reasons which have nothing to do with the act of informing: in order, for instance, to emphasize a position of power or to establish a relation of solidarity. The spoken word is not only a tool, but also a means of self-expression, a form of action, a way of asserting one self as a social being, and a locus of pleasure or suffering.",

      "abstract": "It is not an easy matter, at least I have not found it so in my experience, when brought face to face with an actual case of in sanity, and asked to state the cause of it, to do so definitely and satisfactorily. The uncertainty springs from the fact that, in the great majority of cases, there has been a concurrence of co-operating conditions, not one single effective cause. Two persons are exposed to a similar heavy mental shock: one of them is driven mad by it, but the other is not. Can we say then that the madness has been produced by a moral cause? Not accurately so; for in the former case there has been some innate vice of nervous constitution, some predisposition of it to disease, whereby insanity has been produced by a cause which has had no such ill effect in the latter case. The entire causes have not, then, been in reality the same. And what we have to bear in mind is, that all the conditions which conspire to the production of an effect, whether visibly active or seemingly passive, are alike causes, alike agents, and that therefore all the conditions, whether they are in the patient himself or in the circum stances of life in which he is placed, which in a given case co-operate in the production of insanity, must properly be viewed as its causes. Mental derangement sometimes appears as the natural issue of all the precedent conditions of life, mental and bodily, the outcome of the individual character as affected by certain circumstances; the germs of the disease have been latent in the foundations of the character, and the final outbreak is but the explosion of a long train of antecedent preparations. In vain, then, is it in many cases to attempt to fix accurately on a single cause, moral or physical; a common mistake on the part of those, who think to do so being to fix upon what is really an early symptom of the disease as the supposed cause of it. Religion, self-abuse, intemperance, have all at times been put down as the causes of mental derangement, when they were really morbid symptoms.",

      "abstract": "Postural control has been defined as “regulating the body’s position in space for the dual purposes of stability and orientation.” How the body achieves postural control depends, in part, on the environment. A person navigating a non-moving surface (e.g. hallway, stairway, or step ladder) will process information and will employ different strategies to maintain postural control than someone who is standing or walking on a moving surface (e.g., forklifts, personal transportation systems, escalators, and moving walkways). In both environments, sensory, cognitive, and motor control systems contribute to postural control. The musculoskeletal system uses muscle activation and joint positioning to control the body’s alignment and muscle tone. The biomechanics of postural control rely on information that the musculoskeletal system receives from sensory systems including the vestibular system, which is generally implicated in behaviors requiring balance control, as well as the somatosensory and visual systems. Furthermore, sensory information from these and other systems can be enhanced by cognitive processes, such as attention. The ability to maintain postural control while standing or walking is critical in preventing falls on both non-moving and moving surfaces. This review focuses on moving surfaces and includes a discussion of the biomechanical, perceptual, and cognitive factors responsible for postural control.",

Early literature on the subject was concerned primarily with enumerating different stimuli which would elicit the reaction or with the clinical implications of the reaction pattern. Moro's method of stimulation consisted in striking forcefully the table or bed on which the infant was lying in a supine position. Ordinarily the blow was made simultaneously on both sides of the baby, about 6 or 8 inches (15 or 20 cm.) from his head. This method has remained the classic mode of stimulation.

The term Suvarna is a common word which refers to the Gold noble metal. Prashan refers to Pra+Ashan which means specially the act of eating or drinking or in taking. Suvarnaprashan has been practiced since a long back to make Vyadhikshamatva i.e. Immunity stronger to prevent infectious diseases as well as maintenance of good physical and mental growth and development of a child. According to WHO, Health is a state of complete physical, mental and social wellbeing and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity. In the wider context, health is a state of total absence of illnesses, diseases, syndromes, infections, abnormal behavior, accidents etc. Vyadhikshamatva i.e. immunity or resistance is the power that protects the body from diseases. It depends on Ojas, Bala, Prakrita Kapha and Balavardhaka Bhava. There has been a significant deterioration in the quality of human health status from generation to generation resulting in decline of immunity. Samskara, Lehana and Rasayana medicines, Suvarnaprashan etc. are recommended in Ayurveda for children for the promotion of health and longevity of life span. According to ancient Ayurved Acharyas like Acharya Kashyap, Sushrut and Vagbhat, Suvarnaprashan strengthens immunity and simultaneously improves digestive functions, intellectual capabilities, activeness and vital power of the body, hence keeps a child healthy.

      "title": "Primate aggression and evolution: an overview of sociobiological and anthropological perspectives.",
      "abstract": "Attempts to explain the nature and causes of human aggression are handicapped primarily because aggression is anything but a unitary concept. Aggression has no single etiology, no matter which mammalian species we consider or what kind of causation (developmental or evolutionary) we stress. Nevertheless, forensic psychiatrists are asked to evaluate instances of human aggression in ways that would send shivers up the spines of researchers who have been wrestling with the issue for over fifty years. This is not to say forensic psychiatry should be abolished nor to suggest behavioral scientists have not made progress in discovering causes of species aggression in genera}l and human violence in particular. But especially when predictive models are considered it does mean we are far from achieving highly reliable results.: Particularly when one person is asked to assess the motivational state of another who has committed a serious aggressive act it becomes more evident just how much more data we need. Strangely, if a forensic psychiatrist were asked to testify in a case in which, let us say, one monkey attacked another, the testimony would be based on more complete information than a case involving a human. This is because a plethora of context-specific data on nonhuman primates are available. These data illuminate a wide range of social, ecological, and endocrinological circumstances under which animals will be expected to act aggressively. Data on humans are much more complex, and sometimes they are absent altogether. For obvious ethical reasons scientists do not purposefully nor directly experiment on humans (biochemically, surgically, or hormonally) to determine how and when aggression can be induced. Moreover, among humans culture and biology are so tightly wedded that the task of identifying and isolating the. most salient aggression-eliciting factors is formidable, if, indeed, there is such a thing. If this is not discouraging enough, consider that the data available on human aggression, especially motivation, often lead in diverse directions without any indications about which direction may be most fruitful to explore.4 Perhaps I have painted an overly pessimistic picture. Just as forensic psychiatrists analyze and present conclusions about the mental states of accused aggressors, so also do researchers make use of a wide range of principles and assumptions in putting forth their hypotheses on primate",

      "title": "Woven Words, Embroidered Stories: Inscriptions On Textiles",
      "abstract": "Textiles are of great importance both for the aristocratic courtly culture as well as for the clerical culture of the Middle Ages because they are usually used to mark and shape a visual border between the inside and outside.1 Stone, metal, glass and wood are also used for the purpose of marking and shaping a visual border.Compared to these materials, however, textiles excel in this capacity because they are flexible and can be produced and designed in a variety of ways.What they do less well is protect the interior from external violence or unwanted access.2There are three specific properties and functions of textiles, which are also relevant for inscriptions on the textiles: 1. Flexibility: On the one hand, textiles are locomobile, i. e. a cloth, a dress, a tent can easily be moved from one place to another as a whole.On the other hand, they are also elastic, i. e. they adapt to the interior they create or encase.Therefore, textiles are typically used to cover movable objects such as human or animal bodies (clothing, horse blankets, etc.) or to create ephemeral interiors (tents).2. Drawing a line: Textiles do not create limits that are insurmountable, but primarily borders that restrict a person's vision.In most cases (tents, clothes, curtains, wrapping), this creates an interior protected from the eyes of those standing outside.In reverse, a special interior space can also be conceived and imagined when the border to the outside is highlighted by textile boundaries (tapestries).3. Symbolicity: The textiles that draw these boundaries have surfaces that are particularly suitable for making symbolic statements, either by the material design of the surfaces (colours, use of special threads made of wool, silk, gold, etc.) or by the application of signs of any kind (images, texts).3The semantics of colours and precious fabrics (silk, brocade, velvet, etc.) and ornamentation through woven or dyed patterns or fabric combinations are particularly popular in chasubles and clothes worn by the nobility.1 Cf. the exemplary studies in Coatsworth/Owen-Crocker 2018 and the survey in Heller 2017.Naturally, textiles are also required to protect from environmental factors (cold, wind, the sun, rain etc.).As this aspect does not play a prominent role for script-bearing textiles, it will be disregarded in this chapter.2 Cf.",

      "abstract": "Abstract A computational model for artificial animals (animats) interacting with real or artificial ecosystems is presented. All animats use the same mechanisms for learning and decisionmaking. Each animat has its own set of needs and its own memory structure that undergoes continuous development and constitutes the basis for decision-making. The decision-making mechanism aims at keeping the needs of the animat as satisfied as possible for as long as possible. Reward and punishment are defined in terms of changes to the level of need satisfaction. The learning mechanisms are driven by prediction error relating to reward and punishment and are of two kinds: multi-objective local Q-learning and structural learning that alter the architecture of the memory structures by adding and removing nodes. The animat model has the following key properties: (1) autonomy: it operates in a fully automatic fashion, without any need for interaction with human engineers. In particular, it does not depend on human engineers to provide goals, tasks, or seed knowledge. Still, it can operate either with or without human interaction; (2) generality: it uses the same learning and decision-making mechanisms in all environments, e.g. desert environments and forest environments and for all animats, e.g. frog animats and bee animats; and (3) adequacy: it is able to learn basic forms of animal skills such as eating, drinking, locomotion, and navigation. Eight experiments are presented. The results obtained indicate that (i) dynamic memory structures are strictly more powerful than static; (ii) it is possible to use a fixed generic design to model basic cognitive processes of a wide range of animals and environments; and (iii) the animat framework enables a uniform and gradual approach to AGI, by successively taking on more challenging problems in the form of broader and more complex classes of environments",

      "abstract": "Quality of life, health, and ability are often lost at the same time and most often in one decaying existential movement over 5 or 10 years. This “lost life” is mostly too slow to be felt as life threatening, but once awakened to reality, it provokes the deepest of fears in patients: the fear of death itself and destruction of our mere existence. The horrible experience of having “lost life”, often without even noticing how it happened, can be turned into a strong motivation for improvement. Personal development is about finding the life deeply hidden within in order to induce revitalization and rehabilitation. Rehabilitation is about philosophy of life with the integration of the repressed painful feelings and emotions from the past and the letting go of the associated negative beliefs and decisions. The holistic medical toolbox builds on existential theories (the quality of life theories, the life mission theory, the theory of character, the theory of talent, and the holistic process theory) and seems to have the power to rehabilitate the purpose of life, the character of the person, and fundamental existential dimensions of man: (1) love; (2) strength of mind, feelings, and body; and 3) joy, gender, and sexuality; allowing the person once again to express and realize his talents and full potential. The principles of rehabilitation are not very different from other healing, but the task is often more demanding for the holistic physician as the motivation and resources often are very low and the treatment can take many years.",

      "abstract": "Along with a classical immune system, we have evolved a behavioral one that directs us away from potentially contagious individuals. Here I show, using publicly available cross-cultural data, that this adaptation is so fundamental that our first impressions of a male stranger are largely driven by the perceived health of his face. Positive (likeable, capable, intelligent, trustworthy) and negative (unfriendly, ignorant, lazy) first impressions are affected by facial health in adaptively different ways, inconsistent with a mere halo effect; they are also modulated by one's current state of health and inclination to feel disgusted by pathogens. These findings, which replicated across two countries as different as the USA and India, suggest that instinctive perceptions of badness and goodness from faces are not two sides of the same coin but reflect the (nonsymmetrical) expected costs and benefits of interaction. Apparently, pathogens run the show-and first impressions come second. Lay Summary: Our first impressions of strangers (whether they seem trustworthy, intelligent, unfriendly, or aggressive) are shaped by how healthy their faces look and by our unconscious motivation to avoid infections. Bad and good impressions turn out to reflect the concrete, potentially vital, expected costs and benefits of interacting with our fellow humans.

      "title": "Loss as a lifelong regenerative learning process",
      "abstract": "The predisposition to internalize death and loss of crucial attachment objects, subjectively, as a physical attack on the body, is commonly acknowledged in the field of human psychological behaviour (Freud 1915; Parkes 1972). This view is held, essentially, according to psychoanalytic principles of the functioning of the mental processes, to advance the concept of mind and body sensations as psychical consequences, or affects , of loss trauma. It does not, nevertheless, preclude wider social and cultural factors from adding to our understanding of how and why we react to loss in deeply individual ways. In the affective domain of human experience, the relationship between emotional pain and learning may not strike an immediate connection, since emotions are assumed to be subjective psychological affects of the psyche, while learning involves cognitive processes associated with developed responses to external stimuli. From a psychoanalytic perspective, however, it is possible to conceptualize the interconnecting of mind and body ‘states’ associated with pain, through the channelling and regulation of psychic tension in the ego. Importantly, the channelling of impulses into mind and body ‘ideas’ suggests a dynamic process capable of activating the human potential for emotional development and learning through the ego's capacity for adaptation to external change. We can speak, therefore, of affective learning as an integrated regenerative counterpart to emotional devel When death and major life changes are followed by corresponding feelings of loss, the human propensity to search for, and the lost object is generally viewed by therapists to be a normal part of grieving, however paradoxical the demands for integrating thoughts and irrational actions might feel. This illustrates the of a grief process that ultimately demands a degree of emotional development in enabling us to tolerate high levels of anxiety, there is disparity between the inner world of feeling and external reality. In psychodynamic grief work, the therapeutic principle of through' the deeper, inner layers of loss and mourning creates one such model for developing emotional learning and insight. It within this framework that the client can begin to understand his irrational motives, and be freed from the related feelings of alienation in his inner world. The aim of this paper is to examine the concept of loss and learning in a wider context to include lifelong processes of and growth, which may be a cause for grief. It raises the significance of personal meaning(s) we attach to loss, links this theme to the aetiology of separation anxiety, loss and mourning from a psychoanalytic perspective.",

      "title": "Describing Atypical Instances of Intelligence: The Case of Habituation",
      "abstract": "It is becoming increasingly clear that intelligence must be considered as a widespread, even universal, biological phenomenon. The presence of intelligence, or basal cognition, is signaled by phenomena such as sensing, differentiating beneficial and not beneficial states, decision-making, memory, anticipation, and learning.1 Such phenomena have been shown to be present in bacteria, plants, fungi, protists, and a very broad range of animals.2 For example, Boisseau et al.3 recently showed the presence of habituation in slime molds, adding to earlier findings in protists that habituation is widespread and not limited to animals with nervous systems.4 These findings create a new situation for the demarcation of (basal) cognitive phenomena. Psychology and cognitive science did always rely on common sense judgments as to what to study, usually either behavior or mental processes as occurring in the brain. In this approach, intelligence can be recognized by using common sense, which excludes many of the new findings. While this exclusion has now been challenged in various experimental settings as mentioned above, at a general conceptual level more work needs to be done. The idea that intelligence can take forms that diverge from our long-standing intuitive interpretation remains a conceptual hurdle that research on basal cognition still needs to overcome. For example, take the difference in meaning between general concepts like behavior, growth, and memory. These concepts have clear and separate meanings in the context of animal behavior, but much of plant behavior and decision-making involves directional growth and the generation of structures that reflect past experience with various stressors and beneficial factors. The standard differences between these ordinary concepts are challenged in such cases. As a result, claims concerning plant behavior may sound weird or simply wrong, despite the evidence supporting such statements. Developing clearer and more encompassing descriptions and concepts is therefore an important next step for research on basal cognition. The model of habituation proposed by Bonzanni et al.5 published in this issue provides a good example of extending and generalizing current descriptions of psychological terminology. Habituation is a temporary modification of a response to recurring stimuli and widely considered as the simplest of learning processes.4 However, habituation is often described in terms of specific mechanisms that can be very different between various organisms, such as animals, plants, protists, and slime molds. In this paper, Bonzani and coauthors present a model that casts habituation as a generalized process that is not tied to any specific substrate and therefore can be applied widely to different cases of habituation. Accepting the many new cases of and forms that intelligence can take will remain difficult as long as we look at them with common sense interpretations. Moving beyond such interpretations—such as for the classic psychological concept of habituation—will require a dedicated effort that combines empirical, theoretical, and conceptual work. It can be expected that this enterprise will involve a significant reshuffling of long-standing concepts centered around the mind and the cognitive domain. In other words, we can expect interesting times! The author declares no conflict of interest.",

      "abstract": "Love Without the Obligation to Love1 Cindy Patton (bio) It’s frightening to feel so little attachment to a life that’s so full of the things other people long for—rightly long for, I think: a lot of intimacy, enough money, peace and privacy, intellectual stimulation, plenty of recognition, time for my own work, no violence, both parents living, mostly good health, a long, tender relationship with my fella, oodles of terrific friends. . . . It’s not that these things don’t seem miraculous. . . . I’ve the most acute sense that things not only could be infinitely worse, but actually are for most people. Though I can’t imagine why that’s supposed to be a cheering realization!2 [T]he naturalization of social arbitrariness causes it to be forgotten that, in order for this reality called “family” to be possible, certain social conditions that are in no way universal have to be fulfilled. . . . [T]he family in its legitimate definition is a privilege instituted into a universal norm: a de facto privilege that implies a symbolic privilege—the privilege of being comme il faut, conforming to the norm, and therefore enjoying a symbolic profit of normality. Those who have the privilege of having a “normal” family are able to demand the same of everyone without having to raise the question of the conditions (a certain income, living space, etc.) of universal access to what they demand universally.3 No reader—therapy fellow traveler, critic, homologously positioned academic or artist—can help but be moved by the eloquence with which Eve Sedgwick’s A Dialogue on Love conveys the gripping struggle with mortality, [End Page 215] not first in the face of her own cancer or others’ AIDS, but rather in the context of feeling out of place in the world. There is so much in the text and, yet, so few hints about how to be a worthy reader. In a classroom, one might be tempted to say, “What is Sedgwick saying?” But I remember a conversation with Eve in the late 1980s.4 I was grappling with how to write elegantly, recursively, but clearly in the then-popular deconstructionist High Style. I think I said, “I’m trying to communicate . . .” and she laughed in that high-pitched voice of hers, as delicate and tentative and unpredictable as a flat pebble skipping across the surface of a faintly rippled pond: “That’s the difference!” She described her writing process and explained that however much she shaped her prose through meticulous editing, it was the reader who would bend her works to their place and their meanings. Writing is poesis, not communication. From its title to its ending, through graphic design and shifts in voice and address, A Dialogue on Love is Sedgwick’s own high-water mark in this understanding of writing, blurring the line between forms of self-assertion and forms of listening, forms of intending meaning, and forms of not being heard. “Eve” plays hide and seek with the reader, offering various angles on her body and feelings, and then veiling these with (her therapist) Shannon’s words, perpetually grafting fragments of her poems onto fragments of therapy notes, sometimes Shannon’s official record, sometimes her therapy journals, in one moment her once estranged sister’s childhood diary accounts of Eve, in other places e-mail exchanges with friend Tim—any of which might be Kathy Acker–like plagiarism or faked autobiography.5 Although Eve did a great deal to make me smarter, I turned out to think like a busted-up social scientist, the bastard issue of qualitative empiricism and rhetorical deconstruction, a lost wild child from the literary turn in the social sciences (now passed, I note with regret). I therefore leave it to the literary critics to say how A Dialogue on Love works as a text and instead I open this particular iteration of Sedgwick’s corpus to a sociohistorical, or historicosocial, reading. I do not ignore her aesthetic devices, but recognize them as necessities for marking a place so personal and specific as sometimes not to communicate, as the techniques of a gifted mind that sprung from a quirky but quite...",

We may neither praise nor blame, but wonder whether they were not fully responsible for what they did. Perhaps they were coerced or pressured or, perhaps, just did not know what they were doing. This language of moral evaluation does not only apply to adult human beings, but that is its primary and most typical use. Children may be selfish or act unfairly, but we accept that they only gradually acquire full moral responsibility for their actions. Animals, too, may be courageous or altruistic, but we may suspect a degree of anthropomorphism in extending moral language too far in their direction. The moral status of animals is a matter of debate, but no one thinks butterflies can have or lack charity or that jackdaws are dishonest.

      "title": "Spiritual perspectives on the person with dementia: identity and personhood",
      "abstract": "In this chapter we consider contributions from spiritual and theological perspectives to the meaning of personal identity in the face of dementia. In contemporary health and social care literature there has been a growing interest in spirituality and stress has been laid on identifying and meeting the spiritual needs of people, particularly those with mental health problems, learning disabilities, and ill health in later life. Definitions of spirituality are elusive as are concepts of mind, meaning, and personhood—not least in the case of people with dementia.Spirituality is often described both as being about the intangible and immaterial aspects of life as well as being closely associated with a sense of meaning and purpose. It is particular to each person and yet, by virtue of its essential nature to all human beings, is shared with others. Some would say that spirituality is intuitive or even innate and, therefore, not easily susceptible to rational explication. Whilst it is sometimes described as being distinct from religion, arguably spirituality is essential to religion. One definition claims, people of all ages share basic human needs that include love (the giving and receiving of affection), faith (someone or something to believe in), hope (something to look forward to), peace (finding a measure of stability and tranquillity) and worship (a sense of awe and the attribution of value or ‘worth’ to whomever or whatever is deemed to merit it). (Jewell 1999, p. 10)Some of the circumstances of older age give a particular focus to these needs and values. Other definitions emphasize connectivity. Spirituality is an intra, inter and transpersonal experience that is shaped and directed by the experiences of individuals and the communities within which they live out their lives. (Swinton 2001, p. 20)Spirituality could be described as that which is essential to our humanity, embraces the desire for meaning and purpose, and has personal, social, and transcendent dimensions. The word ‘spirit’ comes from the Latin for breath and its equivalent in Hebrew and Greek, amongst other languages, similarly denotes that which is fundamental to life. To talk of spirituality, then, is to attempt to put into words things intimate and immanent as well as things other and transcendent.Spending time with people with dementia and their carers inevitably poses some basic questions about ourselves. Who am I and what is to become of me? What is the meaning and purpose of our lives? Such are the existential questions and dilemmas with which we are faced and which are often seen as funda mental to recent spiritual discourse. Historically, this discourse has taken place within the frameworks of faith traditions, where faith is both the means and the end of the spiritual quest. Clearly history bears witness to how religious faith, as the politics of spirituality, has not lived up to the ideals it has promulgated; fundamental concepts have been lost or diluted in practice. In a secular and post-modern environment, such history is often used as reason to cease taking underlying concepts seriously. Furthermore, post-Enlightenment philosophies have often rejected the premises of religious thought. That beliefs about who we are and what is to become of us can no longer be responded to in religious terms with any reasonable legitimacy or integrity is a notion we wish to challenge.The apparent renewal of interest in spirituality can be seen as indicative of a positive regard for the identity and personhood of people with dementia. We suggest it also reflects a sense of something essential that is missing from current theory and practice, which goes beyond specific considerations about people with dementia. Without understating the effects of dementia on either those diagnosed or their carers, it appears that people with dementia are showing us something of ultimate concern about the nature of personhood and creation. This is, perhaps, reflected in part by the recent focus on the personhood of people with dementia (Kitwood 1997).The way in which terms such as ‘individual’ and ‘person’ have been employed in both philosophical and religious thought over the centuries is being explored today, perhaps not so much to discover what has hitherto remained mysterious or unknown, but more in an attempt to recover that which has been lost in modern and post-modern thought, or indeed not developed adequately to sustain its case in the contemporary world of ideas.",

      "abstract": "The word resilience is originally a metallurgy term that characterizes the ability of a metal to be stressed (e.g., bent or twisted) and then to rebound to its original form when that stress is no longer applied. As evidenced by this volume, the construct of resilience has become increasingly used by psychologists and psychiatrists to describe similar properties in people—the ability to withstand stress and to rebound to pre-stress levels of functioning when the stress is over. Although this conceptualization is not necessarily shared by all resilience investigators (e.g., Bonanno, 2004), it does illustrate one perspective that has pervaded research in resilience, as well as conceptions of resilience by lay people.",

      "abstract": "Culture is the whole system of ideas and feelings, actions, and works produced by humans in a social construct, which are made their own by learning. The word culture comes from the Sanskrit word buddhayah”, the plural form of buddhi which means mind or intellect (Koentjaraningrat, 2005). J.J. Honingmann in his book The World of Man (1959) distinguishes the existence of three cultural phenomena, namely ideas, activities, and artifacts. This is then confirmed by the opinion of Koentjaraningrat (2009) which states that there are three forms of culture, namely; (1) the form of culture as a complex of ideas, values, norms, rules and so on. (2) the form of culture as a complex of patterned activities and actions from humans in society. (3) the form of culture as objects created by humans. The first form is the ideal form of culture. It is abstract, cannot be touched or photographed, its location is in the head, or in other words, in the minds of the people in the community where the culture resides. The second form of culture is called a social system, regarding the patterned actions of humans themselves. This social system consists of human activities that interact, relate and associate with each other in every second, day and year, accordingly to certain patterns based on customary behavior. The third form of culture is called physical culture, taking the form of all physical products and activities, actions and works of all humans in society. They are most concrete in nature and are in the form of objects or things that can be made, seen, and photographed.",

Mental reports fall into different categories. Some report something of a dispositional nature – they do not imply anything about the person's present state of consciousness. Reports of someone's beliefs seem to be of this kind, as do reports of his likes and dislikes. To say that at a certain time one person liked cheese and another person disliked cheese is not to say anything about their actual states of consciousness at that time – about their actual experiences, or thoughts, or feelings. Such statements could be true of them even if they were not conscious at that time at all – for instance, if they were asleep.",

Repentance is relevant to personal identity because the unrepentant soul has his own theory of personal identity. The unrepentant person believes he is his preference , and that he is entitled to the behavior that flows from those preferences. This fact can explain why people are so often reluctant to admit wrongdoing, why people place so much importance upon receiving an apology and other behaviors that would be otherwise inexplicable. The unrepentant person uses something akin to a naive economic theory of human behavior. The naive version of homo economicus , or economic man, can never truly be sorry for anything, and as a result, will be almost impossible to live with. A person who identifies himself too closely with his preferences will bring misery to himself and those around him.",

The question invokes a contrast between events that are actions, in which the higher faculties of human beings come into play, and those movements of a person's body – instances of behavior other than actions, or mere bodily happenings – that he does not himself make. This contrast can evidently be generalized. It is a special case of the contrast between activity and passivity, which is considerably wider in scope.",

Y como sabemos la fuerza era uno de los instrumentos para defenderse, por lo que las primeras discusiones terminaban a golpes y con la muerte de uno de los adversarios.\r\nCuando una persona sufria un dano era considerado personal sino que afectaba a todo el grupo, y las represalias se tomaban contra toda la otra tribu a la que pertenecia el ofensor.

The results obtained are as follows:1. The potential difference of the human body varies with different regions, being relatively higher between the parts near the trunk and the foot than that between the parts near the ends of the extremities and the foot; the maximum value of the potential difference is about 60mV, its maximum change being 40mV.2. The potential difference decreases when the subject changes from a working state to a resting state, and further decreases as sleep takes place, while it increases again as soon as the subject awakes.3. The potential difference also becomes higher when emotional tension appears as the result of sudden irritation, and resumes its original level when the subject calms down. Within a definite limit, the greater the tension is, the more markedly the potential difference will increase.4. It is the psychological tension that determines the potential difference of the body surface, though the physical status may make some difference. The authors are of the opinion that the potential difference from the body surface is a reliable indicator of the extent of emotional tension of human beings.",

Under this magic term some authors refer to the physico-chemical nature of the cell or cytoplasm, and usually with special reference to selective or directive catalysis; others to the general constitution or structure of the organism and almost indistinguishable from general morphology and physiology; others to embryological development as such (i.e. progressive differentiation under specific chemical stimuli); others more especially to “relations” between cells, organs and structural parts, often in an abstract sense; others refer more particularly to a hypothetical integrating and/or co-ordinating factor (“entelechy', ”field“, ”formative force“, ”telepathic hierarchial monads“, ”diffused Maxwell's Demon“, and so forth): a few refer to re-constitution from dissociated cells (so-called ”re-organization“) as observed in experiments with Sponges and Hydroids.",

      "abstract": "The experience, imagery, and fantasy of self in motion play a central part in the dreams, aspirations, and affective life of individuals, and in their growth. Human infants are supplied with an intrinsic drive to move to, with, and against forces and objects in the natural world, for that action maps a developing self into the world. This striving is not derivative from some other drive; it is a motivational force in and of itself intertwined with other essential strivings of the developing individual. Clinical observations and recent findings of developmental and neurobiological studies demonstrate that positive aspects of a person's striving in the sphere of motor control imbue a person's sense of self with qualities of energy, agency, and mastery. And, when thwarted, distorted, or unbalanced in relation to other strivings, one's physicality may also be a locus for conflict and maladaptive defenses. Schemas of self in relation to the world at large and especially to significant others are often encoded in procedural modes of remembering and perceiving, where movement is central. When the analyst is attuned to the experience of motor action in the life of the person he or she seeks to know fully and to help, the appreciation of that person's motives, emotions, and sense of self is deepened and enhanced.",

A number of citations display the different features salient to each of these two lines of interpretation. It is argued that, for some “singularities”, which take themselves and their powers and properties to be self-sufficient and self-legitimating, exposure to the “world” is in practice morally reductive or destructive. In other “singular” cases, such exposure amounts to, and offers an understanding of, Shakespearean versions of protagonism, heroism, and empathetic charm.",

Because persons are of a piece, whatever happens to one part happens to the all. Because of this, if a determinant of the illness is personal, psychological, social, or spiritual there will necessarily be physical manifestations as well. If these are given the most attention (as at present) that might not be true to the patients experience or offer the best opportunities for intervention. Sickness makes itself known by interferences in functioning that prevent persons from pursuing their goals and purposes.

      "abstract": "Barking bouts by muntjacs are given most often when visibility is reduced due to environmental conditions. Some individuals bark more readily than others, and various parameters associated with barking bouts overlap considerably among individuals. Barking in muntjacs probably does not function in the contexts of food procurement, reproduction, or maintenance and monitoring of individual movements. Rather, barking occurs primarily in two major contexts: during certain social encounters and when novel or inconspicuous stimuli, such as a hidden predator, are detected in the environment. Barking appears to have evolved via individual selection. Although the physical properties of barking bouts are such that they may make a muntjac more conspicuous and easily localized, this response to potential danger may act to deter predation. The underlying causal factor linking the two major contexts in which barks are given may be an internal state of anxiety. Anxiety, and hence barking, occurs more often in muntjacs which are characterized by specific behavioral profiles. Barking is proposed to be better termed a distress call than an alarm call.",

A voyeur may observe others without them being aware of it by a number of strategies. The voyeur may observe the subject from a distance, or use stealth to observe the subject with the use of peep-holes, two-way mirrors, hidden cameras, secret photography and other devices and strategies. Secret photography may involve the use of normal cameras, but with the photographer being concealed. Sometimes the camera itself is disguised or concealed. The use of telephoto lens enables the distance from the subject to provide concealment. The principal characteristic of voyeurism is that the voyeur does not normally relate directly with the subject of his/her interest, which is often unaware of being observed.",

      "title": "Derivation of the Extrinsic Values of Biological Diversity from Its Intrinsic Value and of Both from the First Principles of Evolution",
      "abstract": "Conservation ethics have been based on 2 philosophical value systems: extrinsic value (defined broadly to include all values that derive from something external to the thing valued) and intrinsic value. Valuing biological diversity on the basis of an extrinsic value system is problematic because measurement is often difficult; extrinsic value changes as spatial or temporal scales change; extrinsic value differs on the basis of external factors; some species have trivial or negative extrinsic values; and extrinsic value varies across human cultures and societies and with such factors as socioeconomic conditions, individual experiences, and educational backgrounds. Valuing biological diversity on the basis of an intrinsic value system also poses challenges because intrinsic value can be seen as a disguised form of human extrinsic value; intrinsic value is initially ambiguous as to which objects or characteristics of biological diversity are to being valued; all aspects of biological diversity (e.g., species and ecosystems) are transitory; species and ecosystems are not static concrete entities; and intrinsic value of one species is often in conflict with the intrinsic value of other species. Extrinsic and intrinsic value systems share a common origin, such that extrinsic values are always derived from intrinsic value and life mutely expresses both intrinsic and extrinsic values-these are derived from and are products of biological evolution. Probing the values that underlie conservation helps the community clearly articulate its aims.

It can be verbal or non- verbal, formal or informal as long as it conveys an idea that triggers an idea, gesture, action, etc. Good communication is considered an acquired skill. Most people are born with the ability to speak physically, but we must learn to speak well and communicate effectively. The ability to speak, listen, and understand verbal and nonverbal meaning is a skill that we develop in many ways. We learn basic communication skills by observing others and modeling behavior based on what we see. However, it is important to point out here that information is useless until it is delivered to someone who needs it or needs it. Thus, communication is the process of, distributing or transmitting information from one person to another or from one place to another. In other words, communication is the process of generating, communicating, and interpreting ideas, facts, opinions and feelings. It is essentially an exchange, a process that is a reciprocal exchange between two or more people.",

      "title": "Clothing Comfort- Physiological Status and Psychological Status",
      "abstract": "The primary need of people to dress has changed as time passed, because different high-tech fibers, yarns, fabrics, finishing applications, trends and society influences have completely changed. Welfare and comfort properties have become decisive components to make a product appreciated and successful. This paper presents the detailed explanation of clothing comfort, its subgroups and also the Physiological status and psychological status of the people. Clothing also known as clothes, apparel and attire is items worn on the body. Clothing is typically made of fabrics or textiles but over time has included garments made from animal skin or other thin layers of materials put together. The wearing of comfort clothing is mostly restricted to human beings and is a feature of all human societies. Comfort or being comfortable is a sense of physical or psychological ease, often characterized as a lack of hardship. Persons who are lacking in comfort are uncomfortable, or experiencing discomfort. A degree of psychological comfort can be achieved by recreating experiences that are associated with pleasant. Persons who are surrounded with things that provide psychological comfort may be described as being \"in their comfort zone\". Because of the personal nature of positive associations, psychological comfort is highly subjective. As the year goes the word comfort is been used in all areas such as food, work, people and clothing. Thermal comfort is the condition of mind that expresses satisfaction with the thermal environment and is assessed by subjective evaluation. The human body will release excess heat into the environment, so the body can continue to operate. The heat transfer is proportional to temperature difference. Maintaining this standard of thermal comfort for occupants is one of the important goals of HVAC (heating, ventilation, and air conditioning) design engineers. And in designing of clothes is the most important goal of a fashion designer. There are six primary factors that directly affect thermal comfort that can be grouped in two categories: personal factors - because they are characteristics of the occupants - and environmental factors - which are conditions of the thermal environment. The former are metabolic rate and clothing level, the latter are air temperature, mean radiant temperature, air speed and humidity. Even if all these factors may vary with time, standards usually refer to a steady state to study thermal comfort, just allowing limited temperature variations. The study was conducted to know the responses about comfort clothing in Physiological status and psychological status acceptance. Since there are large variations from person to person in terms of physiological and psychological satisfaction, it is hard to find an optimal temperature for everyone in a ABSTRACT 62 International Journal for Modern Trends in Science and Technology given space. Survey is been collected to define conditions that will be found comfortable for a specified percentage of occupants, being comfortable is a sense of physical or psychological factors. Understanding clothing comfort, Need and consumer trends basic and universal need of consumers in clothing is comfort and they look for good feel and comfort when they buy clothing and other textile materials. Clothing is very important in our life that we use every day to obtain physiological and psychological comfort and also to ensure physical conditions around our body suitable for survival. Therefore, it is extremely important for the survival of human beings and improvement of the quality of our life to have good understanding of the fundamentals of clothing comfort. From the viewpoint of the manufacturers of clothing and textile materials, understanding of clothing comfort has substantial financial implications in the effort to satisfy the needs and wants of consumers in order to obtain sustainable competitive advantages in modern consumer markets. Consumer always expects some additional functional qualities from the clothes they purchase. Clothing is manufactured in a wide range of thermal, tactile and physical properties to meet consumer needs. Depending on the nee. and expectations of the consumer's, the clothing and textile manufacturers provide wide range of options to enhance human comfort. For example, clothing made from blends and natural fibres are preferred to man-made fibres for all comfort attributes except smoothness or woven fabric are preferred to knits for smoothness, thickness and openness. To understand the basics of clothing comfort, sensory tools as well as the equipment’s to evaluate the comfort related characteristics of textile materials have been developed. Large number of studies has been carried out and many equipment are developed in the textile and clothing area such as mechanical, thermal and surface testing, so as to evaluate the related physical properties, but the body between measurement and the consumer feeling of comfort are still difficult to establish. Consumers want everything from the clothing, i.e. it should look good, feel good, perform well, said like their clothing to match with their chosen attitudes, roles and images. Consumers are now allowing touch, smell, intuition, and emotion to influence their decision on clothing selection more than their aesthetic sense. Asa result, great importance is being attributed to the wearing experience and thus comfort is being reinforced as a key parameter in clothing. It is also true that requirements of consumers on comfort changes with products and situations. Clearly, understanding and satisfying the needs of consumer towards clothing products are crucial for the long-term survival and growth of clothing and textile demand. Understanding and enhancement of clothing comfort is definitely one of the important issues.",

      "title": "Philosophy and Politics in the Contemporary Age",
      "abstract": "Political wisdom, judgement or genius do not stem from the spirit of science and is not the upshot of theoretical generalizations or learning. There is of course “political science” and “political philosophy” but politicians can properly act without them because it is neither the discovery of laws or generalizations in the field of politics nor “knowledge about political things” but “political sense” that is crucial for his actions. As Isaiah Berlin put it years ago: “What makes statesmen, like drivers of cars, successful is that they do not think in general terms – that is, they do not primarily ask themselves in what respect a given situation is like or unlike other situations in the long course of human history (which is what historical sociologists, or theologians in historical clothing, such as Vico or Toynbee, are fond of doing). Their merit is that they grasp the unique combination of characteristics that constitute this particular situation – this and no other. What they are said to be able to do is to understand the character of particular movement, of a particular individual, of a unique state of affairs, of unique atmosphere, of some particular combination of economic, political, personal factors; and we do not readily suppose that this capacity can literally be taught”. Therefore politics is not a quest for “general terms” or general features of political phenomena but a direct and individual insight into concrete reality. Being a politician takes not learning but talent, not expertise but intuition, not knowledge but sense; it takes looking not at general but the particular dimension of human actions. Politicians can be taunted for their posture as Napoleon, they can be uneducated as farmer George Washington or act against morality as Cardinal Richelieu but frankly speaking all these vices are unimportant in the political realm.",

Few textbooks even index the term. To help remedy this odd neglect, the author postulated the protective motive as a biologically given “thrust to wholeness,” modified by experience and dependent on social support. Utilizing mechanisms of homeostasis, defense, prevention, healing, and “outreach” (i.e., wholeness expressed), the motive disposes the individual to maintain and express the functional integrity of body and self (including “all that is mine”). Seemingly unrelated phenomena (e.g., immune response, quest for immortality, forgiveness, sharing, urge to procreate) are thus afforded common explanation. Prospectively, the thrust to wholeness affords conceptual unity, parsimony, and pedagogical utility. Also, it may furnish a conceptual anchor for well-being and its paradoxes, self-defeat and suicide.",

The fact that shame is also characterized by a heightened feeling of exposure and vulnerability, by a wish to hide, to become invisible, and to sink into the ground, should alert us to the fact that the body plays a significant role in the emotion. Sartre highlights the impact of the gaze. The case of vicarious shame provides further reason to question the proposal that others are accidental to shame, and play no significant role in its structure. It is no coincidence that the Oxford English Dictionary in its definition of shame includes a reference to situations, where shame arises from the consciousness of something dishonouring, ridiculous, or indecorous in the conduct of those whose honour or disgrace one regards as one's own.",

Firstly, they can have an extremely long recurrence interval – so long that the greatest may not have occurred within human memory. Secondly, the effects of events with which we are all too familiar, for example earthquakes, floods, volcanoes and storms, are easily trumped by the impacts of objects – comets and asteroids – that reach Earth from outer space; and thirdly, the largest of these events have a global reach, in principle threatening not just our way of life but perhaps life on Earth itself. However, recognising that such events occur very rarely, should we ‘make hay while the sun shines’ and ignore, ostrich-like, the significant actuarial risk; or should we seek to understand the underlying phenomena and develop strategies to mitigate the threat, and perhaps technologies to avert it? Our individual response often depends less on a purely rational assessment than on personal circumstances and how we have been brought up. In any case the nature of the risks, which are poorly understood, means that we must be prepared to handle the law of unintended consequences (that is, could our actions make things worse?). We must also be prepared to explore what happens if, perhaps inevitably, our current scientific understanding turns out to be less certain than many experts believe.",

      "title": "Adaptive Behavior and Consciousness",
      "abstract": "Consciousness has resisted scientific explanation for centuries. The main problem in explaining consciousness is accounting for its subjectivity. Subjectivity is an internal point of view or perspective (context) developed from current sensory input and previous experience (perception). Subjective systems may be adaptive; that is, able to respond to change. Humans have the ability to produce voluntary new or novel intentional (adaptive) action and such production is very important for survival. This action is always composed through the choice or free will of the person (voluntary), is always new or novel, and is always directed towards some goal (intentional). Adaptive action is always composed according to the subject‘s point of view or perspective at the moment and is always accompanied by consciousness. Hence the two may be the same. Adaptive action normally arises from perception. Perception directly produces basic programmed action. In order to produce adaptive action, perception must be represented in a new way, so that it becomes explicit, functional, and conscious. This new representation may be accomplished through operation of a positive feedback nonlinear emergent mechanism which is responsible for the generation of a large number of natural phenomena. This mechanism results in the production of explicit stable states from perception which has all the same properties as consciousness and hence may be identical to consciousness. These states are a type of active short term memory and have the ability to produce various types of adaptive action. Consciousness is shown to be natural, material, and functional; utilized in the production of adaptive action.",

      "title": "Power Motivation in Sidonius Apollinaris, Eugippius, and Nonnus",
      "abstract": "Power can be thought of as the capacity to produce effects, consciously and unconsciously intended, on the behaviour and feelings of others. Power motivation arises when an individual experiences a need that can only be fulfilled by inducing appropriate behaviour in others. Ideals of service are an important means for taming or socializing power, rendering it more acceptable. This often means that a drive for power is marked by talk of duty and responsibility. The ranks of teachers, psychologists, clergymen, journalists, and urban planners contain above average numbers of people with a high power motivation. It can be hard to distinguish legitimate and necessary leadership from coercion and domination, for the latter may not be perceived as such by followers. People vary enormously in the degree to which they are prepared to challenge existing structures and norms to gain power, and they vary in their response to the attainment of power. The mere status of their position may be sufficient for some: power is not vigorously or selfishly exercised, nor is it conspicuously displayed. There may be present a fear of power, i.e., a fear of abusing it, which is defended against by maintaining that power is not one's own but a gift of grace to be used for the benefit of others. Charismatic or messianic leaders often make this claim. They are able to enhance the self-esteem of followers by providing a potent object of identification, and they lead by making their followers feel powerful rather than by commanding them. Identifying with any winner or hero, whether sporting, religious, or political, provides a vicarious experience of power. The need for power, therefore, is not only about a drive to influence others. Alcohol consumption induces a feeling of power. For those frustrated in their hopes of gaining real power, it offers a substitute, as do sex and violent behaviour. A drive for personalized power may be accompanied by high alcohol consumption, low inhibition of impulses, and, more so than socialized power, it has a present orientation, a moment-by-moment quality that has to be constantly reaffirmed. Gambling offers opportunities to impress and to win in the short run. A socialized power drive is characterized by low alcohol consumption and high inhibition, and may be advertized by dietary and sexual asceticism.",

      "title": "Life Is Pointless—Good Point...and How Do You Feel about That?",
      "abstract": "This essay is in response to R. Weinberg, whose title well-summarizes the article: “Ultimate Meaning: We Don’t Have It, We Can’t Get It, and We Should Be Very, Very Sad.” This response accepts the idea that life is pointless but argues against the non sequitur that we should be very, very sad. There is a question as to whether “should” means that being sad is the appropriate thing to do, or whether it is a prediction about what will happen if people understand the pointlessness of life. Either way, from the perspective of cognitive psychology, clearly the implied causal path from thought to feeling does not always hold; considerable evidence suggests that, often, causation goes the other way around, that feelings influence thoughts. A person’s feeling sad or depressed might increase the likelihood that the person will conclude that life is pointless, or that the person will worry about it. Nobody has proven that the pointlessness of existence is incompatible with satisfaction in one’s life, or that not feeling sad means one is overlooking the pointlessness of life, or that feeling sad is more appropriate or better in some way. In sum, I wish people happiness and urge them to try to construct a meaning in their life.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The author argues that the so-called \"basic emotions\", such as happiness, fear or anger, are in fact cultural artifacts of the English language, just as the Ilongot concept of liget, or the Ifaluk concept of song, are the cultural artifacts of Ilongot and Ifaluk. It is therefore as inappropriate to talk about human emotions in general in terms of happiness, fear, or anger as it would be to talk about them in terms of liget or song. However, this does not mean that we cannot penetrate into the emotional world of speakers of languages other than our own. Nor does it mean that there cannot be any universal human emotions. Universality of emotions is an open issue which requires further investigation. For this further investigation to be fully productive, it has to be undertaken from a universal, language and culture-independent perspective; and it has to be carried out in a universalist framework that is language and culture-independent. The author proposes for this purpose the \"natural semantic metalanguage\" based on universal (or near-universal) semantic primitives (or near-primitives), developed over two decades by herself and colleagues, and she argues that the use of this metalanguage facilitates such a perspective and offers such a framework.",

      "title": "DEVELOPMENTAL TRENDS IN THE ABSTRACTION ABILITY OF CHILDREN1",
      "abstract": "ion is mental process in which some attribute or characteristic is observed independently of other characteristics of an experience as a whole. Werner (26) emphasizes that the ability to abstract does not appear suddenly in the course of the individual's development; rather it is present from the very beginnings of life but changes qualitatively with progress in maturation. Different organizational patterns of response to environmental stimuli are observed in children of varying age levels (26). The abstraction behavior of very young children seems to be primarily on a sensori-motor level and can be designated as perceptual. In such a response the individual yields to demands of the situation, and the organization of the material is determined by the nature of the stimuli as well as by the limited maturity of the subject. A more mature individual would be expected to consciously impose organi- zation on the material (i, 7, 14, 17, 19, 26) and classify the material into deliberately conceived categories. This is the conceptual level of abstraction. The hypothesis that the younger the child, the more perceptual are his organizations has been stated (i, 7, 14, 26) but a search for specific details of the development encounters a paucity of data. The present study was undertaken to obtain information regarding changes in abstraction abil- ity during the elementary school period.",

      "title": "“Mind to Mind”: Tolkien’s Faërian Drama and the Middle English Sir Orfeo",
      "abstract": "“Mind to Mind”:Tolkien’s Faërian Drama and the Middle English Sir Orfeo1 Kelley M. Wickham-Crowley (bio) Now “Faërian Drama”—those plays, which according to abundant records the elves have often presented to men—can produce Fantasy with a realism and immediacy beyond the compass of any human mechanism. As a result their usual effect (upon a man) is to go beyond Secondary Belief. If you are present at a Faërian drama you yourself are, or think that you are, bodily inside its Secondary World. The experience may be very similar to Dreaming and has (it would seem) sometimes (by men) been confounded with it. But [in Faërian Drama you are in a dream that some other mind is weaving, and] the knowledge of that alarming fact may slip from your grasp. …2 You are deluded—whether that is the intention of the elves (always or at any time) is another question. They at any rate are not themselves deluded. This is for them a form of Art, and distinct from Wizardry or Magic, properly so called. They do not live in it, though they can, perhaps, afford to spend more time at it than human artists can. The Primary World, Reality, of elves and men is the same, if differently valued and perceived. (OFS 63, ¶74) … faierie a state of being in which the will can more or less directly cause things imagined or desired actually to be, or can at least present them to the senses; and the very immediacy of the operation enhances the quality of the product: beautiful things produced by faierie retain the beauty of the vision that precedes the making … (OFS 255) Between every two trees is a doorway to a new world. (Attributed to John Muir)3 J.R.R. Tolkien’s foundational theories of “On Fairy-stories” include the coining of the term “eucatastrophe,” the definition of subcreation, a term first implied by George MacDonald4 though without the expansion Tolkien gave it, and the concept of Secondary Belief in a created Secondary World. But another phrase, Faërian drama, has gone mainly undiscussed as a literary term except in some of Verlyn Flieger’s work,5 perhaps for obvious reasons. It appears as a somewhat peculiar [End Page 1] reference to what fairies/elves might create as art but becomes a springboard for philosophical and metaphysical considerations of how two created species with inherently different minds might communicate what is most central to their experience of the world. On one level, “On Fairy-stories” is a manifesto, as Verlyn Flieger has rightly called it (“Fairy-tale” 27). It does not simply attempt to discuss the terms, rules, and history of what are commonly called fairy tales; it declares Fantasy the highest form of human literary art because, motivated by a desire to be closer to the original creator of worlds, it attempts in its subcreated worlds to imitate that maker. It offers reasons why the desire to tell a story that gives us new ways to see the world, that turns unexpectedly to joy, is central to any being and its health, but even more, central to the created world and its purpose. Within an essay with such a sweeping context for human art, then, Faërian drama initially seems paradoxically important and a minor aside. Tolkien invites us to acknowledge that “fairy-stories” are really human stories about Faërie and its immortals, and asserts that Faërie in its own art would consider humans and mortality as similarly puzzling and alien. Both bodies of stories would inevitably be partial and sometimes in error, constrained by the minds and natures of each. Of what use then, perhaps especially in an academic essay, is an imagined art and genre for an equally imagined or even nonexistent race of artists? The key here is Tolkien’s refusal to separate his scholarly and intellectual interests from his urge, as a created being, to create fiction and fictional settings that command credibility. He had to work out the metaphysical possibilities of Faërie art, constituted by him here under the term “Faërian drama,” to create his own...",

      "title": "The \"Either or\" and Its Effects on Education",
      "abstract": "One of the most significant characteristics which appears to have continually pervaded educational thought and practice is that of the 'either-or.' This is perhaps not surprising as new, or at least, relatively new ideas are invariably introduced as either a reaction against or as some kind of remedy for felt deficiencies in a prevailing mode of thought or action. The history of education is mile-stoned with dichotomous stances: traditional/progressive; closed/open classrooms; teacher-directed/learner-directed activity; art instruction/self-expression; and so on. Indeed this would seem to be a natural order of events as any inadequacies or deficiencies in the system are invariably seen through selectively exaggerated vision and to be attacked vehemently as one would a Quixotic windmill. The new idea, to be put forward subtly or more likely not so subtly, has almost of necessity to be overstated so that the very point at issue will not be missed or the conviction with which it is put forward underestimated. As everyone knows, educational systems are conservative by nature and resistant to change so that any new idea, if it is to take root, has to be distinctly and perhaps even dramatically different from that which it is intended to replace or counter. Educational innovators would not welcome the analogy yet much of what they do in proliferating their ideas would equate them with some of the most successful ad-men of our time. Reference is frequently made almost benignly and certainly resignedly to the 'pendulum of education' which, it would seem, inexorably swings back and forth as if educational thought and practice",

      "title": "Trust as an Unquestioning Attitude",
      "abstract": "Abstract According to most accounts of trust, you can only trust other people (or groups of people). To trust is to think that another has goodwill, or something to that effect. I sketch a different form of trust: the unquestioning attitude. What it is to trust, in this sense, is to settle one’s mind about something, to stop questioning it. To trust is to rely on a resource while suspending deliberation over its reliability. Trust lowers the barrier of monitoring, challenging, checking, and questioning. Trust sets up open pipelines between yourself and parts of the external world. Trust permits external resources to have a similar relationship to one as one’s internal cognitive faculties. This creates efficiency, but at the price of exquisite vulnerability. We must trust in this way because we are cognitively limited beings in a cognitively overwhelming world. Crucially, we can hold the unquestioning attitude towards objects and technologies. When I trust my climbing rope, I stop worrying about its reliability. When I trust my online calendaring system, I simply go to the events indicated, without question. But, one might worry, how could one ever hold such a normatively loaded attitude as trust towards mere objects? How could it ever make sense to feel betrayed by an object? Trust is our engine for expanding and outsourcing our agency—for binding external processes into our practical selves. Thus, we can be betrayed by our smartphones in the same way that we can be betrayed by our memory. When we trust, we try to make something a part of our agency, and we are betrayed when our part lets us down. To unquestioningly trust something is to let it in—to attempt to bring it inside one’s practical functioning. This suggests a new form of gullibility: agential gullibility, which occurs when agents too hastily and carelessly integrate external resources into their own agency.",

      "abstract": "Everyone has five senses: touch, taste, smell, sight, and hearing. Each of these plays a vital role in one's life. But what happens when you don't have one of these and are forced to live with it? Hearing loss is a condition that affects one of these five senses: hearing. Those affected by this condition lose their hearing. It may be a partial loss or complete loss but they cannot hear as one normally should. This condition is quickly growing to be common around the globe affecting a wide variety of people. What makes these conditions so unique is that there is a multitude of causes for them. This paper focuses on some of these causes to find a connection. It was found that one connection between all of these causes is that they are a result of some sort of physical damage or injury to the ear. But this injury’s location and specifications are different in each case yet the result is also hearing loss. Furthermore, this paper offers solutions and prevention for some of the different cases of hearing loss that can be encountered; thereby preparing persons to avoid this condition.",

      "title": "Semiotics of Literary Titling: Three Categories of Reference",
      "abstract": "Introduction: Between naming and titling Any case of naming and titling involves a purpose of identification. [1] This purpose is essentially technical, and is based on needs and considerations outside the named and titled object. The function of identification in such a case is to shorten and to summarize. Instead of embarking on a lengthy account of the main features and landmarks of New York City to identify this object for your reader or interlocutor you need only mention the name of the city, which is a combination of just two words. Shortening and summarizing catalyze communication among people, hence necessarily make it more efficient. However, the difference between naming and titling is not merely semantic but more significant, and may be summed up by the five following points. 1. Who/what is entitled to a name or a title? Since the name is given to a certain object for purposes of identification, the bearer of the name must have a certain importance or significance, actual or potential, and there is interest in identifying it. Any human being must have a name by his/her definition as a human being: a social, communicative creature. In other words, naming is a function of communication. However, is any object entitled to a name? Theoretically yes, but in fact only an object of significance or which fills a special function for humans is entitled to a private name of its own. 'Not everything is entitled to be titled, although everything is entitled to be named. Names can be given to anything, but titling calls for some special acknowledgment of value or relationship. A rock is not entitled to a title unless it is a special rock [...] Titles are names which have a sense; they call for responses' (Fisher 1984: 298-299). Here we should distinguish the private from the collective behavior of an object. Trees as single items, with no particular significance for humans, will probably comply with what language gives them: forest, wood, grove, and so on. But if this forest as a whole, or as a collective, carries specific significance for a group of people, it becomes entitled to its own name. Even when a particular tree from a forest has particular significance for a certain person, or a group of people, it too is entitled to its own name, whether the whole forest has its own name or not. Semantically, the name refers to any material object of any kind, but not every object is entitled to such a name. In art in general, and in literature in particular, matters are somewhat different. In literature we can speak of collective behavior of texts using terminology of genre such as novel, poetry, drama, short story, and the like. But the collective behavior of literary texts in terms of genre does not deny the right of every literary work to a specific title of its own. Moreover, the title of a collection of short stories does not replace the title which every short story in this collection is entitled to carry. This stresses the specific importance of every story as an independent verbal statement. 2. When is a name given and when a title? In certain cases the process of naming should be performed in advance. A daughter or a son is named immediately after birth or maybe even before. In other cases a name may be given to a street long after it has been paved. Whether a name is given before or after the object comes into existence we may speak of a separation or a detachment between the content of the name and the content of the object. You may give your daughter the name X while her qualities are Y (Fisher 1984: 288). The name does not require anything from the object and the object does not commit itself to fulfill the expectations aroused by the name. The naming process becomes a function of subjective considerations that are not necessarily related to the object itself (Levinson 1985: 38). Such considerations may be wishes (hoping that the object will fulfill the expectations aroused by the name) or a miming and copying of a previous name (of a famous person, a famous object, etc. …",

Las deficiencias son problemas que afectan a una estructura o funcion corporal; las limitaciones de la actividad son dificultades para ejecutar acciones o tareas, y las restricciones de la participacion son problemas para participar en situaciones vitales. Por consiguiente, la discapacidad es un fenomeno complejo que refleja una interaccion entre las caracteristicas del organismo humano y las caracteristicas de la sociedad en la que vive.�1 Lo que no dice la definicion es la carga social que esa palabra lleva para las personas que tienen una deficiencia, una limitacion o una restriccion. Una persona miope tiene una limitacion ya que sin gafas tiene dificultades para ver, pero al ser una limitacion normalizada2, no es considerada discapacidad. El objeto de esta investigacion es desarrollar una teoria que nos permita entender que provoca que determinadas deficiencias, sean etiquetadas o calificadas como discapacidad, con su consiguiente carga social. EnglishAccording to WHO (World Health Organization) disability an umbrella term, covering impairments, activity limitations, and participation restrictions. An impairment is a problem in body function or structure; an activity limitation is a difficulty encountered by an individual in executing a task or action; while a participation restriction is a problem experienced by an individual in involvement in life situations. Thus disability is a complex phenomenon, reflecting an interaction between features of a person�s body and features of the society in which he or she lives. The definition does not say the social burden that word brings to people who have a deficiency, a limitation or restriction. A nearsighted person has a limitation because without glasses have trouble seeing, but being a standard limitation is not considered disabled. The object of this investigation is to develop a theory that allows us to understand what causes that certain deficiencies are labelled or qualified as disability, with its consequent social burden.",

      "title": "THE IMPORTANCE OF ADOPTING A HEALTHY LIFESTYLE",
      "abstract": "A healthy lifestyle is a concept that refers not only to the concern for physical health but also to that of mind and soul. Therefore, the concern for physical activity must be extended to activities for the soul and mind.\r\nOften, we humans do not lean toward things that are considered small, such as information about correct eating. More attention is paid to the constant attempt to adapt to new technologies, to science news and much less to a healthy lifestyle as a whole. Therefore, generations that are behind may be considered deficient in a chapter act, given the growing obesity in children, but which is more pronounced in adults as well.\r\nEducating children about correct nutrition, the importance of physical movement and keeping hygiene is essential, because they will become responsible, healthy adults who can pass on accurate personal health information.\r\nAccording to the World Health Organization (WHO) assessment, health is the state of full physical, spiritual and social well-being, not just the absence of illness or physical defects. Health is influenced by several factors, interdependent, natural and socio-economic. If at the latter we can remember working, living or eating conditions, in the natural ones, we can talk about climate, water, soil, etc.\r\nThe influence of natural and social factors is interconnected, ie the development of industry, transport, city development exerts an influence on the natural composition of water, air, soil, and natural factors affect the population's supply and living conditions, industry development, living, etc. But the essential factor determining the health of man is his way of life, in this notion is the correct working and resting regime, the rational feeding, the maintenance on a correct level of the physical activity, the quenching, the observance of the individual hygiene rules, the renunciation of the harmful daily habits, the ability to maintain neuro-emotional balance in conflict situations.\r\n Rezumat\r\nUn stil de viața sanatos este un concept care se refera nu doar la preocuparea pentru sanatatea fizica, ci și la cea a minții și a sufletului. De aceea, preocuparea pentru activitatea fizica trebuie extinsa și la activitați pentru suflet și minte.\r\nDe multe ori nu ne aplecam spre lucruri considerate marunte, precum informarea asupra alimentației corecte. O mai mare atenție se acorda incercarii permanente de adaptare la noile tehnologii, la noutați in materie de știința și mult mai puțin unui mod de viața sanatos, ca intreg. De aceea, generațiile care vin din urma ar putea fi considerate deficitare la acest capitol, având in vedere obezitatea in creștere la copii, dar care se manifesta tot mai accentuat și la adulți.\r\nEducarea copiilor privind alimenația corecta, importanța mișcarii fizice și pastrarea igienei este esențiala, pentru ca astfel, vor ajunge adulți responsabili, sanatoși, care vor putea transmite mai departe o informație corecta privind sanatatea personala. \r\nConform aprecierii Organizației Mondiale a Sanatații (OMS), sanatatea este starea deplinei bunastari fizice, spirituale și sociale, nu numai lipsa bolilor sau a defectelor fizice. Sanatatea este influențata de mai mulți factori interdependenți, naturali și socio-economici.\r\nDaca la cei din urma putem aminti condiții de munca, de trai ori alimentare, la cei naturali, putem vorbi de clima, apa, sol etc. Influența factorilor naturali și sociali este interconexata, adica dezvoltarea industriei, transportului, dezvoltarea orașelor exercita o influența asupra componenței naturale a apei, aerului, solului, iar factorii naturali se rasfrâng asupra caracterului alimentarii și condițiilor de viața ale populației, asupra dezvoltarii industriei, alegerii locului de trai etc.\r\nÂnsa factorul esențial ce determina sanatatea omului âl constituie modul lui de viața, in aceasta noțiune intra regimul corect de munca și odihna, alimentarea raționala, menținerea la un nivel corect a activitații fizice, calirea, respectarea regulilor de igiena individuala, renunțarea la deprinderile cotidiene daunatoare, capacitatea de a menține echilibrul neuro-emoțional in situațiile conflictuale.",

      "abstract": "The use of freedom-depriving measures (physical and medicinal restraints) in people with cognitive impairment or dementia in clinical care settings is of ongoing importance. At the same time, these coercive measures are not only heavily debated but also in most cases ethically questionable from the perspective of the ethics of human dignity. Usually, the ethical evaluation of freedom-depriving measures follows classical paradigms of medical ethics, such as the Principles of Biomedical Ethics by Beauchamp and Childress. To enrich the debate at this point, the ethical category of embodiment (Leiblichkeit ) is introduced and discussed after a short summary of the ethical problem at hand. The phenomenon of the living body that has received increasingly more attention in several sciences since the proclaimed corporeal turn enables new perspectives towards human dignity, freedom and deprivation of freedom: freedom-depriving measures do not take place in an invisible realm of ideas but are directly applied to the psychophysical unity that is the living body of a person. Thus, freedom-depriving measures are an intervention into the bodily autonomy of the human being and the personal freedom that is manifested in the living body. The concept of the living body (Leib) that is applied here, signifies more than just a physical object and is especially apt to capture the (inter)subjective dimension that has to be taken into account here. Finally, it will have to be investigated whether the use of medicinal restraints represents an especially serious interference into the sphere of human embodiment. Once introduced into the debate on freedom-depriving measures in clinical care, the category of embodiment can warrant decisive new emphases.",

      "abstract": "In a state of mental health, a person has a sense of self (sense of self) are intact as a human with a single basic personality. Mental health is the main capital of a human life. Without mentally healthy, a man can not carry out duties humanity well. A healthy human is not only physically fit, but also psychologically healthy. Free from human disturbance is an indication that mentally healthy. There are various kinds of mental disorder (mental disorder), one them is the dissociative trance disorder (dissociative trance disorder).\r\nIn a society known as dissociative phenomena of trance. Trance trusted by the community as a condition that occurs when the spirit others enter one's and master it so that it becomes another in terms of speech, behavior and nature. His behavior became like there Another personality who 'enter'. Maramis (1994:418) call a dissociative mechanism which can lead to multiple personalities (multiple personality) and dissociative identity disorder (dissociative identity disorder). Kaplan & Sadock (1997:100) states that the major dysfunction in the dissociative is the loss of integrity of states of consciousness so that people feel no have experienced the confusion of identity or identity of its own or have multiple identities. Society considers that it happened because someone possessed has conceded the genie or spirit that makes strange behavior outside consciousness. And treatment according to the general public with a request help to the smart people, paranormal, religious scholars, and people which is considered an expert handle it. Rarely do patients with dissociative taken to the doctor. Trance in psychology known as dissociative phenomena which is defined as a psychological state that occurs due to a change in the functioning of self (identity, memory or consciousness) (Nevid, Rathus & Greene, 1997:236). This condition can occur suddenly or gradually, are temporary or chronic. This dissociation phenomenon refers to the trance dissociative. Dissociative trance is a temporary change in terms of consciousness or a weak / loss of feeling self-identity (sense of personal identity) without the emergence of new identities (Suryaningrum, 2006). Under conditions trance, loss of identity is not related to the emergence of new identities and actions raised during a trance state is generally not complex (Eg kejangkejang, bergulingguling, fall). According Hawari (2006), trance is a reaction that kejiwaaan called dissociation reaction (dissociative reactions). The reaction led to loss of ability to recognize the reality around him, due to pressure physically and mentally. This dissociation reaction upon them that his soul labile plus the condition that made him depressed. Stress that piled added a trigger enabling the controlled reaction of this subconscious 3 come to the surface, so that someone who is experiencing severe stress, then it very easy to experience dissociative trance. Here's one example the case of dissociative trance state as it has experienced by subjects in this study. The subjects had experienced a trance\r\nwhen aged 20 years. When the incident was the subject felt in him something control, he berteriakteriak and weeping and occurred nearly five hours ever, he did not realize that he is in a state of trance. The subject admitted before experiencing a trance, the subject has a variety of problems heavy. At that time many of the problems it faces, ranging from problems Personally, the problem with the family until the economic problems that can not be resolved. And finally permasalahanpermasalahan makes depressed subjects. The international medical world, especially psychiatry recognize the phenomenon and written in guiding the most recent psychiatric diagnosis Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorder IV (DSMIV) and The International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems 10 (ICD10). DSMIV enter possessed pathologic (pathologic possession) into a dissociative disorder diagnosis is not specific (dissociative disorder Otherwise not specified). ICD10 categorizes as disorders possessed trance and possession disorder (DSMIVTR, 2000). In fact in daily life, many people who experience dissociative trance without realizing it. In other words he refused to say trance for example, when they're driving, aircraft, and was watching TV in a state of daydreaming. Trance, case found in many third world countries. In India the culture and similar culture of Indonesia, possesion syndrome or hysterical possesion is a form of dissociation of the most frequently found. Figures happened approximately 1 4% from the general population. Epidemiological studies have possesion reportedly related to the social crisis in the community (Hidayat, 2006). Based on gender, women have a greater risk dissociative trance than boys. The condition usually occurs trans in women and is often associated with stress or trauma (Barlow & Durand, 2002:177). This is evident from the cases which occurs mostly are women. This may be because women are more sugestible or more easily influenced than boys.\r\nThose who have personality histerikal sugestible which one character is more risky for the dissociation or also become victims of crime hypnotist. Based on the age, most victims dissociation-old adolescents and young adults. Therefore, it can be concluded that those at risk for dissociation were female teens or young adults are easily influenced. Barlow & Durand (2002:174) states, when individuals felt detached from him or as if he was like a dream, it can be said he dissociative experience. Dissociation most likely occurs after kejadiankejadian which makes the individual very stressful. It may also occur when someone is weakened or psychic experience mental distress. Many species study expresses a relationship between traumatic events, particularly physical and sexual abuse during children, with dissociative (Kaplan, 1997:100). Dissociative trance state is a phenomenon that is admirable and interesting but confusing. Based on existing explanations, dissociative trance phenomenon is still unknown for certain reasons, so researchers are keen to raise this phenomenon as a scientific research. This study represents an initial step to know the factors the causes (etiology), a person may experience trance dissociative.",

      "abstract": "It is a striking principle of biology that the activity of living substance tends to inhibit its further activity. Carried to a moderate degree, this inhibition leads to the self-preservation of the living substance—to an extreme degree, to its self-destruction. The characteristics of this inhibition, its accompanying phenomena within the organism and the causes that lead to it form the subject of the present lecture. Fatigue is a comprehensive term, comprising, in its simple form, the functional state of the organism and its constituent parts after activity. Lying on the border zone where the physiologic and the pathologic meet, it reaches far into both and obscures the division lines between them. When present in slight or moderate degree, it limits achievement, but is easily recovered from; when excessive or an accompaniment of disease, it forms a serious condition, which, if in man, the medical practitioner must meet and combat.

      "title": "Seeing nothing happening: Moments of absence as perceptual events",
      "abstract": "Event representations canonically arise when something is doing something, such as a ball bouncing or a clock chiming. But does perception represent eventhood even when nothing is happening, as in a break in the rain or a moment of silence? Here, by leveraging the fact that event representations distort experienced duration, we demonstrate that perception constructs positive and differentiated representations of absence. Experiment 1 exploited the recent discovery that a single continuous event is perceived as longer than two discrete events having the same objective duration (the “one-is-more illusion”; Yousif & Scholl, 2019). Instead of events with actual objects, our observers viewed periods of absence, during which an eye-catching object (e.g., a drifting UFO) briefly vanished, before reappearing. Remarkably, observers judged a single continuous absence as longer than two discrete absences separated by a brief reappearance — demonstrating that this illusion occurs with absences as well as presences. Experiment 2 generalized this finding to audition. Observers were immersed in ambient noise (e.g., a busy restaurant) and occasionally heard periods of silence. Again, one continuous silence was heard as longer than two equivalent silences. Finally, we asked: Do experiences of absence have a common, purely negative character, or can they be positively represented as *different* from one another? Experiment 3 explored this question by adapting the “oddball illusion”, where a stimulus that breaks a sequence (e.g., a looming circle after several non-looming circles) is seen as longer (Tse et al., 2004). In our study, observers viewed several “standard absences”, wherein one of two circles disappeared for a fixed duration, followed by an “oddball absence”, wherein the other circle disappeared for a variable duration. Observers judged oddball absences as longer than standards, suggesting that oddball absences were perceived differently from standard absences. Thus, moments of absence elicit differentiated, perceptual event representations.",

      "abstract": "I raise the question of responsibility and danger because of the likelihood that being responsible inevitably includes 'something' unresponsible, as well as a concentric movement of will that excludes what is unresponsible and gives increasing power to the forces of will and subjectivity. The subject is strengthened in responsible action. The movement of subjectivity is towards itself as it acts with regard to something other to itself, to which it gives itself. It draws itself towards itself as it draws toward the other. In responsibly choosing to belong to something-be that something a god, another person, a community, or an ideal-the individual is given intensity, a strengthened sense of the future and past, and above all a sense of worldly coherence and meaning. These are good things, and they seem to be excellent things if that to which we are responsible has unqualified worth. Such values are not denied when responsibility is put in question. Further, the question of responsibility's danger does not ask about that to which we are responsible. It asks about the value of responsibility. If we protect responsibility by giving it unquestioned or hardly questioned value, the subject too will continue to enjoy a virtually unqualified value in our thought and action, and we will ignore or denigrate an absence of responsibility that is borne by responsibility. But when responsibility occurs as a question in our thinking, its own movement will be checked in our thought. Perhaps something unresponsible will take place, and perhaps the unresponsible will expose a danger in responsibility, namely that it excludes something vital for the way of being that is to",

      "abstract": "Kleding vormt de interface tussen het menselijk lichaam en de leefomgeving. Kleding geeft mensen de mogelijkheid om hun identiteit en culturele achtergrond uit te drukken. Daarnaast heeft kleding vaak een beschermende rol, vooral tegen extreme weersomstandigheden zoals hoge en lage temperatuur, neerslag, wind, zonnestraling, maar ook tegen vuil, gifgas, kogels (zogenaamde ballistische bescherming), stoten, extreme druk, explosies e.d. Soms is kleding juist nodig om de omgeving af te schermen tegen vuil dat de mens produceert, zoals bij de productie van computerelektronica. Onder kleding wordt in deze verhandeling al het materiaal verstaan dat het menselijk lichaam omhult. Globaal betreft het voor het hoofd een hoofddeksel, voor de handen handschoenen of wanten, voor de voeten sokken en schoenen. Voor het boven- en onderlijf is meer keuze beschikbaar zoals een hemd, bh, Tshirt, polo, overhemd, trui, jas, onderbroek, broek en rok. Er zijn ook kledingstukken die boven- en onderlijf omspannen zoals een jurk, overall en lange jas. Bovendien is er een grote variatie binnen een categorie kledingstukken; hierbij kan onderscheid gemaakt worden in vorm, materiaal en kleur. In het lectoraat is gekozen voor drie speerpunten van onderzoek voor kleding/mode. Deze speerpunten zijn tot stand gekomen op basis van aanwezige expertise in de kenniskring van het lectoraat, analyse van kennislacunes en een inschatting van potentieel relevante maatschappelijke ontwikkelingen.",

      "title": "Statistical 3D and 4D Shape Analysis: Theory and Applications in the Era of Generative AI",
      "abstract": "The need for 3D and 4D (i.e., 3D + time) shape analysis arises in many branches of science ranging from anatomy, bioinformatics, medicine, and biology to computer graphics, multimedia, and virtual and augmented reality. In fact, shape is an essential property of natural and man-made 3D objects. It deforms over time as a result of many internal and external factors. For instance, anatomical organs such as bones, kidneys, and subcortical structures in the brain deform due to natural growth or disease progression; human faces deform as a consequence of talking, executing facial expressions, and aging. Similarly, human body actions and motions such as walking, jumping, and grasping are the result of the deformation, over time, of the human body shape. The ability to understand and model (1) the typical shape and deformation patterns of a class of 3D objects, and (2) the variability of these shapes and deformations within and across object classes has many applications. For example, in medical diagnosis and biological growth modeling, one is interested in measuring the intensity of pain from facial deformations, and in distinguishing between normal growth and disease progression using the shape of the body and its deformation over time. In computer vision and graphics, the ability to statistically model such spatiotemporal variability can be used to summarize collections of 3D objects and their animation, and simulate animations and motions. Similar to 3D morphable models, these tools can also be used in a generative model for synthesizing large corpora of labeled longitudinal 3D shape data, e.g., 4D faces, virtual humans, and various objects. In this talk, I will share the research undertaken by my group and collaborators in the area of statistical analysis and modelling of static (i.e., 3D) and dynamic (i.e., 4D) shapes. I will first highlight the importance of this topic for various applications ranging from biology and medicine to computer graphics and virtual/augmented reality. I will then structure my talk into three parts. The first one focuses on 3D shapes that bend, stretch, and change in topology. I will introduce our mathematical framework, termed Square Normal Fields (SRNF) [6, 10-12, 15], which provides (1) an efficient representation of 3D shapes, (2) an elastic metric for quantifying shape differences between objects, (3) mechanisms for computing correspondences and geodesics between such shapes, and (4) methods for characterizing populations of 3D shapes using generative models. I will consider both shapes that bend and stretch [6, 10-12, 15] but also those that change their structure and topology [18-22]. The second part of the talk will focus on 4D shapes, i.e., 3D shapes that move and deform as the result of normal growth or disease progression [9, 14]. I will summarize the latest solutions we developed for the statistical analysis of the spatio-temporal variability in such 4D shape data and highlight their applications in various fields. The third part of this talk will focus on the role statistical 3D and 4D shape models played and have to play in the era of Deep Learning and Generative AI. I will particularly highlight their importance and the role they played in advancing the field of 3D and 4D reconstruction and generation from images, videos, and text [1-5, 7, 8, 13, 16, 17]. I will conclude the talk by sharing insights into potential future developments in and applications of statistical 3D and 4D shape models.",

This may be the case with MCS and Time-Dependent Sensitization (TDS), a phenomenon we discovered in rats in the late 1970s and later named. TDS refers to the ability of mild stressors--whether pharmacological or environmental--to induce physiological and behavioral effects which then progress, i.e., get stronger, entirely as a function of the passage of time since stressor presentation. This strengthening is revealed when the organism is later exposed to either the original or another stressor. The characteristics of TDS bear a remarkable resemblance to the features of MCS and that similarity is the subject of this manuscript.",

      "abstract": "This article is a state of the art about Grandstands. The Grandstands are slender structures designed to accommodate a large number of people, which are specially under the actions of wind and the human-structure interaction. Over the years, it has been discuss of this topic, although still the number of publications still remain low. The human-structure interaction is a complex issue, where the loads may have different behaviours, depending many factors, including: type of audience (active or passive), public behaviour (jumping, walking, running, clapping, vandal loads), type of event (sports, concerts, meeting), position and posture of the individual, even influences the type of seat (with or without back, stiffness). However, the structure will behave differently when empty or fully occupied. Another load to consider is the wind, especially when the structure has a roof, screens, large-scale advertising, etc. These two types of loads can interact together, which implies an increase in the normal number of load combinations to consider. There are biomechanical models of human behaviour, used for design these types of structures. In addition, there are mathematical models to simulate the behaviour of the Grandstands by numerical methods. In recent years, all these models are throwing good results, against laboratory tests performed. It has also been monitored real Grandstands. This paper compiles all existing information on this topic.",

      "abstract": "Ernest Becker highlights the experience-limiting function of culture. Without such restriction, life, in all of its mystery and terror, is just too much for the self-conscious animal to bear. Culture has developed as a result of a need to minimize the force of life and anxiety associated with the inevitability of death. Successfully socialized individuals can envelop themselves in a death-denying and life-directing and limiting symbolic order. The set of symptoms we think of as schizophrenia are, on the one hand, associated with an inability to link up with the experience-managing, death-anxiety buffering, cultural order, and on the other, with the tendency to remain split off from the body. Individuals with the diagnosis of schizophrenia often do not rely on repression to manage their experience, but instead on the insufficient defense of dissociation. The paradoxical result of the dissociative defense is an overwhelming and terrifying experience. Successful psychotherapy involves helping the fearful, traumatized and interpersonally distant patient tolerate and even welcome body and affect. The attachment with the psychotherapist unblocks affect through an undoing of dissociative processes and a linking of the patient with the consensual, repression-based, symbolic order.",

Fear of the unfamiliar, for example, differs from conditioned fear and perhaps from those forms due to innate releasers of fear (Kagan and Schulkin, 1995). Hebb (1946) and others pointed this out some 50 years ago, noting that there is more than one sense of fear, a fact that has biological significance. Hebb emphasized fear of the unfamiliar and fear associated with innate perceptual sensibility. Both humans and chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), for instance, are afraid of headless animals. This chapter will explain how humoral signals – specifically glucocorticoids and corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) – help to sustain some fear-like states.",

      "abstract": "In life, it often happens that humans take different actions on different occasions to save man or his wealth. These actions can be taken when there is a need to protect the integrity of man and his wealth, both individual and social wealth. Man performs these actions morally and without any institutional obligation. Man does the action without consent in order to save one's life or another's wealth. There is a need for such an action, because everyone sometimes in certain cases needs mutual help. With these behaviors of people, it is seen that they do not take these actions out of legal obligation, but act and should act with the consciousness and conscience of the civilized man. People who do this are driven by the need for cooperation, humanity, existence at the expense of the other, namely society. A person performs this action by perpetrating the work of another without consent for any other person. Hence, they undertake some factual and legal action for the other, sacrificing something that can be the property value and their bodily integrity. Sometimes this action must be taken because there are actions that cannot be postponed, therefore someone should take an action in such situations even when uninvited. Consequently, the subject matter analyzed in this paper is the act of perpetration of the work of another without consent as a source of the right of obligations in the Republic of Kosovo.&#x0D; &#x0D; Received: 6 October 2021 / Accepted: 1 November 2021 / Published: 5 November 2021",

      "abstract": "myth \"as a kind of story or rudimentary narrative sequence, normally traditional and anonymous, through which a given culture ratifies its social customs or accounts for the origins of human and natural phenomena, usually in supernatural or boldly imaginative terms.The term myth has a wide range of meanings, which can be divided roughly into 'rationalist' and 'romantic' versions: In the first, a 'myth' is a false or unreliable story or belief (adjective: mythical), while in the second, 'myth' is a superior intuitive mode of cosmic understanding (adjective: mythic).In most literary contexts, the second kind of usage prevails, and , myths are regarded as fictional stories containing deeper truths, expressing collective attitudes to fundamental matters of life, death, divinity, and existence.(Baldick 235) Myths are the source of one's culture, tradition, rituals, celebrations, beliefs and practices.All information regarding a particular group of people i s revealed through myths.The information said in myths cannot be proved; yet it does not give room for suspicion because of the interest that it kindles on reading.Myths find its place even in contemporary writings as it fascinates the readers of all times and ages.As the mythological characters are not found in real life it fascinates the readers.The message which is conveyed through the myths will be very effective.In short, it will be apt to quote Coleridge; \"willing suspension of disbelief\".We will not use our rational thinking to question it.Myths often help the readers to know the origin of some event.It teaches some virtues, it gives confidence and hope to people who are in grief.The focus of this paper is to bring out the myths used in Dattani's select plays and also to show the beliefs and practises of the people found in the select plays of Mahesh Dattani.",

      "abstract": "In the cathegory of clothing which can be worn by the vegan public -that is, by those who abstain as much as possible from consuming products and services of animal origin for ethical and ideological reasons -there are various synthetic alternatives to materials of animal origin which fulfill the practical, aesthetic and/or symbolic functions.From burlesque copies to reliable imitations, like those of leather, feathers, fur, bones and animal secretionswith different degrees of realism, they haveat first, up close, or from a distance and/or to the eyes of laypeople, aesthetic and sensorial aspects that make it difficult to distinguish from genuine materials of animal origin.This study is a qualitative, exploratory, phenomenological investigation about the problematic of some of the most notable possible conceptual and practical implications, from the practical, aesthetic, philosophical, sociological and ethical viewpoints, of the idea of imitation, emulation and copying of materials of animal origin or materials which make a reference or allusion to, or which evoke exterior aspects of, animals' bodies in vegans' clothing.To this end, based on searches for vegan users' comments in online social media, questionnaires and in-depth interviews with users, vegan movement activists and theoretical specialists (like ethics philosophers and designers specializing in ethical fashion), the aim of this study, based on conclusions obtained through analysis of these different points of view, is to illuminate the fields of fashion design, veganism and consequently, animal rights.Results of this investigation suggest, for instance, that for some users, making use of alternatives considered vegan would be an acceptable practice because they would replace functional, aesthetic and even affective attributes of clothing and accessories that such users otherwise associate with pain, while for other users this option would be objectionable.According to some respondents, due to the reasonably high level of visual similarity of various types of such simulacra, merely employing these animal byproducts would be considered less acceptable, given their insufficiently discernible distinction from animal-body materials.In such instances, they felt this verisimilitude could indirectly foster the idea that the use of such animalorigin material would be acceptable, therefore contributing to promoting the consumption of clothing of a type which is against the principles they adopt.",

      "abstract": "I would like to add to Julio Arboleda- Florez's excellent discussion of the problem of psychiatric participation in interrogations. There is considerable international support for asking psychiatrists and other physicians not only to decline to participate in torture and related practices, but also to speak out vigorously against its use by governments.\r\n\r\nWhile medical ethics surely disapproves such practices, they are also widely condemned in other quarters. For example, in its aspirational of Principles for the Protection of All Persons under Any Form of Detention or Imprisonment, the United Nations General Assembly, after asserting that no person under any form of detention or imprisonment shall be subject to torture or to cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment, adds in a note: The term 'cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment' should be interpreted so as to extend the widest possible protection against abuses, whether physical or mental, including the holding of a detained or imprisoned person in conditions which deprive him, temporarily or permanently, of the use of any of his natural senses, such as sight or hearing, or of his awareness of place and the passing of time (1).\r\n\r\nIn addition, the Body of Principles requires that no detained person while being interrogated shall be subject to violence, threats or methods of interrogation which impair his capacity of decision or his judgement (1).\r\n\r\nPsychiatrists are in a unique position to understand and communicate the importance of these principles and should denounce torture strongly in every possible venue. As Sagan and Jonsen (2) observed, because the medical skills used for healing can be maliciously perverted with devastating effects on the spirit and the body, it is incumbent upon the medical profession and upon all of its practitioners to protest in effective ways against torture as an instrument of political control. This is even more urgently true today than when it was written thirty years ago.",

      "abstract": "Bodily expressions of emotion are powerful signals regulating communicative exchanges. For better or worse, we spend our life surrounded by other people. Nothing is less surprising than to assume that we are trained and over-trained to read their body language. When we see someone running with the hands protecting his face we perceive at once the fear and the action of running for cover. We rarely hesitate to assign meaning to such behaviors, and we do not wait to recognize fight behavior till we are close by enough to see the person's facial expression. Here we report on new findings concerning the role of attention and of visual awareness on the perception and neurofunctional basis of our ability to recognize bodily expressions. Our experiments show that briefly seen, but also consciously unseen bodily stimuli may induce an emotional state and trigger adaptive actions in the observer. Exposure to unseen emotional stimuli triggers activity in the cortical and subcortical visual system and is associated with somatic changes typical of emotions. Specifically, unattended but also non-consciously perceived emotional body expressions elicit spontaneous facial expressions and psychophysiological changes that reflect the affective valence and arousal components of the stimuli. Similar results are also obtained in neurologically intact subjects in whom blindsight-like effects are induced by visual masking. Moreover, participants facial reactions are faster and autonomic arousal is higher for unseen than for seen stimuli. We will discuss the implications of these findings for current debates in human emotion theories.",

      "title": "The common good, terminal illness, and euthanasia.",
      "abstract": "In one sense, dying is the most personal and private of all events. Each of us comes to the end of unique life and dies his or her own death. Along with birth, death sets the natural boundaries of particular life's trajectory. But unlike birth, the consciousness of death can define person's plan of life. In existential terms, the consciousness of an inevitable person death provokes an anxiety that is radically individuating. The fact of my death makes this my life.(1) Yet no aspect of human experiences is wholly personal and private. Like birth, our knowledge of death comes from others. The way we die--when, under what circumstance, and from what cause or reason--is shaped in profound ways by relationships with others and by large social and institutional forces. The symbolic significance attached to death is derived from religious and cultural realities that precede and survive individuals. And it is precisely because death is such as intensely personal and private event, so defining of the individual, that the social arrangements that attend death are so important. What could be more important for society than events that shape individuals? The character of dying and how th dying are cared for has changed in profound ways in the last several decades.(2) In all of our prior history, death for those who reached adulthood came generally in what is now mildlife. It came swiftly, a thief in the night. It came without significant resistance from medicine; little could be done to ward off impending death. Now death is generally an event of old age. It typically follows long pattern of chronic illness and decline. It comes only after exhaustive medical interventions, some of which plainly increase the length and intensity of suffering and all of which increase costs to the health care system. This change in dying, and especially its impact on the deaths of individuals, has produced social consensus over the last two generations on patient's or proxy's right to refuse life-sustaining medical measures, hospice movement designed to improve the quality of life in dying, and growing debate over legalization of doctor-assisted suicide and active euthanasia. What are the social dimensions of these developments, especially the third, since it stands before us as social choice? Aside from real and projected impacts on individuals, how does our treatment of the terminally ill effect society as whole? How might changes in social arrangements surrounding dying affect the common good? These issues are taken up here under three headings. First, some general observations are offered about the notion of the common good. Second, some changes are proposed designed to better serve the common good in the way dying patients are cared for. Finally, some reasons are developed to show why legalization of doctor-assisted suicide and active euthanasia cannot serve the common good. The Common Good Traditionally, the common good has been the key term of articulating and assessing the implications for society as whole of changes in social practice or public policies.(3) But the notion of the common good is problematic in our society. The idea comes to us from ancient Greco-Roman civilizations and from medieval Europe. Thus, the birth and development of the notion of the common good is derived from civilizations far more homogeneous than contemporary American. The diversity in our society--of races, ethnic groups, religions, languages, culture, and lifestyle--makes it more difficult for us to understand and assent to the idea that there is some good or goods that are of value to us as members of society irrespective of our many differences. American politics, especially in the twentieth century, work against generation of practical consensus on the common good. The checks and balances built into our Constitution hobble attempts to develop unitary policy visions. …",

They originate in the relational learning processes in which the individual participates, and they presuppose the ability to thematize oneself in relation to others, especially by means of language. Among the basic constituents of all these features is the insight into one's own limitations: to be wise and humble presupposes that one knows what one cannot do or be, whereas grace is the manifestation of that which moves oneself beyond what one thought it was possible to do or be, due to unforeseen and unanticipated elements in the reality in which one takes part. Hence, wisdom, humility, and grace must all be seen as conditions for (pre-)human agency, building on psychological and other evolved capacities. Thus, these features are also important elements when humans relate to the world in terms of orientation, transformation, and reflection.",

      "abstract": "Like most other literary-critical terms, character, figure or person are polysemic and ambiguous. For the purpose of this essay, character or person in narrative will be understood as designating a human or human-like individual, existing in some possible world, and capable of fulfilling the argument position in the propositional form DO(X) - that is, a Narrative Agent (=NA), to whom inner states, mental properties (traits, features) or complexes of such properties (personality models) can be ascribed on the basis of textual data. This particular explication of the term has the advantage of capturing the reader's intuitive understanding of the term, while at the same time enabling a disciplined and explicit study of this phenomenon within narratology. The ascription of individual mental traits to an NA may be called and the ascription of complexes of traits character-building or portraiture. The two activities are logically and substantively different. The first is the primary one and is based on inference drawn from individual acts of the NA, details of his looks and setting, etc. (see below). Character-building, on the other hand, comes later and involves several additional operations. These include the accumulation of a number of traits from several successive acts of the NA, setting, or formal patterns; a generalization concerning their extent in terms of narrative time; the classification or categorization of these traits; their interrelation in terms of a network or hierarchy of traits; a confrontation of traits belonging to successive acts in order to infer second order traits such as inconsistent; and finally, an attempt to interrelate the traits or trait-clusters into a unified stable constellation (configuration, pattern, Gestalt, personality model) of some duration in terms of narrative time. Character-building consists of a succession of individual operations of characterization, together with second order activities of continual patterning and repatterning of the traits obtained in the first order operations, until a fairly coherent",

Relative foreignness, related to a specific order, is opposed to ­radical foreignness that disturbs and overrides all order. (2) The host is like a passerby (Simmel). He questions the property of the owner, as the latter is no longer the master in his own house (Freud). The host foreshadows the radical otherness of the Other (Levinas). (3) The enemy looks like the ­rival on the opposite bank who is killed, and the opponent we fight against transforms into something that we exploit or even destroy like a wild beast (Locke). The enemy is the opponent without refuge. One can distinguish in detail between ethnocentric, cosmocentric, and legal hostility, directed against the enemies of mankind, as well as between cold hostility armed with technical devices and warm hostility fueled by hatred without pretenses. In short, hostility arises due to repressed Otherness and refusing hospitality.",

      "title": "Open issues in the cognitive science of conditionals",
      "abstract": "The conditional, if...then, is probably the most important term in natural language and forms the core of systems of logic and mental representation. It occurs in all human languages and allows people to express their knowledge of the causal or law-like structure of the world and of others' behaviour, e.g., if you turn the key the car starts, if John walks the dog he stops for a pint of beer; to make promises, e.g., if you cook tonight, I'll wash up all week; to regulate behaviour, e.g., if you are drinking beer, you must be over 18 years of age; to suggest what would have happened had things been different, e.g., if the match had been dry it would have lit, among many other possible uses. The way in which the conditional is modelled also determines the core of most logical systems. Unsurprisingly, it is also the most researched expression in the psychology of human reasoning.\r\n\r\nCognition and Conditionals is the first volume for over 20 years (On Conditionals, 1986, CUP) that brings together recent developments in the cognitive science and psychology of conditional reasoning. Over the last 10 to 15 years, research on conditionals has come to dominate the psychology of reasoning providing a rich seam of results that have created new theoretical possibilities. This book shows how these developments have led researchers to view people's conditional reasoning behaviour more as succesful probabilistic reasoning rather than as errorful logical reasoning. It shows how the multifarious, and apparently competing, theoretical positions developed over the last 50 years in this area - mental logics, mental models, heuristic approaches, dual process theory, and probabilistic approaches-have responded to these insights. Its organisation reflects the view that an integrative approach is emerging that may need to exploit aspects of all these theoretical positions to explain the rich and complex phenomenon of reasoning with conditionals. It includes an introductory chapter relating the development of the psychology of reasoning to developments in the logic and semantics of the conditional. It also includes chapters by many of the leading figures in this field.\r\n\r\nCognition and Conditionals will be a valuable resource for cognitive scientists, psychologists and philosophers interested how people actually reason with conditionals.",

      "title": "[The ego--defense mechanisms and coping].",
      "abstract": "If the aims of defense and coping are considered, it can be concluded that essentially the different kinds of defense should serve to cope with reality. They intend either to inhibit the pressure of the unconscious drives and emotions or to bring them in tracks which are better to overlook. Or they tend unconsciously to reduce the demands of the surroundings and/or to make it possible to use former patterns of coping, as e.g. in regression and transference, or to reduce the cognitive and emotional reception of it, as in autism. Whereas those defense mechanisms, which preponderantly serve to deal with the drives and emotions, may lead to a better coping with the given situation, those defense mechanisms, however, which mostly serve to a reduction of the perception of the environment or to a decrease of expectations of the surroundings, are not increasing the coping capacities with a really given situation. But also when defense is rigid or excessive, which can, if a certain genetic predisposition is given, also be visible in autoimmune-processes, the coping with reality is more difficult. Thereby it is, however, to consider that a rigid defense diminishes the danger of ego-fragmentation and, especially when a psychotherapy is done, leads with the time on this way to a better coping with the outside reality and the inner possibilities. In serious terminal diseases a defense, which permits an active life, seems to have a better prognosis than a resignated acceptation of the illness, which originates in the activity of the superego. Heavy pain-syndromes in diseases which are not life-menacing can apparently be dealt with the better the more the concerned people succeed to turn the anxiety which is little related to objects in object-related fear. With that potencies of the ego are free which otherwise would have to be invested in the defense of anxieties.",

Idealised childhood is intended as a symbol of simplicity and spontaneity, but at the same time is one of\r\nlack of development (childhood years) and vulnerability (childhood illnesses), so that it can mean childishness, immaturity or\r\nlack of seriousness. Children are supposed to be above all spontaneous, calm, collected, with no concealed plan or hidden\r\nthoughts; but children also live through war, can become refugees or go hungry.

The idea of childhood is a constant\r\nin evangelical teachings, as in these words from the Gospel according to St Matthew: »Except ye be converted, and become\r\nas little children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven.« Similarly in St Luke; »Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom\r\nof God as a little child shall in no wise enter therein.« In Christian tradition angels are often shown as children, which\r\nis a sign of innocence and purity.

      "abstract": "Robots are solving challenging tasks that we want them to be able to perform (liveness), but we also do not want them to endanger their surroundings (safety). Formal methods provide ways of proving such correctness properties, but have the habit of only saying “yes” when the answer is “yes” (soundness). More often than not, formal methods say “no”: They find out that the system is neither safe nor live, because there are “unexpected” circumstances in which the robot just cannot do what we expect it to. Inspecting those unexpected circumstances is informative, and identifies constraints on reasonable behavior of the environment. This ultimately leads from safety to the question of who is guilty depending on whose action caused the safety violation. It also leads from liveness to the question of what behavior of the environment is nice enough so that the robot can finish its task. I. FORMAL METHODS FOR ROBOTICS Robots often interact with a dynamically changing environment and in close proximity to humans or critical infrastructure. Thus, safety is key. But we also want a robot to complete some useful task or achieve a particular goal (liveness). Formal verification methods help to exhaustively analyze a robot and its control algorithms for correctness. This paper is based on our experience with formal verification of safety and liveness properties of autonomous robotic ground vehicles [2]. The overall challenge arises, because robots not only execute discrete (control) algorithms, but they also interact with the real world through sensors and actuators. For verification purposes, thus, we need to take the discrete control algorithms and the continuous physical behavior of both our own robot and the environment into account. Hybrid systems are a suitable mathematical model to describe systems with interacting discrete and continuous behavior. We focus on theorem proving for hybrid systems as verification method, and use differential dynamic logic [4] implemented in the KeYmaera prover [5] and the modeling tool Sphinx [3] to illustrate the challenges that arise from analyzing safety and",

      "title": "Seating System Categories and Clinical Indicators",
      "abstract": "Seating systems include the seat cushion, back support, head, arm, lower leg, and foot support, as well as other positioning components, provided on a wheelchair. The seat cushion and back support are the primary support surfaces that a client requires for postural support to maintain stability, pressure management to prevent pressure injuries, and the functional use will vary with each person. These are made from various types of foam, fluid, gel, thermoplastic elastomers, or air flotation materials and may be \"off-the-shelf\" in a variety of sizes or custom made to the individual. Categories and clinical applications of seat cushions will be reviewed in terms of the type of materials used to make the cushions, the shape of the cushions, and the pros and cons of the various materials in relation to someone using the cushion. The type of seating system indicated for hands-free sitters, hands-dependent sitters or prop sitters is based on the amount of external support required to maintain upright postural alignment and functional abilities to perform daily tasks. The shapes of the supports are described as planar, generically contoured, or custom contoured/molded. Detailed descriptions including properties, indications, advantages, disadvantages, and benefits and precautions of the various shapes and types of seat cushions and back supports are reviewed. The supports that are secondary to the primary back and seat supports are specific to the body part they are supporting. These include head, upper extremity, lower extremity, foot supports, and additional pelvis, trunk supports. Categories and functional purpose of these secondary components are described in this chapter.",

Trauma is a universal experience, manifests in many forms, and is defined as something that happens to an individual or a group; it is further explained as isolated, or cumulative and persistent. There are physiological, physical, psychological, cognitive, emotional, and social implications to traumatic experiences that are well documented throughout clinical literature. Trauma is considered something that happens to a person, and traditionally is understood on a continuum of small \"t\" through large \"T\" to define events that challenge one's ability to optimally function. For example, an ongoing fight with a spouse might be considered a small \"t,\" and a natural disaster, a large \"T.\" Different traumatic experiences may evoke a variety of responses but seem to have a similar effect on the biological and physiological systems that manage their impact.",

The process of survival results in a radical change of values, intensified concern with the body (the survival value of hypochondriasis and narcissism), the establishment of absolute trust in a few others or the equivalent for internalized objects if alone. Communication is paramount. This survivor behavior is distorted in the clinical setting resulting in noncompliance, manipulation of power figures (clinical staff), and distorted understanding, both ways, of communication. Suggestions are offered on the developmental history of the patient as a survivor and how survivor behavior can be incorporated into therapeutic regimes. In line with the concept of conservation-withdrawal, the action-engagement of survivor behavior is hypothesised as being biologically based.",

      "abstract": "Living in two-way, dialogical relations with our surroundings, rather than in monological, one-way causal relations with them, means that we can no longer treat ourselves as inquiring simply into a world of objective ‘things’ already existing in the world around us. We need to see ourselves instead as always acting ‘from within’ a still-in-process world of flowing streams of intermingling activities affecting us as much, if not more, than we can affect them. In such a world as this, instead of discovering pre-existing things in our inquiries, we continually bring such ‘things’ into existence. So, although we may talk of having discovering certain nameable ‘things’ in our inquiries, the fact is, we can only see such ‘things’ as having been at work in people’s activities after they have performed them. This, I want to argue, is also the case with all our diagnostic categories of mental distress – thus to see the ‘things’ they name as the causes of a person’s distress is to commit an ex post facto fact fallacy. Something else altogether ‘moves’ people in the performance of their actions than the nameable ‘things’ we currently claim to have discovered in our inquiries.",

      "title": "Misanthropy without Humanity",
      "abstract": "Representations of misanthropy have frequently attributed it to one or both of two motivations. The misanthrope is often depicted as being ruled by passion, or as being guided by unbending principle. The videogame Plague Inc., which casts players as a pathogen with the objective of annihilating the human species, offers an alternative misanthropy. Inviting us to invest in the values of a virus, bacterium, or parasite, without emotional investment or underpinning rationale, it entertains the possibility of a misanthropy without humanity. Misanthropy is the dislike or hatred of humanity as a whole. The term derives from the Greek μῖσος (hatred) and ἄνθρωπος (human). Representations of misanthropy, in literature and elsewhere, have frequently attributed it to one or both of two motivations. On the one hand, misanthropes are often depicted as being ruled by passion, their intense, emotional abhorrence of humanity the result of personal affronts or misfortunes. Thus, the protagonist of Shakespeare’s Timon of Athens (c.1605), overcome with resentment and loathing for the society that has abused his generosity and good will, retreats into the wilderness, wishing only ill on his fellows; in the closing lines of the play, his epitaph records the hope that “a plague consume you, wicked caitiffs left!” (V.4.71). On the other hand, the misanthropist will be guided by unbending principle, their reasoned disdain deriving from a high-minded moral code. In Moliere’s The Misanthrope (1666), Alceste’s uncompromising insistence on honesty and plain-speaking, and his refusal to indulge the dissembling fops and fools around him, similarly lead to self-imposed exile: “Finding on every hand base flattery, / Injustice, fraud, self-interest, treachery. ... / Ah, it’s too much; mankind has grown so base, / I mean to break with the whole human race” (I.1). Timon is a tragic hero, Alceste comic, but they share the character flaw of excess: where Timon is over generous, Alceste is too honest. Both are represented as extreme, even pathological, in their ways, and misanthropy is cast as a misguided consequence or symptom of intemperate inclinations.",

      "abstract": "In this paper I would like to describe, even if in broad terms, certain ways, more or less adequate, in which it is possible to experience our own or others’ subjectivity and to acquire from it, in less unhappy cases, a more or less deep knowledge. In particular, I present an ecological model of the Self, which is capable of constituting, in the specific “sense” in which it manifests itself – the self-sense, the sense of our own embodied and embedded being – a fundamental presupposition of an eventual self-knowledge and knowledge of others. The self-sense or sense of our own living bodyness, evident, for example, in feeling good or bad in one’s own body, in the hunger or in the pain, in the attunement (or non-attunement) of the subject involved with its own environment and with other animals (human and non-human), points out, in other words, in the contextual perspective that is outlined, the minimal form that can assume self-knowledge and knowledge of others. In an indirect route, that is to say, turned towards the recognition of possible failures and pathologies of self-knowledge and knowledge of others, of “unhappy knowledge” so to speak, I uncover the role that self-sense and its eventual failure play in the possible conquest or failure of second-order self-knowledge and knowledge of others (social cognition, personal and interpersonal knowledge). Above all, I turn my attention to axiological-affective self-deceptions and to delusions and affective “blindness”, suggesting a possible alternative route, or at least an integrative route, in comparison with standard theories of self-deception and delusion, essentially characterized in a propositional sense. I show in the end the formative and transformative power of art, its expressive and material dimension and its therapeutic relevance or dis-illusory, absolutely antithetical, as such, to anaesthetizing or simply protective (of a would-be equilibrium of one’s own self) and adaptive power that certain self-deceptions can have.",

This chapter develops a conception of unity according to which a structured whole derives its unity from the way its parts interact with other parts to allow the whole and its parts to manifest their “team-work”-requiring capacities. With this conception of unity in place, interesting differences emerge between paradigmatic matter–form compounds belonging to natural (e.g., physical, chemical, or biological) kinds and composite entities belonging to social kinds, in particular artifacts. In the latter case, the interactional dependencies that connect the components of a system can be traced to mind-dependent factors that are extrinsic or external to the system in question, viz., the mental states of intentional agents who invent, design, produce, or use an artifact.",

      "title": "What Is General Semantics?: A Personal View.",
      "abstract": "Sometimes when people ask What General Semantics?, don't want to answer. My reluctance to categorize general semantics arises from the general semantics principle of non-identity. This postulates that no two things are identical in all respects. Suppose say, a Such a sentence uses a form of is called the is-of-identity. It violates the non-identity principle. In effect, I've said, individual noun (Pat) equals class noun (politician), X identical to Y, identical to This seems harmless, you say. Not so! Tunnel Vision I've confused the specific with the general, confused things with words, and imposed linguistic limitations that do not reflect the rich diversity of a living human who has personality, hopes, habits, a certain physique, etc. I've reduced Pat to a label, politician. My self-imposed tunnel vision will prejudge and damage my relationship with Pat. By treating this individual as identical to a class, category, or group, can't help but think and act as if all politicians are alike. If a particular politician has disappointed me, will probably react badly to all. Labels That Limit Suppose we have a task to do, and we only have a We can say, I can't do it, only have a screwdriver. In practice, we can use a screwdriver to drive screws, to hammer, chisel, lever, wedge, garden, open cans, crack ice, stir liquids, etc. Similarly, we can use the numerous tools of general semantics to achieve diverse goals. Hence my reluctance to limit general semantics with is-of-identity labeling. Yet to describe, we must focus, select, abstract. Incidentally, a key formulation of the system of general semantics says that we process information at biological and verbal levels by abstracting, by leaving things out. We've chosen not to describe the system by means of the is-of-identity, by what it is. We can describe something by what it does. Success and Survival think of general semantics as a system for making evaluations vital to success and survival. By evaluating, mean our processing of perceptions and inferences as influenced by existing conscious and unconscious assumptions. Evaluations, not necessarily conscious ones, involve our thoughts, feelings, judgments, decisions, etc. Generally we do something as a result. Evaluating leads to appropriate or inappropriate action. We might describe general semantics as an integrated system for improving our thinking, evaluating, communicating, etc. Of course, in doing so we've only just begun. Alfred Korzybski formulated general semantics in the first half of this century in his major work, Science and Sanity, and he continued to write and lecture about general semantics until his death in 1950. Numerous educators, writers, and editors have continued to develop and disseminate his work, including Irving J. Lee, Wendell Johnson, Harry Weinberg, Francis Chisholm, Kenneth Johnson, S. I. Hayakawa, Elwood Murray, Russell Joyner, Robert Pula, Anatol Rapoport, Mary Morain, D. David Bourland, Jr., Susan Presby Kodish, Bruce I. Kodish, Earl Hautala, Jeremy Klein, and Gregory Sawin. Beyond Aristotle Korzybski called general semantics a non-Aristotelian system because its many-valued logic goes beyond the two-valued, either-or logic attributed to Aristotle. Two-valued Aristotelian logic says either X Y, or X not Y; it offers no middle choices, and it often leads to either-or evaluating. Non-Aristotelian logic employs multiple values, a range of choices, more in keeping with the diversity of lived experience. It adheres to the principle of non-identity by allowing degrees of difference or similarity. Separation of Word and Thing Korzybski recognized that language and lived experience consist of two distinctly separate realms. He said The word not the thing, and Whatever you might say the object 'is,' well, it not. …",

This is obvious from our attitudes towards other human beings. We may be kind and understanding and be recognizing likenesses with ourselves or what we cherish, or we may be hostile and without an ability to recognize any likenesses with ourselves.  As such our attitudes are expressions of emotional dispositions for experiencing things in a specific value-laden way, and values come into existence from the awareness of our attitudes to various things and reflections on their goodness and badness, rightness or wrongness - i.e. whether our attitudes reflect our right values. Values therefore seem to be pondered  attitudes, but his is by far normally the case. Most often values are traditionally accepted ways of viewing what is good and bad and right and wrong to do on this background of values and the actions therefore are not necessarily reflected and in accordance with what might be the right or true values. An examination of the possibly right values involves a deep reflection on human life and the nature of values and that includes all the aspects of human life - i.e. our relationship to nature:  to surrounding nature and to ourselves. We might discover the problematic relationship of human beings to nature on the background of destruction and perhaps hence exploitation and climate-change, but we might also start the other way round and ask which values - and that means which human and cultural conditions made it possible to develop values and attitudes that have over-exploitive and destructive consequences for nature - and ourselves.",

      "title": "A view of pain based on sensations, meanings, and emotions",
      "abstract": "Views about what constitute the fundamental dimensions and functions of pain are remarkably different. Until the late 1960s pain was mainly seen as a specific neuronal system that functioned like other sensory systems: pain sensation intensity and duration were considered to be determined only by the intensity and duration of the peripheral stimulus, much like other exteroceptive systems directed toward the external environment. Sensory qualities of pain are unique and distinct from other body sensations. For example, unlike sensations of other modalities, pain often spreads in area as it becomes more intense, even when the stimulus itself is not spreading. Pain sometimes has an exteroceptive function, extracting information about events in the environment in order to execute behaviors that protect the organism from external threats. When the skin of mammals comes into contact with external objects that can cause tissue damage, specialized nociceptors are activated, ultimately leading to the initiation of escape and avoidance behaviors providing for self-protection.",

      "abstract": "The aim of this study was to describe how body language of humans affects the domestic dog (Canis familiaris) and how it can be implanted in the stressed situation that occur at an animal hospital. The subject is brought to notice because the author has experienced that dogs can get more stressed when a stressed and nervous owner is attending. Humans affect each other through posture, facial expression, voice and movement, and are often driven by their emotions, which can differentiate the verbal communication from the non-verbal communication. This occurs both consciously and unconsciously. Every human uses body language but not everyone knows how it is used or how to understand it. All humans have a unique way of talking, walking, standing, sitting and lying down. Everyone has his/her own rhythm and this makes it possible to recognize one another from a far distance. The eyes are also important when getting to know a person. They can often tell you about those feelings that a person is trying to hide. The personal distance to other people depends on how well you know the person, but also of the personality of the receiving person. The same can be said about physical touch from another human being. Occasionally humans misunderstand each other, verbally or non-verbally. It can occur because words or gestures have different meanings to different people. Canine communication is affected by the entire body, from motion and olfaction to vision and hearing. The communication originate from the ancestor; the wolf (Canis lupus), but since then the domestication parts of the communication within the species has changed. A dominant dog has a high standing, with head and tail high and ears erected forward. Submissive dogs crouch, trying to make themselves as small as possible. Vocalization occurs in a wide range of situations with different meanings. The olfactory sense is one of the canines’ sharpest senses and an important part of communication. The relationship between humans and canines depends grossly of the expectations the human has on the dog. This relationship has been going on for several years and it is reasonable to believe that the close contact with humans has affected the canine behavior. Canines have learned to read and understand the human body language. Studies have shown that canines look at humans for comfort and safety in situations of stress, but no earlier studies have been done to investigate how the consequence of a stressed owner affects the dog. This work concludes that further scientific studies and research need to determine whether stressed owners cause increased levels of stress among dogs, or if a calm and secure owner will bring safety to a nervous dog.",

      "title": "BLIND FAITH ACCORDING TO THE JAINAS: THE YAMA CASE",
      "abstract": "According to this pan-Indian1 maxim, there is a connexion between the last thought or thoughts of the dying and their fate in the next life. Hence, it is necessary to help the dying during this essential moment. Ritualising death is the best way to reach this aim. Ritual death is an option only for one who has made up his mind without hurry, if his certain death is near. Suicide determined by emotions, such as excessive arrogance, anger, love or fear,2 is not sanctioned by the rite, because it involves blind attachment and haste. The deceived lover, for instance, who takes the decision to hang himself,3 to throw himself from a rock or to drown himself into a river, shows only that he is a fool (bāla), and dies the death of a fool (bālamaraṇa). In this kind of “deliberate” death or suicide there is no room for ritual, because there is no, or very little, room for reflection and conscience. Yet, when disease or similar circumstances give death the appearance of inevitability, and when this is not only established by the dying, but confirmed by his guru, the choice of dying according to a ritual may seem rational (paṇḍita-maraṇa). This is the case in the Jaina ritual eradication (Skt. saṃlekhanā) of karmic particles at the end of life. In the context of this ritual, death is not awaited passively. Fasting unto death is an activity. By taking his vows again, by progressively reducing food and drink, the future dead plays an active part in his own process of dying. Moreover, his activity involves the religious group to which he belongs. He does not die alone, away from human society, but near his guru, in a place which reminds him of his belonging to a Jaina community. However, despite the fact that the ritual death is backed by the religious group or by some of its mendicant or lay members, the man who is fasting to death is in some way, alone, busy with his own thoughts. Loneliness or solitariness (ekatva) is familiar to the Jainas. They know that social and even family bounds do not ameliorate the helpless situation (aśaraṇa) of anybody dying—the",

Humans also exhibit behavior consistent with the experience of pain; they try to escape from paincausing stimuli. These things, taken together, provide evidence that humans can feel pain, hence are sentient. They also provide evidence that animals classified as vertebrates, and perhaps other groups of animals, can feel pain as well. The subjective experiences of members of different species may not be exactly the same but then neither do any two humans respond exactly the same to painful stimuli.

      "title": "The object ‘university' from a speculative realist perspective",
      "abstract": "From a speculative realist perspective, everything can be seen as an object, that cannot be paraphrased in terms of either its components or its effects (Harman, 2016:3), be it a toothbrush, a disease or a fiction character. Objects have their proper existence, and interact with other objects, independently of human's conscience or action. In parallel, one of the main criticisms against capitalism and managerialism, is that they transform everything into objects (commodification), in a manner that seems improper. The two themes of the stream cross on the matters of object, property, and style. If we take the contemporary university, and its evolution towards ever more managerialism, as our object, what would a speculative realist perspective make us understand? First that the present evolution is not fully forced from outside. The university managerial state or stage is a potentiality present inside the university-object. The evolution can be seen as a phase shift wherein inherent potential is actualized (similarly as depicted by Simondon - another author who attempts to escape from connexionism) or a new symbiosis. In both cases, emphasis is not on actors and actions. Second, this transformation would not be seen as improper, as a smearing of a before purer object, rather has the entry of a new of From this perspective, two themes are emerging: the question of what is proper to the object-university (proper in the double meaning of appropriation and of purity); the question of allure/style of this object. 1/ When Derrida (1985) comments on Francis Ponge's Le parti-pris des choses, he notes that Ponge is trying to speak for / from within / as the things/objects. Not from a human/social perspective. He wants to access the proper of the thing, which in French means both the proper/property and the cleanliness. However, at the moment when he is signing, his effort can be nothing but an appropriation (taking property over and dirtying) and his text becomes a thing. To speak for / from within the object requires the object's auto-affection. Most of the criticism against the becoming-managerial of the university, and the correlative ranking/audit emphasis, is spoken about the scholars' affects, not the university's auto-affection (Letiche and al, forthcoming). This criticism is an appropriation. This raises the question of what is the proper of the object-university? 2/ We feel that one central element of this proper lies in the university's allure. is a special and intermittent experience in which the intimate bond between a thing's unity and its plurality of notes somehow partially disintegrates (Harman, 2005:143). Allure is also a term from Francis Ponge, meaning its speeds and its specific appearance, its style. For Mace (2016), most of what we care and fight for is a question of style. A style is an appearance, a habitus, an habitat and a compound of values. A style is a mode of existence. A style is a source of distinction, of individuation, and also something that may die, and that we might stand for its existence. Those elements will be discussed with the case (the object) of the universities' occupation in Brazil against a cut in resources and a growing emphasis on performativity that may endanger the continuation of a particular style. Governmental decisions are seen as intrusion, expropriation, and becoming-improper. But here criticism are raised in the name of/made by the university ‘it-self'. Seeing the university as an object which cannot be reduced to its components (be they the professors, students, walls), nor to its social effects may provide a perspective different from a pure political game of actors defending their power/privilege/actions.",

On the one hand, to feel ashamed is to feel badly about oneself ; but on the other hand, it also seems to be a response to the way the subject is perceived by other people. So whose standards is the subject worried about falling short of, his own or those of an audience? I begin by arguing that it is the audience's standards that matter, and then present a theory of shame according to which shame is a response to the subject's perception that he is not thought of in the way he intrinsically values himself for being thought of by someone else. Then I go on to suggest some refinements to this basic view. First, the subject of shame is primarily concerned about his audience's attitudes toward him, not what they believe about him. And second, there may be one particular attitude which he values himself for inspiring. There is no very perspicuous term for this attitude, so I call it ‘proto‐respect’ – the attitude a social animal directs toward those it regards as valuable allies or bad enemies.",

We are learning that man can consciously alter his vital signs and reduce blood pressure through biofeedback training; that altered states of consciousness can produce heightened perceptual awareness, reduction of anxiety, and relief from pain; that controlled laboratory studies can demonstrate man's capacity in precognition, extrasensory perception, and psychokinesis. All these confirm the dramatic dimension of untapped human potential(4). The very fact that man patterns and repatterns his behavior in mutual and simultaneous interaction with his environment throughout the life cycle supports the thesis that man can consciously redirect an illness-producing pattern to a health-maintaining one(5).

In this sense it means the three levels of interpretation. However, the fact, how one explain a text cannot refer to any qualifications, judgements. These levels exist because of the different demands on searching for the essence. 1. The level of historical interpretation: It has an analogical connection with the material, physical approach. 2.The level of mythological interpretation: It has an analogical connection with the level of unconsciousness and partly collective unconsciousness. 3.The level of intellectual, mental interpretation: It has an analogical connection with human and archetypal contents of men.

These are measures of gross value; they are in principle quantitative; and they are subjective and idiosyncratic to the individual and the circumstances. The economic value of an item is not measured by its price. It is likely to vary with the amount of the item and should not be taken as a constant. A core conceptual distinction is between use value and nonuse value. A person’s use value for an item is the value that she places on the item from motives connected with the use of the item by someone, whether her own use or that of someone else. Nonuse value is the value she places on an item from motives not directly connected with the use of that item by anybody in any tangible way. For example, a person may value water to drink (a use value), but he may also value having water remain in its natural state (a nonuse value). Consumptive uses are use values, but nonconsumptive uses can also be use values (e.g., swimming in a lake). Other conceptual distinctions include that between wet water and paper water (water that exists on paper but is not actually accessible or usable), and that between raw water alone versus water accompanied by the infrastructure necessary to store it and convey it so as to make it available for use.",

(3) Fear, anger, distress, and maneuvers aimed at avoidance are typical responses to its threatened unmasking. (4) From its earlier history as a \"good\" and necessary game, it is fast becoming (simply because it is a game and dishonest, and therefore in the end self-defeating) a \"bad\" and indeed suicidal one, crying out for our immediate recognition and counter-measures. The urgency is underscored by the many-sided threat it now poses to its players, to people everywhere, to the very survival of humanity and many other species. (5) The fact that, since each of us learned it, the game can be unlearned, and the fact that it is superfluous and can with immense and all-round benefit be opted out of, are demonstrated by the lives and teachings over the past 3,000 years of notable non-players – \"seers\" belonging to all religions and none whose numbers seem to be increasing.",

      "title": "Ifd Disease: Korzybski's Happiness Formula",
      "abstract": "THE MOST WIDELY KNOWN version of the 'I.F.D.' disease is probably that of Wendell Johnson presented in his excellent People in Quandaries. After Hayakawa's Language in Thought and Action, Johnson's book seems to have been the most read of the first generation of popularizations of Korzybski's work. In my view, it is second to none in its clear, practically focused elaboration of fundamental general-semantics. Highly recommended. (1) Korzybski's formulation appears in several places in Science and Sanity, most succinctly on p.472: In life, numerous serious 'hurts' occur precisely because we do not appreciate some natural shortcomings and expect too much. Expecting too much leads to very harmful semantic shocks, disappointments, suspicions, fears, hopelessness, helplessness, pessimism,, [etc.] In other words, ideal, maximum, unrealistic (structurally unsound) expectations cannot be realized. They must, 'by definition,' be thwarted, frustrated, blocked, unfulfilled. Human nervous systems/brains do not take kindly to such repeated, persistent frustrations; they literally break down, self-restructure in a dis-integrative way; they may enter upon a continuum of destructive evaluation, a gradient from annoyed to despairing. Wendell Johnson crisply put it this way (my paraphrase): Idealization leads to Frustration which, if repeated enough, leads to Demoralization (I.F.D.). This demoralization, if not relieved by more sound evaluating, can mature to a state which we can properly label disease; thus the I.F.D. Disease. It's important to recognize that both Korzybski and Johnson (a well-known speech therapist) emphasized the automaticity, the nenro-logical inevitably of this progression; that without intervention by self or others, powered by and eventuating in higher degrees of consciousness of abstracting, the persistently ideal expectationist (who seems to want to make a profession of it) is stuck in a routine of self-battery. A pity and a crime. A, frequently, crying shame. What to do? As shown in the Keyser/Korzybski/Pula Neuro-Logical Inevitably diagram, (2) we need to revisit the starting point: the T that leads to the 'F' and 'D'. We need to mole-out (dig it?) the premises upon which our ideal expectations are, well, premised. If we, via consciousness of our own abstracting, uncover those flawed premises and modify them toward structural soundness, i.e., rebuild them so that they make a better match with the eventually silent structures of extra-neural space-time (sometimes called 'reality'); if we develop more 'realistic,' context-driven expectations, we may make better predictions about our life-situations (Malinowski's context of situation) and reduce the experiences of frustration and their consequent demoralization, despair, etc. As usual in our work, we need to honor the distinction between simple and simplistic. Let's understand 'happiness' not as a constant state of hedonistic euphoria (though occasional visits to that altered state seem useful) expressed as la-dee-dahing through life, but as a condition of structurally sound, extensionally-grounded expectations. Expectations that, if wedded to an appropriate amount of work (maximum motivation) may eventuate in the realization of those expectations: 'happiness.' A state of relatively steady satisfaction that plans are being realized, that worked at (non-demanding, non-petulant) relations with other humans are (degree-wise) on a scale from satisfactory to terrific (for those special ones). …",

      "title": "Dehumanization and mental health",
      "abstract": "Dehumanization is a fearsome word, calling to mind the gravest atrocities of the past and present. People seen as less than human have suffered and suffer violence, deprivation, exclusion and dispossession, and that suffering has been and is routinely ignored or minimized. However, although dehumanization is usually understood as an extreme phenomenon confined to wars, genocides and conquests, it falls on a spectrum. Two decades of social psychological research have shown that it has significant repercussions in everyday life1. The burgeoning literature on dehumanization offers three key insights. First, dehumanization ranges from blatant and verbalized to subtle and unconscious: people can be explicitly likened to animals, but also implicitly denied fundamental human qualities such as rationality, self-control and complex emotions. Second, dehumanization takes varied forms, from seeing others as bestial or robotic, to rejecting their individuality or agency, to failing to spontaneously grant them minds. Third, although dehumanization often accompanies negative views of others, it is psychologically and even neurally distinct from prejudice. Seeing people as less than fully human is not the same as disliking them. We can dehumanize those about whom we are indifferent, not only those we hate. Indeed, studies of close relationships show that we can subtly dehumanize those we love. The vast literature on stigma reveals how people with mental illness are often viewed negatively by the general public, pictured as dangerous, blameworthy and shameful, with adverse implications for equity, well-being and recovery. It has recently become clear that, in addition to these negative perceptions, they are often also denied humanity. People are seen as less human when they receive mental rather than physical illness labels, and people with mental illnesses – especially schizophrenia and addictions – are even more blatantly dehumanized than some vilified ethnic or religious minorities2. Dehumanizing attitudes to the mentally ill are not confined to the public, but can also be held by mental health professionals. Researchers have begun to document the causes and consequences of these attitudes. One contributing factor is emotional self-preservation: professionals may dehumanize patients as a way to protect themselves against emotional exhaustion and distress3. The anticipation of emotional demands may motivate professionals to deny humanity to others and result in the withholding of empathy and care. Studies like these shine a new light on burnout, one of whose primary manifestations is the loss of empathy for others. In clinical settings, this dehumanization-like tendency may lead professionals to disengage from patients, failing to appreciate their emotional experience and reducing them to their diagnosis. Adverse working conditions that foster burnout, such as excessive workloads and organizations that treat employees as interchangeable cogs in an industrial machine, can lead mental health professionals to dehumanize patients, with the adverse effects on clinical care that burnout researchers have documented. One study found that psychiatric nurses who felt unsupported by their organizational superiors were more likely to experience burnout and depression as well as to dehumanize their patients (e.g., showing a greater willingness to bypass their consent)4. People who seek mental health treatment need not be denied humanity on the basis of their illness to suffer the impacts of dehumanization. Dehumanizing perceptions of racial minorities might contribute to racial disparities in mental health diagnosis and treatment, such as significantly elevated rates of chemical sedation in African American patients presenting to emergency departments with psychiatric disorders5, just as race-based dehumanization contributes to harsh discipline in criminal justice and educational settings. People who believe they are being denied humanity by others typically respond negatively. Just as believing that one is dehumanized based on one's race or political views has been shown to generate antagonistic reactions, so patients' engagement with psychiatric treatment may be undermined by experiences of dehumanization from demeaning media representations, dismissive interactions with professionals, and deindividuating encounters with the health care bureaucracy6. Dehumanizing perceptions can also be internalized rather than resisted. People who believe that others see them as less than human may come to \"self-dehumanize\". This phenomenon may have significant clinical implications. A study of patients with severe alcohol use disorders found that those who self-dehumanized more had lower self-esteem and engaged in less functional coping7. Research such as this indicates how dehumanization can create vicious cycles that compromise therapeutic aims. Being dehumanized can lead to feeling dehumanized, which can sabotage treatment. Being perceived as less than human may exacerbate an existing mental illness, but dehumanization might also be a risk factor for developing it. Indeed, studies point to adverse effects of dehumanization which are known psychiatric vulnerability factors. Being perceived as less than human increases people's feelings of social exclusion and also decreases others' willingness to help and show empathy1. The resulting social disconnection may amplify risk especially for internalizing and substance use disorders. In addition to reducing social connection, dehumanization increases tendencies to actively harm people and to tolerate harm perpetrated by others. People with stronger tendencies to dehumanize others are more likely to engage in bullying; men who dehumanize women are more prone to sexual violence and harassment; and people who dehumanize their opponents in ethnic conflicts are more likely to support violent actions towards them1. Exposure to violence is a significant psychiatric risk factor, and dehumanization fosters it. At a more systemic level, dehumanization based on race, social class, and immigrant status may reinforce the public acceptance of social disadvantage and economic hardship, known contributors to mental health inequities. The concept of dehumanization has proven to be a fruitful one for thinking about many forms of interpersonal and intergroup conflict. It complements more familiar constructs such as prejudice, stigma, stereotyping and discrimination by focusing on whether we perceive and treat others in ways that recognize our common humanity. Failures to do so have now been demonstrated in perceptions of diverse social groups, and their destructive implications are increasingly well understood. Research on dehumanization in the psychiatric realm is in its infancy, but strongly suggests that failures to fully humanize people with mental illness are widespread and have significant consequences. How dehumanization related to mental illness should be addressed is not a straightforward issue. At a population level, a cultural change is required for public perceptions of mental illness to become more humanizing. The promotion of dimensional models may lead people with mental illness to be seen as less drastically \"other\". Some aspects of dehumanizing media representations of mental illness have measurably declined in recent decades8. It is equally important to lessen dehumanization in clinical practice9. Dehumanization can be reduced by enhancing empathy in professionals, through selection and training, while recognizing that empathy and problem-solving can sometimes be in conflict, and by promoting face-to-face contact between professionals and patients despite the growing intrusion of medical technologies. Dehumanization can also be diminished by ensuring that patients and professionals are presented as individuals with uniquely identifying attributes, boosting patients' sense of agency by increasing their say over treatment, and attenuating the real and perceived dissimilarity between patients and professionals. The goal of humanizing care, within and beyond the mental health field, should be widely recognized and shared, and concrete strategies to address this goal should be identified and implemented. In addition to this, the impact of dehumanization on mental health at the population level should become a more explicit and specific focus of research.",

      "title": "JOURNAL DISCUSSION The Ethical Force of Stories: Narrative Ethics and Beyond",
      "abstract": "Things get murkier with the attempt to “use narrative toward ethical ends” [2]. The relationship between understanding a patient’s illness experience and making ethical decisions about his or her care—without recourse to such other ethics approaches as principlism, casuistry, or virtue ethics—is neither obvious nor uncomplicated. Narrative ethics’ claim is that one can “gain ethical insight and wisdom directly from narratives and without appealing to rules, principles, or other ethical constructs” [2]. Aesop’s fables make a similar claim—the morals derive from the stories. If the grasshopper sings and dances all summer (while the ant is laying-in food), and he therefore starves in winter, a child unschooled in moral theory or principles can deduce that the grasshopper’s actions have brought him a certain sort of harm— death. (Unless, as in some revisionist versions of the story, the saintly ant pities the grasshopper and takes him in for the winter). But, just as with principlism and even virtue ethics, the trouble comes when the narratives (or principles or virtues) conflict. Listen to the grasshopper’s side of the story. The miserable little ant spends the glorious summer carrying crumbs as big as she is on her back—she can neither see the sun nor feel its warmth—all to sustain life in an uncomfortably cold mound during the winter waiting for the next summer’s drudgery to begin. (Aesop’s fabled insects lived multi-year lives.) “You call that living,” the grasshopper might declaim as he goes out in a blazing dance of defiance during the red and gold profusion of autumn. This all sounds quite silly, but can be deadly serious when the grasshopper is a 20-something motorcyclist who refuses leg",

Do we recognize ourselves in the mirror because we remember how we look like, or because the available multisensory stimuli (eg, felt touch and vision of touch) suggest that the mirror reflection is me? Participants saw an unfamiliar face being touched synchronously or asynchronously with their own face, as if they were looking in the mirror. Following synchronous, but not asynchronous, stimulation, and when asked to judge the identity of morphed pictures of the two faces, participants assimilated features of the other's face in the mental representation of their own face. Importantly, the participants' autonomic system responded to a threatening object approaching the other's face, as one would anticipate a person to respond to her own face being threatened. Shared multisensory experiences between self and other can change representations of one's identity and the perceived similarity of others relative to one's self.",

      "title": "Multidimensional Educational Models Recommended by Innovative Agonology – Examples of Physical Education and Music Education",
      "abstract": "Almost all types of education are in some sense multidimensional, even if it is difficult to ascribe formal, or passion-driven, experiential, cognitive-behavioral competences closely related to the subject of education to the teaching subject (an individual or a team). From the perspective of the mission of innovative agonology, the most valuable ways, methods, forms and means of educational activities are those whose use (in a session, in a cycle, or as a ‘passion for life’) stimulates as much as possible some aspect of somatic, mental and social health, but also at least one element (component) of survival.From a broader point of view, i.e. the social mission of evidence-based science, the important premise is that although humans are genetically adapted to operate in terrestrial environments, however, they are also active underground, in water, in the air and in space. In each of these environments, one pole of the continuum of survival possibilities accumulates minimal health criteria, while the opposite pole – a long list of factors that mean inevitable death. This diversity of human operating environments and the roles they fulfill within them implies the legitimacy of recommending very complex educational models, some of which require multilevel selection.Apart from individual career paths, swimming and wrestling (even if pursued without the pressure of sports performance) optimally stimulate the somatic dimension of health (hard-respiratory capacity, strength and endurance of the largest muscle groups and flexibility) compared to other sporting activities. The survival dimension is already diverse. For instance, swimming skills increase the chance of survival in an aquatic environment while hand-to-hand combat skills increase the likelihood of effective self-defense in situations of physical aggression. And wrestling is a contact sport (psychophysical activity involving a permanent ‘dialogue of minds and bodies’), so it qualifies as a model that also stimulates the mental dimension of health. Moreover, in general, also the adepts of other martial arts interact in a peculiar way with the centuries-old heritage of the cultures from which these arts originate (social dimension of health). Unfortunately, the effective and attractive status of educational models based on martial arts is depreciated by the pathology of bloody fights of neo-gladiatorship. These spectacles are promoted and camouflaged in the public sphere precisely under the banner of mixed martial arts (the first part of the phrase ‘mixed’ is only 31.25% of the name).Brazilian capoeira is an example of a multifaceted educational model that combines martial art with music. Although innovative agonology is an appropriate science for formulating justifications at the interface between these two arts (martial art and music), the well-established standards of music education are its competition. These standards include respect for centuries-old traditions and multiculturalism, a commitment to routine with an awareness of the unlimited potential for creating beauty and positive emotions. The coordinating perfectionism of the instrumentalists is also admired. However, a hypothesis is justified: ignoring scientific knowledge (including human motor skills) from areas of activity other than music is the cause of, among other things, interpersonal conflicts (for instance teacher-student) and negative effects encompassing all dimensions of health.",

      "abstract": "Introduction: Transgressions or, beyond the Obvious I Recognitions and MisrecognitionsTransgression: it is a common enough word, circulated enough for us all to believe we understand what is meant by it when it is used.Ideas about what constitutes transgression are equally commonplace.Transgression, we might say, goes without saying.Yet, is that in fact the case?Or is it not that we are so used to what we take to be the idea of transgression that we have, in all truth, forgotten, or not even become aware of the extent to which transgression constitutes our identities?Believing we understand the term as indicative of breaking a law, doing something illicit, disrupting order and rebelling against societal norms, if and when we think we transgress we do no more than conform to expectations of acceptable 'deviance'.We act up in a manner already in some sense prescribed, whether socially or historically, and so merely conform in a way that is more or less tolerated, even when excoriated.Transgression however runs much deeper than that.It is, as I shall argue in the present volume, not merely the breaking of a code, a rebellion against normative social or cultural constraints; rather it is the very pulse that constitutes our identities, and we would have no sense of our own subjectivity were it not for a constant, if discontinuous negotiation with the transgressive otherness by which we are formed and informed.Identity must needs believe in its own stability for the conventions of transgression to apply.However, 'for a subject to imagine itself as having a stable identity', remarks Elisabeth Bronfen, is always an act of misrecognition (mésconnaissance), a fiction, an illusion…'.She continues, 'though language allows for a differentiation between self and Other… this differentiation is never complete and the imaginary register never disappears … In a sense any image is the death because the negation of the thing, for it signifies that something was thought or recognised, not as real but as an image' (Elisabeth Bronfen 1992, 395) Seeing oneself as having a stable identity is, then, to misrecognize one's selfhood.It is to project an image and take that simulacrum as the reality, as Bronfen suggests.From this basis of misunderstanding or, to anticipate the next citation, from this 'mode of production' that generates the social structure we call the self, the subject or identity, it is an all too easy step to imagine the self negated, the subject beyond the law, situated, and situating itself, in a locus of negativity, opposition, and transgressive rebellion.This leads to the following question.'If', asks Julia Kristeva, ' in certain modes of production, social structure projects itself…by circumscribing a represented, assumed, encased negativity…how does this closed place function generally, logically, outside the … system?' (97).Kristeva's inscription of precise location, of an inside and an outside in the definition of proscribed or outlaw act or event is instructive.It comments on the coercive nature of modes of production that are shaped by historical, cultural and ideological forces, which are themselves not stable but which shift endlessly, in order that a 'social structure' such as the subject might be incorporated in the mode of production, (mis)recognised as a product of that mode, or otherwise placed outside, expelled or marginalised.Identifying illicit practice, determined as a negativity in relation to, and yet closed off from the social structure, Kristeva defines in part at least the transgressive subject produced as a historical subject and determined through the reading of a transgressive space or locus.Her description of spatial position, of clearly defined positions based on perceivable oppositions such as I have indicated, is far from uncommon in the thinking of transgressive events.However, as valuable a starting point as it may be, Kristeva's reading does not take into account sufficiently the endless differentiation implied in Elisabeth Bronfen's argument, and",

      "abstract": "In the process of evaluating the effects of external Qi Gong on inanimate substances by the Bi-Digital O-Ring Test, Qi Gong energy was shown to have a polarity which the author designated for convenience sake (+) or (-), where (+) increases the strength of muscles and (-) weakens them. Depending upon how external Qi Gong is applied and from which part of the body it emanates, the polarity changes. In general, it was found that, when (+) polarity is applied to the painful area or spastic muscles or arteries in vaso-constriction it often reduced or eliminated the pain, spastic muscles or circulatory disturbances. The author succeeded in storing part of the Qi Gong energy in inanimate materials, such as papers, metals (such as a sheet of aluminum foil), glass, stone, band-aids, clothes, drugs, etc. in bi-polar (one end of the same material becomes (+) polarity and the other end of the same material becomes (-) polarity) form in one material or uni-polar, i.e., the entire material either has pure (+) polarity or (-) polarity. Water, EPA, vitamins, antibiotics and other drugs were also converted to (+) polarity. When the material has a bi-polar state, it becomes possible to eliminate one of the polarities by applying certain changing electrical fields. The effect of placing (+) polarity Qi Gong energy stored material was compared with direct application of the Qi Gong on pain, spastic muscle and spastic vertebral arteries. The therapeutic effects of these 2 methods were quite similar for the identical time duration but a more predictable effect was often obtained in the former. As our previous study indicates that acupuncture, electrical stimulation (1-3 pulses/sec.), as well as Qi Gong not only improved the microcirculatory disturbance and relaxed spastic muscles and vaso-constrictive arteries but also reduced or eliminated the pain and also selectively enhanced drug uptake to the area where drugs could not be delivered due to existing circulatory disturbances, by placing (+) Qi Gong stored material, such as a sheet of paper or aluminum foil, band-aid or clothes. Bi- Digital O-Ring Test evaluation indicated that not only did it produce all the beneficial effects of Qi Gong but also enhanced the drug uptake selectively in the area where it is necessary for the drug to be delivered for effective treatment, and reduced lead deposits in tissue.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

The engineering community has recently taken to referring to certain events as black swans, perfect storms or events caused by a priori unknowable unknowns, as if such appellation would constitute an apology for their sudden occurrence. We show that many of these metaphoric notions are either conceptually inappropriate, mostly from an epistemic point of view; or else, that they have little operational bearing on our knowledge base and on best practice rational decision-making.

There is a particular focus on sensory mechanisms by which prey can avoid being detected, avoid being identified, signal (perhaps sometimes dishonestly) to predators that they are defended or unpalatable. The book is divided into three sections. The first considers detection avoidance through, for example, background matching, disruptive patterning, countershading and counterillumination, or transparency and reflective silvering. The second section considers avoiding or surviving an attack if detection and identification by the predator has already taken place (i.e., secondary defences). The key mechanism of this section is aposematism: signals that warn the predator that a particular prey type is defended. One particularly interesting aspect of this is the sharing of the same signal by more than one defended species (the phenomenon of Mullerian mimicry). The final section considers deception of predators. This may involve an undefended prey mimicking a defended species (Batesian mimicry), or signals that deflect predator’s attention or signals that startle predators. The book provides the first comprehensive survey of adaptive coloration in a predator-prey context in thirty years.",

      "abstract": "Trance is a condition in which a person is mentally disturbed and loses control over themselves, resulting in them not understanding what they are saying, losing their memory, and feeling confused. This research is included in the type of library research or library research, where researchers read, study, and analyze relevant literature, such as the Qur'an, hadith, books, and the results of previous research. The literature approach allows researchers to gain an in-depth understanding of the topic under study through careful review and study of the various available text sources. The phenomenon of trance has occurred since the time of the Prophet Muhammad SAW, as in the hadith about a woman who came to complain to the Prophet about her possession, namely a disorder that causes tension in the body and can even cause fainting, similar to epilepsy. This type of possession can be caused by disturbances from jinns, both due to the actions of sorcerers and other disturbances. Jin has the potential to affect the human body and feelings. In Islam, to protect oneself from the influence of negative jinn, it is important to practice the actions taught in the religion, such as memorizing and reciting the Ayat Kursi, adhering to the dhikr and prayers of the Prophet Muhammad, and avoiding daydreaming and over-eating.",

      "abstract": "I know, for the most part, what I think, want, and intend, and what my sensations are. In addition, I know a great deal about the world around me. I also sometimes know what goes on in other people's minds. Each of these three kinds of empirical knowledge has its distinctive characteristics. What I know about the contents of my own mind I generally know without investigation or appeal to evidence. There are exceptions, but the primacy of unmediated self-knowledge is attested by the fact that we distrust the exceptions until they can be reconciled with the unmediated. My knowledge of the world outside of myself, on the other hand, depends on the functioning of my sense organs, and this causal dependence on the senses makes my beliefs about the world of nature open to a sort of uncertainty that arises only rarely in the case of beliefs about my own states of mind. Many of my simple perceptions of what is going on in the world are not based on further evidence; my perceptual beliefs are simply caused directly by the events and objects around me. But my knowledge of the propositional contents of other minds is never immediate in this sense; I would have no access to what others think and value if I could not note their behaviour.",

The emotion of shame is the primary or ultimate cause of all violence, whether toward others or toward the self. Shame is a necessary but not a sufficient cause of violence, just as the tubercle bacillus is necessary but not sufficient for the development of tuberculosis. The purpose of violence is to diminish the intensity of shame and replace it as far as possible with its opposite, pride, thus preventing the individual from being overwhelmed by the feeling of shame. Violence toward others, such as homicide, is an attempt to replace shame with pride. It is important to add that men who feel ashamed are not likely to become seriously violent toward others and inflict lethal or life-threatening, mutilating or disabling injuries on others unless several preconditions are met.",

Therefore, we may prefer to rephrase this question as: \"Can Nāgārjuna legitimately be called a thinker of philosophy or religion?\" Although it has been and may still be defined by its method or the objects of \"philosophical thinking\", philosophy is, in most cases, expected to have the following characteristics: (1) Philosophy is a type or product of human thought. (2) It is motivated by the human inclination for inquiry into the fundamental basis of being, whether human, social, or natural. (3) It is, theoretically at least, free from any types of dogmatic premises, whether traditional, social, or religious. (4) It requires a thoroughly logical and unequivocal usage of words and sentences. Likewise, although it has been and may still be defined by the existence or number of the absolute(s), be they god(s), spirit(s) or mental state(s), religion is, in most cases, expected to have the following characteristics: (1) Religion is a type of human beliefsystem or a product thereof. (2) It is motivated by the human inclination for ultimate reliance upon the absolute being or state. (3) It is, in practice, not completely free from some types of authoritative premises, whether traditional, customary, or founded by a certain individual. (4) It requires a purified mind, a deep understanding of tradition, constant practice and a careful observance of certain rules and regulations. Taking into account of the above characteristics of philosophy and religion, can we legitimately regard Nāgārjuna as a thinker of philosophy, religion, both, or neither? Let me focus on this question with an analysis of Nāgārjuna's discussion as found in his magnum opus, Mūlamadhyamakakārikā, and related works.",

      "abstract": "Each of us is uniquely subject to certain kinds of stimulation from a small part of the universe within our skins. Mentalistic psychologies insist that other kinds of events, lacking the physical dimensions of stimuli, are accessible to the owner of the skin within which they occur. One solution often regarded as behavioristic, granting the distinction between public and private events and ruling the latter out of consideration, has not been successful. A science of behavior must face the problem of privacy by dealing with events within the skin in their relation to behavior, without assuming they have a special nature or must be known in a special way.The search for copies of the world within the body (e.g. the sensations and images of conscious content) has also had discouraging results. The organism does not create duplicates: Its seeing, hearing, smelling, and so on are forms of action rather than of reproduction. Seeing does not imply something seen. We know that when we dream of wolves, no wolves are actually there; it is harder to understand that not even representations of wolves are there.Mentalistic formulations create mental way stations. Where experimental analyses examine the effects of variables on behavior, mentalistic psychologies deal first with their effects on inferred entities such as feelings or expectations and then with the effects of these entities on behavior. Mental states thus seem to bridge gaps between dependent and independent variables, and mentalistic interpretations are particularly attractive when these are separated by long time periods. The practice confuses the order of events and leads to unfinished causal accounts.",

      "title": "The Principles of Education",
      "abstract": "EDUCATION covers the span of life from the cradle to the grave. Impressions are received in bits and blocks in an endless stream. Some of these pass almost at once into oblivion, leaving the merest trace in our minds. Other impressions, stimulating more or less interest through partial or anticipated connection with something already in our minds, are seized upon, inspected and then, if found true and worthy, tagged and pigeon-holed with other associated impressions. An occasional new impression of unusual strength will dominate a whole group of old impressions. The mind then makes abstracts (ideas) of groups of impressions to connect with abstracts of other groups. The best measure of mentality is probably this tendency to interconnect and abstract the essential ideas in a wide variety of other ideas and groups of impressions. And mentality in this sense is a measure of the degree of education in an individual. The impressions of an infant are limited to those received from its immediate surroundings. During school days, the mind receives and assimilates ideas from farther afield not associated with desire or discomfort. Later on, in high school and college days, the mind likes and readily assimilates groups of abstract related ideas and even probes the infinite and unknowable. In middle life, the dominant interest lies in the practical problems of everyday life. The field of our activities is our school and the newspaper and magazine our text-books. The mind demands fresh facts and new ideas. In later life, after the details of most minor problems have become familiar, interest turns once more to general principles, and larger problems, details are reduced to routine when possible. In short, education is as long and as broad as our lives. National welfare requires that it be recognized and treated as such. What we now call education is a mere generalization of parental instruction covering the period of most active interest in the most abstract ideas. Real education in the interest of the nation should be such as to develop and bring into action all the latent possibilities in every individual. Whatever our useful activities at any period of our lives, we should be continually receiving and assimilating new ideas with both bodies and minds fresh and active, with a code of ethics firmly established and a philosophy of life equal to any emergency.",

A perceptual experience is typically an experience that represents a cup before me, a tree through the window, a police siren heard in the distance, the burning toast in the kitchen and so on. It is commonly held that besides having intentional content, the perceptual experiences have a sensuous, sensory aspect: there is something to the taste of a Shiraz wine, the smell of burning onions, the look of a Perth blue sky, that is not captured in the intentional content.",

These senses represent the interface between an animal and its environment. Indeed, the survival and fitness of an animal depend upon its ability to accurately and adequately gather sensory stimuli. Olfaction and taste are grouped together as chemical senses because the stimuli they detect are molecules or compounds that either travel through the air or are settled on a physical substrate. Hearing, vision and somatosensation are grouped together as physical senses because the stimuli they detect are physical forces (e.g. sound waves, light, pressure, temperature). While taste is a critical part of an animal’s ability to judge aspects of its environment (such as food quality), it does not play a direct role in social communication and thus will not be included in the ensuing discussion (Dominy, Ross and Smith, 2004).",

      "abstract": "Eating disorders are a complex and constantly growing phenomenon; there are several therapies designed to treat this disease. But what do we mean when we talk about disease and treatment? What is an eating disorder? Is it a clinical disease? A psychological ailment? A reaction to difficulties encountered in particular socio-relational environments? Behind the symptom is always a person who, consciously or unconsciously, is the cause of their own discomfort. The symptom is a symbolic representation of an inner conflict, betraying difficulties in relating to oneself, to others and to reality. A valid method of treating eating disorders is the theatre experience, primarily in workshop form. Theatre experience is inherently about openness to others and to oneself; it can be tool for developing a new perspective, for looking after oneself, for discovering one’s body as an authentic, deep and healthy interface between an individual and the world, which is necessary for constructing a positive self-image. Through play, and in an environment perceived as safe and removed from everyday reality, the individual can follow a process of experimentation, creation and expression (perceived as impossible in ordinary life) which can lead to a new way of living. Starting from current studies on eating disorders and their connection with social dynamics, and based on personal experience in leading a theatre group of girls with eating disorders in a collaborative project with the medical team of therapeutic communities in Asso (at Sant’Anna Hospital, Como), this essay aims to evaluate theatre’s potential as an effective, long-lasting treatment for eating disorders, one that gives the individual a chance to extend this potential to their own everyday life as the foundation for broader social change.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Many objects that we encounter have ‘typical’ material qualities: spoons are hard, pillows are soft, and jell-O dessert is wobbly. Over a lifetime of experiences, strong associations between an object and its typical material properties may be formed, and these associations not only include how glossy, rough or pink an object is, but also how it behaves under force: we expect knocked over vases to shatter, popped bike tires to deflate, and gooey grilled cheese to hang between two slices of bread when pulled apart. Here we ask how such rich visual priors affect the visual perception of material qualities and present a particularly striking example of expectation violation. In a cue conflict design, we pair computer-rendered familiar objects with surprising material behaviors (a linen curtain shattering, a porcelain teacup wrinkling, etc.) and find that material qualities are not solely estimated from the object’s kinematics (i.e. its physical (atypical) motion while shattering, wrinkling, wobbling etc.); rather, material appearance is sometimes “pulled” towards the “native” motion, shape, and optical properties that are associated with this object. Our results, in addition to patterns we find in response time data, suggest that visual priors about materials can set up high-level expectations about complex future states of an object and show how these priors modulate material appearance.",

Human reality is the social reality of one's fellow-creatures. It is always rooted in the corporeal, the soma which is the manifestation within the individual of the unity of physis, bios, and mind. This complex manifestation (or gestalt in a broader sense) is unstable. It must be maintained by means of a constant supply of emotional stimuli, which is aesthetically mediated by communicative intercourse. Schizophrenia signifies the rupture of interpersonal relationships, a breakdown in the process of emotional refuelling. A marked diminution of clear contours in physiognomic manifestations also has somatically perceivable consequences in the case of the chronically ill.

These are examples of transcendental experiences (from the Latin transcendere = to exceed, surpass), that is, experiences that go beyond what is considered as ordinary perception and experience. This chapter presents a selection of accounts that can illustrate such transcendental experiences in connection with music. It is, of course, self-evident that these are hard to put into words. Often, such descriptions are restricted to one or several expressions of the type above, perhaps with the addition of an image or a metaphor.

This series of studies examined whether and when preschool children are willing to attribute internal and immanent causes to motion. In 3 studies, preschool children and adults viewed animals and artifacts (wind-up toys and transparent objects) either moving independently or being transported by a person. Children explained animal and artifact events differently, even with the kind of movement controlled: They were more likely to attribute immanent cause to animals than to artifacts and more likely to attribute human cause to artifacts than animals. Internal causes were less frequently endorsed overall; however, when asked to describe the insides of artifacts, children who saw them moving alone more often described internal mechanisms (e.g., batteries, electricity) than children who did not see them moving alone. Altogether, the studies suggest that children as young as 3 or 4 years of age honor two principles: For animals more than for artifacts, movement is caused by an immanent source, and across domains, movements without an observable agent have an internal or immanent source.",

      "abstract": "‘Waiting for Godot’ is a play about behaviour which is identifiably religious from a sociological point of view, although not explicitly so. Because it is a play, it is an icon of implicitness, as plays don’t say what they mean in the form of explicit messages from the author to the audience, but communicate implicitly through fictitious events and personages. In this particular play, the main characters demonstrate by means of what they say and do, that, for them, life’s meaning is associated with a longed-for consummation, a life- and purpose- -giving encounter, and that the action of waiting for this provides the focus for all their other actions and intentions, affecting the way they interpret whatever occurs in their world. They are committed to waiting for Godot to arrive; a state of mind encapsulated within the symbolic scenario which is the play. In other words, then, their behaviour chimes with the three defining characteristics of Implicit Religion: commitment, integrating focus, and extensive effects which proceed from an intensive concern, when these occur in circumstances which are not associated with explicit religion of any kind. The tramps themselves never mention God or religion, and the play’s author is recorded as saying ‘If I had meant God I would have said God’. Nevertheless the parabolic shape and the poetic language of the play produce an effect similar to that of religious ritual.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Peircean semiotics entails a set of tools quite useful in understanding phenomena of interest not only to medical anthropologists but also, more importantly, to the actors engaged in the situations reflected in my transcripts. For, using the vocal qualities they use means not only manipulating symbols in Peirce’s sense of the term but also physically engaging listeners and forming a vocal icon of a nonvocal state, such as misery. The creaky voice (described and graphically depicted later in this chapter) may be a sign conventionally understood to resemble a particular sort of low-energy state (Brown and Levinson 1986: 119, 267, 268). But to understand its use in troubles talk, we must also see it as a sort of vocal gesture indexically linked with other gestures, some visible, some audible. The sum of these gestures seems to represent a category like suffering, physical depression, or weakness. Put simply, using the creaky voice or the other sign-vehicles I highlight later may be a familiar signal. Still, conventions do not abstractly govern behavior (Bourdieu 1977b). Hence, over and above the conventionality of the vocal gestures described later, their availability and local social history condition the significance of their use. This semiotic fact potentiates something even more interesting-the ability of actors to invoke, play with, and deviate from convention.",

      "title": "Fear of strangers in children and the orienting reaction",
      "abstract": "The phenomenon of fear of strangers (FS) is reviewed in light of recent findings in neurophysiology, ethology, developmental and cognitive psychology. Responses to strangers by infants are variable, including looking, withdrawal, clinging, rigidity and screaming. Visual fixation of strangers is invariable in humans and animals. The evolutionary survival value of FS in humans has been questioned. The theory that this behavior prevents the dilution of the attachment bond late in infancy when the child cannot flee an enemy is critically examined. Such a behavioral mechanism whereby infants were programmed to fear members of their own species would have been of little survival value in early human hunting and gathering societies where parent mortality was high. Fear of strangers has also been accounted for on the basis of cognitive conflict induced in infants by strangers. This theory does not explain why FS appears in human infants several months after discrimination of familiar from strange objects is perceptually possible. The orienting reaction (OR) elicited by changes in the environment and characterized by heightened arousal might be important in understanding the development of the FS response. The adaptive value of the OR may be the maintenance of an optimal distance between novel stimuli and the infant until such time as informational uncertainty about the stimulus is reduced. Maturation of the OR in the latter part of the first year of life permits the child to consider informational variables involved in a novel object or stranger and determine the nature of his response. Physiological measurements such as EKG could be used experimentally to determine whether an OR is evoked in infants by the appearance of a stranger.",

      "title": "The Language Problem",
      "abstract": "ONE CAN RECOGNIZE confluence of two tributaries in what I will call language problem. The first of these (a secular and, to some extent, a psychological tributary) involves inevitable distortion that arises when translating an inner experience into an outer expression. may regard this distortion as either random or motivated, as either error or as bias. In either case it results in speech untrue to underlying thought. I find other source in realm of religion: In beginning was Word, and Word was with God, and Word was God. that Word, religion often tells us, had divine qualities and perfection, while our words, so uniquely human, so characteristically mortal, appear inherently corrupt and fallible. Both of these tributaries lead to same paradoxical, absurd conclusion: Language, which apparently functions to serve as a tool of communication, cannot fulfill its goal. Notice that argument goes far beyond criticizing language for its imperfection and ambiguity, or for not always meeting expectations. Instead, language problem refers to a state of affairs where we contrast inner truth with outer falsehood: Human speech conceals rather than reveals. In every generation, philosophers, linguists, poets, and other reflective thinkers rediscover and elaborate this basic idea, with or without its religious overtone. The following quotations express this common theme, despite differences in ideology and style: * Adorno (1973a, pp. 52-3): But no matter how hard we try for linguistic expression of such a history congealed in things, words we use will remain concepts. Their precision substitutes for thing itself, without quite bringing its selfhood to mind; there is a gap between words and thing they conjure. And again (1973b, p. 59): ...language no longer allows anything to be said, as it is expressed. Either it is reified and banal of commodities and falsities thought from start. Or it installs itself, ceremonious without ceremony, mighty without might...in short, of sort that Hofmannsthal attacked in George School. * St. Augustine, circa 400 (1876, Sermon xii, 600-1): God is true and every man a liar. * Bacon, quoted in Harris (1981): Words still manifestly force understanding, throw everything into confusion, and lead mankind into vain and innumerable controversies and fallacies. * Bateson (1972, p. 275): We are so befuddled by language that we cannot think straight... * Berger (1912, p. 221): Before Verb, Word par excellence, all speech will be fruitless. here, for us ourselves, we have a scarcity of words... * Bialik (1917/1950): For it is clear that language with all its associations does not introduce us at all into inner area, essence of things, but that, on contrary, language itself stands as a barrier before them. * Brecht (1967, vol. I, 187) in Jungle of Cities: Garga: Language is not enough for understanding. Shlink replies: ...the only union is that of sexual organs, but even this cannot bridge over chasm made by speech. * Browning (1869, Ch. 12, line 838): Our human speech is naught. (1) * Christy (1979, pp. 980-1), attacks what he calls Medspeak, i.e. language interns and residents use to serve the need to hide. Meaning is drained out, communication ceases to exist, thought wilts, action is paralyzed. (2) * Eliot (1936, p. 152). Sweeney in Fragment of an Agon, apologetically: But I've gotta use words when I talk to you... * Frege (1918), quoted in Harris (1981): One fights against language. * Goethe (circa 1800), quoted in Huxley (1954, pp. 73-4): We talk far too much. should talk less and draw more. I personally should like to renounce speech altogether and, like organic Nature, communicate everything I have to say in sketches. …",

      "abstract": "In contrast to prevailing trauma narratives that reduce adolescent war survivors to symbols of victimhood, psychic collapse, or moralized endurance, Patricia McCormick’s Never Fall Down articulates survival through a less valorized, yet psychologically intricate, instinctual paradigm. In this work, the survival practices of Arn Chorn-Pond are not questioned as the remnants of a heroism or ideology that was independent of genocide; instead, they are interpreted as deeply seated manifestations of what Freud termed the life-instinct, or Eros, fellow feeling, and permanence that motivate the psychic organization set in opposition to death or decomposition that is to say, one that cannot be explained in terms of programmed responses to a least-resistance-seeking genocide. The moral disengagement (a cognitive precondition that warrants individuals to relinquish moral standards to save themselves in extreme circumstances) and the strategic production of emotional, desensitisation and abdication of language can be placed at the forefront in understanding these forces as structurally called upon, rather than ethically deviant reactions, about the behaviours portrayed by Arn. The questions addressed are deepened by a tissue-like approach to the text combined with the trauma theory as well as Freudian drive theory, making it a fresh intervention to replace the prevailing patterns of martyrdom in the analysis of young adult literature. Never Fall does not portray survival as a triumph of ethics because the accounts that follow are not a story of survival and triumph but rather a precarious balancing of the soul, one that survives amidst moral turmoil. Such a reframing advances a novel critical discourse that redefines survival not as resistance, but as a conflicted, instinct-driven imperative shaped by unbearable historical conditions. The paper thus contributes a theoretically rigorous, ethically ambivalent, and narratologically specific reading of survival in post-genocidal adolescence.",

The abject is not easily relegated to definition precisely because it 'beseeches and pulverizes the subject'. Pursuing constantly, avoiding absolute destruction and lingering always on the edges of repression, it is 'a terror that dissembles, a hatred that smiles, a passion that uses the body for barter'. Continuing this interdependency is the fact that the subject needs the abject; it is necessary refuse, defilement shed from the body in order to maintain the controlled borders of the self. Like vomit, purged so that a healthy body can continue to function, or the presence of abject entities in religion so that the safe and correct strictures of belief can be followed, the abject, Kristeva suggests, exists in opposition to and in challenge of everything.

People abnegate part of their agency regularly; for example, this is done within hierarchical institutions. In other times, the self-abnegation is all-encompassing; for example, this happens to victims of brainwashing. An agent in such a position can completely fail to understand herself or be understood as having a self. This can arise from internal and external forces. After describing the features of self-abnegation, Wieland concludes by considering whether the self-abnegated person is owed respect. Should a person be treated as if her reasons and narratives were her own even though they are derived from the will of another?

Florence Nightingale recognizes the radically changed outcomes by addressing clean water, nourishing food, light and fresh air . Good nutritive food plays very vital role in maintaining proper health and also helps in prevention and cure of diseases. All body functions like metabolic, hormonal, mental, physical or chemical cannot be performed by the body without nutritive food . For healthy mind, soul or psyche food itself needs to be healthy. Access to good quality food has been man's main endeavor from the earliest days of human existence. Food adulteration is the most dangerous problem related to nutrition. Adulteration can be defined as the inclusion of constituents whose presence is prohibited by regulation, custom and practice or making impure by adding inferior or less desirable materials or elements in the food. Food adulteration can be classified as intentional, unintentional or incidental. Intentional adulteration is the act of adding, removing substances to food and knowingly altering the existing natural properties of food. Unintentional adulteration is not willful act; it may be due to ignorance, and lack of proper facilities like dropping of rodents, larva in food. The most common practice is the intentional addition of an adulterant to a food to increase the food’s value through deception. Consumers are cheated by adulterated foods due to lack of knowledge regarding quality of food. Most of them are also ignorant about the consumer protection acts and remain recessive for taking action against such activities prevalent in the society, which gives opportunities to the fraudulent traders and retailers.",

There is a change in the wearer's consciousness, thoughts, feelings and behavior. The substance that is swallowed, enters the stomach, then the blood vessels. If inhaled or inhaled, substances enter the blood vessels through the hood and lungs. If injected, the substance enters the blood directly. Blood carries these substances into the brain. The brain is the body's control center. If work changes, all the organs of the body also have an effect. Through a caring attitude, prevention of various crimes, juvenile delinquency, security, peace, harmony, will be easily created. With this caring attitude, the motto that, Prevention is better than cure, will truly be proven in the case of the use of illegal drugs. Key Word : Narcotics Crime, Society",

      "title": "Communication Failure as Communication Power",
      "abstract": "After all communication remains a bitter idea that one could communicate properly, and better, and more efficient, and lower overall costs. The idea that persists after any communication is that the communication was imperfect. Being imperfect, any communication is also a failure. The power of communication is the communication failure. The failure is to not express your-self perfect, or speak more or less than you should, or could not say everything, or being misunderstood. In essence, the failure and the primary means of communication to improve the communication would be expression, speech, discourse. Discourse can be verbal or non-verbal. In linguistic communication works the principle of general expression, the principle of strong effability (J. J. Katz). The range of expression through language we record influence of idea of ineffable: it is thought, content, feeling, feelings, expressiveness that cannot be expressed. Ineffable principle seems to be secondary. In fact, the natural state of the world is ineffability. Effability and Ineffability of communication are complementary principles. The power of communication is in communication failure. Perfection communication cancel communication, perfection does not allow self-reproduction of communication and therefore stimulate its implosion. Deficient communication process development support communication; communication failure is the communication power. Communication failure is a relatively late theoretical discovery of communication discipline. It follows that in a subsequent paper to investigate ”the principle of communication failure” that emerges from the research of several renowned experts in General Science Communication (C. R. Berger -1997; J. D. Peters; Noemi Marin - 2007).",

Destiny is thought of as contradictory, ambivalent beginning. It is able to help or hinder. Carriers of the Polish language are ambivalent in their relation to the destiny. Presence of the destiny may either be approved or denied. Poles have different views on the nature of destiny. On the one hand, destiny is presented as unchangeable and predefined from above. On the other, there is a view that it is created during the life (existence), and, for example, a person can have a significant influence on it. Metaphorically in Polish destiny is represented by the signs of person, connecting or disconnecting, gracious or formidable beginning.",

Some accounts of friendship can include (other than human) animals more easily than others. I present an argument in favour of characterising some animal-human connections as friendships, and address some of the standard objections to this characterisation. It might seem that under any conception of friendship, characterising animals as (potential) friends would likely lead to better treatment of animals, as various kinds of ill-treatment or use would not be consistent with treating someone as a friend. However, concern for animal welfare typically extends well beyond the direct concern for our own household companions, and is a concern for animals (or certain animals) in general, whereas friendship, by its nature, is particularist. There are limits to applying the concept of friendship to animal treatment beyond particular relationships.",

When an organ of a different system begins to degenerated and lose its anatomical and physiological capabilities over time, it is said to be ageing. This process can occur in a cell, an organ, or the entire organism.&#x0D; Shareera (physical), Indriya (emotional), Satwa (psychological level), Agni (metabolism), Bala and Ojas etc. are influencing factors for Jara (ageing). The final stage of life is called Vriddhavastha (Jara). During this phase, every aspect of the body begins to degenerate, including the Dhatu (different anatomical tissues), the Indriya (sensory and motor organ), the ability to perceive, the power of speech, the power of the body, and numerous mental and cognitive functions (such as memory, intellect, reception, retention, analytic ability, etc).&#x0D; The Vayu dosha predominates throughout this phase (one of the three physiological body factors). The most noticeable physical changes at this time include ageing skin, greying hair, baldness, and a decline in physical stamina. Loss of muscle compactness, joint looseness, vitiation of Rakta (blood), excessive production of Meda (fatty tissue), failure of Majja (marrow) accumulation in bone, failure of production of Shukra (semen), and loss of Ojas component are examples of these pathological alterations. This article is made to explore the physiological changes during Aging.",

The nonverbal communication system comprises facial expressions, body movements, vocalic or paralinguistic cues, personal and environmental space, objects, time, physical appearance, and smell/odor. These nonverbal modes perform important functions for us, such as sending relational messages, emotional expression, and impression formation. Theories have been developed to explain how some of these functions work, with particular attention given to changes in intimacy or immediacy (forms of relational messages) and deception and its detection.",

      "abstract": "My intention is: to try to face a certain central social problem in its connection with the concept of leisure. And I hope that a solution of that problem, or at least some ways towards a solution, may become more clear and visible. This is a rather modest purpose (because problems are still not solved when a solution has become visible or even when some ways of a solution have become more clear than before). I shall not consider the social problem from a formally sociological point of view or from a formally political point of view, but from a philosophical point of view. It shall not be spoken of in such a way that the field of vision is completely filled with it. The point-of-view does not lie so close to the concrete phenomena that our attention is occupied and consumed by their immediate impact. Philosophical consideration means that a certain subject is considered within the horizon of the total and universal reality; it belongs to the essence and nature of a really philosophical question, that not only this question itself comes into play, but that—onsidering, meditating this question—one is obliged to bring into play the totality of the world, even God and the world. In such a view the discussion loses perhaps some actual interest for the politician or for an immediately-involved man. But on the other hand, it might be that deeper possibilities of a solution become perceivable, just because the totality of the real world, especially the totality of human nature, comes into the range of vision. It might be, too, that there are social and political problems which, from the mere viewpoint of sociology and politics, cannot be solved. And perhaps this possibility is relevant to our present case. I would like to formulate the claim very modestly. In question is a sort of attempt, a proposal, to view the problem from a new and familiar standpoint. There may result an insight into the social problem—which possibly can become useful within the sphere of politics.",

Medical auscultations tend to use sight (e.g., inspecting throat or ears), touch (muscle tone, tissue, swellings), or sound (e.g., listening to heart beat, resonance of lung cavity).

      "abstract": "Humans do not have a monopoly on emotionality. More than a century ago, Charles Darwin (1872) provided compelling arguments that some animals, especially mammals, are capable of expressing human-like emotions. Today, an increasing body of research convincingly demonstrates that most nonhuman primates possess the same basic neural circuitry and exhibit the same general patterns of neurochemical change that have been implicated in human emotional expression (cf. Panksepp, 1998). Monkeys and apes routinely display characteristic patterns of emotional expression that seem strikingly similar to, if not homologous with, those routinely exhibited by infants and young children in virtually every human culture studied to date. To be sure, some complex emotions such as shame are most likely exclusively human, but they apparently require cognitive capabilities well beyond those of human infants and nonhuman primates of any age (cf. Lewis, 1992). The more basic emotions, such as fear, interest, surprise, and rage, are clearly expressed soon after birth by human and nonhuman primate infants alike, and their expression is usually obvious to all around; that is, they serve as highly visible and salient social signals (cf. Suomi, 1997b).",

To be concerned about someone's well‐being is to care whether he is doing or faring well. The word “well” that appears in these expressions plays an evaluative role – it is the adverbial form of the adjective “good,” and of course “good” is a grade we use to evaluate things. If someone is well‐off, his life is good. Hence, it is not surprising that we commonly move back and forth so easily between “well‐being” and such terms as “health,” “happiness,” and “prosperity”: most people assume that the life of a human being is a good one – that someone living such a life is faring well – only if it has at least some measure of these goods.",

      "title": "Does Trait Loneliness Predict Rejection of Social Robots?",
      "abstract": "Since chronic loneliness is both a painful individual experience and an increasingly serious social problem, robot companions have emerged as a result of robotization of social work to confront this issue. We foresee that social robots will become pervasive in the near future. Thus, it is crucial to pinpoint the relationship between chronic experiences of loneliness (i.e., trait loneliness) and both anthropomorphism and acceptance of such artificial intelligent agents. Previous research demonstrated that experimentally induced state loneliness increases anthropomorphic inferences about nonhuman agents such as pets. However, in the present research we found that trait (vs. state) loneliness - a permanent personality disposition that is not easily relieved (vs. transitory experiences caused by circumstance, and easily relieved) - reduced participants' anthropomorphic tendencies and acceptance of a social robot (regardless of the form: a picture of the robot, an on-site robot, or direct interaction with the robot). In particular, believing that the robot lacks good \"unique humanness\" traits (i.e., Humble, Thorough, Organized, Broadminded, and Polite) is one reason why dispositionally lonely participants are less likely to anthropomorphize a robot, which further prompts reduced acceptance of it. This finding suggests that unique humanness, exemplifying secondary emotions, is vital, not only in interpersonal contexts, but in establishing connections with social robots.",

      "abstract": "Arousing anxiety is one of the most important instruments of tyranny. Arousing anxiety is a weapon used not only by dictatorial societies, but also by the dictators of the family, school, workplace or organization. The essence of anxiety is the inability to actively control situations perceived as threatening —the experience of this lack of control and the inability to avert the impending threat causes this situation. In the interest of preserving and strengthening their power, the person or group possessing crucial information is able to withdraw the possibility of control, or to portion it out as a reward; in this way anxiety is aroused in those affected. Arousing anxiety is not only an instrument, but can also be the essence of the exercise of power for its own sake. Tyrannical power wishes to ensure full freedom of decision for itself at all times and it therefore does not commit itself, not even in the form of an agreement serving its own interests. This is true for all relationships of dependency in which the more independent partner is able to withhold information, thereby keeping the other partner in a state of “loss of control”. If the plumber does not turn up at the time agreed and does not inform us of this beforehand, if the garage does not repair the car on the grounds of a shortage of spare parts despite the fact that they have parts, we are placed in a state of powerlessness. We encounter various forms of abuse of power and induced anxiety day after day, but do not pay sufficient attention to it, do not recognise it in its essence and do not understand how this slow-acting poison kills. However, we can also arrive at a psychological definition of freedom and democracy through an understanding of the essence of arousing anxiety and of anxiety.",

      "title": "Information Basis for Action in Human Information Processing: Consequences for Information System Design",
      "abstract": "Information is available internally as well as all around us. It is possible to identify a\r\nnumber of different levels for information. Internally we can find genetic information that\r\nwill make us the way we are. It will determine our characteristics as human beings. There\r\nis also other internal information that we are unaware of, information that controls\r\nautomatic processes like heartbeat and breathing. We also have internal information that\r\nwe are aware of. Such information appears when we are thinking of something or solving\r\nproblems using our previous knowledge and impressions from the outside world.\r\nExternal information can be obtained from several different information sources. Physical\r\nobjects may convey information to us when we perceive them. Such information can be\r\nobtained through active as well as passive search. Conversation with other people is\r\nanother information source. Talking to people can also give us information through active\r\nas well as passive search. Reference information is found in for example encyclopaedias\r\nand reference literature. Such information is usually found through active search, but it\r\nmay happen that when looking for one concept you get information about another\r\nconcept and therefore this kind of information can also be gained through passive search.\r\nMass media is another information source that will bring us news information. We are fed\r\nwith the information that news editors has chosen to deliver to us. Encyclopaedias and\r\nmass media can be seen as logical objects. There are also other kinds of logical objects\r\nthat may convey information to us such as for example books about a certain subject or\r\nfiction. I will call this kind of logical objects descriptions. Descriptive information is\r\nusually gained through passive search. Regardless of information source, we get\r\ninformation only after we have interpreted the impressions and created a meaning using\r\nprevious knowledge. Information is thus regarded as an internal concept. We can see that\r\nmuch of the information is a direct base for action. Thoughts are used for decision\r\nmaking, which is we plan actions according to what we think. Information from external\r\nsources can also be used as a base for actions since we use information obtained in that\r\nway for decision making. An information system should help the user in information\r\nprocessing. Since information is the base for actions it is not enough to look at usability\r\naspects of the information system but actability aspects must also be considered.\r\nActability means that the system should support and encourage the user to perform the\r\nactions that the supplied information will imply as well as to support the information\r\nbehaviour of the user to find the information that he or she needs.",

      "title": "Consciousness as a Product of Evolution: Contents, Selector Circuits, and Trajectories in Experience Space",
      "abstract": "Conscious experience can be treated as a complex unified whole, but to do so is problematic from an evolutionary perspective if, like other products of evolution, consciousness had simple beginnings, and achieved complexity only secondarily over an extended period of time as new categories of subjective experience were added and refined. The premise here is twofold, first that these simple beginnings can be investigated regardless of whether the ultimate source of subjective experience is known or understood, and second, that of the contents known to us, the most accessible for investigation will be those that are, or appear, most fundamental, in the sense that they resist further deconstruction or analysis. This would include qualia as they are usually defined, but excludes more complex experiences (here, formats) that are structured, or depend on algorithmic processes and/or memory. Vision and language for example, would by this definition be formats. More formally, qualia, but not formats, can be represented as points, lines, or curves on a topological experience space, and as domains in a configuration space representing a subset of neural correlates of consciousness, the selector circuits (SCs), responsible for ensuring that a particular experience is evoked rather than some other. It is a matter of conjecture how points in SC-space map to experience space, but both will exhibit divergence, insuring that a minimal distance separates points in experience space representing different qualia and the SCs that evoke them. An analysis of how SCs evolve over time is used to highlight the importance of understanding patterns of descent among putative qualia, i.e., their homology across species, and whether this implies descent from an ancestral experience, or ur-quale, that combines modes of experience that later came to be experienced separately. The analysis also provides insight into the function of consciousness as viewed from an evolutionary perspective, defined here in terms of the access it allows to regions of SC-space that would otherwise be unavailable to real brains, to produce consciously controlled behaviors that could otherwise not occur.",

      "title": "Estimation by Associations and Trends",
      "abstract": "Product engineers are often challenged to estimate: 1. the properties of new or obscure classes of material that have not been extensively studied before, or have never been made before; 2. the property changes on a material due to physical and chemical modifications; 3. the properties under a variety of ambient conditions, such as temperatures, pressures, electromagnetic fields, and prolonged environmental exposures and weathering. When theoretical understanding is insufficient and quantitative correlations are not available, we can often make useful qualitative estimations by using fragmentary empirical structure–property relations. The principal tools are observations of associations and trends, which are often the only methods available in biological, health, safety, and environmental properties. Association is based on analogy, or the probabilistic assumption that “similar substances have similar properties.” Does x◦, the material in question, resemble a known substance x1 or a class of substances {x1, x2, . . ., xi , . . .} that have known properties and structure? If we can find such a match, then we can use it to make qualitative property estimates for x◦.We know that metals are nearly always solids at room temperature, but mercury is an exception. Trend is based on the study of the variation of properties among the substances {x1, x2, . . ., xi, . . .} and how they depend on structure variations, which amounts to qualitative and empirical structure–property relations. For example, we know that a larger molecule tends to have higher melting and boiling points, but chlorobenzene has lower melting point than benzene. Thomas Midgley used qualitative trend analysis to help him to discover the chlorofluorocarbons as refrigerants. He did not have a well-organized database, nor did he have an established method of analysis and prediction, and his method was ad hoc and empirical. What he did know was that sulfur dioxide and ammonia were in use as refrigerants. He looked at the periodic table of nonmetallic elements and observed the trend that small compounds of these elements tend to become less flammable when we move from the left to the right of the table, which is certainly true in the sequence CH4, NH3, H2O, and HF.",

      "abstract": "Traditionally, objects of attention are characterized either as full-fledged entities or either as elements grouped by Gestalt principles. Because humans appear to use social groups as units to explain social activities, we proposed that a socially defined group, according to social interaction information, would also be a possible object of attentional selection. This hypothesis was examined using displays with and without handshaking interactions. Results demonstrated that object-based attention, which was measured by an object-specific attentional advantage (i.e., shorter response times to targets on a single object), was extended to two hands performing a handshake but not to hands that did not perform meaningful social interactions, even when they did perform handshake-like actions. This finding cannot be attributed to the familiarity of the frequent co-occurrence of two handshaking hands. Hence, object-based attention can select a grouped object whose parts are connected within a meaningful social interaction. This finding implies that object-based attention is constrained by top-down information.",

      "title": "A crucial source of psychological certainty in human cognition: The certainty signature of central form",
      "abstract": "It has long been established that humans exhibit more psychological certainty than is justified (Burton 2009; Russell 1933). People feel certain about their most deeply held beliefs (e.g., their political beliefs), and their most distinctive memories (e.g., where they were on September 11th, 2001). The present paper proposes and tests another distinctive type of psychological certainty displayed by human beings. Namely, as people navigate the world, they encounter thousands of instances of kinds/categories at any moment (e.g., floors and walls, phones and watches, houses and gardens, pedestrians and students, coffee shops and universities, not to speak of small-scale entities, like cracks and crumbs, glints and glimmers). The present paper proposes that humans possess an initial expectation of psychological certainty that the entities they encounter will possess their form properties. Recent empirical work within cognitive science has provided evidence that human category representations possess a central form, a central structure which represents a few properties of the category as capturing its conceptual identity—e.g., what makes a watch a watch, what makes a house a house, what makes a student a student. For a watch, the central form represents properties like telling time and being portable. In Experiment 1, participants provided expectations about which properties would exist in new instances of kinds. They exhibited psychological certainty that form properties would exist in these instances, but they did not exhibit this certainty for other properties that were part of their generic knowledge of the kind. In Experiment 2, the same strong certainty belief was shown to be activated for a newly acquired kind concept, as soon as a property had been encoded as part of its central form. A wide range of consequences of this proposal are discussed, including for research on conceptual structure, stereotyping, and conceptual combination.",

      "title": "Fundamental Steps in the Development of Adaptive Behavior of the Eyes",
      "abstract": "Summary 1. Records of human eye-movements involved in following a simple object of regard during its harmonic oscillation, in the foveal fixation of a motionless object, and in the fixation movements to new objects of regard, show characteristics which lead us to the following generalizations and hypotheses:2. Approximation and correction is a type of adjustment that appears in simple forms of human behavior as well as in the conduct of affairs and the development of science. While the first responses to a new situation often follow the principle of trial and selection, subsequent adjustment in the selected mode of response commonly follows other formulae, frequently that of approximation and correction. The latter seems to be a complement of the former principle. We conjecture that it ranks close to trial and error as a general formula of adjustment.3. The tendency of an adjustment pattern to break down at or near its physiological limit and to give place to a simpler form of reaction appears in response to relatively simple stimuli as well as in response to the complex stimuli of our social and economic environment. We conjecture that it represents some fundamental characteristic of neural action that may be found in a great variety of human and infra-human behavior. It is probably related to relative fatigue and to the rivalry and competition for control of common paths.4. Anticipatory reaction is found in a simple form of human adaptive behavior as well as that which depends on insight and purpose. We conjecture that it is one of the fundamental forms of learning to meet familiar situations. Whether it develops on the basis of antecedent cues which are so related to the adequate stimuli that they become secondary or conditioned stimuli, or on the basis of the constellation of stimuli in configurations, is a question that our data did not answer. Résumé Les rasultats des études des mouvements des yeux chez les êtres humains quand ils suivent du regard un simple objet pendant son oscillation harmonique, dans la fixation fovéale d'un objet immobile, et dans les mouvements de fixation aux nouveaux objets du regard, montrent des caractéristiques qui nous font formuler les généralisations et les hypothèes suivantes: L'approximation et la correction sont un type d'ajustement lquel se trouve dans les simples formes du comportemept humain ainsi que dans la conduite des affaires et le développement de la science. Tandis que les premières réponses à une situation nouvelle suivent souvent le principe essai et choix, l'ajustement subséquent dans la mode choisie de réponse suit ordinairement d'autres formules, fréquemment celle d'approximation et de correction. Celle-ci semble être un complément du premier principe. On conjecture que celui-ci a à peu près la valeur du principe essai et erreur comme formule générale d'ajustement. La tendance d'une. mode d'ajustement à disparaître à ou près de sa limite physiologique et à donner lieu à une plus simple forme de réactioa se montre en réponse aux stimuli relativement simples ainsi qu'en réponse aux stimuli complexes de notre milieu social et économique. On conjecture qu'elle représente quelque trait fondamental de l'action des nerfs lequel peut se trouver dans une grande variété du comportement humain et infra-humain. Elle aura des rapports avec la fatigue relative et la rivalité et la concurrence pour le contrôle des sentiers communs. La réaction anticipée se trouve dans une simple forme du comportement d'adaptation des humains ainsi que dans celle qui dépend de connaissance et de but. On conjecture que c'est une des formes fondamentales de I'effort d'apprendre à faire face à des situations bien connues. Nos données ne nous disent pas définitivement si elle se dèveloppe sur la base de suggestions antérieures lesquelles ont tel rapport avec les stimuli adéquats qu'elles deviennent des stimuli secondaires ou conditionnels ou sur la base de la position des stimuli dans les configurations. Referat Aufzeichnungen von Bewegungen menschlicher Augen, während ihrer harmonischen Schwingungen beim Verfolgen eines einfachen Sehobjektes, bei fovealer Fixierung eines unbeweglichen Objektes, und bei Fixierungbewegungen auf neue Sehobjekte, weisen Merkmale auf, die uns zu den folgenden Verallgemeinerungen und Hypothesen führen: Annäherung (approximation) und Korrektur ist ein Anpassungstypus, welcher sowohl in einfachen Formen des menschlichen Verhaltens als auch in der Durchführung von Geschäften und in der Entwicklung der Wissenschaften wiederkehrt. Währenddem die ersten Reaktionen hinsichtlich einer Situation oft dem Prinzip von Versuch und Auswahl. folgen nachträgliche Anpassungen im gewählten Modus der Reaktion gewöhnlich andern Formeln, oft der der Annäherung und Korrektur. Das letztere Prinzip scheint eine Ergänzung des obigen zu sein. Wir vermuten, dass es dem Probieren als allgemeine Formel der Anpassung nahesteht. Die Tendenz eines Anpassungsmusters, an oder nahe einer Physiologischen Grenze zu zerfliessen, um einer einfacheren Form der Reaktion Platz zu machen, zeigt sich sowohl bei der Rückwirkung auf verhältnismässig einfache Reize. wie auch bei der Rückwirkung auf die komplexen Reize unserer gesellschaftlichen und ökonomischen Umgebung. Wir vermuten, dass dies ein wesentliches Merkmal der Nerventätigkeit ist, das wohl in manigfachen Variationen des menschlichen und inframenschlichen Verhaltens wiederzufinden ist. Es ist wahrscheinlich verwandt mit der relativen Müdigkeit und dem Wetteifer und—Kampf für die Beherrschung allgemeiner Mittel. Zuvorkommende Reaktionen kann man bei einfachen Formen des menschlichen Anpassungsvermögens beobachten, als auch bei solchen, die auf Einsicht und Ziel beruhen. Wir vermuten, dass sie eine der wesentlichen Formen des Lernens sind, um bekannten Situationen zu begegnen. Ob sie sich auf Grund vorhergehender Winke entwickeln, die sich zu den ihnen entsprechenden so verhalten, dass sie sekundäre oder bedingte Reize werden, oder auf Grund einer Reizkonstellation in Gebilden, ist eine Frage, die unsere Aufzeichnungen nicht bestimmt beantworten.",

      "title": "Self-harm and suicide",
      "abstract": "A person may redress a wrong by harming the transgressor, or by harming someone with whom the transgressor has a vital CS relationship. Suicide and self-harm take both forms, sometimes simultaneously. Thus, Annie may kill herself because she has violated a relationship that only her self-punishment can redeem, or she may kill herself to punish Bill who has transgressed against her, but who loves her and will suffer when she kills herself. In either case there are often important metarelational motives at work. Hurting or killing oneself may restore the collective honor of one’s primary CS group, such as family or military unit. Suicide and self-harm may also show that one accepts full individual responsibility for failure, so third parties should not blame anyone else. In other metarelational processes, Annie’s suicide to punish Bill’s transgression against Annie may make George, who loves Annie, hate Bill, or at the very least shame Bill by drawing George’s and others’ attention to the gravity of Bill’s transgression against Annie. Similarly, like Lucretia’s suicide after being raped by Sextus, it may spur others to avenge a grave transgression. More recently, Tibetan monks’ suicide by setting themselves on fire to protest Chinese rule over Tibet and repression of Buddhism have put great moral pressure on China, and in 2010 Mohammed Bouazizi’s suicide by fire in Tunisia brought out masses of protestors who overthrew the government.",

      "title": "Animal Welfare Considerations: Should Context Matter?",
      "abstract": "Much consideration of animal welfare issues, as well as the bulk of welfare legislation, is closely related to context, with clear distinction between defined responsibilities towards farm-, laboratory-, companion- and wild animals. It has however been recognised that such distinction leads to inconsistencies, in that it might lead to different welfare management practices for the same rat (for example) as a pet, laboratory animal or pest. We suggest that if legal provisions recognize animals as having moral status, then that implies certain responsibilities towards the animal that cannot be context-dependent. Although we argue the moral responsibility to consider an animal’s welfare is context- independent, we suggest that the requirement to take action (and the form of that action) may alter with context. From a biological perspective, we argue that there exists an obligation to take action to address potential welfare problems only when a challenge exceeds the animal’s adaptive capacity, such that it cannot adequately respond by changes of its behaviour. The obligation to intervene further depends on whether or not there are practical (and economically feasible) options available for mitigation. Beyond this, additional constraints may be posed by anthropocentric aims or objectives, where any suffering may be adjudged avoidable (in theory), but necessary (because of specific human interests). Finally, whatever may be determined necessary or unavoidable by the actual manager or agent himself/herself, such judgement is inevitably subjective and possibly subject to self-interest. Thus any decision must be further evaluated within the context of what is considered by a wider society to be (morally) acceptable or unacceptable.",

      "abstract": "Can one person's mental states, such as intentions or emotions, affect others even in the absence of any action or expression on that person's part? Contrary to a widely shared assumption, I argue for a positive answer. The assumption, I claim, rests on the view that a person's thoughts are by themselves neither knowable by others nor do they have causal efficacy with regard to them. The assumption can be refuted, accordingly, by recognizing other cases in which a person will be said to be affected by an event about which he knows not and in the absence of a causal link. Our willingness to acknowledge that a disaster befell a father whose son was killed in an accident, unbeknownst to him, provides such an example. The account of this case I propose highlights the fact that being a father is a relational property: it is defined in terms of the father's relation to the son, whom I call \"the relational term.\" The accident can be said to have affected the father despite the absence of a causal link because it did causally affect the relational term, i.e., the son. The crucial step in the argument is to recognize that one person's mental state can also be the relational term that defines another's relational property, thus providing a medium for non-causal effects on the latter. The argument has wide normative implications, illustrated by a discussion of the legal treatment of hate speech, and broader philosophical ramifications, concerning \"externalist\" views of the mind and their bearing on the limits of individualism.",

      "title": "On Experiential Loneliness",
      "abstract": "Presumably, everyone has, at some point in their lives, felt lonely. Loneliness is, in that particular sense, omnipresent. What it feels like to be lonely can, however, vary significantly. Loneliness is far from being a homogeneous phenomenon. Different kinds of loneliness need to be distinguished, considering its causes, contexts, a person's capacities to cope with it, and many other factors. This paper introduces the notion of a specific kind of loneliness: experiential loneliness. Experiential loneliness, it will be argued, consists in particular ways of experiencing the world, oneself, and others. Although feelings of being lonely in one way or another can emanate from one's experience of the world being structured in a particular manner, such kinds of loneliness need not-at least, not always and the whole time-lead to emotional feelings that are concerned with one's loneliness or the lack of meaningful social relationship. Loneliness can give rise to quite different emotional feelings that sometimes even cover up their provenience from underlying experiential loneliness. The notion of experiential loneliness, it is suggested, helps to tie back certain styles of thinking, desires, feelings, and behaviors to contexts of loneliness. Moreover, it will be argued that the notion can also elucidate the development of feelings of being lonely in contexts in which others are not only around but also available. To develop and enrich the notion of experiential loneliness as well as to exemplify its usefulness, a closer look will be taken at the case of borderline personality disorder, a condition in which sufferers are often plagued by loneliness.",

      "abstract": "The general problem of moral luck - that responsibility is profoundly affected by factors beyond the control of the person held responsible - has two distinct dimensions in the case of accidental injury (and no doubt in many other cases). One dimension is concerned with attribution of moral blame. Thomas Nagel explains: \"If one negligently leaves the bath running with the baby in it, one will realize, as one bounds up the stairs towards the bathroom, that if the baby has drowned one has done something awful, whereas if it has not one has merely been careless.\" How badly one has behaved and hence how much one should be blamed turns on consequences beyond one's control - on luck. The other dimension concerns the existence and extent of one's responsibility for having done harm, one's obligation to someone harmed to make amends for or repair the harm done. Someone who has been careless and lucky enough not to injure anyone has no such obligation. Someone who has been equally careless and inflicted a devastating injury may well have a ruinous obligation.",

Ambivalence is believed to be intensifying in society, resulting in inhibited growth and impaired decision-making. Researchers assert that humans utilize two basic forms of coping with ambivalence: emotionfocused and problem-focused. With emotion-focused coping, humans avoid, procrastinate, or downplay the significance of situations (i.e., valence-carriers); humans may feel relieved superficially, yet dilemmas remain unresolved [2]. With problem-focused coping, humans seek information and weigh the pros/ cons of alternatives (i.e., valence-carriers); humans invest time and cognitive effort to maximize confidence for the best possible decisions. In contrast to emotion-focused coping, our community excavates dichotomies; we probe ambivalenceinduced discomforts. Our contributors explored a variety of valence carriers.",

It was found that the prohibition was erroneous, including that it was: (a) unenforceable—the occurrence of hypnosis cannot be prevented because communication necessarily invokes, often without awareness thereof, trance hypnosis and/or waking hypnosis; (b) unnecessary—the prohibition of the utilization of hypnosis by other disciplines is not a logical consequence of the prohibition of its psychotherapeutic utilization by other disciplines because its utilization in any discipline is distinct from that in any another; and (c) preventing efficacious use—the demarcation of hypnosis as belonging to psychology, and thus as single-disciplinary, prevents efficacy because this is contingent on knowledge about the mind, body, physical environment, and interaction, which is necessarily of a multidisciplinary nature. Having identified that hypnosis cannot be prevented, only utilized, is content free, and can effect profound learning, it was concluded that the potential utilization of hypnosis in, and thus refiguration of, the practice of multidisciplinary health care is limited only by every discipline’s awareness, training, and integrated utilization thereof in medicine, surgery, and/or communication for mental and/or physical illness and/or disease. The paper concludes with illustrations of how hypnosis may be utilized in treatment and therapy disciplines respectively.",

      "title": "The Physical Basis of Mental Disease",
      "abstract": "In bringing forward some evidence which would point to the biological course followed by some forms of nervous disease to be considered, I would first of all accept as a working hypothesis two generalisations which apply to all forms of disease. The first of these generalisations is that there is essentially no difference in kind between a physiological and a pathological process. The distinction is an arbitrary one; the course of disease is distinguished from that of health only in so far as it tends to compromise the continuation of a more or less perfect adaptation between the organism and its surroundings. There is no tendency in Nature either to kill or to cure; she is absolutely impartial as to the result of a conflict between organisms and a host; and it is a matter of complete indifference to her as to whether toxins are eliminated or not. In the same way diseases of the mind are the manifestation of a perfectly natural relation of the organism, such as it is, to the environment. If the mental processes are abnormal, it goes without saying that the brain must be acting abnormally whether the stimuli to abnormal action originate in the brain itself or in some other part of the body. For example, if a child with pneumonia be suffering from delirium and hallucinations, as is not infrequently the case, this must be considered a perfectly natural outcome of the relation of the brain to its environmental stimuli outside and inside the organism. The actual stimuli may originate in the intestine from masses of undigested food and the stimuli may play on the brain rendered hypersensitive by the toxins from the lungs; the process and its manifestations, as well as the final outcome, are matters in which nature plays an impartial part. It cannot be admitted that there is any form of nervous disease which does not come under this generalisation. It has been argued by some authorities that because insidious forms of insanity are marked only by the slightest variation from the normal course of mental life, and that because the mental abnormalities are only modifications, and often easily explainable modifications, of normal mental processes, that the so-called insanity originates in these processes, and not in the material substratum of the organism. The fallacy of such an interpretation is obvious; it is tantamount to saying that slight albuminuria is the cause underlying early disease of the kidneys, or that a slight ódema may have something to do with the origin of circulatory disease. It is only natural that in the milder forms of mental disease the abnormal manifestations of brain activity should resemble normal mental processes; and even in the most advanced forms of mental disease there must be a close resemblance between abnormal ideation and conduct and perfectly normal ideation and behaviour. Even in advanced cases of Bright's disease the urinary elimination is more normal than abnormal; the abnormal constituents do not differ so much in kind as in degree from those of urine from healthy kidneys. It is not to be expected that in kidney disease bile or some other substance foreign to the organ would be the chief constituent of the eliminated fluid. The signs of insanity in any given case are the natural products of normal brain action mingled with the products of abnormal action. This does not, of course, preclude the possibility that under certain circumstances these abnormal products, such as delusions, hallucinations and perverted conduct, may not themselves be the direct stimuli to further abnormalities. The suicidal character of pathological processes is well seen in other organs of the body. A diseased heart, for example, is its own worst enemy; it not only fails to supply sufficient nutrition to the rest of the organism, but it starves itself by its inability to contract and expand properly, thereby increasing its own weakness. In the same way, certain phenomena of abnormal brain processes are in all probability due to the recoil on the brain of its own abnormal products in the matter of ideation and conduct.",

      "title": "Decision‐making and Neuroeconomics",
      "abstract": "Abstract Decision‐making is the process of choosing one out of several alternatives. The study of decision‐making is inherently multidisciplinary and can be approached from many different angles. Traditional accounts in economics and biology have a normative flavour and prescribe, rather than describe decision‐making. Recently, however, efforts in psychology and behavioural ecology have resulted in the development of theories with higher descriptive validity. Furthermore, neuroeconomics is a new interdisciplinary field that combines contributions from economics, biology and psychology and aims to identify a biologically valid, mechanistic, mathematical and behavioural theory of choice and exchange. Recent neurophysiological advances have further deepened our understanding of the mechanistic implementation of a decision in the brain. Key Concepts Utility function : A mathematical function that models the relationship between an objective measure of a commodity (such as money) and the subjective value or desirability of that commodity. The utility function is often assumed to be concave, which is supposed to underly risk aversion. Risk attitude : Animals and humans are almost never risk neutral, i.e. when choosing between a very risky and a less risky (or even certain) option, most organisms prefer the less risky option ( risk aversion ) even if the payoff of both options is identical, or even better for the risky option. Occasionally, some individuals systematically prefer the more risky option ( risk proneness ). Expected utility theory : Normatively flavoured model in economics that tries to prescribe how humans should make decisions under risk. It is assumed that decision‐makers compute the probability‐weighted sum of the utilities of all possible outcomes, integrate them with their current asset, and then choose the option the highest expected utility in final assets. Discounted utility theory : Similar model to expected utility, but for decisions in time. The weighting factor in discounted utility theory is not probability, but a function of the delay between choice and consumption. Game theory : Framework to formalize choice behaviour involving multiple interacting decision‐makers. A game allows to isolate and investigate in a controlled environment a limited set of premises of economic decision theory. Prospect theory : Alternative theory to expected utility theory with higher descriptive validity. It is assumed that outcomes of a decision are evaluated with respect to changes in wealth (gains versus losses), not in final states. Furthermore, the utility function is concave in the domain of gains, and convex in the domain of losses, and steeper for losses than for gains. Choice heuristic : A simple decision rule, or set of rules, that humans and animals apply to make decisions in complex environments. Optimal foraging theory : Based on the assumption that evolution should have favoured the development of decision mechanisms that maximize Darwinian fitness, optimal foraging theory aims to explore animal behaviour from an optimal choice perspective. Neuroeconomics : Interdisciplinary field that attempts to identify a biologically valid, mechanistic, mathematical and behavioural theory of choice and exchange.",

By “consciousness” I mean those subjective states of sentience and awareness that we have during our waking life (and at a lower level of intensity in our dreams); by “intentionality” I mean that feature of the mind by which it is directed at or about objects and states of affairs in the world; and by “thought processes” I mean those temporal sequences of intentional states that are systematically related to each other, where the relationship is constrained by some rational principles. Examples of conscious states are such things as feeling a pain or hearing a sound. Examples of intentional states are such things as wanting to eat food or believing that someone is approaching. Examples of thought processes are such things as figuring how to get a banana that is out of reach or monitoring the behavior of prey who is on the move and is trying to escape. Though these three phenomena – consciousness, intentionality, and thought processes – overlap, they are not identical. Some conscious states are intentional, some not. Some intentional states are conscious, many are not. For example, my current thought that it is unlikely to rain is conscious, my belief when I am asleep that Bill Clinton is president of the United States is unconscious. All thought processes, as I have defined them, are intentional; but not every intentional state occurs as part of a thought process. For example, a pang of undirected anxiety, though conscious, is not intentional. A sudden desire for a cold beer is both conscious and intentional.",

      "title": "Non-human Welfare : Well-being, Health and Longevity in the Animal Context",
      "abstract": "This thesis aims to answer the question of what quality of life is constituted of in a non-human context. Or differently put, ‘what is it that makes an animal's life worth living?’ In the procedure of reviewing this question other concepts and issues are addressed. One of these being the composite concept of 'animal welfare', mainly due to its popularity and frequent use in discussions and referrals to the goodness or badness of animal lives. For instance, it appears as if animal welfare may encompass concepts like quality of life, health, good production or the necessary conditions for the above. The other issue being dealt with, apart from quality of life and health, is the inquiry whether, all other things being equal, a longer life is preferable or not. Thus, the first problem presented is the concept of health and its place and definition in a nonhuman context. After considering three main theories of health from the human context and one animal-oriented concept of health, this thesis argues for a multi-factorial and holistic approach. On this view animal health is defined as being constituted by both biomedical health, functioning and subjective well-being. The second, and main, issue to be addressed is the one concerning animal quality of life, i.e. what has final positive or negative value for an animal. These are the components of quality of life, as opposed to instrumental values or means to quality of life. After presenting a large variety of theories of well-being they are all criticized. In the end a pure hedonistic approach is proposed, where it is claimed that what ultimately is in the interest of an animal is to have pleasurable feelings and to avoid suffering. However, the importance of instrumental values in the practical realm is emphasized (for examples see below). The third issue to be dealt with is longevity. This is to a large extent an unaddressed issue in the animal sciences and in discussions of animal welfare. This thesis defends a view where, given a decent level of well-being, a longer life is preferable to a shorter one and in the interest of the animal. Lastly, the relationships between the concepts of health, longevity and QoL as proposed are sorted out along with an illustration of how these approaches may support one another in a more practical sense, taking into consideration also states of seemingly important instrumental values like preference satisfaction, the meeting of innate needs and the realization of strongly motivated behaviours.

In our socialcognitive model of transference, transference occurs when a mental representation of a significant other is activated by cues in a new person that resemble the other. As a result, the self in relation to this significant other is activated, eliciting changes in affect, expectancies, motivations, and behaviors, as well as in the nature of the working self-concept, all reflecting the version of the self one is when with the significant other. Moreover, when people experience a threat to either a significant other relationship or the self in the context of an encounter with a new person who triggers transference, this sets into motion self-regulatory processes, which play out in relations with the new person. Overall, we argue that the evocation of prior experiences with significant others tells us something about the nature of the self, affect, and self-regulation that has implications for both resiliency and vulnerability.",

      "title": "Unconscious Processes",
      "abstract": "Consciousness has to do with two aspects of mental life: monitoring ourselves, our phenomenal awareness of our experiences, thoughts, and actions; and controlling ourselves, engaging in voluntary behavior that goes beyond reflex, instinct, and conditioned response. The unconscious mind—whether it exists at all, and if so what its scope and limits are—has been an important theoretical issue since the beginning of scientific psychology. There are of course many physical and biological processes that, in some sense, proceed unconsciously: the orbiting of planets around the sun and photosynthesis are two examples. Changes in blood pressure are not accessible to phenomenal awareness; and the brain activity which gives rise to consciousness itself goes on unconsciously (neurosurgeons assure us that there is no afference in the brain). But there is little point in talking about something being unconscious if that same thing cannot also be conscious, in the sense of being accessible to phenomenal awareness and voluntary control. Therefore, the adjective unconscious only makes sense when applied to mental states and mental activity, as an adjectival contrast to conscious. Mental states come in various forms—namely cognition (percepts, memories, thoughts, and knowledge acquired through learning), emotion (positive and negative feelings), and motivation (desires and goals of approach and avoidance). Usually, these mental states are accessible to consciousness, in that people are generally aware of what they are thinking, what they want and feel. “The unconscious” is shorthand for mental states and processes that are inaccessible to introspective phenomenal awareness and voluntary control. The question is whether, and to what extent, mental states can exist (and mental activities transpire) outside the scope of phenomenal awareness and voluntary control. Objection: If these mental states and activities are unconscious, how are we to know them? Answer: We know them indirectly by virtue of their effects on our ongoing conscious experience, thought, and action. Question: If there are two kinds of mental states and processes, conscious and unconscious, how do they compare and contrast? Answer: In principle, unconscious processes differ from conscious processes because they operate outside phenomenal awareness. And because conscious awareness is the logical prerequisite for conscious control; unconscious processes are not susceptible to voluntary self-regulation. Other differences between conscious and unconscious processes are empirical questions. This revision adds items that appeared through 2022.",

      "title": "The Role of Perception in Development beyond Infancy",
      "abstract": "Abstract Perception always has a role in development, as well as in ongoing behavior, because perceiving is the way we keep in touch with the world and what is going on around us. Perception never stops; it provides the information for ongo ing actions (even just sitting or standing), for planning, and for developing concepts and reasoning. It may be that the role of cognitive processes such as imagining and reasoning increases developmentally in proportion to one’s get ting information directly from ongoing events (we certainly make educational efforts to encourage them). Of course, what we learn verbally increases enormously as spoken, and then written, language is acquired. Does that mean that perceptual development ceases, or at least slows down, after infancy? Our answer is no. Potential new affordances never stop becoming available, nor do people of any age stop learning to perceive them. We have seen that as reaching, handling, and locomotion develop, encounters with the environment broaden and potential affordances multiply. New opportunities don’t stop with physical growth, they increase. The nervous system develops, as well as stature and muscles. Increasing experience provides a backlog of knowledge that breeds new opportunities. Environments change from home to school to scenes outside both, imposing new demands that lead to learning about new affordances.",

      "title": "Property Generalization as Causal Reasoning",
      "abstract": "Induction – reasoning to uncertain conclusions – appears in many forms. In some cases one makes an uncertain inference about a specific object or event. Given a particular dog, one asks whether it is safe to pet it; given a particular berry, one asks if it is safe to eat it (e.g., see Chapter 8 by Murphy & Ross, this volume). But in other cases one makes inductive generalizations that are intended to characterize an entire class of situations or objects. On the basis of a finite number of medical cases, one might induce a general causal law, such as that unsafe sex can cause AIDS or that mosquitoes can cause malaria. Or, from a few examples one might make a generalization about a property being displayed by many or most members of a particular category, such as that koalas eat bamboo, Apple laptops have fire-prone batteries, or Madagascar Fire Ants have poisonous venom. This chapter is concerned with category based generalizations such as these in which new properties are projected to an entire class of objects.",

      "title": "Deconditioning and Reconditioning: Humans in Stressful Environments",
      "abstract": "Deconditioning is an integrated physiological response of the body to a reduction in metabolic rate; that is, to a reduction in energy use or in exercise level. While it may involve assumption of a horizontal body position, it certainly perturbs bodily homeostasis - at least temporarily. The reduction in physical activity that causes deconditioning is often associated with an increase in the time spent, for whatever reason, in a sitting or horizontal position. As a result, orthostatic factors may also contribute to the deconditioning mechanism. The word decondition may be defined as 1: to cause extinction of (a conditioned response) 2: to cause to lose physical fitness. This definition implies that psychological/emotional factors may accompany physical deconditioning, and it is this interpretation of the word that is used throughout this volume. It is apparent that deconditioning plays a major role in the mechanism of the general adaptive (homeostatic) response that is initiated by exposure to prolonged bed rest (BR). And the total homeostatic response to BR involves more than deconditioning per se. For example, it has been shown that the restoration of plasma volume and maximal work capacity after 4 weeks of BR deconditioning left other bodily functions (submaximal exercise oxygen uptake and cardiac output, leg proprioception and posterior leg muscle thickness and volume, head-up tilt tolerance, and sleep quality) functioning at decreased levels. The precise effect of deconditioning on BR homeostasis is difficult to determine, because the fundamental interactive neuro-endocrine-immune control networks that facilitate conditioning and deconditioning also act to maintain basic wholebody homeostasis. For example, is the mechanism of BR-induced deconditioning independent of the mechanism that provokes concomitant orthostatic intolerance; that is, fainting? Assumption of the recumbent body position for prolonged periods of time, results in a new adaptive-homeostatic state. This state occurs in response to the mutually interactive effects of the change in bodily position (hydrostatic pressure), to the virtual elimination of longitudinal pressure on the bones, to the increased confinement with possible reduction in total daily energy (exercise) expenditure, to the reorientation of stimuli within the vestibular organs, and (often) to altered socio-psychological conditions. The exercise-training (reconditioning) syndrome affects total body homeostasis by facilitating increases in work capacity and endurance, whereas deconditioning decreases physical performance. There are many interrelated factors that influence the control parameters that seek to maintain the adaptive conditioning-deconditioning syndrome. These control parameters can be better elucidated by subjecting otherwise healthy ambulatory people to various stresses, such as exercise training and prolonged spaceflight, bed rest, water immersion, hyperbaria, and isolation and confinement. Changes in control parameters will be manifested in muscle function, orthostatic tolerance, cardiorespiratory responses, musculo-skeletal systems, free-radical processes, and body thermoregulation with overarching effects on the subjects' psycho-sociological states. A discussion of these factors and the control parameters constitutes the substance of this volume. Special emphasis is placed on delineating practical applications of the findings that will be of special interest to physicians, nurses, and other health-care workers.",

      "abstract": "In essence, education is a basic human need, because humans are born endowed with various potentials that must be developed as provisions for living life as servants and representatives of Allah on earth. But in fact today, instead of being God's representative, humans create various chaos, both in their relationships with fellow humans—violence, brawl, bullying—and their relationship with the universe—garbage, air pollution, damage to marine ecosystems, water pollution, forest fires and so on. And the bad news is, Indonesia is included in the 5 countries with the most population in the world, so the habits of the Indonesian greatly influence world conditions. It seems that the various bad conditions that occur are the result of human actions who do not have good morals, this shows that the ongoing education system has not been able to lead humans to have the awareness that everything in the universe is related to one another, especially connection with God—or better known as Cosmology, or if it is compared to one body, when one limb is injured then the whole body feels the impact. This study aims to: 1) Know how the Islamic Cosmology Perspective of Sachiko Murata; 2) Knowing the concept of Islamic Cosmological Perspective Child Education in the contextualization of Sachiko Murata's thoughts. The research method used is descriptive qualitative, which has the primary source from Sachiko Murata's book The Tao of Islam, while the data collection technique uses literature study, and the data collected is analyzed using processing, categorization and interpretation. The results of this study are (1) God is viewed in two perspectives (duality), tanzih (incommensurability) and tasybih (likeness). To know God, Murata uses the tasybih approach. Islamic cosmology aims to emphasize tauhid (the oneness of Allah), which is depicted in the form of a triangle, encompassing God, nature and man in every corner, so that there is unity and interrelation between all realities; (2) Child education in the perspective of Islamic cosmology according to Sachiko Murata, building divine awareness that God is not only about Himself who is far from the reach of creatures, but we can see God scattered throughout the horizon and soul.",

The lies of the human being are often driven by language, since they are most economical. It is easier to hide or to hide behind words. Betray you more easily through mimicry or gestures.

The things that create trouble in most of the people are having faulty dietary habit &amp; not following daily and seasonal regimen (Dina charya &amp; Rutucharya) as stipulated in Ayurveda. So different diseases related to daily life are rampantly appeared, out of them Amavata is one of the most common disease. It is made up of two words i.e. Ama and Vata. Various factors are responsible for mandagni like virudha ahara, virudha chesta (Sharirika as well as Manasika). Due to Mandagni Anna rasa does not undergo proper digestion as it results in Apakwa anna rasa which accumulates in Amashaya is known as Ama.[1] This Ama circulates all over the body, if kha vaigunya occurs it obstructs the srotas and vitiates Vata dosha. This vitiated Vata dosha with Ama enter dhamanis and circulate all over the body. The vitiated Vata &amp; Ama enter into the trika sandhi leads to stiffness of body, which is called as Amavata. The clinical sign &amp; symptom of Amavata mentioned in different Ayurvedic classics is partially equivalent to the clinical sign &amp; symptoms of Rheumatoid arthritis. It possesses a challenge to the physicians owing to its apparent chronicity, incurability, complications and morbidity. Females are three times more affected than male. Treatment for Amavata are Langhana, Swedana, Tikta Deepana, Katu Dravya sevan,Virechana, Snehapana &amp; Vasti. KEYWORDS: Mandagni, Ama, Vata, Amavata",

      "abstract": "The world around us consists of a vast collection of objects. Some of these (for example, a computer or a motor car) will be man-made while others (such as a flower or an animal) will exist purely as a consequence of natural evolutionary processes. Some items will exist in a concrete form that enables us to reach out and touch them, whereas many others (such as thoughts and ideas) may be quite abstract. An object may be loosely defined as 'anything that exists' — either permanently in the real world or transiently within our imagination or thought processes. As we have suggested above, objects may be of a number of different types and possess widely different properties. Three convenient categories into which objects are often classified are: concrete, abstract, and notional. A book is an example of a concrete object while an idea, a thought or a belief may each be considered to be examples of abstract objects. Similarly, a county or a state is an example of a notional object since the borders that define its actual physical extent could at any time be changed. Likewise, a taxonomy of knowledge is again an example of a notional concept or object. Frequently, the term 'entity' is used as a synonym for the word 'object'.",

      "title": "ARE SEDENTARY BEHAVIORS TERMINABLE?",
      "abstract": "2012 Sedentary behaviors are commonly believed to be interminable. That is, relapse looms over all those involved in physical activity. There is evidence to support this assertion. For example, initial physical activity periods are often followed by relapse episodes or complete withdrawal. Also, very few people are physically active on a regular basis and activity levels appear to decrease with age. Some people do, however, remain physically active for long periods of time - perhaps even indefinitely. What is unique about these people? To answer this question constructs from the Transtheoretical Model (TM) of behavior change were examined. The first construct examined was the \"maintenance\" stage of change. People in maintenance have sustained physical activity involvement for periods lasting at least 6 months. The second construct was the \"transformed\" stage of change. People in this stage have sustained physical activity involvement for 5 or more years and, importantly, are 100% confident this can be continued indefinitely. A third construct, not directly accounted for in TM, may also emerge (i.e., \"long-term maintenance\"). People placed here have sustained physical activity involvement for 5 or more years, but do not believe this can be continued indefinitely. Using these decision rules, 306 people (M age = 40 yr.; 59.9% female; 93.1% Caucasian) were classified as follows: 24.8% maintainers, 52.3% long-term maintainers, and 22.9% transformed. With stage serving as the independent variable, participants were compared on: age, attitude toward role modeling (ATRM), BMI, self-perceived physical activity, self-perceived fitness, and exercise METS. Overall group differences were observed (p<0.01). In follow-up tests, mean scores followed a gradient pattern of improvement from maintenance through transformed. ATRM and self-perceived fitness best described the differences observed between the three groups. In summary, preliminary support is offered to suggest a possible transformed stage of change. On the basis of our findings, it would appear that people reaching this stage have robust cognitive profiles in terms of an underlying construct we have labeled \"self-image.\"",

The discussion starts with four propositions: (1) that we are bound to think about religion; (2) that the usual result of thinking about religion is to naturalize it; (3) that religion resists being naturalized; (4) that we cannot let religion go. 2. Starting from the fundamental experience of religion, viz, worship, it is discovered that worship (1) secures freedom, by breaking through the determinisms of habit, mood, and thought; (2) promotes the meeting of minds in such a way as to make differences of view fruitful instead of merely combative. 3. Although worship promotes useful ends in human social life, it must not be made a mere means to a utilitarian end. It demands a metaphysical object of worship. To leave religion with merely psychological attitudes or social task is illicitly to naturalize it. The object of worship must be worthy of worship; it must be God. 4. The existence of evil is the chief obstacle to objective worship. The refusal to be content to let evil remain an unexplained fact in the universe involves an attempt to see it in other relations. There is an implicit or explicit appeal to a reality transcending our experience of evil. Realism refuted. 5. The possibility of worship is thus opened.

      "title": "A biological perspective on memory",
      "abstract": "Memory enables information to be stored and retrieved after seconds to years and is essential for daily life. This issue of Current Biology takes a broad look at the biology of memory. There is no universal definition of memory, but we consider the term to refer to enduring changes in the mechanisms of behavior based on prior experience with environmental input; the focus here is on specific plasticity systems, methods organisms have evolved to retain information that may be useful at a later time. In practice, memory is in evidence when some observed output at time point B can be attributed to an earlier input experience at time point A. The usual design needed to place that attribution on solid ground is as follows. One group of individuals receives input X at time point A, whereas another group does not (or better, receives some unrelated input Y). Next, after a delay, performance at time point B is said to depend on memory if individuals in the first group perform differently from those in the other group. Notice that other potential explanations for the change in the performance of the first group, such as injury and disease, must first be ruled out, with additional control groups if necessary; furthermore, if behavioral change does not occur in the first group, it does not necessarily indicate the absence of learning — the subjects must be shown to be attending to input X. An everyday example: not buying flowers for a spouse on the occasion of a wedding anniversary can lead to unpleasant associated consequences, so buying flowers each year becomes something to remember. (Mercifully, some situations can yield single-trial learning!) One of the grand challenges of science is to understand the biological mechanisms that support memory. This issue contains an expansive purview of the biology of memory. Coverage includes a broad range of phyla and species — from bacteria (Escherichia coli) to plants (Arabidopsis) to animals, including invertebrates — Drosophila, stink bugs, wasps, and ants — and vertebrates — mice, rats, monkeys and people; of biological levels of analyses — gene regulation, signal transduction, cellular/synaptic changes, formation of neural networks (biological and synthetic) and alterations in regional brain activity; and of embodiment — bacteria encoding changes in their biochemical environment [1Stock J.B.

Raulet D.H. Evidence for natural killer cell memory.Curr. Biol. 2013; 23: R817-R820Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar], and, of course, information storage by central nervous systems. Moreover, the issue illustrates the striking convergence of knowledge about fundamental cognitive processes in human and nonhuman animals that has taken place during the past four decades. This convergence should facilitate the development of animal models of memory that can help to solve fundamental mysteries about the biology of memory. Ultimately, our ability to harness the full potential of such animal models rests on the rock of evolution, the certain knowledge that the brain, not excepting the human brain, evolved, just as did our other organs. Progress toward understanding the biology of memory can be aided by first disentangling some basic distinctions. One classic distinction is that of learning and performance. Many factors may influence performance on a test, including some of the same factors that influence learning. A common solution to this classic problem is to vary the inputs at the early time point and employ a common test to assess learning. Performance factors are equated by employing the common test, so it is a safe bet to attribute differences in performance on the test to the learning that occurred in consequence to the different inputs. Another common distinction is between learning and memory. Learning is the process of acquiring new information, whereas memory involves retaining specific information over a delay. Interestingly, although this distinction appears to be graded, mechanistically, in central nervous systems, Stock and Zhang [1Stock J.B. Zhang S. The biochemistry of memory.Curr. Biol. 2013; 23: R741-R745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar] provide evidence that learning and memory are molecularly separate processes in bacteria. This raises the intriguing question of the functional purpose underlying the evolution of graded learning and memory processes in nervous systems. Memory comes in many forms. Early approaches to the study of memory focused on retention of information that was about fixed elements. For example, learning that element X is associated with element Y represents a classic form of learning. The classic approach continues to draw interest. Nevertheless, newer approaches focus on item-specific memory. For example, a series of items may be presented sequentially or simultaneously, followed by a delay and a subsequent assessment of memory for any item in the series. A central question in the biology of memory is the extent to which underlying mechanisms are shared across species. The answer to this question appears to be that, to a remarkable degree, the basic molecular and cellular mechanisms of memory have been conserved during evolution. A fascinating example of such conservation is described by Song et al. [2Song J. Irwin J. Dean C. Remembering the prolonged cold of winter.Curr. Biol. 2013; 23: R807-R811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar] in their review on vernalization, a memory-like phenomenon observed in plants in which exposure of a plant to prolonged cold accelerates its flowering during its subsequent exposure to warm conditions, for example during the spring. Vernalization in the plant Arabidopsis thaliana is accomplished via modulation of the expression of the floral repressor gene FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC). During a cold period, the expression of FLC is gradually downregulated via epigenetic repression, and this repression persists when the plants are returned to warmer temperatures. Interestingly, with longer periods of cold, the epigenetic repressive changes in the FLC chromatin progressively accumulate, so that, during a subsequent period of warmer temperatures, flowering in the plants is accelerated, and this acceleration is quantitatively proportional to the accumulation of the epigenetic changes. Song et al. [2Song J. Irwin J. Dean C. Remembering the prolonged cold of winter.Curr. Biol. 2013; 23: R807-R811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar] point out that the specific mechanisms that underlie vernalization in Arabidopsis have parallels in Drosophila and mammals, and speculate that accumulation of epigenetic memory may play a general role in memory. Given the increasing appreciation of the importance of epigenetic mechanisms in memory formation and maintenance in animals, this idea is likely to be correct. Another striking example of conservation of memory mechanisms is the ubiquity of N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors in the animal kingdom. The major candidate for a synaptic mechanism of learning and memory in mammals is long-term potentiation (LTP), which is mediated by activation of postsynaptic NMDA receptors (see [5Abel T. Havekes R. Saletin J.M. Walker M.P. Sleep, plasticity and memory from molecules to whole-brain networks.Curr. Biol. 2013; 23: R774-R788Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar]). However, NMDA receptors are not unique to mammals; the nervous systems in animals ranging from nematode worms to slugs to flies to fish all possess NMDA receptors, and non-mammalian animals also exhibit NMDA receptor-dependent forms of learning and memory [6Glanzman D.L. Common mechanisms of synaptic plasticity in vertebrates and invertebrates.Curr. Biol. 2010; 20: R31-R36Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar]. Whereas all animals appear to share a common cell biology of memory, the extent to which basic mnemonic processes that underlie memory are shared among widely diverse species is uncertain. The phenomenon of memory consolidation illustrates this point. Consolidation of memory in the mammalian brain occurs on two levels, the cellular/synaptic level and the systems level [7Frankland P.W. Bontempi B. The organization of recent and remote memories.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2005; 6: 119-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (1388) Google Scholar]. The mechanisms of cellular/synaptic level memory consolidation are fairly well understood; these include activation of various protein kinases or protein phosphatases, which in turn can trigger protein synthesis and gene transcription or repression. The molecular products of this protein synthesis and gene transcription/repression mediate the strengthening and growth, or the weakening and retraction, of synapses; the end result is the persistent modification of neural circuits in an animal’s nervous system that constitutes memory. The mechanisms of cellular/synaptic level consolidation appear to be universal among animals; for example, activation of the transcription factor cyclic AMP response element binding protein (CREB) is a necessary step in the cell/systems-level consolidation of many forms of invertebrate and vertebrate memory [8Kandel E.R. The molecular biology of memory: cAMP, PKA, CRE, CREB-1, CREB-2, and CPEB.Mol. Brain. 2012; 5–14: 14Crossref Scopus (604) Google Scholar]. As discussed by Preston and Eichenbaum [9Preston A.R. Eichenbaum H. Interplay of hippocampus and prefrontal cortex in memory.Curr. Biol. 2013; 23: R764-R773Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (770) Google Scholar], however, the consolidation of some memories in the mammalian brain involves, in addition, a time-dependent transfer of information from one brain region, the hippocampus, to another, the medial prefrontal cortex. The functional reason for this information transfer is unclear, as is whether the transfer is permanent, as proposed by some [7Frankland P.W. Bontempi B. The organization of recent and remote memories.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2005; 6: 119-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (1388) Google Scholar], or, whether instead, as Preston and Eichenbaum [9Preston A.R. Eichenbaum H. Interplay of hippocampus and prefrontal cortex in memory.Curr. Biol. 2013; 23: R764-R773Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (770) Google Scholar] argue, memories can reside permanently in both regions, thereby allowing the two memory representations to interact under some circumstances. The purpose of this post-learning interaction between the hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex, according to Preston and Eichenbaum [9Preston A.R. Eichenbaum H. Interplay of hippocampus and prefrontal cortex in memory.Curr. Biol. 2013; 23: R764-R773Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (770) Google Scholar], is the formation of memory ‘schemas’, which give an animal the ability, for example, to resolve conflicts between new events and old memories. Regardless, at present the evidence for systems level consolidation in invertebrate memory is sparse (but see [10Perisse E. Burke C. Huetteroth W. Waddell S. Shocking revelations and saccharin sweetness in the study of Drosophila olfactory memory.Curr. Biol. 2013; 23: R752-R763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar]). Another potential disjunction between vertebrate and invertebrate mnemonic processes concerns the role of sleep in memory consolidation. As reviewed by Abel and colleagues [5Abel T. Havekes R. Saletin J.M. Walker M.P. Sleep, plasticity and memory from molecules to whole-brain networks.Curr. Biol. 2013; 23: R774-R788Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar], sleep is critical for the consolidation of many forms of memory in mammals. Strikingly, electrophysiological recordings from single ‘place cell’ neurons in the hippocampus of rats during a spatial learning experience and during non-REM sleep immediately after such learning have shown that the neurons exhibit similar patterns of firing during learning and sleep. This finding has led to the idea that learning-induced patterns of hippocampal activity are ‘replayed’ during non-REM sleep and that this hippocampal reactivation plays a role in memory consolidation. (Replay of learning-related neuronal activity during sleep has also been reported for vocal learning in songbirds [11Shank S.S. Margoliash D. Sleep and sensorimotor integration during early vocal learning in a songbird.Nature. 2009; 458: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar].) Whether a similar process occurs in invertebrates is not known. Sleep-like behavior has been observed in invertebrates, particularly Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila. Moreover, sleep has recently been reported to be crucial for a form of one-day memory in the fly. However, the reactivation of specific patterns of learning-induced neural activity during sleep has not yet been documented in an invertebrate. Also, the evidence for the presence of a sleep state in some invertebrates that are unambiguously capable of learning, such as mollusks, is equivocal. Besides its intrinsic intellectual fascination, the issue of how evolutionarily conserved are the neural processes of memory is interesting to neurobiologists for two other major reasons, one practical, the other ethical. Neurobiologists tend to be reductionistic in their approach to behavior and cognition. If it can be shown that a neurobiologically simple, experimentally tractable organism, such as C. elegans, exhibits the identical form of memory — say, habituation — as a monkey, most neurobiologists interested in that form of memory would probably choose to work on the simpler animal. (Simpler animals also tend to be cheaper, a not inconsequential advantage in these times of reduced extramural funding for research.) With respect to ethical considerations, it is difficult to justify taking the life of a monkey or a mouse if one can use a snail, for example, to study a given memory-related phenomenon. Many types of higher order learning and memory can only be studied in mammals, however, and in some cases, perhaps, only in humans. Thus, Collett et al. [12Collett M. Chittka L. Collett T.S. Spatial memory in insect navigation.Curr. Biol. 2013; 23: R789-R800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar] conclude that insects do not use cognitive maps, despite the impressive displays of spatial navigation by some insect species. By contrast, Templer and Hampton [13Templer V.L. Hampton R.R. Episodic memory in nonhuman animals.Curr. Biol. 2013; 23: R801-R806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar] review evidence that critical elements of episodic memory, the memory system that stores unique personal past experiences, are shared by humans and nonhumans such as rats and monkeys. The development of convincing animal models of episodic memory is valuable; from the perspective of an experimental neurobiologist, humans are perhaps the least attractive of all subjects, both because of the unsurpassed complexity of their brains and because of the relative crudeness of the experimental tools available for studying human brains. (Despite these significant scientific impediments, some of the most important intellectual advances in understanding memory (e.g., [14Scoville W.B. Milner B. Loss of recent memory after bilateral hippocampal lesions.J. Neurol. Neurosurg. Psych. 1957; 20: 11Crossref PubMed Scopus (4885) Google Scholar]) have come from studies of people.) Development of valid animal models of memory is important because such models have significant potential for translational research to improve outcomes, for example, the impairments in memory that occur as we age and as a consequence of disease. A range of amnesic syndromes in humans include prominent deficits in episodic memory. People with Alzheimer’s disease (AD), for example, exhibit profound impairments in episodic memory. Eventually and inevitably, patients suffering from AD experience a profound loss of cognitive function, including the inability to recognize even close friends and family members. In addition to AD, episodic memory is also impaired in a range of disorders, including frontal lobe lesions, Huntington’s disease, mild cognitive impairment, normal aging, schizophrenia, and stroke. The societal impact of memory disorders is staggering. In addition to the enormous personal and emotional costs such disorders incur, they cost the US economy approximately $200 billion annually [15(2012). Alzheimer's Association. (2012 Alzheimer's Disease Facts and Figures. Chicago).Google Scholar]. The financial and societal consequences of memory impairment disorders are expected to increase as the population of elderly increases. At present, there are approximately 5.4 million Americans with AD; an estimated 6.7 million will have the disease by 2025 and 11–16 million by 2050 [15(2012). Alzheimer's Association. (2012 Alzheimer's Disease Facts and Figures. Chicago).Google Scholar]. A better understanding of mechanisms of memory and memory impairments may ultimately reduce both escalating health care costs and unnecessary suffering in AD. Notice that even small improvements in retention of cognitive function can have enormous impacts on wellbeing, social engagement, and productivity by decreasing healthcare and long-term care costs. Most research using animal models of AD assesses only general aspects of learning and memory, and thus the translational relevance to episodic memory impairments in AD is uncertain. This is a significant and widespread problem because a variety of approaches to modeling AD have appeared promising at early stages of preclinical testing, only to fail in subsequent clinical trials [16Kimmelman J. London A.J. Predicting harms and benefits in translational trials: ethics, evidence, and uncertainty.PLoS Med. 2011; 8: e1001010Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar]. For example, at least 20 compounds have provided preliminary evidence for benefits in AD preclinical studies and phase II clinical trials, yet failed to show consistent success in phase III clinical trials, which occurs in 40–50% of tested compounds. Recent examples include drug candidates that have failed for lack of efficacy at phase II (AZD-103, bapineuzumab) and at phase III (atorvastatin, phenserine, rosiglitiazone, tarenflurbil, tramiprostate) clinical trials. This problem is further compounded because unsuccessful preclinical and clinical trials are often not published. Importantly, our understanding of the molecular underpinnings of AD, for example, has greatly outpaced our ability to model the types of cognitive impairments observed clinically. The ability to translate successfully from animals to humans will be improved by development of approaches that include modeling of the specific memory impairments observed in clinical populations rather than general memory assessments (for example, spatial memory) that are not specifically impaired in AD. In addition to impairments of memory due to molecular abnormalities — such as the amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles of AD — and brain injury, people suffer from disorders, particularly posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and drug addiction, that are caused by abnormal hyperactivation of memory-related processes. Two recent developments in our understanding of the mechanisms of memory maintenance hold particular promise for the treatment of PTSD and other disorders of overstimulated memory. The first, described in the primer of Alberini and LeDoux [17Alberini C.M. LeDoux J.E. Memory reconsolidation.Curr. Biol. 2013; 23: R746-R750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar], is the recognition that reactivation of a consolidated memory by a stimulus that reminds the animal of the original learning experience (this is typically the conditioned stimulus in a classical conditioning paradigm) can trigger a new round of consolidation (‘reconsolidation’); reactivation-induced reconsolidation of a memory depends on many of the same processes, particularly protein synthesis, that are required for original consolidation of the memory. (However, the mechanisms of original consolidation and reconsolidation differ in certain respects.) The evidence indicates that when memories undergo successful reconsolidation, they become strengthened. Conversely, if reconsolidation is disrupted (through, for example, administering a protein synthesis inhibitor to an animal soon after a reminder stimulus), the memory is weakened or eliminated entirely. Thus, consolidated memories are not unchanging as previously believed; rather, they are dynamic and potentially quite labile. The function of reconsolidation appears to be to provide the ability to respond flexibly to an ever-changing environment; reconsolidation permits an organism to update its memories, either strengthening or weakening them, without having to undergo re-exposure to the original learning situation. The recent discovery (or more correctly, re-discovery) of reconsolidation has led to an attempt to put reconsolidative processes to clinical use to treat PTSD. Two drugs that have been used on human patients in reconsolidation protocols in attempts to weaken traumatic memories are propranolol, a β-adrenergic receptor antagonist (noradrenaline has been implicated in memory reconsolidation in rats) and rapamycin (or sirolimus), an inhibitor of protein synthesis. Unfortunately, neither pharmacological intervention has proved successful, perhaps because highly traumatic events may have consequences in humans that are not mimicked in laboratory studies of rats and mice. A second major advance in our knowledge of memory maintenance, not represented in the present issue, has been evidence that a constitutively active isoform of protein kinase C (PKC) known as PKMζ may play a critical role in maintaining memories. PKMζ mRNA is formed from alternative splicing of the gene for the atypical PKCζ; the PKMζ mRNA is then transported to dendrites, where it can be locally translated by learning-related synaptic stimulation, particularly stimulation that induces LTP [18Sacktor T.C. How does PKMζ maintain long-term memory?.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2011; 12: 9-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar]. The PKMζ protein lacks a regulatory domain and so its activity normally cannot be inhibited (hence its attraction as a memory maintenance molecule); however, pharmacological inhibitors of PKMζ are available. Many studies have now shown that inhibition of PKMζ appears to erase consolidated memories, as well as established LTP [18Sacktor T.C. How does PKMζ maintain long-term memory?.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2011; 12: 9-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar]. But not all forms of consolidated memories are susceptible to disruption by inhibition of PKMζ [19Glanzman D.L. PKM and the maintenance of memory.F1000 Biol. Rep. 2013; 5Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar]. Furthermore, the specificity of the inhibitors that have been used to block the activity of PKMζ has recently been questioned (discussed in [19Glanzman D.L. PKM and the maintenance of memory.F1000 Biol. Rep. 2013; 5Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar]). Finally, at present there is no way to ensure the precision of the memory-weakening actions of PKMζ; in principal, non-traumatic and traumatic memories would be erased indiscriminately by inhibiting PKMζ’s activity in the brain. These facts suggest that manipulation of the activity of PKMζ is unlikely to prove clinically useful in the near future. The grand challenge to understand the biological mechanisms that support memory is unfolding during a golden age of neuroscience research. One prospect for the future is the goal of integrating a deep understanding of biological mechanisms with sophisticated models of human cognition. For example, there is growing evidence that specific aspects of human memory can be modeled in non-human animals, including such processes as episodic memory, declarative memory, and prospective memory (‘remembering to remember’). Combining these approaches with new insights about the biology of memory has the potential not only to illuminate some profound mysteries of the mind, but also to advance translational research that may ultimately foster the development of therapeutic approaches to severe human cognitive disorders [20Crystal J.D. Animal models of human cognition.in: Vonk J. Shackelford T. Oxford Handbook of Comparative Evolutionary Psychology. Oxford University Press, Oxford2012: 261-270Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar]. Another reason for optimism is the rapid progress in experimental methodologies available for studying memory. For example, optogenetic tools now permit the targeted expression of calcium indicators, or light-gated ion channels, neurotransmitter receptors and ion pumps, in specific types of neurons; investigators can thereby optically monitor, or remotely manipulate, the activity of the neurons in intact animals while the animals are actually learning or recalling a learned experience (see for example [10Perisse E. Burke C. Huetteroth W. Waddell S. Shocking revelations and saccharin sweetness in the study of Drosophila olfactory memory.Curr. Biol. 2013; 23: R752-R763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar]). These and other developments point to a bright future for research into how brains store and retrieve information about the past.",

This we all know, and we hold also that verbatim use of another's words without setting them off in double quotes is an act of fraudmisrepresenting another's property as one's own ... plagiarism. Further, this account explains how strips of words can be said to reflect a particular point of view or ideological bias. It is the speaker, not the words, that has the point of view; the poor words are innocent (the basis of the judge's decision in the Star Wars case)-innocent as units in the linguistic system, but sometimes laden with ideological force or value by being used by a human actor in a particular discursive situation.",

Some answer Yes, on the ground that evolutionary continuities linking humans with other animals must include psychological ones. But (1) evolution does not operate—even primarily—by means of continuities. Thus species, no matter how closely related (in fact, sometimes even conspecifics) operate with very different adaptive 'tricks'; and it is plausible to think these, rather than the physiological 'groundings' underlying them, are the best means of (analogies for) explaining beliefs. Also (2) it is reasonable to assimilate most cases 'down' to creatures (e.g. flies) that obviously lack beliefs rather than 'up' to others (chimpanzees) that apparently possess belief‐like states (proto‐beliefs), because observation shows the internal workings of such middle animals' 'beliefs' differ markedly from the corresponding things humans do. For example, ducks do not have beliefs about the numbers of objects, because although they estimate numerically, they do it in a way that is much more firmly connected to perceiving than would be the case either with counting or a counting‐like process.",

Most definitions of ‘obsolescence’ in fact refer to evaluations of inanimate physical phenomena within a dynamic context, not to human behaviour as such.

      "title": "Words' connotations and semantic construals",
      "abstract": "Within a semantic approach to different aspects of language experience language phenomena need to be revealed in their significance. In particular, what should be clarified is\r\nthe common sign-structures of things and words at three different levels: of theoretical form, of actual existence and of socio-cultural values. This will help overcome the main referential illusion of dealing with “existent objects” irrelevant to their significance, or the sign-valued understanding. Respectively, the illusionary semantic study of word-meanings irrespective of\r\ntheir anthropological, social and psychological value-connotations would be avoided. The claim in this paper is that in human experience we have access to actual objects via sensations of physical, material character but we perceive or apprehend these objects as signs.\r\nWithout being a sign, an object is not recognizable, nor communicable or understandable. This means that to become a sign, every single object has to identify some other object or any object like it, or be understood as presented in its specific features in an actual act of communication of any form. Such objects are predicative signs of speech or thought. A thing obtains its reality as an object on the level of cultural values or social functions as a sign-type\r\nwith its own name, meaning and connotations. These connotations as values of meanings (or of values) govern the dynamics of object and word-transformations. As a result of a connotative analysis of word semantics, it may be possible to clarify the general types of word meaning:\r\niconic-metaphorical, object-symbolical and symbolic-allegorical. Finally, it is necessary to extract the main semantic features (or marks), understood as named substantiated qualities like soundness, lightness (darkness), substantiality, formality, corporeality, humanity, etc. in their construal function as words’ iconic etymons. On these grounds – on the grounds of\r\nsign-words’ meanings – it is possible to build lexico-semantic architectonic categorization and systematization of words’ meanings in order to establish a lexico-grammatical system of language and to understand lexico-semantic development of values, transformations of\r\nmeanings and word-formation processes.",

But it is less clear how to ask the same question of a society. The question is muddied further by the fact that societies can change. A leopard can’t change its spots. But a society can become more or less productive in the organization of its economy, more or less equal in its distribution of opportunity, more or less democratic. This course provides an extended answer to the question of of a country the United States is. It also explores the implications of that answer for understanding, and making progress in solving, some of the social problems that confront America today. Our discussion revolves around five key values that most Americans believe our society should realize: \n1. Freedom: the idea, commonly thought to be the most essential to the American creed, that people should be able to live their lives, to the greatest degree possible, as they wish. This means people should be free from coercive restrictions imposed by others and, as much as possible, have the capacity to put their life plans into effect. \n2. Prosperity: the idea that an economy should generate a high standard of living for most people, not just a small privileged elite. \n3. Economic efficiency: the idea that the economy should generate rational outcomes, effectively balancing costs and benefits in the way resources are used.\n4. Fairness: the idea that people should be treated justly and that they should have equal opportunity to make something of their lives without unfair privileges and unfair disadvantages.\n5. Democracy: the idea that our public decisions should reflect the collective will of equal citizens, not of powerful and privileged elites.",

      "abstract": "This chapter focuses on one of Lord Hoffmann’s concerns, responsibility for harm to others. I start from the principle that human beings, like other living creatures, are responsible for the misfortunes that befall them. We all have to cope with what happens to us, and hence to bear the risk of events that befall us. These include such misfortunes as ill-health, loss of property or employment, the death of friends or relatives and similar mishaps. Our need to adapt to risk is a natural form of responsibility, since life rests on the pursuit of continuity by survival or reproduction. This ‘having to cope’ burden is pre-legal. On the other hand we are not normally responsible for the misfortunes that befall others. So our responsibility to others for misfortunes that befall them, when it exists, involves a transfer of this pre-legal burden from the person who suffers the misfortune to another. I then discuss the two main ways in which this transfer, in my view, comes about. The person held responsible for another’s misfortune has either (i) brought about or helped to bring about the event for which he is held responsible, or (ii) bears the risk of having to cope with or answer for that event.",

Similarly, it would have been interesting to see when anger expressions were judged to arise in relation to heightened behavior rate in the extinction period. In closing, I return to my cat. If she is looking for evidence of intention, then I would say she could benefit greatly by studying Lewis's theory of intentional levels. As we consider her, or any other intentional system, as itself possibly examining intentions in others, we may ask when and how it comes to do that. Following his second principle of social cognition (Lewis & Brooks-Gunn, 1979, p. 231), I expect Lewis would predict that young children's awareness of intention in others arises as they become aware of intentions in. themselves.",

      "abstract": "Different Paradigms of Software Agents Applied to Modeling and Simulation of Complex Social Systems Marco Remondino (remond@di.unito.it) Department of Computer Science, 185 C.so Svizzera Torino, 10149 - Italy part on some environment. Each senses its environment and act autonomously upon it. No other entity is required to feed it input, or to interpret and use its output. Each acts in pursuit of it's own agenda, whether satisfying evolved drives as in humans and animals, or pursuing goals designed in by some other agent, as in software agents. (Artificial life agents may be of either variety.) Each acts so that its current actions may effect its later sensing, that is its actions effect its environment. Finally, each acts continually over some period of time. A software agent, once invoked, typically runs until it decides not to. An artificial life agent often runs until it's eaten or otherwise dies. Of course, some human can pull the plug, but not always. Mobile agents on the Internet may be beyond calling back by the user. These requirements constitute for sure the essence of being an agent, hence the definition by Franklin and Graesser (1997): “An autonomous agent is a system situated within and a part of an environment that senses that environment and acts on it, over time, in pursuit of its own agenda and so as to effect what it senses in the future”. And the very general, yet comprehensive one by Jennings (1996): “…the term is usually applied to describe self- contained programs which can control their own actions based on their perceptions of their operating environment”. Abstract The term agent, deriving from the Latin “agens”, identifies someone (or something) who acts; the same word can also be used to define a mean through which some action is made or caused. The term is used in many different fields and disciplines, such as economics, physics, natural sciences, sociology and many others. In computer science, the word is used to define very heterogeneous entities and sometimes is even abused. The main purpose of this work is to investigate various kinds of software agents that could be applied to modeling and simulation of complex social systems. Introduction The concept of software agent originates in the early fifties with J. McCarthy, while the term has been coined by O.G. Selfridge some years later, when both of them were working at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Their original project was to build a system which, given a goal, could be able to accomplish it, looking for human help in case of lack of necessary information. In practice, an agent was considered a software robot that lives and acts in a virtual world. In (Wooldridge and Jennings 1995): ... a hardware or (more usually) software-based computer system that enjoys the following properties: • autonomy: they operate without the intervention of humans or others, and can control their actions; A Simple Taxonomy • social ability: agents interact with other agents (and possibly humans) via some kind of language; Agents themselves have traditionally been categorized into one of the following types (Woolridge and Jennings, 1995): • reactivity: agents perceive their environment and respond in a timely fashion to changes that occur in it; • Reactive • pro-activeness: agents do not simply act in response to their environment, they are able to exhibit goal-directed behavior by taking the initiative. Franklin and Graesser (1997) also try to find the typical features of agency, deriving them from the word itself: an “agent” is 1) one who acts, or who can act, and 2) one who acts in place of another with his permission. Since one who acts in place of acts, the second usage requires the first. Humans act, as do most other animals. Also, some autonomous mobile robots act, for example Brooks' Herbert (Brooks 1990; Franklin 1995). All of these are real world agents. Software agents live in computer operating systems, databases, networks, MUDs, etc. Finally, artificial life agents live in artificial environments on a computer screen or in its memory (Langton 1989, Franklin 1995). Each is situated in, and is a • Deliberative • Hybrid When designing any agent based (AB) system, it’s important to determine how sophisticated the agents' reasoning will be. Reactive agents simply retrieve pre-set behaviors similar to reflexes without maintaining any internal state. On the other hand, deliberative agents behave more like they are thinking, by searching through a space of behaviors, maintaining internal state, and predicting the effects of actions. Although the line between reactive and deliberative agents can be somewhat blurry, an agent with no internal state is certainly reactive, and one which bases its actions on the predicted actions of other agents is deliberative. In Mataric (1995) we read that reactive agents maintain no internal model of how to predict future states of the world. They choose actions by using the current world",

One of the most obvious adaptive uses of that peripersonal space is self-protection. It is a safety buffer zone, and intrusions can trigger a suite of protective behaviours. Perhaps less obvious is the possible relationship between that complex protective mechanism and social signalling. Standing tall, cringing, power poses and handshakes, even coquettish tilts of the head that expose the neck, may all relate in some manner to that safety buffer, signalling to others that one’s protective mechanisms are heightened (when anxious) or reduced (when confident). Here I propose that some of our most fundamental human emotional expressions such as smiling, laughing, and crying may also have a specific evolutionary relationship to the buffer zone around the body, deriving ultimately from the reflexive actions that protect us.",

For example, when I kick a rock, I do not do anything wrong, nor is the rock wronged. On the other hand, if I kicked an innocent child, I do something wrong, but more importantly I wrong the child. I argue that sentience (the capacity to feel pleasure and pain) and rational autonomy (the conscious capacity to self-govern) are both individually sufficient for moral standing and disjunctively necessary for moral standing. I argue against a variety of alternative positions such as consciousness (the capacity to have any experience such as the color blue), biological life, and dispositional agency, in order to strengthen my position. Moral status refers to the set of normative features governing the way we treat those with moral standing. When it comes to moral status regarding moral patients, I argue that they have at least two kinds of basic moral interests which are based on their wellbeing and their autonomy. I argue in favor of a hierarchical system of moral status whereby moral patients and agents possess higher, weaker, or equal moral status based on their capacities. I conclude by arguing that we may have impersonal obligations (moral obligations owed to no moral patient) towards the environment because the natural environment may be a possible source of beauty. Thus, our moral obligation would be to beauty rather than the environment itself.",

These are cases where the possibility of a certain autonomy in the child was not built: the certificate of disability denotes this. In this state of things, the patient requires a permanent dependence on the other, often the State, through state or private institutions. All this leads us to think, as a hypothesis, in the incidence of the variables of the present time on what we place as a precarization in the construction of subjectivity in the cases described.",

A difficult complicated birth is, not only for the mother but for the child as well, a marked interference with the normal course of life; that, under certain circumstances, not only enduring physical but also psychic effects may be its result seems quite possible.

For some, violence must include some measure of physical force or destruction. For others, limiting the expression of violence to the physical may itself be an enactment of violence. Thus, we now hear about discursive or representational violence, and, as we saw in connection with animal experimentation and endangered species, physical violence may be encouraged precisely through the denial that it even counts as violence. Violence is a problem and violence is a solution. Violence is, as we know, even the solution to the problem of violence. And while we argue about its limits, its causes and cures, its pleasures and uses, we are commonly aided by a rough but durable taxonomy in which conceptions of nature play a fundamental role. When we consider violence in general or in regard to specific events, when we want to explain or assess it and gauge our response to it we work with a fundamental distinction between natural and human violence.",

      "abstract": "This article tries to test some of the categories of Julián Marías’ metaphysical anthropology to analyze mobbing from the vital reason, that reason that is not mere theory but life itself. Marías proposes vital reason as the method of development of his metaphysical anthropology, in order to respond to each of the situations we face in life; even more specifically, to know what to expect when faced with a new circumstance or chance. Because normally we live, we rest, we are established on beliefs or certainties that we assume from our past experience dragged into the current present. But faced with a new chance, or a change in the circumstances that surround us, we have to stop and think; to be able to establish, welcome or assume, after the reasoning done in life and from life, some new beliefs from which to continue living. On the other hand, the installation is like a vector, it points to the future, to the plans or projects that we see that we have to undertake, especially those that are part of our personal vocation. Mobbing is an attack on our personal vocation because it makes our vector installation falter, so our reflection through vital reason must be extremely deep, to know what to expect: to display the new certainties on which to settle when we have been victims of mobbing and our old certainties no longer exist.",

      "abstract": "In this study, we dealt with the axiological dimension of the alienation phenomenon.According to this, it is understood that axiological alienation arises from the deviations or contradictions taken place between human and his historical existence.Here, the human transfers his essence to the acts he has produced, with the material or spiritual reasons, and becomes an objective element or elements by externalizing through them.With the introduction of these produced objective elements into circulation to meet the needs or desires of the external world, the existential integrity between the essence and the actions is disrupted, and the man feels alien to his externalized essence.Because, here people are respected for the sake of these acts, not because of themselves.Because what matters is not the human himself, but the external equivalent of the acts he produces.Naturally, this situation causes the human to lose his position of being a goal and becomes instrumental for someone else or other things.This situation, which starts in the acts and spreads to the whole spiritual body, leads to a decrease or develuation of human ontologically as well as axiologically.For this reason, the maintenance of the integrity between human and his historical existence is crucial.This will be possible by placing the spatial relationship/balance between the essence and acts on a right and solid ground.This will come true by accepting that human is an aim in himself, not a means for anything material or spiritual, such as religion, culture, history or tradition, including his own actions.",

      "title": "New Age hiedelmek cyber-köntösben: az energiavámpír",
      "abstract": "In this presentation I try to trace the ways and processes how entirely new supernatural beings emerge, and function and at the same time, how old notions gain new interpretations in current popular belief in Hungary. Post New Age discourses on physical and mental health / healing, namely the so-called energy-healing methods form the broader context of my examination. The extremely popular methods of energy-healing are based on three major 'theoretical' principles: 1) in each creature of the universe there exists a certain inner energy of cosmic (or divine) origin; 2) this cosmic energy is in constant flow, since each creature is able to absorb it from and then recycle it into the environment; 3) the fundamental cause of any kind of mental or physical illnesses is the disturbance of acquiring and / or utilizing this energy. Within the above mentioned discourses there exists a psychologising quasi-theory, called ' energy-vampirism', which seems to be a rather effective tool in explaining certain forms and patterns of human behaviour, or special situations or conditions in everyday life (including also illnesses, personal conflicts, etc.). Developing the basic ideas of energy-healing, energyvampirism considers the exchange of energies as ultimate goal of social communication. Furthermore, it differentiates between three types of human behaviour on the basis of energycycling and recycling abilities: 1) energy-supportive, 2) energy-consuming; 3) and neutral (from this 'energetic' point of view) types. Since the shortage of energy may lead to serious mental and physical symptoms, one spontaneously strives against it. There is a strange creature constantly referred in this situation: the energy-vampire, which is charged for blocking the flow of cosmic life-energy. According to relevant narratives energy-vampires are malevolent demonic beings, which possess humans occasionally and like parasites devour their life-energies causing serious illnesses. Its supernatural, non-human characteristics are supported by further synonyms, like 'being', 'astral-body', 'demon', 'üdére', 'spirit'. Not only in the semantic field, but also in the context of beliefs energy-vampires are strongly resembling of certain supernatural beings of traditional Hungarian folk belief, like the above mentioned 'üdére', the devil, the witch, and the malevolent Dead. Merging the characteristics of traditional supernatural beings with post New Age ideas, the figure of the energy-vampire is a typical creature of current popular belief.",

      "abstract": "Relational goods contribute to understanding why people engage in collective action, notably including political participation, even though, as Olson showed, it would often be more rational for them to free-ride on the activity of others. Relational goods are neither public goods nor private goods but a third type of good. They must be jointly consumed with another person or persons (unlike private goods), but the identity of the other persons matters crucially (unlike the case for public goods). Relational goods can only exist by mutual agreement as part of a relationship with non-arbitrary others, in the context of an interaction. Friendship is a prototypical example. Relational goods can exist along a range of personal contact from direct, where individuals interact face to face, to indirect, where the interaction may be at a distance with a certain type of person. In the indirect case the relational good may frequently take the form of reinforcing a desired social identity. The distinction between “consumption” and “instrumental” goods applies, parallel with other usage. The consumption relational goods are produced independent of any consequences of the action or relationship, while the instrumental ones refl ect consequences, such as from an action that enhances the value of an identity. People who value relational goods may act collectively even if other net benefi ts of action are negative. Larger groups become more, not less, prone to collective activity. Relational goods provide a missing element to understand how the process of mobilization works at the individual level; leaders can infl uence people’s perceptions of what others are doing, of the value of a shared identity, and of the likelihood of success. Some limited empirical evidence is consistent with relational goods playing a role in enhancing collective action.",

      "abstract": "<title>Abstract</title> Many philosophers and psychologists have made claims about the feelings in an experience of beauty. Here, we test how well these claims match the feelings that people report while looking at an image or listening to music that is beautiful to them, or recalling a personal experience of beauty. We conducted ten experiments (total n = 851) spanning three nations (US, UK, and India). Across nations and modalities, we find that top-rated beauty experiences are strongly characterized by six dimensions: intense pleasure, an impression of universality, the wish to continue the experience, perceived harmony in variety, exceeding expectation, and meaningfulness. Other frequently proposed beauty characteristics — like surprise, desire to understand, and mind wandering — are uncorrelated with feeling beauty. When explicitly asked, participants in all countries report that beauty is closely related to pleasure, found in nature rather than art, influenced by mood, and a form of communication. A remembered beautiful experience was typically active and social, like a family holiday, quite unlike the passive solitary appraisal of art emphasized in aesthetics. Our data align well with Kant (r = 0.74) and psychological theories that emphasize pleasure, and reject theories that emphasize information seeking. These six dimensions characterizing how individuals feel beauty emerge from the reports of hundreds of people seeing, hearing, or remembering something beautiful to them.",

      "title": "The ‘learning everything from others’ thesis",
      "abstract": "One of the key arguments advanced by situationalists stresses how the meaning which informs the actions of individuals either derives from knowledge which is ‘learnt from’ or ‘acquired via interaction with’ other people, or alternatively constructed employing abilities which have themselves been acquired in this way. A claim which is seen as sufficient grounds for declaring such understandings and therefore any associated action to be ‘social’ in character. This assumption has become so widespread and taken-for-granted by situationalists that it is routinely made en passant in discussions without any attempt to justify it. Thus in the passage from Totman quoted above he states that the gardener's knowledge is ‘passed through the community’, when in reality much of it could have been acquired from books or through experience. There are several different versions of this argument depending on what exactly it is presumed that individuals learn from others in this way. At one extreme all that is stressed is denotative meaning or simply the names for people, objects and events, whilst at the other it is the whole body of discursive and non-discursive knowledge which it is assumed is transmitted in this fashion. One commonly encounters the view that everything necessary for the individual to engage in successful action in the world is effectively ‘socially derived’ and ‘language carried’, which is to say it is acquired from others. In so far as the argument stresses the acquisition of general abilities rather than knowledge itself, then those most commonly identified tend to be the possession of a self and hence the ability to be reflexive, as well, of course, as the ability to use language.",

There are diff erent ways and levels by which anxiety aff ects the individual, in its most diverse areas, such as: personal, family and social. A very common cause among anxiety disorder suff erers is the inability to cope with chaos, suff ering or any manifestation of what has been called evil. Theodicy is concerned with working on the attributes of God and his relationship to existence and the problem of evil. In fact, one of the anxieties that affl ict the human being is the complexity of the origin, existence, advancement and the most diff erent materializations of evil. The complexity in relating the goodness and the power of God with the existence and reality of evil, has plagued many people, but it has also motivated theological and philosophical thinkers to work on elaborations around this problem, however, very few have reached the level of contribution in this. area like Augustine of Hippo, who lived in the fourth century and who has been considered one of the greatest collaborators in the development of Christianity.The purpose of this text is to presente a refl ection on a possible contribution of the theological-philosophical elaboration of this Catholic bishop on the problem of evil to those who suff er from anxiety disorder, such as the unfolding of the inability to deal with the most varied forms of suff ering.",

      "title": "An ethics of composure",
      "abstract": "To reiterate: neither methodologically nor ontologically does an anthropology of ethics have its ground in the individual. The population of its interpretive universe is instead one of subjects in or passing through positions in environments. It is thus a population not of atomic units but of complex relata. Its subjects are for their part already highly complex. They may be individual human beings (though never human beings in their pure individuality). They may be the individualized subjects of the formally egalitarian society; Homines hierarchici, the holistic dividuals of the caste-structured social system (Daniel 1984; Dumont 1980, 1986); the relationalist subjects that Robbins and many others have encountered in Melanesia (Robbins 2004: 13). They may be human collectives, or even human and non-human collectives or assemblages of one or another kind. Nothing in principle precludes the possibility of a cyborgic ethics, an ethics of quasi-objects (Latour 1993), an ethics of corporations of an economic or of some other sort. The only proviso is that the subject occupying or passing through its position in an environment be at or beyond the threshold of the complexity requisite of any system capable of autopoiesis, though such a requirement is never the sufficient condition of an ethical subject position, even a potentially ethical one. Individual human beings typically display such complexity, yet do so only after a considerable course of socialization has taken place, only after a considerable dose of the intersubjective has already been incorporated, already become part of the self (and hence are never individuals in their pure individuality).",

      "title": "Dealing with Danger: The Practices of Keeping and Discarding Magical Letters",
      "abstract": "Disposing of a piece of paper with a textual apotropaios might be even more problematic than storing or sharing it. A perfect example is a type of amulet named “heavenly letters”, “luck letters” or “chain letters”. Such a letter is often framed by its owner as an object or sacred/magic artifact which can act and produce non-beneficial effect on its own, without any human agency: one does not necessarily need to read or otherwise handle a luck letter to receive bad luck, while to receive good luck certain actions must be undertaken. Most often bad luck or a curse affects those who ignore or neglect a luck letter, and some of the later examples of this genre define at length different punishments for those who tear it or throw it away. Finding themselves in this situation, people turn to contemporary traditions of discarding sacred or malign artifacts. However, people often choose an intermediate strategy of giving a letter away, taking it to a specialist or discreetly passing it to a neighbor. The latter case is considered a malign magical activity. The intertwining between a luck letter as an autonomous force with a potential negative effect, “lay” senders and receivers and “specialists”, all bound together with the problem of discarding a magical object forms a complex and dynamic network of actors.",

      "abstract": "Mead considers that the data for solving the problems of social psychology were to be found in the conduct and experience of men rather than in the behavior of lower animals or in the facts of physiology. The ongoing social process was his starting-point, and man was assumed to be a part of nature, entirely and without residue. In the analysis of conscious reflective action he found use for all the psychological concepts. The social nature of man was assumed, and the self is shown to have its origin in communication which leads in man to self-stimulation and self-response and the taking of the role of the other. Personality is a role in a social situation. Every self is in a social context. Auditory gestures are of first importance in self-stimulation; and when one becomes his own object, he achieves selfhood. The conception of the self is therefore dependent on the defining responses of others, which responses are abstracted into a \"generalized other.\" Significant symbols, used with a consciousness of their meaning, occur only in man. Besides numerous original concepts which Mead proposed, he also gave new definition to many already familiar notions, such as imagination, perception, and attention, by relating them to action, either as phases of the act or determined by it. In his doctrine of \"the I and the me,\" he found for himself an escape from a mechanistic view of human nature and a fresh defense of responsibility and freedom.",

      "title": "Stranger Anxiety: When Children Face Strangers",
      "abstract": "Till about seven months, the baby mostly flees from contact with strangers, often avoiding eye-contact without the parent’s awareness. A reaction of resistance and anxiety when approached by a stranger is commonly seen around eight months. In this paper I explore this emotional responding in the context of a novel re-conceptualization of healthy narcissism processing as an emotional immune system. Whereas recent discussions in the literature have focused on the anxiety reaction, I propose that key to understanding this commonplace phenomenon is the understanding of how healthy narcissism works to safeguard that which is familiar and resist that which is strange. The operation of these psychic processes may be likened to those of the biological immune system, which safeguard the familiar codes of the body and repel alien invaders. In safeguarding that which is familiar and repelling the alien, healthy narcissism operates as an emotional immune system. It is promoted by good-enough attachments (object relations) characterized by our being loved the way we are (true self), in separateness and not according to someone else’s blueprint (false self), one that risks invading our familiar self. The more we are loved for who we truly are, our self-integrity is more immune to invaders, and throughout our lifespan, we are more immune to alien influences, and to the incursions of others’ hurtful words and deeds. Healthy narcissism is thus understood as providing, from birth, emotional immunity to our sense of self-familiarity. We come to recognize ourselves and the partners of our various relationships via continually being alerted to and subsequently resisting or rejecting strangers/strangeness (i.e., invaders), and by gradually tolerating and even befriending the otherness. Befriending is possible when we are able to discover some familiarity embedded within the stranger. The appearance of eight-month resistance/anxiety, a normal alertness to strangers, signals that the baby has a rudimentary sense of both self and object constancy and is able to differentiate between his familiar “not-I,” such as the parent/caregiver whom he experiences as familiar and is attached to, and the unfamiliar “not-I” stranger. The parent/caregiver is then experienced as a bridge between that which is familiar and that which is strange and anxiety-provoking/overwhelming. Parents’ reactions to the “not-I” (of their baby) can help the infant differentiate between a “not-I” he might befriend, and one that is best avoided. The normal emotional immune reaction reflects a good-enough balance between preserving the familiar and true self, and befriending the otherness, to which one remains appropriately but not excessively alert.",

      "abstract": "The classical Simon effect shows that actions are carried out faster if they spatially correspond to the stimulus signaling them. Recent studies revealed that this is the case even when the two actions are carried out by different people; this finding has been taken to imply that task representations are socially shared. In work described here, we found that the \"interactive\" Simon effect occurs only if actor and coactor are involved in a positive relationship (induced by a friendly-acting, cooperative confederate), but not if they are involved in a negative relationship (induced by an intimidating, competitive confederate). This result suggests that agents can represent self-generated and other-generated actions separately, but tend to relate or integrate these representations if the personal relationship between self and other has a positive valence.",

      "abstract": "Behaviour sequences commonly consist of highly variable appetitive phases leading to rather fixed consummatory acts. Action-pattern rigidity is typical of the terminal moments of a reaction chain. This basic fact is all too often obscured by the artificial conditions of behaviour studies. Observations on laboratory or captive animals tend to conceal the degree of variability of the earlier phases of each sequence. The simplicity and sterility of the unnatural environment offered to the animal causes differential damage to its motoric performance, attacking the early stages more and the later stages less. A caged animal will feed, drink, nest and copulate, but it cannot set off on lengthy quests for food, water, nest material or a mate. Notorious laboratory devices such as the Skinner-box have served to eliminate totally any possibility for motoric variability. The emphasis in laboratory studies of this kind has been steadfastly concentrated on the variability in the relationship between simple stimuli and an artificially rigidified response. Although the study of this (SR) relationship is an important aspect of animal psychology, it is extremely misleading to overstress its importance as has been done so often in the past. To equate it with the whole topic of animal behaviour is like claiming that the gaming rooms of Las Vegas reflect the whole of human endeavour.",

But since some face-to-face groups are not primary groups (e.g., formal institutions) and since some primary groups are not face-to-face (e.g., a widely scattered kinship group), the spatial contiguity is not essential. Temporal priority is not essential, since many primary groups are formed by adults. These are accidents, the essence of the primary group being the relation which corresponds to ideas, images, and feelings of a specific and easily identified character. A family is a primary group only if these relations exist. Discipline in school and home may follow institutional forms or primary group patterns, but the family is not a primary group merely because of a common dwelling. The essence of the primary group is its functional and emotional character. Temporal priority and spatial contiguity are accidents.",

This study investigated the differences between how United States participants (N = 610) experience interpersonal gratitude and spiritual gratitude. Compared to interpersonal gratitude, spiritual gratitude experiences were less often attributed to human action, more often attributed to supernatural beings and circumstances beyond human control, and elicited significantly less feelings of gratitude, indebtedness, and admiration, but greater awe. Participants reported the highest feelings of gratitude when they also believed in a personal God with a benevolent mind. These findings demonstrate the importance of perceiving benevolent agency in evoking feelings of gratitude, whereas experiences that are attributed to more abstract, less personified, or less external entities elicit a different profile of positive emotional responses.",

People have to go beyond the information given in order to arrive at a social judgment. In this sense, social perception is an active and constructive process of the perceiver. Not surprisingly, then, the same social situation or the same person may be “perceived” quite differently by different perceivers, or by the same perceiver in different situational contexts.",

On this basis luck lies beyond anyone's rational control. With risk ( R ) as the probability of failure in a chancy situation and the stake ( S ) as the difference between a favorable and an unfavorable outcome, luck ( L ) can be measured as the product of these quantities: L = R × S .

      "abstract": "Abstract Bodily action other than speech that is recognized as being done in order to express something. It is considered separate from emotional expression and separate from other bodily actions such as tics, mannerisms, and nervous movements. These expressions and actions may be very revealing of a person’s current level of physiological arousal, emotional state, unconscious motives, social class, or cultural background, but to the extent that they are thought not to be under voluntary control, they are not regarded as gesture. The topic of gesture includes bodily movements that occur in close association with speech (gesticulation); expressive movements that can be used independently of speech and can serve as complete utterances on their own, such as the thumb up gesture, the shoulder-shrug, or shaking of the fist (autonomous gesture); gestural codes used in certain occupational circumstances in which speech is difficult or impossible, primary sign languages used in communities of the deaf, alternate sign languages used in some tribal and religious communities during periods when speech is forbidden, and the special elaboration of gesture found in religious RITUAL, as in the complex systems of mudras developed as part of the ritual of prayer in Tantric Buddhism; and the complex gestural systems found in some DANCE traditions, especially in India.",

      "abstract": "Today, it is no longer a surprise that 20th century was dominated by mass culture, somehow associated with illusion of individual's freedom, with maintaining his impression that he has not lost his distinctive feature from other people. Although, at a first glance, focusing on leveling and affirmation of individualism may appear contradictory concepts, power of first one and utopia of second one get on together fairly well and for a long time. The condition of history may seem a serious matter only for one who pays too much attention human values, spirituality by which, as it is said, a person goes beyond any other form of life. Such a man is confused and disappointed in finding out how one who should like him becomes more and more opposite a subject, a weak self and unaware of real conditions of his existence, who wanders about without stability, without an aim, without specific features.1Quite often, a man has come identify himself with an image. He forgets that life means also privacy, that real way of living implies privacy. He has transformed himself into somebody placed under curious eye of public, used being somebody only in service of this public. Thus, his desire remain alone with himself diminishes and profound beliefs of existence do not tell him too much. The real individual neglects fact that, finally, each person has accept himself, with beauties he nourishes and with his personal frustrations, make peace with himself after having made his own choices, with meanness and goodness he transmits. Nobody can escape from himself, no matter how unconsciously and deeply absorbed he may by his image, by his celebrity. There will come, without doubt, some sporadic moments become conscious, draw balance sheet of regrets, remorse, joys, fulfillment etc.I come back say that everything that is most precious in a man's life are singular beliefs, values nourished and private experiences. To be and to have. To be is linked privacy and quality, to refers public space and quantity. Celebrity could understood as a to which replaces to be. Quite often, a person does not know any more that he has become an image, that he fails live in favour of mimicking living. Existence should placed under a question mark when the outside has tendency replace inside, when privacy of spirit with itself is no longer a need or has changed into something unknown, when, from point of view of value, there is no distinction between quality and quantity, when hollow individual is cultivated and not person, a substantial existence which takes care of spirit.Celebrity is looked for, is desired, envied by others, it is a fashion of present time, although its greatest risk is miss really important things. Being concerned polish your own image, you forget that you take care of an image and that any image is a limitation spiritual power. The few ones who value profound ego of privacy, with its crucial, extreme experiences, for whom there is no distance between theory and practice, who make an effort live in agreement with what they are thinking, being perfectly aware that only in this way they are honest themselves and life given them, on other hand, they dedicate themselves a troublesome and continuous struggle.It is much harder your own person or dominated by understanding and mentality of masses than yourself, evaluate yourself consciously, endeavor with honesty improve your ego, simply follow your destiny according your own singular beliefs. Neither intelligence nor culture can relevantly serve you if you have not previously assumed freedom and courage yourself in spite of anything else.Nevertheless, tendency existing in society leveling people's tastes, sticking a certain fashion are in a close interdependence with creation of illusion of individual freedom2. …",

Individualism has, indeed, many spectral qualities: indeterminate shape, evocative power, and a myriad of other qualities attributed to it and which allow it to take many forms on a scale which ranges from benevolence to terror according to perceptions of it. Perhaps the most important quality ascribed to it when it appears (or reappears) is its power of annunciation: annunciation of historic changes which have taken place or are in the making, and which will shake the fragile foundations of our knowledge and our existence. Hence its incantatory use by visionaries, who are usually more concerned with invocation than with understanding. Conversely, it is the spectral quality ascribed to individualism which tempts many to refute it without due consideration or to reduce it to a ‘pre-notion’, or else to abandon it altogether to ideologues and (false) prophets.",

      "abstract": "WHAT, HOW AND WHY?In a world in which, as shown by today's networks of social and working relations, communication dominates and even determines the way in which we manage our personal lives, we find ourselves continually bombarded with more or less reliable messages that update us on the macroscopic and microscopic reality that surrounds us.In this context, news that claims to be \"absolutely true\" is often supported by data, or rather figures.This pattern is more evident when communication purports to become information: we are faced with mountains of figures, which certainly make the news more credible but unfortunately less understandable.In the field of scientific information, this method is a guarantee of quality since no phenomenon (whether presented as personal experience, reproduction or translation of the experiences of others, or evidence of the validity of these experiences) is considered worthy of attention unless it is somehow quantifiable.But what does it mean to measure a phenomenon?It doesn't take much for an experience (or experiment, if we want to remain close to the world of science) to be measurable: an object to be measured, a person to do the measuring, and an instrument through which to perform the measurement.It sounds easy put like that!In actual fact, this simple (or simplified) concept of \"measuring\" is riddled with pitfalls, especially when the action takes place in a field of investigation as variable, unstable and subjective as medicine.And naturally this includes orthopaedics.Let us consider, for example, the relationship between the subject doing the measuring and the object being measured.The interaction between these two elements becomes highly variable if they are both human beings subject to a vulnerability (and thus an instability) that is determined, for example, by expectations (personal and reciprocal), frustrations or discomforts that may be related to or independent of the phenomenon that is bringing them together in that specific circumstance.And what about the instrument used to do the measuring?We need to be certain that it really is able to measure, in the same way time after time, the phenomenon that we are investigating.Finally, we have to ask whether we can be sure that what we are seeking to measure really is measurable, or rather quantifiable.I could write reams about this, but fortunately there is already plenty of literature on this topic and excellent scholars, far more expert than me, who have made it their lives' work to try and clarify, predict and teach us how to limit the mistakes that can be made when measuring a phenomenon in medical research.Instead, I wish to draw the attention of our readers to three of the articles published in this issue of Joints, which are excellent examples of how to deal with the problem of measures in orthopaedics.The first, by Arrigoni et al., is a diagnostic study in which the biceps resisted flexion test (a new test for diagnosing long head of the biceps pathology) is described and analyzed for validity using the arthroscopic diagnosis as the gold standard.The second, by Blonna et al., analyses the validity and reliability of the SPORTS Score for shoulder instability in a cohort of athletes, using other validated outcome measures as reference standards.The third, by Boniforti et al., introduces an interesting and innovative measure of short-term outcome after total knee arthroplasty; using the EQ-5D-3L, a self-administered questionnaire, the authors analyzed patients' perceptions of their state of health during the first months following surgery.Works of this kind often provide interesting reading not just for their contribution to scientific literature, but also because they can provide an experimental model of reference that can be reproduced in future studies having similar objectives.I therefore advise the readers of Joints to approach the world of measures with interest and confidence, because it is one of challenge and never-ending discovery.",

      "title": "Constructing Abstract (Theoretical) Models of Actual (Material) Systems",
      "abstract": "The world around us is a global system, therefore, it can be said that all its elements are interconnected. The strength of the connections between the system’s elements and their groups is not uniform. In some cases, we can observe the links very clearly, in other cases, we assume that they exist, while, sometimes, we are not even aware of their existence. The existence of the connections of various strength shows that the particular elements are of different nature and possess some specific features and capacity allowing them to interact with others and form the particular structures when the same goal is pursued. These structures differ from others and make the systems of a particular level. Therefore, the elements relevant for the considered problem should be identified (or formed if an artificial system is considered). In other words, we should identify or form a system for solving an arising problem. Another important aspect of investigating an existing or specially formed system is associated with its reflection. To change or to manage a social economic system, for example, the state of an enterprise should be measured. This may be achieved only if all major aspects of its performance are described by the particular criteria. The values of the criteria allow us to plan the measures to be taken for improving enterprise performance. The analysis of the literature shows that we can hardly find a generally accepted concept and definition of the word ‘system’. However, a lot of various definitions are suggested. This may be explained by the fact that either various features of the system are emphasized, or not all relevant features are considered. In some cases, a definition includes too many features, often duplicating each other. Some researchers base themselves on a very wide ‘system’s’ definition, while others prefer a short one, embracing its essential features. Various approaches depend on the research objective, ‘system’s’ perception, and, finally, the researcher’s ability to see the essential features and understand the nature of the considered phenomenon. In terms of the research objective, investigators usually search for a versatile ‘system’s’ definition, while others prefer a short one, embracing its essential features. Various approaches depend on the research objective, ‘system’s’ perception, and, finally, on the researcher’s ability to see the essential features and understand the nature of the considered phenomenon. In terms of the research objective, investigators usually search for a versatile system’s definition suitable for studying any phenomenon at any investigation level. However, they also may try to find a multifunctional approach, giving the priority to general features of the system, rather than to its basic, principal characteristics, thereby restricting themselves to a ‘narrow’ definition suitable for solving a particular problem and achieving a particular goal. The latter approach makes sense only if it does not contradict a universal system’s concept and definition. This means that a universal concept and definition of the word ‘system’, which could be used as a basis for possible interpretations should be developed. The analysis of the available ‘system’s’ definitions allows us to suggest the following basic definition – a system is the structured whole of interacting elements. A basic category of the theory of systems is structure, which marks the beginning of system’s stabilization. However, we can see that a generally accepted definition of the concept ‘structure’ is also lacking. On the other hand, all definitions emphasize the same, probably, most essential, structure’s feature – the connections between the elements. In addition, the existence of the system and structure representing it is closely connected to the aim (purpose) of the system. It is the structure that orients the system to pursuing a particular aim. In mathematical terms, the establishing of invariable relations between the elements is necessary but insufficient for system formation. These relations should be properly directed, i.e. oriented to achieving the system’s aim. This may be obtained only by establishing hierarchical relations between the interacting elements, i.e. by structuring the elements according to the type of their subordination. It is the process of structuring of a set of interacting elements that gives them a particular orientation and turns them into a system. The analysis of various ‘structure’s’ definitions allows us to define it as a whole of constant relations between the elements oriented to achieving the system’s aim. Now, when the concepts of system and structure are clear, it is possible to investigate them. Classification, i.e. their subdivision into separate groups, is an efficient tool in this process. The analysis of the literature on the problem shows that, in various system’s classifications, various attributes are considered. For the case investigated in the present paper, system’s classification into actual (material) and theoretical (abstract) systems is relevant. The first class embraces the systems of organic and inorganic nature, while the second includes hypotheses, theories, formalized models, etc. In fact, the latter may be deduced from the former. Therefore, they are aimed at reflecting actual (material) systems. Thus, it may be stated that theoretical (abstract) systems are the models of actual (material) systems. - 8 - The following steps may be identified in the process of reflecting actual (material) systems by theoretical (abstract) models. First, the problem situation associated with the actual (material) system is described, then, the problem and the aim of its solution are stated. The existence of the reflected system’s problem situation, the problem and the aim of its solution determine the problem situation, the problem and the aim of the reflecting model.",

Barriers between people in general have two properties, namely objective and subjective.

      "abstract": "Talking to oneself is not heard by anyone but us. So many terms have been used to indicate “inner speech”: inner voice, self-talk, verbal thoughts, etc. This psychic phenomenon refers to the silent production of words in one’s mind. Inner speech plays a central role in human consciousness, providing guidance for the growth of the individual. Sharing Vygotsky’s ideas, a central aspect of his theorizing is that inner speech is developmentally the internalisation of the external dialogues between children and their parents or other caregivers. This process follows four stages of internalization: external dialogue (level 1), private speech (level 2), expanded inner speech (level 3), condensed inner speech (level 4). Children’s private speech represents, indeed, a waystation on the developmental path between external and inner speech. Thus, the socio-cultural tool or symbol system of language, first used for interpersonal communication, is used by the child overtly not for communication with others but for intrapersonal communication and self-guidance. A monitoring deficit in inner speech may result in auditory verbal hallucinations (AVH), have in common neurobiological correlates. History and art have shown for a long time the power of this phenomenon as a guide for creativity and growth of society.",

      "abstract": "In this paper I propose to examine the cognitive status of mystical experience. There are, I think, (at least) three distinct but overlapping sorts of religious experience. (1) In the first place, there are two kinds of mystical experience. The extrovertive or nature mystic (in some sense) identifies himself with a world which is both transfigured and one. The introvertive mystic withdraws from the world and, after stripping the mind of concepts and images, experiences union with something which (in some respects at least) can be described as an undifferentiated unity. Introvertive mysticism is a more important phenomenon than extrovertive mysticism. (2) Numinous experiences are complex experiences involving dread, awe, wonder, and fascination. One (apparently) finds oneself confronted with something which is radically unlike ordinary objects. Before its overwhelming majesty and power, one is nothing but dust and ashes. In contrasting oneself with its uncanny beauty and goodness, one experiences one's own uncleanness and ugliness. (3) The experiences bound up with the devotional life of the ordinary believer (gratitude, love, trust, filial fear, etc.) are also religious in character. Nevertheless these more ordinary experiences should, I think, be distinguished both from numinous experiences and from mystical experiences, for they do not appear to involve the sense of immediate presence which characterises the latter.",

Two of these conceptions are open to scrutiny. One, called restrict conception, can be thought of as coincident with the concept of forecast and/or prediction traditionally followed by the classical paradigm of physical/quasi-physical sciences. The other, named the widen conception, is prominently social and psychological and, to a great extent, its features are quite distinct from those the restrict conception is usually endowed with. For instance, it entails both several pasts and various futures, futures which, in turn, may retrospectively act upon such pasts, giving rise to different presents, etc. The host of manifold problems that these features beget are analysed in detail and a possible unifying model that connects private times with social/cultural times and these with physical time is proposed.",

Apart from these, even the case of action that seems self-destructive in its result need not be considered a failure of control. Of course, there are gamblers who lose, criminals who get caught, and addicts and drinkers who ruin their lives. They are people, often demoralized people, for whom talk of transcendence or delay of gratification is meaningless and for whom therefore the immediate relief or the short-term gain is what counts. In any case, it is a mistake to imagine, when we talk of so-called self-destructive action, that short-term gains and longterm consequences are always calculated. They are not. In fact, such calculations are often avoided: A few drinks, an abruptness of action with a quick completion, a rationalization that emphasizes the single and relatively safe instance of a general and risky pattern-all these diminish one's sensation of making a risky choice. They are ways in which people (some people particularly but all of us sometimes) can avoid asking themselves questions to which, they dimly suspect, the answers will be unpleasant.",

The purpose of this study is to discuss and compare similarities and differences between Quran’s and forensics’ perspective in terms of death.Methods: The present study is carried out by library studies on multiple interpretations of Quran, interpretation of juridical references and comparing them with current forensics knowledge.Results: Holy Quran has mentioned different types of death: 1- certain death: death is inevitable; 2- Suspended death: occurrence of death is conditioned; 3- Optional death: optionally giving up on deeds, properties and void thoughts; 4- Ambiguous death. On the other hand, different types of death from the perspective of forensics include: 1- Apparent death: a state in which breathing and functions of the heart are slowed down; 2- Cellular death: certain and imminent death; 3- Somatic death: irreparable loss of cognitive potency which is in fact the same as Brain death; 4- Instant death: roughly instantaneous deterioration of the entire cells. From the view of forensics, manners of death are divided into two groups including natural death and unnatural death. The latter includes committing suicide, killing and accidents.Conclusion: Quran is the equivalent of Natural death in forensics. In addition, the equivalent of Suspended death in forensics is death resulted by illnesses, accidents and incidents which may appear as certain death or brain death.",

As painful as the feelings of remorse are, they may be sought or clung to as a defense against having to give up the Other, who, via incorporative processes, may be unconsciously experienced as part of the self. Painful memories and affects may serve to ward off the feelings of abject emptiness that would otherwise be experienced, especially with persons whose sense of self is highly dependent on a stable relationship with an Other.

Whereas, for Durkheim, we begin life in a simple state of sameness and we \ngrow into increasingly complex states of otherness, for Tarde we begin as we finish, as we \nlive, that is, different, since “difference keeps differencing” (“la difference va differant”; \nTarde 1999a: 69), since difference is something that has the unique capacity to take itself \nas a target or as an object of change. This point is crucial, directly affecting the ways each \nthinker has chosen to define society and to practice sociology, the former arguing that \nthe social is a special – that is to say, transcendent – domain, the latter that the social is \nimmanent to relations of association. As Tarde claims, “those final elements at which all \nsciences arrive, the social individual, the living cell, the chemical atom, were final only to \nthe eyes of their particular science; even themselves are composites” (Tarde 1999a: 36). \nAgainst those who take for granted the identity of the collective or the composition of the \nsocial – as Durkheim did for example in his Suicide – Tarde argues that we must follow the \nassociations, the movements of composition themselves.",

      "title": "Pain Transduction: Gating and Modulation of Ion Channels",
      "abstract": "The sensation of pain informs us that potentially or actually damaging stimuli (noxious stimuli) are impinging on our bodies. All animals, and even many single-celled organisms that could scarcely be dignified by the name animal, show some form of avoidance reaction in response to noxious stimuli. Pain has therefore been a feature of many forms of life since early in evolution, and we would expect pain to be a highly evolved and complex sensation, responsive to a multitude of harmful stimuli, either those present in the external environment or those generated within the organism itself. The word \"pain\" causes some difficulties because it covers a multitude of quite separate concepts. Pain refers to the processes involved in detection of the physical effects of an injury (e.g. the pain of a fracture); to the perceptual and emotional reaction to an injury (the \"feeling\" of pain); and to similar sensations experienced in response to a purely emotional event (e.g. the pain of parting). Sherrington, in 1906, removed the emotional connotations of the word \"pain\" from the physical process of detection of a painful stimulus by coining the word \"nociceptor\" (a receptor for noxious stimuli) to refer to those primary sensory neurons that are activated by stimuli that we would regard as painful. The existence of nociceptors as a separate class of sensory neurons was doubted for many years, and it was proposed instead that the sensation of pain could result from the strong stimulation of sensory receptors responsible for detecting nonpainful stimuli, an idea which was given support by the discovery of second-order neurons in the deeper layers of the dorsal horn of the spinal cord which respond to a wide range of stimuli, both nonnoxious and noxious. However, Ed Perl in 1969 recorded directly from primary afferent nerve fibers and was able to demonstrate clearly that a separate class of primary sensory afferents responding only to high-threshold stimulation did indeed exist and had properties quite distinct from those of receptors responding to nonnoxious stimulation. Thus, the existence of a distinct class of nociceptive neurons, as postulated by Sherrington, was finally confirmed. Nociceptors, like all somatic sensory neurons, are \"long\" neurons in which the sensory terminal must be depolarized and action potentials elicited in order to communicate to the distant central synaptic terminals. The generator current activated in nociceptive nerve terminals by all noxious stimuli must therefore be inward, as it is in all somatic sensory neurons. In many other respects, however, nociceptive neurons differ from other sensory neurons, although most of the functional differences are readily explicable in terms of the tasks that nociceptors are designed to carry out. Most obviously, a painful stimulus is, almost by definition, large in magnitude, so the cellular amplification pathways that form a prominent part of (for instance) olfactory and visual sensory transduction are not often seen in nociceptive transduction—most stimuli, in fact, act directly to gate an ion channel. Our current understanding of ion channels important in nociception is discussed below. Secondly, while most sensory receptors respond with exquisite sensitivity to only a single sensory modality (for instance, a narrow band of wavelengths of light in the case of visual receptors), nociceptors are typically polymodal, responding to a wide range of stimuli, which may include strong mechanical stimuli, heat, extreme cold, and a range of noxious chemical stimuli. Polymodal behavior makes sense in the context of pain, where the organism will be more concerned with detecting a noxious stimulus and taking appropriate avoiding action, rather than with analyzing the precise nature of the stimulus. Finally, in all other sensory receptors, adaptation is seen in response to the maintained presentation of a stimulus, a property that enables the receptors to operate over a wide range of stimulus intensities. The response of nociceptors, in contrast, typically increases, or sensitizes, in response to a prolonged or intense stimulus, a property that ensures that a noxious stimulus is not ignored by the organism. Our current understanding of the molecular basis of sensitization is discussed below.",

      "title": "Dismantling Lock-ins and Tragedies of the Commons",
      "abstract": "Most of us are affected by “thought models” that lock us into mindsets and behaviors that create inertia for change. We may remain for long periods of time in this state without any need for significant changes. But the lock-in can become a threat to the individual, the organization or the society that is locked-in when the context in which one “operates” changes faster than one can unlock. The inertia to change inhibits sufficiently rapid adaptation. From an evolutionary perspective, such inhibitions can be life-threatening. Many examples can be given where individuals, companies and societies die off because of inabilities to adapt caused by lock-ins in mental models unsuitable for the contextual changes they experience (cf. Diamond, 2006). This lock-in effect may be one important explanation for why society, despite our knowledge regarding human-caused environmental degradation, climate change and the extinction rate of other life forms, seems so reluctant to do something about it. It may also be one important explanation for why companies seem reluctant to change their product offerings despite the insight that those who do – in directions that solve the environmental challenges in ways appreciated and valued by their customers – will experience “one of the biggest business opportunities in the history of commerce” (Hart and Milstein, 1999:25). Lock-in can appear at all three system levels of society: the individual level, the organizational level and the societal level. Each of these three levels’ lock-ins pose threats and opportunities for the entrepreneur. This article tries to dismantle these lock-ins and the tragedies of the commons that seem to be consequences of these lock-ins. The focus is the entrepreneur and it is discussed how the threats can be addressed and opportunities exploited in ways that will benefit the entrepreneur’s business.",

Whether voluntarily or involuntarily acquired, abominations of the body can be regarded as a form of deviance.

Everything about the stigmatized person is interpreted in light of the negative trait, so that interaction with the nonstigmatized is often awkward and uncertain.

      "abstract": "Abstract Human identity is a complex process linked to the subject and his environment, both constantly evolving. Personality is developed and changed throughout lifetime, but it has a core that remains constant. Thus a person can secure his continuity; he recognizes himself and is recognized by the others as time goes by. In fact, we are all the same, even after experiencing changes and years later. The constitution of the other and the self are – from the phenomenological point of view – two components of the same process, which is the origin of the subjectivity of self and the objectivity of me. These are conditions for the identity’s construction, a continuous process that takes place throughout time. (Ballerini, 2005) Human tendency to the community emerges with priority from the above definition. That deep desire of being part of a social group interprets others as constituent of the identity of the self. (Pulcini, 2002) “Having an identity” actually means not only a set of characteristics noticed by ourselves after actions done or the “image” of us, but also to be recognized by the rest of society. (Andrea, 2004) Therefore, community turns out in the ultimate horizon that responds to an individual’s recognition need. The recognition of self by me is linked to the issue of the recognition of self through the other until mutual recognition as reciprocal act is reached. (Ricoeur, 2005) Hence, “gift” becomes an emblem of mutual recognition, highlighting the relational and inter-subjective structure of the person. The identity development goes through the mutual recognition experience and gift. (Castiglioni, 2008) Somebody who gives himself recognizes the others and simultaneously, participates in his constitution and his self-understanding.",

Or we might begin with a notion of or motive for history or, more precisely, for doing or writing (a) history or histories (as opposed of course to History with a capital H, History proper, the \"true whole\" story and nothing else) of, specifically, rhetoric. 1 Or we might begin with a notion of subjectivity, of who this we is that concerns itself with this writing activity. Or we might focus on the writing itself, asking the question What is writing? or Who can do it? or What can it do? or What is it about? all of which may be much like answering or debating similar questions frequently asked about/of/through rhetoric. Indeed, rhetoric and writing, rhetoric and discourse, tend to be confused, or ecstatically intermingled, terms.",

The starting hypothesis of our study focused on identifying the existence/absence of a causality connection between the lifestyle of the communities in the upper basin of the Moldavian Bistrita (Vatra Dornei town and other ten rural areas) and their health state. If we can’t control the release of a storm, drought, landslide, volcano eruption, tsunami, etc., we can’t say the same thing about our decisions regarding nutrition, weight control and maintenance, physical and psychical hygiene, the quality of interpersonal relationships, continuous self-development, the attitude towards stressful events, etc., aspects upon which we can fortunately interfere. Our case study confirms once again that the healthy persons’ lifestyle is significantly different from that of a person suffering from different medical affections.",

The “hidden” influences come from the brain and nervous system, hormones, the activity of genes, and the like, which operate beneath the skin. None of these influences, including the environmental ones, are primary or act independently; they are all necessary and thus “coact” in a systemic way to produce developmental outcomes.

      "title": "Estrés y burnout. Efectos en la organización",
      "abstract": "espanolLa organizacion se conforma de recursos humanos, materiales y financieros. La base principal de la empresa son las personas, mismas que coordinadas entre si y a partir de ciertas estructuras permiten la funcionalidad del ente, visto de esta manera son las personas las que se encargan de lograr el buen desarrollo de la entidad. Por ello, deben atenderse los estados psicologicos por los que atraviesa el miembro de la organizacion, que se manifiestan en fenomenos como el estres y el burnout. Estres y Burnout no deben confundirse, el primero es la reaccion fisica que se tiene ante situaciones inesperadas; sin embargo, puede ser benefico si se visualiza como un instinto de supervivencia innato, debido a que el estres surge en momentos en que se deben vencer obstaculos que hacen sentir amenazada o comprometida a la persona. El estres puede originarse tambien por la necesidad de una persona de ser altamente productiva y en ese caso, si el individuo controla el estres adecuadamente, el efecto final sera benefico para la organizacion. Por otro lado, el Burnout se presenta como una enfermedad, se genera acompanado de varias sintomatologias, lo que le han dado el nombre de sindrome de burnout; en palabras de Maslach y Jackson (1981), es el agotamiento emocional, cinismo y baja realizacion personal que viven los profesionistas involucrados en ayudar a otras personas; aunque diversas investigaciones han determinado que esta enfermedad no aqueja solo a las profesiones asistenciales, sino tambien a aquellos que se relacionan con personas en otros ambitos laborales. El sindrome de burnout aqueja al ser humano que se siente rebasado y compromete el desempeno de la organizacion en su conjunto; de la misma forma, Veliz (2014) considera que la organizacion tambien se enferma y que presenta sintomas muy claros que no le permiten el crecimiento y el desarrollo. Por lo expuesto anteriormente, la finalidad del presente es analizar las diferencias entre estres y burnout para contextualizar el dano que se hace a la organizacion cuando se ignora el malestar individual. Ello a partir de un metodo deductivo y con un alcance descriptivo, toda vez que se busca especificar propiedades y caracteristicas importantes del fenomeno que se analiza respecto al estres y al burnout y su efecto en la organizacion, lo anterior apoyado en la tecnica documental. Los resultados permiten identificar lo siguiente: 1. Mediante la busqueda documental se observo una completa diferenciacion y conceptualizacion de los terminos que nos ocupan y se encontro que si tienen correlacion entre si, dado que el estres es el antecedente mas proximo del burnout y cabe aclarar que el antecedente mas proximo del estres es la ansiedad y 2. Se pueden identificar los alcances de no atender el malestar colectivo e individual de los integrantes de una organizacion, toda vez que, la identificacion del estres y burnout son pieza clave en el inicio del cambio organizacional. EnglishThe organization is made up of human, material and financial resources. The main base of the company is people, who coordinate with each other and from certain structures allow the functionality of the entity, consequently, it is the people who are in charge of achieving the good development of the organization. Therefore, the psychological states through which the member of the organization goes through, which manifest themselves in phenomena such as stress and burnout, must be addressed. Stress and Burnout should not be confused between these. The first one is the physical reaction when people have unexpected situations; nevertheless, it can be beneficial if it is viewed as an innate survival instin, due that stress arises at times when obstacles must be overcome that make the person feel threatened or committed. Stress can also originate from a person's need to be highly productive and in that case, if the individual controls stress, the end effect will be beneficial to the organization. In the other hand, Burnout is presented as a disease, it is generated accompanied by various symptoms, which have given it the name of burnout sindrome; in the words of Maslach and Jackson (1981), it is the emotional exhaustion, cynicism and low personal fulfillment experienced by professionals involved in helping other people; although various investigations have determined that this disease affects not only the peoplecare professions, but also those that are related to people in other work environments. The burnout syndrome afflicts the human who feels overwhelmed and compromises the performance of the organization as a whole. In the same way, Veliz (2014) considers that the organization also gets sick and that it presents very clear symptoms that do not allow it to grow and develop. Having mentioned the above, the proposal is to analyze the differences between stress and burnout to contextualize the damage done to the organization when individual discomfort is ignored. This from a deductive method and with a descriptive scope, since it seeks to specify important properties and characteristics of the phenomenon being analyzed regarding stress and burnout and their effect on the organization, the above supported by the documentary technique. The results allow to identify the following: 1.Through the documentary search, a complete differentiation and conceptualization of the terms that concern us was observed and it was found that they do correlate with each other, since stress is the closest antecedent to burnout and it should be clarified that the closest antecedent to stress it's anxiety and 2. The scope of not addressing the collective and individual discomfort of the members of an organization, all Once, the identification of stress and burnout are a key element in the beginning of organizational change.",

      "abstract": "Abstract To summarize, the first process of digestion and, thereby, of nutrition takes place in the The food mass is broken down into smaller parts by the mechanical action of the teeth to permit easier attack by the digestive juices, including the saliva. The act of chewing is part voluntary and part reflex. The person wills to chew, but the power of the chewing stroke is determined by neuromuscular tonus and the condition of the dental tissues. The pressure that is exerted and the extent of the chewing stroke is a reflex act determined by the character of the food bolus and the presence or the absence of dental pain or discomfort. If the first step in digestion, namely, the mechanical preparation of the bolus, is inadequate it is conceivable that the succeeding steps in digestion will suffer. The chewing of palatable food stimulates the flow of gastric juice. In the case of the aged, inadequate mechanical preparation of the food results from painful, nonfunctioning, or missing teeth, or from unsatisfactory dentures. When mechanical preparation is difficult or painful, the person begins to select foods to conserve effort or to diminish pain. By this pernicious process of self-selection he may gradually drift into the state of malnutrition. An opportunity is open for a piece of enterprising research on the application of gerontology to the dental problem. Without adequate nutrition the aged patient cannot long edure. Adequate nutrition is impossible in the face of disturbance along the digestive tract. The mouth is the beginning of the digestive system. Its structures and functions have long been neglected in the consideration of the nutritional problems of all ages. The French have told us that death enters through the mouth. We might likewise say that so, too, do life, and health, and long well-being.",

      "title": "A Biophysical Approach for Dealing with Somatization Disorders in Health Care the Cassel BioSensors",
      "abstract": "Psychological and social stressors are a recent element which we have learned often provoke our bodies into an accompanying uproar linked to mere thought (Sapolosky, 1994). That uproar in our bodies is directly associated with the principle of that serves to explain the typical functioning of a healthy body. Our bodies (digestive, circulatory and other body functions) seek to operate in such a manner as to maintain a sufficiency needed for a healthy life, and when that sufficiency is not being met there is disharmony created by feelings of unpleasantness which Festinger (1957) called dissonance, and that causes the individual to seek ways to receive such angry feelings. The Cassel Bio-Sensors is designed to assess both the degree and nature of disharmony present (Cassel, 1978; 1985; and 1987). Nature of Stressors A stressor then, is anything that disturbs the homeostasis of the well functioning body and where dissonance (feelings of unpleasantness) is the inciting force to restore harmony or homeostasis. A stressor is no longer limited to an absence of physical needs (hunger, injury, blood loss, temperature extremes, etc.), psychological needs (anxiety, neurosis, hostility, etc.), but also includes not achieving own personal psychological insults, but also in the expectation of them; so they may be real or imagined. Clearly, stressors are the principal inciting force that disturbs the homeostasis or harmony of our inner space (Cannon,1936). Nervous Systems An important part of our body that is always associated with harmony of the internal regions is the nervous system. It is comprised of two major parts that operate in opposition to each other. First, the parasympathetic nervous system is typically associated with our conscious brain and mediates calm vegetative activities. Second, the sympathetic nervous system is typically associated with emergency states (fight, flight, fright, and sex) and is largely unconscious in nature. Internal harmony exists only when the sympathetic nervous system is under voluntary control, and where personal goal setting and striving of the individual is the primary focus in life (Stryer, 1992; Weiner, 1992). Endocrine System Epinephrine (adrenaline is British term) secreted by the adrenal glands, is largely under control of the sympathetic nervous system, and is typically released in excessive quantities during the major vehicle creating the emergency state where normal functions cease, and the blood is sent to vital organs so individual is able to fight or fight or flight to survive. So, clearly, it is the presence of this emergency state, real or imagined, that typically causes disharmony in our inner states. Brain as an Endocrine Structure The more recent research describe how the brain is the master gland which exercises control over the pituitary gland which previously was considered to be the governor of other glands. It is now recognized that the base of the brain, the hypothalamus, contains a huge array of inhibiting hormones which instruct the pituitary gland that in turn regulates the secretion of the peripheral glands; some as releasers and others as inhibitors; so that the strict control of the reticular formation in one's limbic system no longer applies for such action (Sapolsky, 1994). Hostility and Heart Disease Recent studies suggest that floating hostility is directly associated with heart disease, anthersclerosis and high rates of mortality (Chesney, et. al., 1988). Blood pressure goes exceedingly high for people with floating hostility which typically involves cynical mistrust and repeated overt aggressiveness. Often such persons are likely to also be heavy smokers. Peptides and Neurotransmitters Of the nearly 100 peptides and neurotransmitters identified to date, at least four of them play a critical role in relation to harmony in our inner space through the cognitive element in feelings (Goldstein, 1990; and Burks, 1991). …",

This might seem a fairly unconventional view. Usually many other differences are underscored, for instance the role of individual freedom, the diversity and complexity of human behavior and so on. More specifically it is often stated that (i) social systems are inherently more complicated in the sense that societies comprise many different kinds of agents and interactions; (ii) physical phenomena can be observed in the laboratory through experiments which can be repeated whereas social observations, it is argued, cannot be repeated. We do not mean that these differences do not exist but we believe that they are not as fundamental as may be the impression at first sight.",

      "abstract": "Idiosyncrasies are the expression of abnormal mental or physical reaction towards “agents.” An attempt is made to indicate the position of idiosyncrasies in a classified scheme of all abnormalities; but bodily idiosyncrasies due to an “allergic” or hypersensitive response to agents are mainly considered in the present paper. Migraine and mucous colic (“colitis mucosa”) are discussed in connexion with Freeman's view of food idiosyncrasies, hay fever, asthma, urticaria, angioneurotic œdema, &amp;c., as manifestations of an “immunological abnormality or defect.” The hypothesis that idiosyncratic hypersensitiveness towards physical agents, such as light, heat, cold and mechanical trauma, may in reality be the expression of reaction towards a histamine-like body, or protein of some kind (virtually a “foreign protein”) liberated in the tissues by the physical agent in question, is referred to, according to the works of W. W. Duke and Sir Thomas Lewis and his co-workers, and the writings of Sir Humphry Rolleston on the subject. A somewhat analogous explanation is suggested for the following conditions: an abnormally hypersensitive (eczema-like) reaction towards formalin lotions; epidermolysis bullosa; constitutional factitious urticaria in otherwise healthy individuals not suffering from ordinary urticaria; excessive liability to chilblains; so-called “erythrocyanosis” of the lower parts of the legs in girls and young women, and some cases of Raynaud's disease. The significance of eosinophilia in cases of dermatitis herpetiformis and pemphigus is also alluded to.",

The flattening of a dog's ears means fear, the curl of his lip implies aggression. If a Gelada monkey lifts his eyebrows to reveal a yellow stripe, he is under threat. Animal signals are limited and inflexible, but they are precise and unlikely to be misconstrued (Ardrey 1970). The human animal is often unaware that his actions, gestures and expressions are telling their own clear story — they are the outward signals of inner attitudes and tensions. Man concentrates so hard on his words that he often seems to forget that the coded messages from his body can be either contradicting or confirming the words from his mouth. It is as if two languages are being spoken simultaneously: the familiar verbal messages and transmissions from the subconscious which are often visible rather than audible.

      "abstract": "In chapter 1 I argued that judgements of numerical persistence are imperatives, directing us to discover and draw inferences from causal patterns by which newly arriving accidental features will either lead to their own continued presence, or will give way to particular other accidental features, depending on the natural kind to which the persisting object (or portion of matter) belongs. Such causal patterns are clear enough that we can discover them, at least widely enough to have rendered it fruitful for us to heed the imperatives embodied in judgements of numerical persistence – widely enough, then, to have earned for those judgements a place in our conceptual/linguistic repertoire. Where such patterns obtain, they are grounded in the properties essential to the natural kind in question. Thus in treating judgements about an object's course of persistence as guiding us to such patterns, we are treating the events that may befall an object over its course of persistence as governed by the properties essential to the kind to which it belongs. In effect, then, we treat any course of persistence as delimited by some instance of kind-membership. We act as if any object (or sample of matter) can continue to exist only so long as it stays in its natural kind: we treat the conditions on kind-membership as being, at the same time, persistence conditions for the members of that kind.",

      "abstract": "<h3></h3> There is an appointed time for everything. A time to give birth and a time to die. <i>—Ecclesiastes 3:2</i> What a privilege it is to be able to touch those sacred spaces in the soul of each person in suffering that we encounter every day. Facing our own mortality while suffering a life-threatening illness might create a cascade of distressful physical, emotional, existential/spiritual and social suffering. Patients who express living with existential/spiritual distress might express a loss of the will to live or a loss of the meaning of their lives. They also express low life satisfaction and happiness; worse sleep quality; severe anxiety and depressed mood. At the same time, expressing spiritual struggles might be related to decrease physical functioning and worse survival. Those who express spiritual distress have significantly lower self-perceived religiosity and spiritual quality of life. With any rupture in the relationships that give us meaning or purpose, no matter the cause of the rupture, our humanity suffers; our soul breaks. It is extremely important for care providers to explore and evaluate that broken soul and try to identify factors from multiple domains that promote healing processes. Embracing the spiritual care into our daily practice is a common effort and a service provided by each member of the team. Our clinical encounters need to become spiritually informed with enough time and opportunity for reflection so that we are able to talk about illness trajectories, treatment, and medical decisions on the basis of personal values, self-worth, spiritual and religious beliefs, and spiritual and religious support systems, struggles and what gives the patients meaning and purpose. Our calling to help creating a healing environment for everybody—for patients and caregivers in suffering as well as for team members.

      "abstract": "Abstract My work as a general practitioner is based on an attempted articulation of clear distinctions between concepts of illness, disease and health (Heath 1995). Illness describes the patient ‘s subjective experience. It is the first vague feelings of something being not quite right and it is, and was always, the starting point of the whole end eavour of medicine. In illness, the body makes its presence felt in a way that does not happen in health. No one notices his or her throat until it is sore. Illness is necessarily lonely because no one can share the direct experience of a symptom, and almost all illness carries implicit fear of a diminished life or untimely death. Disease is quite different and is the stuff of biomedical science. It is a theoretical construct and the means by which humanity has tried to control and make sense of the experience of illness. Each disease is a reified abstraction developed by a process of describing patterns of both symptoms and physical signs, which different patients appear to have in common. As these patterns are refined, the patients come to be described as suffering from the same disease. Thus, bio- medical science is based on a series of relatively crude generalizations, which we recognize as diseases.",

      "abstract": "We can and do reflect in very general terms on human beings and their place in the world, and we do so for a number of reasons and in a variety of ways. We can notice similarities between human beings and other parts of nature, or differences between them and most other things, or even respects in which they are unique in the world as we know it. Human beings are born and grow and they decline and die. They are the only things in the universe who laugh. Human beings also act. Unlike rocks on a mountainside or branches of a tree, they do not just move, they do things. Other animals also do things, but humans differ from them in the extent to which they think about what to do, and then act as a result of that deliberation. And, not coincidentally, human beings also know things about the world around them. Knowledge is essential to deliberation and to informed action. No one would deny or question these sweeping platitudes about human beings and the human condition. It is equally uncontroversial that humans can become curious and reflect on some of these very general features of human life and try to understand them better. This could be called in the most general sense. Not simply the study of this or that group of human beings, or of this or that social or cultural arrangement among them, but anthropology as the study of human beings in general, or of apparently universal features of human beings or human life as such. If we take an interest in human action in general we might ask what it takes for an event or a movement to count as an action performed by an agent, and how such a thing is possible. The question can be found especially pressing once we acknowledge certain other general facts of the world and understand them in a certain way. Human agency must be understood as occur-",

One of the forms of simulation (or hide) is a lie when it is communicated orally. Words are the first to tempt him to lie man, language is the first human institution appeal - the lie - as stated C. Cucos (Cucos, 1997:20). Inextricably linked language document, purporting to be a lie concealed by a simple order information, language, that words themselves represent human infidelity to truth and the effort they are doing it to hide their feelings normal in view of P. Turchet (Turchet, 2005:25). Editing a lie requires a mature consciousness, symbolic thinking type, a subjective halving decentrare and development and clean language.The lies of the human being are often driven by language, since they are most economical. It is easier to hide or to hide behind words. Betray you more easily through mimicry or gestures. Our hands or face are more sincere, more transparent (Cucos, 1997:20). There is the possibility that people focus too much on deciphering and understanding nonverbal behavior of the party, neglecting thus his speech.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Chapter 2 makes the case that there is a pull toward explaining “evil” behavior in terms of an actor’s characteristics (internal attribution) rather than circumstances (external attribution) even if the actor is neither human nor visible (such as a demon). The characteristics of an evil person, neatly summarized in Baumeister’s “myth of pure evil,” include a presumably unchanging, unrelenting capacity to inflict unjustifiable harm. Consequently, evildoers—which, in the popular imagination, include evil spirits, perpetrators of satanic ritual abuse, and serial killers—pose the ultimate threat. People may therefore resort to extreme measures (like potentially lethal exorcism attempts) to resist, punish, or destroy them. Places and things, by virtue of their association with evildoers and/or their capacity to evoke raw negative feelings such as dread, can sometimes function as evil symbols.",

      "abstract": "This article approaches senses as physiological but culturally organised phenomena. It analyses archived Finnish and Sámi narratives, which interpret unusual sensory perceptions according to belief tradition. Supernormal interpretation is triggered not only by the exceptionality of the perception but also by circumstances. Collective belief tradition connects the supernormal to the margins of social everyday activity: to marginal times and places and to antisocial behaviour such as norm breaches. Perception often combines two or more senses but the existence of supernormal beings in this world is only partial: they are heard but not seen or seen but intangible. People sometimes discuss their unusual perceptions with others but the interpretation may remain open or contradictory. Descriptions of unusual sensations challenge our cultural division of senses to sight, hearing, taste, smell and touch. Yet they confirm that only those five are easy to verbalise. Internal sensations such as pain and pressure seem more difficult to explain. The experiences often mix mental and physical feelings and include inability to sense or act. Tradition offers a special vocabulary for certain states caused by supernormal beings. Those words cover the cause of the state but leave room for an individual variety of experience.",

So my “God does nothing” has a special sense (it does not deny that action can be ascribed to God). But what I intend in saying it is, I think, something of great importance when it comes to thinking about God in a sensible way. To grasp the point I want to make will save one from following all sorts of false trails when it comes to reflection on divinity. Let’s start with what is going on when you or I act. Examples of human actions could include opening a door, wiping one’s nose, making a telephone call, baking a cake, and waving goodbye to a friend. But what is common to these examples, and to others which might be mentioned? There is at least one thing common. For they all involve people going through a process. I open a door by reaching for the door handle and exerting a continued pressure on it. I wipe my nose by transporting with my hand an object to my nose and moving it about. I bake a cake by walking around a kitchen and following a recipe. I wave good-bye to a friend by lifting my arm and going through a waving motion.",

While mental health practitioners often focus on symptoms of psychological disorders such as depression, compulsion, lack of meaning/purpose (emptiness), phobias and fears, and adverse physiological functioning of sleeping, eating, elimination and sexual activity/experience, the fundamental complaint of clients and patients is an inability to enjoy their lives with a sense of well-being. This article will attempt to show that enjoyment, well-being, and the experience of pleasure however are not determined either by cognitive activity (state of mind), nor by physiological factors of nutrition, fitness, or dietary supplements. Rather, pleasure and fear are best understood energetically. As Wilhelm Reich pointed out nearly 100 years ago, and as incorporated in the somatic psychotherapy of Bioenergetics, and dance/movement therapy (DMT), fear produces contraction while pleasure produces expansion, psychically and physically. It is a simple intuitive fact with broad and deep implications yet is unaccepted in academic psychology.",

These inputs are processed and interpreted by the animal’s brain according to its species-specific and individual nature and experiences, and then are perceived consciously. That being said, for an animal to be able to perceive states that we believe would reflect its welfare, the animal must be alive and conscious, and it must also be sentient. Previous studies, which I cite and describe further later in this paper, show that the brains of animals, especially mammals, have enough complexity to process mental states. The mental abilities of an animal arise as a result of sensory and other neural inputs linked to nutritional, environmental, health and behavioral components of physical or functional abilities. They are also linked to cognitive-neural inputs and activity related to external challenge. All of these components are integrated and expressed mentally as varying degrees of thirst, hunger, weakness, debility, breathlessness, nausea, sickness, pain, distress, fear, anxiety, helplessness, boredom and so on.",

      "abstract": "According to Indian Vedic philosophy, a human being contains 3 major bodies: (1) the matter body--brain, organs, and senses; (2) the mental body--mind, individual consciousness, intellect, and ego; and (3) the soul or causal body--universal consciousness. The third, which is located in the heart according to all spiritual traditions and recent scientific literature, can be seen as the information body that contains all memories. The mental body, which can interface with the matter and information bodies, can be seen as a field of immaterial energy that can carry, regulate, and strengthen all information (eg, thoughts or emotions) both positively and negatively. This body of information may store ancestral and/or autobiographical memories: unconscious memories from inner traumas--inner information (Ii) or samskaras in Vedic philosophy--and conscious memories from outer traumas--outer information (Io). These conscious and unconscious memories can be seen as potential psychological stressors. Resonance between Ii and Io may induce active conflicts if resistance occurs in the mental body; this conflict may cause specific metabolic activity in the brain and a stress response in the physical body, which permits adjustment to psychological stressors. The brainregulated stress response may be biphasic: cell death or growth induced by adrenergic molecular pathways during the conflict's unresolved phase and reversion to cell growth or death induced by cholinergic molecular pathways during the conflict's resolved phase. Case studies and data mining from PubMed suggest that this concept complies with the principles of holistic medicine and the scientific literature supporting its benefits. We suggest that the evolution of cancer can be seen as a biphasic stress response regulated by the brain to adapt to psychological stressors, which produce imbalance among the physical, mental, and information bodies.",

It has a defined identity in which it starts its own coordinated gradual development. Therefore, it is not just a simple cluster of cells. Integrity or holistic properties of a new quality of cells that, as a whole, represent an early embryo, and in fact are not a cluster of pre-embryonic \"structural\" parts or a sum of cells etc. They have theirs own evolution, previously inherently encoded, but not precisely predestined. In other words, only autointegrity alone in evolution, inherence as a part of predetermination in evolution of embryo, is not able to exist as a unit \"alone\". Human foetus since the first moments of its existence goes through many qualitative (externally or internally determined) transformations before it becomes a respectable human being. It is possible to say that medicine, as many times before, is now coming to a stage when axiologic values, ethical directives or moral feelings of its subjects and human objects proved in the past, are no more relevant at present. Therefore, medicine has no other alternative than an active approach to study this problem from all philosophical, biological and medical aspects to evolutionize itself in this new dimension. In this paper some of these questions are discussed and some ways of forming the ethics in therapeutic use of stem cells are presented.",

As the research suggests, the message about a potentially frightening situation can reach the amygdala long before we are even consciously aware of it. Then, the amygdala is to trigger a fight-or-flight reaction, marked by our increased heart rate and respiration to prepare for action (cf. LeDoux 2007). The aim of the research is, first, to account for the most prototypical cognitive scenario of fear through the prism of Cognitive Linguistics (cf. Kövecses 1986, 2015) and supply it with this neuroscientific and psychological knowledge of fear . We learn that in addition to the most common human reactions to fear , i.e. the one of a fighter or the one of a runaway, a modern man reacts to fear by denying it as well as by displacing fear from their subconscious mind. Second, by investigating the novel metaphor FEAR IS AN ILLNESS OF THE BRAIN, we aim to propose a novel constructive cognitive scenario of fear , which helps us deal with this unwanted emotion in contemporary situations that generate fear , e.g. in the era of (post)Covid-19 pandemic (WHO 2021, July 15).",

      "abstract": "English-speakers sometimes say that they feel \"moved to tears,\" \"emotionally touched,\" \"stirred,\" or that something \"warmed their heart;\" other languages use similar passive contact metaphors to refer to an affective state. The authors propose and measure the concept of kama muta to understand experiences often given these and other labels. Do the same experiences evoke the same kama muta emotion across nations and languages? They conducted studies in 19 different countries, 5 continents, 15 languages, with a total of 3,542 participants. They tested the construct while validating a comprehensive scale to measure the appraisals, valence, bodily sensations, motivation, and lexical labels posited to characterize kama muta. The results are congruent with theory and previous findings showing that kama muta is a distinct positive social relational emotion that is evoked by experiencing or observing a sudden intensification of communal sharing. It is commonly accompanied by a warm feeling in the chest, moist eyes or tears, chills or piloerection, feeling choked up or having a lump in the throat, buoyancy, and exhilaration. It motivates affective devotion and moral commitment to communal sharing. Although the authors observed some variations across cultures, these 5 facets of kama muta are highly correlated in every sample, supporting the validity of the construct and the measure.

First, it offers an overview of several philosophical accounts of grief, acknowledging the heterogeneity and complexity of the experience that responds to particular personal points of importance, concern and one’s identity; the loss triggering grief represents a blow to these. I then argue that ecological grief is equally varied and personal: responding to what the grieving person understands as a loss severe enough to present intelligibly a degradation of her life and the world, to their meaningfulness or even sustainability. More specifically, both personal and ecological grief may manifest in an eroded sense of the future as a space in which one would invest oneself with plans, projects, ideas, desires, and endeavours. On the other hand, personal grief is, in some cases, conceptualised as having embedded the inherent possibility to come to closure or “move on” (e.g., by marrying again), while with ecological grief, the intelligibility of overcoming (replacing) the loss may be, depending on its scale, severely limited. I argue that this erosion of the future need not take the shape of paralysing sadness but rather of a disruption of taking some options of projecting oneself into the future seriously or as real.",

There is some mention of similar classification in the work of Iamblichos, but a more extensive study of these similarities in ancient Greece and present-day mediumnistic activities will be the center of another paper to be published later.The research is based on personal and verbal inquiries and on a quite extensive written questionnaire (117 questions) which was sent to spiritual professional mediums and some of the results are here mentioned, especially concerning deceased persons: the way the mediums perceive space around the entities, movements and surroundings, belongings, emotional states and the kind of messages received (nearly always the same wish to be recognized as still living). In general, mediums feel themselves relaxed when they undergo their seances, but they feel that they are in another state of consciousness, without always being able to define precisely what changed in their body or in their mind. Guides are giving another kind of message, more personal (advice for future actions) and with moral implications. High Entities can't be asked to come; when they appear very often some fear and an immense loving atmosphere are experienced simultaneously.",

      "title": "Duty",
      "abstract": "To have a duty is, above all, to be subject to a binding, normative requirement. This means that unless there are exculpating reasons someone who has a duty is required to satisfy it, and can be justifiably criticized for not doing so. Having a duty to do something is like having been given a command by someone who has a right to be obeyed: it must be done. Sometimes we speak as if we have duties to individuals (such as persons and institutions). So, for example, if Jones makes a promise to Smith, then Jones has a duty to Smith to keep the promise. We also talk as if we have duties to perform, or to refrain from performing, types of actions, for instance, a duty to help those in need. Even if the performance of such a duty involves treating an individual in a certain way, the duty may not be to that individual. For example, a duty to be charitable might not be a duty to anyone, not even the recipient of the charity. An important feature of duties is that they provide some justifying reason for action. If we explain why we did something by saying that it was our duty, we are offering a justification for the action. Such a justifying reason does not depend on the entire nature of the action. For example, if we make a promise, we have some justifying reason for keeping it, regardless of what was promised, or to whom the promise was made. Again it is like a command. If we are given a command by someone with a right to be obeyed, we have some justification for obeying it, no matter what we are commanded to do. On some views, however, the justifying reason we have for doing something because it is required by duty may not be decisive: we may have an even better reason for doing something else. None the less, that something is required by duty provides some justifying reason for doing it. Talk about duties is found in many areas; we speak, for example, of legal duties, moral duties, professional duties, the duties of a scholar and, even, matrimonial duties. This discussion will focus on moral duty, but may have wider application.",

      "title": "Death, Badness, and the Impossibility of Experience",
      "abstract": "Abstract It is a perennial philosophical puzzle how death can be bad for the individual who dies. Insofar as death is construed as an experiential blank, some have argued (following Epicurus) that one’s own death (as opposed to one’s dying) cannot be bad for one; after all, one does not experience death as bad or have any unpleasant experiences as a result of it. As the saying goes, “What you don’t know can’t hurt you.” But is the view expressed by this saying correct? Thomas Nagel has argued that it is not. Nagel argues that an individual can be harmed by something which does not result in any unpleasant experiences for that individual. He employs the following example in support of his position: It (the view that what you don’t know can’t hurt you) means that even if a man is betrayed by his friends, ridiculed behind his back, and despised by people who treat him politely to his face, none of it can be counted as a misfortune for him so long as he does not suffer as a result.",

      "abstract": "Behavioral pediatrics begins, as a discipline, with at least two important assumptions: (1) that all human experiences have psychosocial as well as biological or organic contexts; and (2) that the biological substrate with which the child is born is modifiable. Thus, behavioral pediatrics, by its own definitions and assumptions, initiates research questions at the biobehavioral interface.1 This paper attempts to delineate a number of research directions that may be used to investigate the complex relationships between behavioral and biological factors in behavioral pediatrics. Research investigating biobehavioral processes can be approached on a number of different levels. The research can be organized in terms of the following specific causal assumptions relating behavioral and biological factors: (1) a parallel model; (2) a causal model in which behavioral factors influence biological factors; (3) a causal model in which biological factors determine behavior; and (4) a causal model in which there is bidirectional causality. 1. Parallels Between Behavior and Biology. This model assumes that there is no directional causality. Behavioral and biological factors represent parallel systems sharing a common underlying organization. Behavioral and physiological variables may be viewed as different levels of the same system, mediated by central nervous system processes. Various screening methods are based on this model. Research questions dealing with this model focus on indexing and predicting developmental outcome. Techniques such as the Neonatal Behavioral Assessment Scale2 or the identification of sleep patterns3 evaluate behavioral patterns and attempt to identify neurophysiological or neurological dysfunction. Similarly, physiological response patterns such as infant cry patterns4 or heart rate variability measures such as cardiac vagal tone5 have been used to predict developmental outcome when the behavioral repertoire is too limited to be useful in predicting subsequent behavior.",

      "abstract": "The solution of the mind-body problem as the problem of interrelation and interconditionality of mental and physiological faces contradictions when one proceeds from the classical subject-object opposition.Accepting the subject-object opposition only as the convenient way for a scientist to speak about the phenomena of this world (the way that shouldn't be equal to the world itself), it is already senseless to look for the reason of a mental event neither in biology nor in sociality.The subject-object opposition itself is possible, because the event of proportionality of human being and world have happened.In this event the human being and the world are defined by a finite way and until it neither the human being, nor the world can't be defined.The human physiology (as well as a sociality which is sometimes unfairly identified with spirituality) can be considered as a marker of such definiteness, it is minimum of the being of consciousness.However in addition to this minimum there is also another aspect.Indeed, in every act of perception two events are realized simultaneously (not in a sequence): perception of a certain seeming (what is possible if human being and world are already defined, i.e. the act of proportionality of human being and world have happened) and a certain content.The content is always related to a certain idea.Ideas, in its turn, can be subdivided into two classes.To the first we will attribute the ideas which are the result of generalization of preceding experience and which give an opportunity to speak in an ordered way about the phenomena of the surrounding world.But there are also ideas of another sort -those that give an opportunity to the human being to newly re-create himself each time in the complete and ordered state.These ideas organize human life as human one, they are initiated by culture, but they are not a result of generalization.Such are a conscience, good, moral, love and the similar phenomena for which there are no external reasons -here the basis of a phenomenon coincide with the phenomenon itself.So, human physiology (including work of human brain) is the only side which characterizes the minimum of life of consciousness, it is the marker of human being and world are defined now.We are always after this definiteness (or, more precisely, inside it) when we perceive events of the world, and one shouldn't search the conditions of any event of life of consciousness (the point of interests of ontology) neither in biology nor in sociality.Every conscious act is complete and self-sufficient, and the consciousness basis (being actually the basis of human being) can be found only in consciousness.",

      "title": "The Management of Tensions",
      "abstract": "The development of personality may be studied from the point of view of the individual's learning how to manage his physiological tensions. Learning is to be considered as the process of structural and functional modification wherein the organization of internal process and of overt behavior is achieved. An organism may be viewed as a structure engaged in the capture, storage, and release of energy, the human organism at birth being least organized functionally of all the mammals, unable to execute movements beyond a few reflexes, and evidencing highly unstable physiological functioning. The child, during its long infancy, must achieve a relatively co-ordinated, integrated, and stabilized organism, physiologically and psychologically. One of the first tensional problems of infancy is presented by hunger, in the face of which the child must learn to sustain and diffuse tensions, which results in the regularization of activities. The hunger problems are made more acute at the time of weaning and the introduction of solid food, because of the substitution of a new for an accustomed stimulus. The holds for the pressure tensions incident to the elimination of waste and the muscular tensions which are released through sleep, or later through relaxation. The child is functionally complete and efficient at birth in the sympathetic reaction or so-called emotional response. As a result of shock or blocked activity a physiological condition of \"panic\" arises which presents tensional problems, to which the child must learn to react in terms of socially sanctioned behavior. The physiological instability of the human infant at birth presents tensional problems which are solved through the child's learning to react to gestures of those in his social world, and particularly language, which serve as substitutes for the tactual intimacies of infancy. Childhood and youth are periods which should be occupied with learning to sustain and diffuse tensions and to achieve ever more remote tensional releases according to the demands of social life. The period of adolescence represents a severe crisis to the personality, since it calls for a readjustment due to sex tensions which, if not adequately sublimated, may bring about faulty adjustment. The socialization of the individual is to be viewed as a continuation of parental and other adult instruction under which the child learns to observe the taboos and to use the institutional practices as the group-sanctioned patterns for tensional management. Status involves the relationship a person bears toward the persons around him as shown by the degrees of immunity he enjoys from their invasion of his person or goods and the taboos he must observe toward them. The ways in which individuals learn to meet these problems furnish the basis for the twofold classification of personalities into (1) the status type, and (2) the objective type. The former are predominantly concerned with the status they can create and sustain with other, even at the sacrifice of the consummations deemed most important. The latter have little or no difficulty in learning to manage their tensional problems and in facing their personal relations, and being therefore unaware of their personal relations, they will in their pursuits be primarily concerned with objective goals and the means for achieving them. The former resemble the schizoid type, and the latter the circular, cyclic, or syntonic type. This classification seems more promising and fundamental than the usual one according to occupation, interests, and other criteria, since it focuses attention first upon the organic tensions a person brings to life, and second upon the way he learns the social rules for adjusting those tensions.",

The function of images is, according to the Catholic Church, to provide a focus for contemplation and the reflection of faith (McCrone, 1996). Often the image of the sacred is shrouded from human view, destructive to gaze upon or an imperfect reflection. Aspects of divinity are often perceived by some peoples in the spread of a disease through a population or its natural history in the signs and symptoms it creates in a body. Here we see an image of the god of capitalism (Figure 1). We can produce it from a variety of data, on the value of stock, prices of a variety of goods and services, and other means. But in general, the image is very similar. It traces the behavior of man’s faith in the value of his creations and in his future wealth. It is the single most important representation of the health of the world economy. In a Durkheimian sense, it gives as a representation of the sum total of society’s active mood and reflects, as some economists have said, the attitude and character of humanity. In a sociobiological sense, it represents the pushing and shoving of the actors involved, each trying to capture a greater share of the wealth available now and in the future, like ants (described by E.O. Wilson, 1976) trying to individually seize a piece of food, their common actions can be argued to be a tide of social consequence increasing the fitness of all concerned as they result in the arrival of the food in the nest.",

When conditional stimuli are formed from various external agents (for example, in the conditional food reflexes), the animal’s first reaction to the newly established conditional stimulus is usually a movement toward this stimulus, i.e., the animal moves toward the place where the stimulus is. When the stimulus is within its reach, the animal even tries to touch it, and specifically with its mouth; for example, if the conditional stimulus is the turning on of an electric bulb, the dog licks it, and if the conditional stimulus is a sound, then (when food excitability is very high) the dog even snaps at the air with its mouth. In this way, as far as the animal is concerned the conditional stimulus has really become like a full surrogate for the food. When different conditional stimuli come from different parts of the surrounding space, the animal naturally turns to each one of them.",

The soft power and the hope of expanding it to the rest of the world are appealing to those who have already tasted success from their political and economic position and to those who are not too dissatisfied with the world as it is. When a single word serves so many purposes, it legitimately raises ideological suspicions.

      "abstract": "Drawing on data from a series of informal conversations about public safety and police-community relations, we distinguish between a speaker’s generalized communicative intentions with respect to metaphor use and story-telling, based on what Chafe (1994, p. 145) calls “unifying ideas that persist in semiactive consciousness” and the spontaneous intentions that arise within the short-term focus or spotlight of consciousness and guide the production of actual utterances. Although speakers occasionally enter a conversation with a fixed intention to express an idea with a particular metaphor, tell a particular story in a particular style, or accomplish some other speech act, such as persuading or informing, more commonly in ordinary conversations speakers begin with only a generalized intention to engage in the social interaction, sometimes but not always accompanied by generalized intentions regarding a particular topic or a particular form of expression. We argue that these “unifying ideas” interact with the contents of the short-term focus or spotlight of consciousness to generate spontaneous communicative intentions that in turn guide the production of metaphors, stories, and other language segments. Often these spontaneous communicative intentions arise interactively in response to other participants’ utterances; sometimes they arise in response to unforeseen opportunities in the speaker’s own utterances. Consequently, in ordinary casual conversations the spontaneous communicative intentions behind metaphor, story-telling and humor are often formed ‘on the fly,’ in response to the dynamic social interaction, and sometimes as a result of collaboration with other participants.",

Certain questions that have not only puzzled the common man but also the intellectuals had been like, Is there any meaning behind every happening? How ought we to live? Is there any life after death? Is death as such is the true end of all activities and so on. However, when the subject of death comes the answers through theories or philosophies have not been very convincing or suitable to all the rungs of the society. This could be mostly due to our evading the very subject of death much owing to the general uneasiness, fear and a sort of psychological insecurity, while dealing with it. Therefore it is always easy to raise philosophical questions than to answer them. There are almost two dozen theories in vogue which have certain basic assumptions but somehow they do not fall in the domain of truly scientific inquiry. They are to be accepted as an outcome of religious sentiments or wishful thinking. This paper highlights the salient features of Indian philosophical viewpoint with regard to death.",

The term Human Factors (HF) includes all qualities that are generally found as characteristic human limitations of perception, thinking, language and memory in operating vehicles and technical facilities. HF are general human qualities that are typical and stable in all people - regardless of origin, culture or age, etc. Individual qualities, as well as temporary affectivity, illness, medication or special motivations are excluded.

      "title": "Disaster victim identification: Stable isotope analysis and the identification of unknown decedents",
      "abstract": "Within the complex world of disaster victim identification, or DVI, forensic science practitioners use a variety of investigative techniques to work toward a common goal: identification of the decedents, bringing closure to the affected communities. Identification is a complex undertaking; the event (disaster) also can be extraordinarily complex, as it may be an acute event, or one that spans months or years. Compounding this time issue, remains may be heavily fragmented, dispersed, commingled, or otherwise disrupted by either the perpetrators or the disaster itself. To help solve these complexities, we explore the use of stable isotope analysis (SIA) in DVI events. SIA can be used with a variety of body tissues (hair, nail, bone, and teeth), and each represents different time depths in a decedent's life. Bone collagen and tooth enamel carbonate are useful to reconstruct an individual's diet and source water intakes, respectively, leading to likely population or geographic origin determinations. Additionally, the carbon and nitrogen isotopic signatures of bone collagen have calculated intraperson ranges. These facts allow investigators to determine likely origin of remains using isotopic data and can be used to link skeletal elements (to an individual), or perhaps more importantly, show that remains are not linked. Application of SIA can thus speed remains identification by eliminating individuals from short lists for identification, linking or decoupling remains, and reducing the need for some DNA testing. These strategies and hypothesis tests should commence early in the DVI process to achieve maximum effectiveness.",

      "abstract": "In the world there are millions of people who suffer from some type of phobia. Specifically, more than 20 million American adults suffer from some type of phobia, an irrational fear of a particular entity or event. Among the most common of phobias lies the fear of heights, to animals, normally called Zoophobia. Usually, when a person with phobias to heights or Zoophobia is exposed to or even things about the elevator or animal dreaded, they will go through physical and emotional symptoms of extreme anxiety reaction, like: excessive sweating, trouble controlling muscles, dizziness, fainting, elevated heart rate, rapid and shallow breathing, etc. Some patients refuse to leave their homes in fear of encountering said animal or enter a tall building forcing them to become secluded. Unfortunately, many individuals do not seek treatment for their phobias, and only 20% of people who get professional help, recover completely. Therefore, the objective of this project is to provide a reasonable alternative for treating various types of phobias, using virtual reality. To achieve said objective, a virtual world is developed using Unity, and Sweet Home 3D, and is implemented into an Oculus Rift virtual reality glasses. Patients will be transported to a house-like or building environment with the Oculus Rift, and gradually exposed to the animals or to heights, while progressively approaching them with no real risk or further traumatization. This will be made to feel as realistic as possible to help the patient feel more at home, while helping them adjust to their fears in places where these phobias are more likely to be found.",

In the course of these activities, children make and hear a number of statements about themselves and other children, and they also encounter ideas about and representations of childhood in general, for example when reading stories or walking through temples. But it is difficult to hold in mind the distinction between children and ideas about childhood. And how, in any case, would such a distinction be made? Could someone who thinks of herself as a Chinese child totally fail to see herself in a story about Chinese childhood? If she almost recognised herself, would I then say that she was bound to be influenced by the story? In which case, where would the representation end and the child begin? Might not even the vaguest act of recognition influence her process of becoming something other than a child?",

The position of the body (erect or genuflected) and arms (raised or elevated) characterize these gestures in the most common way, with a great number of variations. The most widespread manifestation is mourning after the death of a relative. It takes a variety of forms, very similar in the two cultures under examination.

      "abstract": "When speaking about the object model, we start by enumerating its main features. However the use of the object model to design a system, does not take into account all of these features because objects are especially designed according to an environment and are generally not reusable in other ones. This is because the temporal behaviour and the communication between objects in a given environment are particular to this environment and not often adaptable to other situations. To solve this problem, we think that the object should be presented in three dimensions. The first dimension represents the structure of the object which is a set of private attributes, the second dimension is the behaviour of the object which is represented by a set of operations applied on the structure of the object. The third dimension (environmental or temporal dimension) represents the behaviour of the object according to an environment and especially the communications between the object itself and the other objects of the system. This paper presents an object model defined according to the three dimensional point of view. The environmental dimension corresponds to a part, called scenario, which puts the object into a given system or environment. This part allows us to define an object independently of any environment and to adapt it to a given system by defining its scenario according to this system. However, the scenario part is not reusable but the structure and the behaviour of the object corresponding to the first two dimensions are completely reusable.",

In Christian teaching, human dignity is regarded as a divine gift that whatever the circumstances in which the person lives, takes God’s given Model as an example of life and attitude. Term form of dignity in a society can also be understood as the autonomy and freedom of thought as well as the behavior of an individual. Human dignity is very much linked to the sense of honor because a worthy man always inspires respect both to himself and to those around him, to his values and the values of others.1 Thus, the term dignity means the quality to be worthy, prestige, moral authority, dignified attitude, greatness and self–esteem. When talking about the esteem granted to a person we must understand the respect and consideration for human worth and dignity of each person in itself. Dignity cannot be represented without honesty, responsibility, fairness, courage, duty, honesty, etc., values which it integrates. The disregard of the human being, regardless of the reasons from which it springs, brings damages to human dignity, and as such must be regarded as inhuman and reprehensible acts. Human dignity requires the credit or trust that should be given to each person.  KEY WORDS: worth, dignity, human condition, humanistic conceptions, virtue, honesty, respect, responsibility, moral authority.",

People differ in the degree to which they believe that everything is one, but we know little about the psychological or social implications of holding this belief. In two studies, believing in oneness was associated with having an identity that includes distal people and the natural world, feeling connected to humanity and nature, and having values that focus on other people's welfare. However, the belief was not associated with a lower focus on oneself or one's concerns. Participants who believed in oneness tended to view themselves as spiritual but not necessarily religious, and reported experiences in which they directly perceived everything as one. The belief in oneness is a meaningful existential belief that has numerous implications for people's self-views, experiences, values, relationships, and behavior.",

      "abstract": "Many of our thoughts are about particular individuals (persons, things, places,…). For example, one can spot a certain Ferrari and think that it is red. What enables this thought to latch onto that particular object? It cannot be how the Ferrari looks, for this could not distinguish one Ferrari from another just like it. In general, how a thought represents something cannot determine which thing it represents. What a singular thought latches onto seems to depend also on features of the context in which the thought occurs. This suggests that its content is essentially indexical, contextually variable much as the content of an utterance such as ‘I am hungry’ depends on who utters it and when. The indexical model of singular thought is not limited to thoughts about individuals one perceives, but applies also to thoughts about individuals one remembers or has been informed of, such as an old bicycle or Christopher Columbus. In each case, a certain contextual relation, based on perception, memory or communication, connects thought to object.",

      "abstract": "The control of balance is crucial if we are to perform efficiently most of our daily motor tasks such as those involving goal-directed arm movements or whole-body displacements. Like all terrestrial species, humans move in a gravity field that permanently tends to induce postural destabilization through its attracting effect towards the centre of the Earth. In addition, movements themselves perturb our balance, and can be considered as a self-inflicted perturbation [1]. Alteration of the balance control system may therefore result in postural instability and increase the risk of falls with well-known associated morbid consequences (physical, psychological, social etc).",

There are situations, when it is morally right, and indeed obligatory, to allow a dying person to die in peace and dignity. But there is a world of difference between allowing a peaceful death, and deliberately setting out to bring death of the person either by acts of commission (s.c. 'active euthanasia'), or by acts of omission (s.c. 'passive euthanasia'). The word \"killing\" seems proper for euthanasia, because \"to kill\" does mean \" to intentionally cause the death of someone.\" It can be morally acceptable to withhold or withdraw a treatment precisely because it is reasonably judged as inefficacious (futile), or excessively burdensome for the patient. One's reason for withholding such treatment must not be a judgement about the desirability of putting an end to the patient's life, but a judgement about the desirability of putting an end to the treatment, which is futile or burdensome.",

Five conditions explored what object features elicited gaze‐following behavior in the infants. In one condition, the object was an adult stranger. The other four conditions used a soft, brown, dog‐sized, amorphously‐shaped, asymmetrical novel object that varied along two dimensions theorized as central to the identification of intentional beings: facial features and contingently interactive behavior. Infants shifted their own attentional direction to match the orientation of the actor or object in every condition except the one in which the object lacked both a face and contingently interactive behavior. Infants’‘gaze’‐following behavior in general, therefore, appears to have been driven selectively by a particular configuration of behavioral and morphological characteristics, specifically those theorized as underlying attributions of intentionality rather than attributions of person per se.",

      "title": "Elementary concepts of medicine: IV. Sickness from illness and in health",
      "abstract": "In the definition of illness that we put forward in the preceding essay, the specific difference that makes a case of somatic anomaly one of illness is its being, actually or potentially, manifest (adversely) to the affected person – overt or patent in this meaning. The manifestations that are subjective, perceptible to the affected person alone, are properly termed symptoms; and those that are objective in the sense of being perceptible to both the affected person as well as to others constitute not symptoms but a subtype of signs of the illness: patient-perceptible signs. These two types of manifestation, already present or potentially emerging in the future, are the ones involved in the illness-defining specific difference among the somatic anomalies that constitute the proximate genus of illness. Other manifestations are, naturally, objective but not perceptible to the affected person – signs from tests (‘physical’, ‘laboratory’). These simple propositions, again, differ from what we find in medical dictionaries. Symptom is said to be ‘any subjective evidence of disease or of a patient's condition, i.e. such evidence as perceived by the patient; a noticeable change in a patient's condition indicative of some bodily or mental state’ (Dorland 1994), or ‘any morbid phenomenon or departure from the normal in structure, function, or sensation, experienced by the patient and indicative of disease’ (Stedman 1995). And sign is defined as ‘an indication of the existence of something; any objective evidence of a disease, i.e. such evidence as is perceptible to the examining physician, as opposed to the subjective sensations (symptoms) of the patient’ (Dorland 1994), or as ‘any abnormality indicative of disease, discoverable on examination of the patient; an objective symptom of disease, in contrast to a symptom which is a subjective s. of disease’ (Stedman 1995). What binds symptoms and patient-perceptible signs, and makes them outstandingly significant, is that these manifestations, and these alone, take away from the affected person's feeling, and lay presumption of being, healthy; they, when already present, represent unwellness and thus constitute the person's ‘complaints’ to the doctor. For this all-important, patient-relevant segment of the manifestations of a somatic anomaly – the segment which is involved in our definition of illness – there now is, remarkably, no established term; and ‘unwellness’, while correct, is awkward. We take the appropriate term for patient-perceptible manifestations of illness to be ‘sickness’. A person with patent illness, we find natural to say, is sick from the illness; and if the illness is latent, then the person, while ill rather than healthy, is not sick from this illness. This again brings us to examine our medical dictionaries. The one that equates illness with sickness and specifies disease as something else (Dorland 1994) defines various particular sicknesses under ‘sickness’. A number of the definitions incongruously involve the term ‘disease’, and some others involve ‘illness’. What characterizes all of those sicknesses, athlete's sickness, altitude sickness and morning sickness among them, is a particular, less-than-specific type of manifestation to the patient in conjunction with a specific cause and, notably, absence of a defined somatic anomaly as the proximate genus. Another medical dictionary, the one that equates disease as well as illness with sickness (Stedman 1995), specifies a similar, limited set of particular sicknesses (rather than all diseases/illnesses). To us these sickness entities are not ones of illness nor ones of sickness caused by illness; they are ones of sickness as a result of definitional causes other than illness-defining somatic anomalies; they are entities of sickness in health. With the dictionaries thus strikingly confusing about the concept of sickness, to us it is simply lack of feeling and/or overtly being well (physically). A person who is sick may or may not have an illness – illness-defining somatic anomaly – as a basis for this. Our usage of ‘sickness’ in relation to illness, we wish to underscore, is by no means novel. To quote scripture: Elisha arrived in Damascus when King Ben-hadad of Aram was ill. The King . . . said to Hazael, ‘Take a gift and go to meet the man of God, and through him inquire the Lord: will I recover from this illness?’ . . . Now, when Elisha had taken sick with the illness of which he was to die, . . . [italics added] (Miles 1995, pp. 182–183) The concept of sickness remains incompletely apprehended when not having adopted a disciplined approach to the definition of particular sicknesses, to the specification of the essence that is always present in and unique to a particular sickness. Common to the definitions of all the particular sicknesses in the two dictionaries are two structural features. For one, a particular type of unwellness is described as present (and thus not merely potentially present in the future); and for another, causal origin, other than somatic anomaly, of the unwellness is consistently specified. This is incongruous with the general equatings in those dictionaries of sickness with illness and/or disease, with definitions of particular illnesses and diseases not routinely having this structure – they are commonly defined in terms of somatic anomaly alone, with no definitional role for its manifestations in unwellness. (Pleonastic description of potential manifestations in unwellness is commonplace, however, obfuscating conveyance of the definitional essence.) Proper conceptualization of particular sicknesses rests on appreciation of the principle that the particularity is to pertain to the nature of the unwellness or to that of its cause, but not both (as in these dictionaries). Thus, nausea with vomiting constitutes a sickness, irrespective of its cause (whether an illness or, say, the use of a medication or involvement in a poorly tolerated type of motion without appropriate medication); and sicknesses in this same sense also are whatever combinations of elements of unwellness – these elements being symptoms and/or signs only when they are manifestations of illness. On the other hand, sickness caused by the use of a medication is ‘medication sickness’ (cf. motion sickness) irrespective of what type of unwellness the medication is causing; similarly, sickness manifesting syphilis is ‘syphilis sickness’ irrespective of what type of sickness ‘the great imitator’ happens to have as its overt manifestation; and this non-specific kind of conceptualization/definition of type of sickness on the basis of its cause alone should be applied whenever cause is involved in the definition (as the specific difference in the proximate genus of sickness). To summarize, whereas it is our position that illness is a somatic anomaly manifest, or in the future potentially manifest, to the affected person, these illness-defining manifestations consist of symptoms (inherently subjective) and those signs (inherently objective) that are overt in the sense of being recognized by (and bothersome to) the affected person. The individual aggregate of these patient-relevant manifestations of illness, distinct from its consequences, we believe should be referred to as the sickness in which the illness is manifest to the individual. Sickness can also have causation which does not involve illness. Particular sicknesses are to be conceptualized in terms of the nature of the aggregate of elements of unwellness or the nature of the cause(s) of this, but not both of these jointly. Much confusion about the concept of sickness prevails.",

Following the age of an infant, for example, the structure, quality, and the degree of symbolization will be different. The term representation in science is filled with different contents. In psychoanalysis, we see a development from Sigmund Freud's “(Sach‐ or Wort‐)Vorstellungen” to internal objects, then to self–object representations and finally—following newer results of the concept of intersubjectivity and especially under the influence of infant mental‐ and interactional research—to self–object interaction representations. Some aspects of this development are presented more in detail. Knowing that on one hand, interaction in external reality is structured by the self–object interaction representations of each interacting partner and that on the other hand, what happens during the interactions in external reality modifies the representational world of all the interactive persons (i.e., their inner reality), one can observe constant movements from inside to outside (e.g., transference, action) and from outside to inside of the individual (e.g., perception, stimulation, containment, modification). Clinical implications for the actual way of understanding are manifold, but are here only very shortly delineated.",

      "title": "Causal discounting and conditional reasoning in children",
      "abstract": "Book synopsis: The conditional, if...then, is probably the most important term in natural language and forms the core of systems of logic and mental representation. It occurs in all human languages and allows people to express their knowledge of the causal or law-like structure of the world and of others' behaviour, e.g., if you turn the key the car starts, if John walks the dog he stops for a pint of beer; to make promises, e.g., if you cook tonight, I'll wash up all week; to regulate behaviour, e.g., if you are drinking beer, you must be over 18 years of age; to suggest what would have happened had things been different, e.g., if the match had been dry it would have lit, among many other possible uses. The way in which the conditional is modelled also determines the core of most logical systems. Unsurprisingly, it is also the most researched expression in the psychology of human reasoning.\r\n\r\nCognition and Conditionals is the first volume for over 20 years (On Conditionals, 1986, CUP) that brings together recent developments in the cognitive science and psychology of conditional reasoning. Over the last 10 to 15 years, research on conditionals has come to dominate the psychology of reasoning providing a rich seam of results that have created new theoretical possibilities. This book shows how these developments have led researchers to view people's conditional reasoning behaviour more as succesful probabilistic reasoning rather than as errorful logical reasoning. It shows how the multifarious, and apparently competing, theoretical positions developed over the last 50 years in this area - mental logics, mental models, heuristic approaches, dual process theory, and probabilistic approaches-have responded to these insights. Its organisation reflects the view that an integrative approach is emerging that may need to exploit aspects of all these theoretical positions to explain the rich and complex phenomenon of reasoning with conditionals. It includes an introductory chapter relating the development of the psychology of reasoning to developments in the logic and semantics of the conditional. It also includes chapters by many of the leading figures in this field",

The art of offerings is the art of symbols in which concrete and abstract could create artistic as well as symbols of supernatural characters; ten characters, five characters which are applicable and have different functions. And sometimes contradictory according to the needs and intended use. From these observations arose the interpretation of a meaning that, in meeting the needs of human life, basically has two major potential attractions to each other and complementary, i.e. doing structuring/restructuring or order which is oriented on the arrangement of a better life.

This is when management is not based on the concept of balance and harmony, it will affect the social fabric of society and is prone to conflict and discord. Hence, the joints destabilize the integrity of nation and state. The concept of the balance contained in the upakara or offering means in comparison to the meaning of life phenomena that occur in society today seems to have been neglected and even abandoned. This can be proven where there has been deviation measures both the nature and the human life, among others, the exploitation of natural resources, discrimination in law and human rights, gender, and abuse of authority in the field of public administration, and will impact the spread of ecological crisis and moral degradation, as well as heighten the level of community poverty.

Its existence may not be consciously recognized, and generally the choice of right and wrong action is unaccompanied by reflection; but the problem begins to operate as soon as the development of character begins, and people are always deciding between good and evil, whether they look inside their minds or not. For the formation of character depends on the manner in which the problems of conduct or morals are solved by each individual for himself. If he solves them correctly, he becomes good; If he solves them badly, he sows in himself the seeds of evil.

It suffices for our purpose to know that man's original complex exceeds in variety of tendencies that of any other animal, and that the virility and dominance of certain tendencies may vary endlessly with the individual. What a man is, what he will do, is a result of the play of environmental stimuli upon the leanings, bents, tendencies, lodged in his constitution. Native endowment and environment fit each other as lock and key. The limit, character and direction of man's behavior can not transcend his original nature-a soft pine germ-plasm spells a soft pine character and this remains true no matter how favorably the environmental forces may be applied. By no pedagogical device has it been, or ever will be, possible to transform a weak inherited complex into an oak character. The future security of the state or the home must not fail to regard mar biologically, as possessed of powerful destructive tendencies as well as powerful tendencies of love, sympathy and kindness. Two souls, as Faust says, dwell within his breast, the one of sociability and helpfulness, the other of jealousy and antagonism to his mates. Wanton blindness to this poetic expression of man's dual nature wobbles the security of any nation unwilling to turn the unsmitten cheek. In this matter the evil component of man must be reckoned with the good. To cherish the latter is noble; to blink the former is not only perilous, but beggars courage.",

      "abstract": "… Do I have, not merely a self-interested feeling, but also a disinterested feeling of concern for others? Yes – the weal and woe of another touches us directly: the mere happiness of another pleases us in the telling: even that of fictional persons whose tale we know of, or in distant ages – this common concern is so great that it collides with the self-interested feeling. The sense of it is indeed a noble feeling, nobler than the self-interested one. Nobody despises it: everyone wishes for it, though not all have it in the same degree; in some it is great, and the greater it is, the more it is felt as a perfection. It is universal, though seldom so great that it inspires active exertions – in misers, for example, with whom self-interest has become very strong. As needy beings the creator gave us self-interest in our own perfection. As beings who have the power to be of service to our fellows, He gave us a disinterested concern for the perfection of others. The concern for others ranks high, since even the concern for self can be subordinated to it, but not vice versa. The more self-interested, the poorer (at least in thought), and hence the more to be despised. The disinterested feeling for the welfare, etc., of another has our own perfection, not as an end, but as a means.",

      "abstract": "\"Being strange\" as opposed to \"being oneself\" is part of the thinking in all cultures. Belonging to a given culture is actually defined by ones identity and by \"being oneself\". Both concepts--\"being oneself\" or \"being strange\"--are rational and related constructs. Whatever they are confronted with, for most human beings it is self-evident to differentiate between subject and object, between \"being oneself\" or \"being strange\". This explains why thinking often occurs in opposites or polarities, as an either/or. All \"being strange\" has its origins in one's own self. \"Being strange\" becomes most obvious when persons, gestalt or cultures strongly deviate from one's own familiar situation. It is part of man's disposition to be cautious, suspicious of and at distance from everything considered strange and different. That explains his xenophobia feelings and actions. Behind this attitude we can always discover one's wish to preserve the familiar beliefs--combined with an uneasiness to give up one's thinking and behaviour that is proven and routine. It is only by reflecting on our own culture and our own inheritance that we have the possibility to come to terms with our own ethnic identity and foreign behavioral patterns. If we do not try to understand other cultures while keeping our own cultural identity, tensions and violent conflicts will inevitably result.",

Nadel can be understood to limit ‘symbol’ to those situations where the relationship between something and what it stands for is intended, conventional and can be put by the actor into words. It points up the distinction between the communication of meaning to people within the society (actors) and items of social behaviour or belief which express in an indirect or obscure fashion some principle, value, conflict or problem occurring in that society. Expression is not the same thing as communication. You can express your feelings to a stone, yet it is unmoved. You could also, like the mystic Henry Suso (Huizinga 1965, p. 148) eat three-quarters of an apple in the name of the Trinity and the remaining quarter in commemoration of ‘the love with which the heavenly Mother gave her tender child Jesus an apple to eat’ and unless you or Henry Suso told me, I would not, though I watched you twenty times, discern your symbolism or even that what you did was symbolical.",

      "title": "Beyond Shallow Models of Emotion",
      "abstract": "There is a huge diversity of definitions of “emotion” some of which are associated with relatively shallow behavioural or measurable criteria or introspectable experiences, for instance use of facial expression, physiological measures, activity of specific regions of the brain, or the experience of bodily changes or desires, such as wanting to run away, or to hurt someone. There are also deeper theories that link emotional states to a variety of mechanisms within an information processing architecture that are not easily observable or measurable, not least because they are components of virtual machines rather than physical or physiological mechanisms. We can compare this with “shallow” definitions of chemical compounds such as salt, sugar, or water, in terms of their appearance and observed behaviours in various test situations, and their definitions in the context of a theory of the architecture of matter which is mostly concerned with postulated sub-atomic entities and and a web of relationships between them which cannot easily be observed, so that theories about them are not easily confirmed or refuted. This paper outlines an approach to the search for deeper explanatory theories of emotions and many other kinds of mental phenomena, which includes an attempt to define the concepts in terms of the underlying information processing architectures and the classes of states and processes that they can support. A serious problem with this programme is the difficulty of finding good constraints on theories, since in general observable facts are consistent with infinitely many explanatory mechanisms. This “position paper” offers as a partial solution the requirement that proposed architectures be capable of having been produced by biological evolution, in addition to being subject to constraints such as implementability in known biological mechanisms, various resource limits (time, memory, energy, etc.) and being able to account for a wide range of human functionality. Within such an architecture-based theory we can distinguish (at least) primary emotions, secondary emotions, and tertiary emotions, and produce a coherent theory which explains a wide range of phenomena and also partly explains the diversity of theories:",

      "abstract": "The sense of precarity is specifically human. It accompanies the consciousness that “what is” is in becoming and can stop being. All lifeforms live through signs, but we humans are also endowed with a capacity for metasemiosis. As semiotic animals, we have self-consciousness, feel responsibility, and feel apprehension: we are consciously aware of our subjection to precarity. G. Semerari called it insecuritas, in relation to both self and others. Fear “of the other” entails a threefold genitive: object, subject, and ethical (“for” the other) genitives. When concern for the other becomes overwhelming, the self may pass from non-indifference to indifference, an escape through identity: given competing identities, the other is not my concern. Yet the other remains inextricably involved, especially in globalization. Apprehension for the other cannot be eliminated. Semiotics explains this in terms of sign-network interconnectivity while “semioethics” develops the relations between signs and values. It insists that life can only flourish in relation to the other (including nonhuman life) and calls for responsibility.",

Words with the meanings ‘to be sick’, ‘sick person’ and ‘to become healthy’ noted in the Pechora dialects are proposed to be divided into two groups. One of them are antonymous one-root and different-root tokens, finding themselves in both semantic fields. Another group includes single, not correlated with each other by motivational model tokens from each field. The attempt is made to compare the motivational models identified for the tokens from semantic areas “Disease” and “Health”, with models typical to dialect and folklore nominations of death and life. It was revealed that the main components of the texts of health and illness (often typologically corresponding to the texts of life and death) in the Pechora dialects are the following motifs: the presence / absence of a power or impatient condition; compliance / non-compliance of a man to his functional nature; ending with / continuing movement along a predetermined path, the road descent / return to the road, loss / finding of yourself. Particular attention is given to the tokens skuchat ‘to be sick, suffer from pain’ and ‘to experience the absence of disease’, pogozhy ‘healthy, strong’.",

      "abstract": "One of the chief tasks incumbent on a nation at war is to look after those of its citizens who have been severely disabled in the service of their country.For the uninformed this is merely a surgical and financial matter, but the informed have long known that the working capacity and social readaptation of the disabled man do not exclusively depend on his physical condition.To a large extent they depend on his state of mind.An ablebodied man who goes out to fight and comes back badly maimed encounters a variety of problems arising from his disability; according to his temperament and character he either is able to solve them or fails.If he fails he creates a good deal of unhappiness for himself and those around him, and eventually he may become a liability to the community.While great strides have been made in many aspects of the after-care of the disabled, it is felt that the psychological aspect has so far received insufficient attention.What follows is a summary of detailed reports on each of the disabilities studied-loss of limb, blindness, loss of vision in one eye.Considerations of space necessitate omission of much of the confirmatory and explanatory evidence.-200amputees, 103 war-blinded, and 102 monocular individuals were examined psychiatrically, each of them for at least two hours.Charac- teristics common to all three types of disabled men, and differences in their emotional, social, and occupational situation specific for each of the disabilities, are discussed. I. EMOTIONAL SITUATIONA. Common Characteristics Commoni Psychological Features.-Severelydisabled men, irrespective of the specific nature of their disability, are apt to regard it as a defect which lowers their status in the eyes of their fellow citizens.In extreme cases, sometimes with but more usually without foundation, the men are afraid that they may become an encumbrance to their families or to the community at large.Fear that they may not stand an equal chance with able-bodied men is very common.They are appreciative of acts of kindness if not overdone.Those who are badly disfigured are especially concerned by the doubt whether they are lovable by women any longer, and acknow- ledge gratefully any evidence that this is still the case.Fear that they receive sympathy or pity, which they loathe, rather than true affection, which they'want, is hard to dispel.Their feelings of inferiority account for their frantic desire to con- ceal their disability and, if it makes them dependent on other people, to assert their independence.Like any other minority uncertain of its social status, they clamour for their rights and are very sensitive to any real or imagined encroachments upon them.Since time immemorial evil-doers have repeatedly been depicted as disabled, freaks, or cripples.These writers obviously sensed that disablement mobilizes aggressiveness arising from envy and frustration.Owing to their ill-temper, disabled persons are often difficult to get on with.",

Thus perhaps dogs a man from cradle to grave. In fact perhaps is so powerful that it controls human Fate, with lifelong guarantee, whether man wants it or not it seldom bothers. The use of perhaps is due mainly to for two reasons namely ignorance or lack of knowledge. But perhaps this doctrine seems to be the manifestation of half truth.

      "title": "Memory and the A-Series",
      "abstract": "Can the structure of memory tell one anything about the nature of time? There is a certain kind of memory that appears to connect us in a special way to the past, namely `episodic memory´: remembering witnessing a certain event or performing a certain action (as opposed to merely remembering that one witnessed the event or performed that act). This kind of memory requires there to have been a relevant experience in the past, to which the memory is linked. It is this link that reveals something about time itself. Following a suggestion by John Campbell, in Past, Space and Self, this paper argues that an epistemological principle governing episodic memory has interesting consequences for our understanding of the passage of time. The principle question is that the memory cannot acquire a greater degree of veridicality (closeness to the truth) than the original experience. That in turn requires that the content of the memory be the same as, or at least be logically connected to, the content of the experience. The event or past state of affairs that makes the original experience veridical also makes the resulting memory veridical. So, for instance, if I remember the first moon landing, then it is the landing itself, or some fact about it, that makes veridical, both my current episodic memory of seeing it (on television), and the original perception. But how should we conceive of that event? Should we think of it as located in a changing `A-series´, that is, as receding further into the past? Or should we think of it as located only in an unchanging `B-series´, that is, as standing in relations of precedence, subsequence or simultaneity to other events? The first view takes seriously talk of the passage of time. The second is assiociated with what is sometimes called the `static´ conception of time, which treats passage as wholly mind-dependent and perspectival. This second view can easily accommodate the idea that in episodic memory what makes the memory veridical also made the original experience veridical. The first, it argued, cannot. For if there is an A-series, then one state of affairs is constantly being replaced by another, and past states of affairs are no longer available as truth- makers for present memories. One reply to this line of reasoning is that it is enough that there be a logical connection between past fact and present fact to secure the corresponding connection between memory and original experience. But, again, only the static view can explain this.",

Sometimes the organization lives for a certain length of time, and then, either sud­ denly or gradually, losing its essential traits, it begins to disintegrate, and becomes more and more unidentifiable, until finally, like a wave which exists for some time and then disappears in the midst of other waves, it dissolves in the ocean of other organizations and institutions. The beginning and the end of some organizations and institutions is clearly marked and can be established definitely in the terms of a year, a month, sometimes even a day or an hour. Such are for instance most of the organizations whose beginning and end are determined by juridical incorporation and dissolution. Other organizations and insti­ tutions, like many States, Religious Organizations, Educational Insti­ tutions, sometimes Family, and so on, often do not have such definite marks of their emergence and end, either because they are not record­ ed and are lost in the grey past, or because they have grown and dissolved, gradually and imperceptibly. In such organizations the life-span either cannot be established at all or can be determined only very approximately, liable to a considerable error. From the standpoint of theory and practice a more exact know­ ledge of what is the average life-span of various social organizations",

      "abstract": "Metaphors of the evil eye ( sahir ) are interpreted as posing a threat to the Muslim Arab Rubāṭāb 1 of the Sudan. A common situation in which these metaphors are used is when the speaker (saḥḥār) attempts to cast or “shoot” a sahir metaphor at persons or objects by comparing them to something else. A victim may then try to counteract the shot by uttering protective invocations. The victim's later account of the event in which the evil eye was cast upon him will include subsequent misfortunes and perhaps justifications for personal failure. For example, a sahhār likened someone eating a green onion to somebody speaking into a microphone. The man threw away the onion, cursed the sahhār , and complained thereafter that his hand had never been the same. The audience evaluates the metaphors. Good comparisons evoke much laughter. “He is really evil,” or “He killed him,” are often pronounced by the audience both in appreciation of the theoretical powers of the metaphor shooter and in anticipation of the harm that may come in the shot's wake. The audience later reports the interaction as a joke or legend.",

Within the realm of the SF genre, additional Others appear, which do not exist in our world or in the realistic literature, like aliens and robots. This work investigates the relation to, and the view of, Others - especially the non-realistic ones - in some danish SF stories. The results of the investigation were that some Others were viewed with fear and some rather neutrally, but only very few with disregard. On the other hand, did women, who never explicitly were the Other, only have second-rate roles in almost all of the stories.

      "abstract": "We humans differ radically from other animals because we use sophisticated symbolic languages in thinking and speaking. We use our languages represent persons and things and facilitate the creation of thoughts. We misuse our language when we misrepresent persons and things and create life-degrading thoughts. In the following pages, I'll examine one way in which believe we misuse language. Two sentences in Science and Sanity (page 384) outline this misuse: we use a language of adjectives and subject-predicate forms pertaining sense impressions, we are using a language which deals with entities inside our skin [italics Korzybski's] and characteristics entirely non-existent in the outside world. Thus the events outside our skin are neither cold nor warm, green nor red, sweet nor bitter, but these characteristics are manufactured by our nervous system inside our skins, as responses only different manifestations, physico-chemical processes. Many papers exist dealing with subject-predicate forms, notably the use of predicate adjectives following copulative verbs, e.g., water is warm. have seen none dealing with the use of adjectives as described in Korzybski's statement, especially the adjective, e.g., I prefer warm If the term attributive is new you, let me quote from the definition given in the Random House unabridged dictionary: Pertaining an adjective ... that is directly adjacent to, in English, the noun it modifies. The same reference work also gives this definition of attribute: to consider as a quality of or characteristic of the person, thing, group, etc. of the thing indicated. Briefly, an adjective stands next the word it modifies, and by its position it implies attribution of its quality or characteristic that word. Here's an illustrative experiment from life that may make this clearer. Fill three pitchers with water. In #1, the water has a temperature reading of 35 degrees. In #2, 65 degrees. In #3, 95 degrees. A person puts his hand into pitcher #1 for a few minutes. Then he puts the same hand in #2. He'll say, That's warm Another person puts her hand in pitcher #3 for a few minutes. Then she puts it in #2. She'll likely say, That's cool They use adjectives attribute different temperatures the same water. Obviously false. The two people are describing what they have manufactured in their own nervous systems. (1) The habit of using adjectives make false-to-fact attributions of what we feel and think, energy manifestations, physico-chemical processes, has become an addiction for most of us. Indeed, we are even less aware of making this attribution than we are when we use the is of identity. Concentrating on the is of identity language form addresses only part of the fundamental identity problem. Even total elimination of this is from our vocabulary will leave us basically in the same semantic trap. Korzybski described his awareness of the addictive power of the language structure of false attribution by saying he had keep a model of his Structural Differential before him on his desk. …",

      "title": "\"A Robot Is Watching You”: Humanoid Robots And The Different Impacts On Privacy",
      "abstract": "Robots, particularly the ones that belong to a special type of robotic technologies designed and deployed for communicating and interacting with humans, slip into more and more domains of human life - from the research laboratories and operating rooms to our kitchens, bedrooms, and offices. They can interact with humans with facial expressions, gaze directions, and voices, mimicking the affective dynamics of human relationships. As a result, they create new opportunities, but also new challenges and risks to peoples’ privacy. The literature on privacy issues in the context of Social Companion Robots (SCRs) is poor and has a strong focus on information privacy and data protection. It has given, however, less attention to other dimensions of privacy, e.g. physical, emotional, or social privacy. This article argues for an “evolving” or “transformable” notion of privacy, as opposed to the “elusive” concept of privacy elaborated by leading privacy theorists such as Daniel J. Solove (2008) and Judith J. Thomson (1975). In other words, rather than assuming that privacy has a single core or definition (as defined, e.g., in Warren and Brandeis' 1890 paper), it maintains that it is important to conceptualize privacy as distinguishable into various aspects, including informational privacy, the privacy of thoughts and actions, and social privacy. This inductive approach makes it possible to identify new dimensions of privacy and therefore effectively respond to the rapid technological evolution in AI technologies which is constantly introducing new spheres of privacy intrusions.",

Normally and naturally, pain will not go away unless and until we do something to address the conditions to which it points. Moral agents are obliged to take into account any pain and suffering of human beings that would be attendant on a proposed course of action, the worse the harms, the weightier the consideration. Moral competence requires rational agents to cultivate sensitivity and a capacity to empathize with the pain and suffering of others. Pain produces paradoxes for human rational agency, because two of its essential functions—moral deliberation and meaning-making—require an appreciation of how bad pain is.",

      "abstract": "Muslims have concrete life guidance that manifest itself in the Quran and the prophetic traditions, however, they are not completely immune from the psychological imbalances\r\nin their lives. Like any other people in this world they face many types of difficulties in their lives that create havoc and maladjustment's in their personalities. These\r\nmaladjustment's pose as catalysts to anxieties and stubborn thresholds to an individual’s and group’s normal functioning. In Islamic thinking and belief, Muslims admit that the human is made up of two different creations, the spirit and the body. Al Ghazali, one of the great and famous Muslim scholars asserts and misery are caused by the conditions of the soul. The soul is a substance by itself (al Ghazali) but the body of a\r\nhuman being relies on the soul to achieve its optimum functioning. The human soul is not perfect in nature and when it joins the human body, it is subject to some influences of human desires that pollute its status and fall sick with some mischievous diseases. Among the diseases of the soul that have direct implications to hunan functioning are sorrow, excessive anger, unrealistic fear, selfishness, destructive envy, dissatisfaction, rancor, and failure to stick to Allah’s guidance. Therefore, this paper is an attempt to provide some useful interventions that could be used to properly deal with these human\r\npredicaments in the Muslim communities in order to achieve the real happiness in our lives in this world and that of hereafter. Some essential counseling interventions in the\r\nMuslim communities include strengthening their souls, strengthen their Iman, awareness of whom they are (self-awareness), the purpose of their creation, analyzing things and occasions rationally, eradication of negative thinking and self defeating thoughts, patience and prayers, understanding that life calamities are part of our lives as tests, fighting the narcissistic self talk, etc.",

      "title": "Internal Conflict",
      "abstract": "ABSTRACT. … the extraordinary propensity of the human being to join hands with external forces in an attack upon his own existence is one of the most remarkable of biological phenomena (Menninger 1938) The term 'superego’(which should perhaps be replaced by‘anti‐ego’) is used to denote a set of habitual response tendencies that are antagonistic to the self, and cause the subject to behave as if he were two separate persons at war with each other. The superego develops in early life and may be ‘punitive’or‘humiliating’or both. The former kind arises through learning to restrain the self from dangerously rebelling against overwhelming coercion, and the latter through intense striving to avoid parental scorn. The resultant‘internal’conflict resembles the external one between an actual child and a demanding parent; and the relative fortunes of the two antagonists provide a model for understanding the characteristics of many kinds of emotional and psychosomatic disorder. Superego behaviour is propagated from generation to generation; and perpetuates itself in the individual by preventing the responses that, by proving it unnecessary, would lead to its extinction. Self‐punitive conditions are therefore highly resistant to treatment, which must be specially directed to the particular needs of each of the patient's two conflicting parts in turn. To be able to do this, psychotherapists themselves need to be freed from their own internal conflicts during training and later.",

      "abstract": "In Le Diffrend, Lyotard defines the silencing of victims, with its consequent effacement of the violence done to them, as that which creates a wrong (tort), which he distinguishes from damage (dommage).2 A damage occurs when one being is harmed by another. Many kinds of damage may be litigated against, taken to court, proven, and compensated for. But sometimes a damage cannot be expressed, whether because the being who undergoes the damage is unable to speak in a language to which the judges will listen (as in the case of animals, children, the mentally ill, the dead), or because the judges are the ones who have done the damage, whether directly or through affiliation, or because the testimony of the one damaged is deprived of authority for whatever reason.3 Such a scenario is called a differend, and the person who suffers from both a damage and a loss of the ability to prove it is a victim.4 Lyotard's primary example is of the victims of Auschwitz, who were simultaneously damaged, that is killed, and deprived of the ability to bear witness to what was done to them, because they are dead. Anyone else who might testify to Auschwitz may have her authority undermined by Holocaust deniers by the very fact that she is alive and hence cannot have seen what happened in the chambers, since the only witnesses to what occurred there are dead.5 More common examples may be helpful, however, and I would like to consider a few that gender my discussion of differends.",

      "abstract": "Language has many words like 'few,' 'some,' and 'many,' that denote quantity more or less precisely. Words and phrases are often used as substitutes for numbers in estimating magnitudes of all kinds. The information conveyed by such terms varies with context and personal factors. Thus Many died in the Cocoanut Grove disaster refers to dozens, or hundreds at most, whereas Many died in the Second Battle of the Marne is a statement about hundreds of thousands. The number meant by the word 'many' obviously differs in the two contexts which must be known if the estimates are to be correctly interpreted. Words with quantitative denotations are also employed to communicate evaluative judgments based largely on subjective or emotional states. If strong emotional biases are operative in forming judgments even quantitative terms may be greatly altered in meaning. Thus the society matron who asserts that 'nobody' attended a party given by a rival does not mean that not a single person attended or even that the number of guests was small, but that no one of social importance or from her set attended. Evidently the information and meanings conveyed by language depend upon more than the information conveyed by individual words, phrases, or even sentences.",

In fact, it may even appeal to functions to explain the existence and nature of particular purposes, motives, and intentions. A functional explanation in biology, say of the bee-hunting behavior of wasps, does not ascribe intentionality to organs and tissue or even to the organism as a whole, but it need not deny this intentionality in order to be a functional explanation. What is relevant is that a functional explanation is independent of any attribution of intentionality. Functional explanation in social science tends to be more easily misunderstood because many social institutions or cultural practices that might have an intelligible functional explanation may also be thought of as having an intentional explanation, and many social institutions were in fact intentionally founded or are now shaped and supported for particular purposes. Let us assume that public executions in a particular society have the function (and the actual effect) of representing power in naked form and thus obviating the necessity of actually exercising that power in numerous instances (which can be expensive and draining).",

We have selected several such cases and will try to present them to colleagues working outside the natural sciences to serve as motives for their work: i) Water, the basic liquid for our life, seems to be much more abundant (though not in clear form without ingredients) on and inside the Earth and in the Universe than was assumed still a decade ago. What does it mean and which are the consequences for us? ii) Is our Earth the only place of intelligent life in the Universe or not? What do both these possibilities mean for us, for philosophy, ethics and theology? iii) Nature is full of various surprises, which may come as a disaster in a global scale. Are we prepared to cope with them?",

      "title": "Freud, Sigmund (1856–1939)",
      "abstract": "Freud developed the theory and practice of psychoanalysis, one of the most influential schools of psychology and psychotherapy of the twentieth century. He established a relationship with his patients which maximized information relevant to the interpretation of their behaviour, and this enabled him to find explanations of dreams, symptoms and many other phenomena not previously related to desire. In consequence he was able radically to extend our common-sense psychology of motive. On Freud’s account everyday actions are determined by motives which are far more numerous and complex than people realize, or than common-sense understanding takes into account. The most basic and constant motives which influence our actions are unconscious, that is, difficult to acknowledge or avow. Such motives are residues of encounters with significant persons and situations from the past, often reaching back to early childhood; and they operate not to achieve realistic satisfaction, but rather to secure a form of pacification through representation. When we interpret what others say and do we apply these patterns of satisfaction and pacification to explain their behaviour; and in so far as we succeed in understanding others in this way we support the patterns as empirical generalization. While we recognize that pacification consequent on genuine satisfaction is deeper and more lasting than that effected by representation alone, we also know that human desire outruns opportunities for satisfaction to such an extent that pacification via imagination is common. This is a view which psychoanalysis radically extends. This understanding of the mind enabled Freud to give psychological accounts of neurosis and psychosis, and to explicate how the past gives significance to the present in normal mental functioning. Past desires, even those of infancy, are not psychologically lost; rather they are continually re-articulated through symbolism, so as to direct action towards their representational pacification throughout life. In this Freud provides both a radically holistic account of the causation of action and a naturalistic description of the generation of meaning in life. New goals acquire significance as representatives of the unremembered objects of our earliest and most visceral passions; and the depth of satisfaction we feel in present accomplishments flows from their unacknowledged pacification of unknown desires from the distant past. Thus, paradoxically, significant desires can remain forever flexible, renewable and satisfiable in their expressions, precisely because they are immutable, frustrated and unrelenting at the root.",

      "title": "Personal identity",
      "abstract": "What is it to be the same person today as one was in the past, or will be in the future? How are we to describe cases in which (as we might put it) one person becomes two? What, if anything, do the answers to such questions show about the rationality of the importance we attach to personal identity? Is identity really the justifier of the special concern which we have for ourselves in the future? These are the concerns of this entry. In order to answer the question about the persistence-conditions of persons we must indulge in some thought experiments. Only thus can we tease apart the strands that compose our concept of personal identity, and thereby come to appreciate the relative importance of each strand. There are plausible arguments against attempts to see the relation of personal identity as constitutively determined by the physical relations of same body, or same brain. I can survive with a new body, and a new brain. But it does not follow; nor is it true, that a person’s identity over time can be analysed exclusively in terms of psychological relations (relations of memory, belief, character, and so on). To the contrary, the most plausible view appears to be a mixed view, according to which personal identity has to be understood in terms of both physical and psychological relations. This is the view which can be extracted from our core (that is, minimally controversial) set of common-sense beliefs about personal identity. The possibility of the fission of persons– the possibility that, for example, a person’s brain hemispheres might be divided and transplanted into two new bodies – shows that the mixed view has to incorporate a non-branching or uniqueness clause in its analysis. The concept of personal identity, contrary to what we might first be inclined to believe, is an extrinsic concept (that is, whether a given person exists can depend upon the existence of another, causally unrelated, person). Some philosophers have recently tried to forge an important connection between theories of personal identity and value theory (ethics and rationality). The possibility of such a connection had not previously been investigated in any detail. It has been argued that, on the correct theory of personal identity, it is not identity that matters but the preservation of psychological relations such as memory and character. These relations can hold between one earlier person and two or more later persons. They can also hold to varying degrees (for example, I can acquire a more or less different character over a period of years). This view of what matters has implications for certain theories of punishment. A now reformed criminal may deserve less or no punishment for the crimes of their earlier criminal self. Discussions of personal identity have also provided a new perspective on the debate between utilitarianism and its critics.",

      "title": "On the Counterfactual Dimension of Negative Liberty",
      "abstract": "This article explores some implications of the counterfactual aspect of freedom and unfreedom. Because actions can be unprevented even if they are not undertaken, and conversely because actions can be prevented even if they are not attempted and are thus not overtly thwarted, any adequate account of negative liberty must ponder numerous counterfactual chains of events. Each person's freedom or unfreedom is affected not only by what others in fact do, but also by what they are disposed to do. Their dispositions play a key role in determining whether the abilities and inabilities of each person would continue as such if the person's conduct or situation were altered in various respects. Until one knows whether people would or would not have acted in certain ways if a given person had sought to do something, one cannot know whether that person was free to do that thing. Nor can one know whether the person was free to perform that action in combination with manifold subsequent actions. Thus, whether tacit or explicit, counterfactual scenarios are indispensable for any enquiry into a person's liberty. By relying (albeit perhaps only implicitly) on such scenarios, which trace how people are disposed to act vis-a-vis one another, one takes account of the central role of unmanifested dispositions in setting the bounds of people's sociopolitical freedom. Among the principal theorists whose work is critically examined in this article are Hillel Steiner, Ian Carter, and G.A. Cohen.",

Previously it was believed that a person has only five senses: hearing, touch, vision, smell and taste. Then, people usually say «he has sixth sense» about those with intuition. And now at the present stage, scientists recognize the presence of more than 20 senses in a person. For example, a person is able to feel changes in the temperature of surrounding objects and air, to analyze the degree of limb flexion, to feel the empty stomach or fullness of the bladder. Thus, there can be pain, vibration, gravitation, visceral sensitivity, and so on. Many feelings have already been well studied, but there are those that no one knows about. Therefore, scientists continue to work on the study of human feelings, sensitivity and their properties.",

However, like other animals we also follow an internal rhythm. This endogenous rhythm, which follows a period of nearly 24 hours, drives sleep-wake cycles, modifications in body temperature and other physiologic parameters; but many decades ago, time-isolation experiments showed that humans have a natural tendency to sleep at a slightly different frequency from the most adaptive 24-hour rhythm. This circadian rhythm is closer to 25 hours and has to be reset each day – by zeitgebers or external cues. The circadian rhythm links sleep behavior to body temperature: body temperature decreases, not only as a function of circadian rhythm phase, but also as a function of sleep. When a person is asleep, central control of body temperature is decreased, and at certain sleep stages when this control is suspended the body relies on an equilibrium with its environment.",

      "abstract": "One intersection between studies of and of disaster, that is seldom theoretically explored, is temporal delimitation. The well-known before–during–after trichotomisation of disaster studies is an indication of the inherent temporariness of disasters. Organization, on the other hand, is usually associated with stability and continuity. However, temporary aspects of have during recent decades attracted increased attention from researchers. In this paper, disaster management is regarded as a form of temporary organization. The aim of the paper is to provide a categorisation of different forms of temporary in which different aspects of disaster management can be placed. In connection with a recent discussion in organizational sociology, organization is here regarded as a form of social order (comparable with other social orders, like institution and network) rather than as a formal social structure; a phenomenon can be organized to different degrees, and some phenomena are only partially organized. The least common denominator of is that it is a decided order. Without a decision, no organization, not even a partial one. Here, a distinction is made between full and different forms of partial organization, the latter consisting of mixes of and other social orders; a phenomenon may be a mix of and institution (if it, e.g., rests heavily on rules, norms and beliefs) or a mix of and network (if it lacks a clear formal hierarchy). Organization is a widespread form of social order. Many such phenomena are temporally delimited. Here a distinction is made, regarding the nature of temporariness, between known and unknown time-frames. The latter (when it is not known when a phenomenon will take place) is characterised by a higher degree of uncertainty. Disaster management belong to this category. Different aspects of disaster management are analysed with this theoretical framework.",

This latter circumstance display us the fact that social objects, for which construction is necessary, depends on social acts, whose inscription constitutes the object. As I show through the law Object = Inscribed Act, social objects consist in the recording of acts that encompass at least two people, and are characterized by being inscribed, on a physical substrate what so ever, from marble to neurons, passing through paper and computers. If all this is true, then a theory of social objects develops naturally into a theory of the document, understood as an inquire centered on the definition of what I call “documentality”, namely the properties that constitute, in each case, the necessary and sufficient conditions to be a social object.

      "abstract": "The question I shall consider is whether there are any mental causes, that is, whether there is anything which is both a state of mind and a cause of other mental or physical happenings. The obvious common-sense answer to this question is Yes. In ordinary discourse (that is, outside philosophy and psychology) we constantly refer to human actions and experiences in what appears to be causal language; we seem to be saying that some states of mind are causes of other states of mind, and of some bodily activities. Sometimes we do this by using the word ‘cause’ itself— ‘His driving into the ditch was caused by his seeing a child run into the road’, ‘The cause of his silence was his wish to protect his friend’. More often we use expressions which in physical contexts are admittedly causal— ‘A glimpse of the look on her face made him hesitate’, ‘Ambition was the driving force of his career’. Most philosophers have taken for granted the genuineness of these causal attributions. But recently it has been frequently denied that any state of mind can be properly described as the cause either of other states of mind or of physical occurrences, at any rate if by a state of mind one means a state of consciousness. Some philosophers who deny this are materialists, advocates of the Unity of Science. They believe that everything that happens in the universe can be causally accounted for by reference to a single set of fundamental laws, the laws of physics, and since a state of consciousness is not, as such, a physical state of any kind, it cannot have a place in the causal explanation of any event, and must be an epiphenomenon. Others are believers in an indeterminist interpretation of human freedom, and hold that o t introduce the category of cause and effect into the explanation of human actions is to deny that there is any genuine free will. I shall not be concerned with either of these general metaphysical objections, neither of which convinces me; but I shall consider some more specific objections to the admission of particular sorts of mental causes.",

      "title": "On the Concept of Basic Trust",
      "abstract": "In sociology, psychology and also in philosophy trust is often taken be basic or fundamental in the sense that only trust allows us to be and engage in the world, to develop a healthy ego-identity or to gain knowledge about other people’s opinions. Without basic trust in the world, in others or in other’s testimony, that is, we would not, as Luhmann says, get up in the morning, we would lack the self-confidence necessary to interact with others or would be unable to take their statements as trustworthy which seems to be a prerequisite for all learning processes. I question this model of basic trust not necessarily because I find it wrong but because I find it less informative than is often assumed. The fuzzy notion of trust gains in semantic richness and distinctivess, I assume, if we “defundamentalize” it and accept it as always surrounded by alternative psychological and emotional attitudes. Trust is thus treated as an achievement never to be taken for granted though easily naturalized. Following some conceptual clarifications I discuss phenomena such as violence and terror in order to clarify in what ways they destroy basic trust. This also opens the possibility to historicize trust and treat it less as an anthropological or psychological given.",

      "abstract": "According to a widely used definition, pollution is ‘the introduction by humans into the environment of substances or energy liable to cause hazards to human health, harm to living resources and ecological systems, damage to structures or amenity, or interference with legitimate uses of the environment’. Inreflecting common uses of the word ‘pollution’ the definition also reflects the different, and sometimes competing, rationales for its regulation. Thus, on the one hand, it indicates that by ‘pollution’ some are put in mind principally of what, in affecting the natural world, does harm to humans (and speciically to their ‘health’, and to the ‘legitimate uses of’ and the ‘living resources’ and ‘amenity’ they find in the environment). On the other hand, however, it recognises that others use ‘pollution’ to describe not only what adversely affects humans through affecting the environment, but to describe in addition what, quite simply, adversely affects the environment; thus there is reference to harm not only to ‘living resources’ but also to ‘ecological systems’, and to damage not just to ‘amenity’, but also to ‘structures’ (not, as it might have been, ‘structures of value to humans’).",

In fact, body temperature is the best measure of this clock, because the two are very closely linked. Body temperature and alertness are normally at their daily lowest around 2–6am and at their highest around 6–8pm. The changes in alertness are seen in Figure 4, where alertness rises fairly quickly around the normal wake-up time, at about 7–8am, followed by a levelling off and, often, a small trough or ‘dip’ around mid- afternoon. There is a final rise to the evening peak, and then a fairly rapid fall up to bedtime and beyond.",

      "abstract": "Silence is an universal language. If there is anything that crosses multiple cultures, in ways that seem so familiar to anyone, this can be achieved by silence. The concept of silence does not need grammatical forms, declinations or accents, although it includes them on a subtle level, silence does not need, most of the time, translation, it goes without saying, because its peculiarities are predominantly emotional, and emotions are universal. Of course, there can be cultures of noise, just as, for example, there are cultures of silence, inclined towards an expression that includes to a very large extent the need for silence. In theatrical art, we cannot get rid of the “other” or the “others” – stage partner, audience, director, etc. The profile of a so-called “other” is a hypostasis that seems to offer a more intimate setting, a direct connection, without witnesses, that moment of wholeness to which a man, from time to time, aspires. The silent being attracts the being in need of an answer. Is “the other” a foreign, separate, culturally or metaphorically distanced formula? This study aims to x-ray moments where the other (either a character, a state, a world, etc.) meets another and decides to “complete” him, to adhere to each other's world, or, on the contrary, to cause him to distance himself and close himself in his own world. The gaze cast at the “other” is a glance thrown beyond the boundaries of one's own person – the gaze of one is silently linked to the gaze of the other.",

      "title": "The Variety of Emotions",
      "abstract": "A remarkable fact about natural languages is their high articulation about emotions. In speaking about people's beliefs, we always mention or assume a particular content: Amos believes that the pliers are in the toolbox. It is virtually uninformative to say simply that Amos believes, unless the context supplies implicit reference to what is believed; and the same goes for the variants of belief: doubt, conjecture, strong conviction, and so on. Desire is in a like case. To speak significantly of desire is to designate some more or less particular desired thing, action, or state of affairs, or to exploit a context that makes this clear. Amos wants (desires, wishes for) a pair of pliers. It is almost uninformative about Amos's state of mind to say simply, “Amos desires.” By contrast, to hear that Amos is angry, afraid, or contrite is to receive significant information about his state of mind, quite apart from knowing what Amos is angry about or afraid of. By the account given in Section 2.5c, this informativeness can be explained in terms of the two kinds of propositional content of relatively mature human beings' paradigm emotions. Even if we do not know the material proposition forming Amos's emotion – that Jeremy has maliciously hidden my pliers just when I need them – if we know his emotion is anger, we know a great deal about his state of mind because we know anger's defining proposition.",

In ordinary human discourse, information communication is generally more complex than the transmission and reception of a single message. Information is essentially not possible to model, since it is totally dependent on context and the prior knowledge of the persons or systems sending or receiving the information. Information value can be computed in simple situations, but with imperfect research and complex multivariable problems if becomes essentially impossible. An important property of the human nervous system is that information is coded as a logarithmic function of the physical property of the stimulus. More specifically, it is coded according to a metric on stimulus force or energy that is approximately a logarithmic function (or related inverse exponential function).",

      "abstract": "Five qualities have given man his ability to realize his full human potential: 1) an innate predisposition to gregarious life, 2) an aggressive instinct, 3) an aptitude for insight, 4) a capacity for gaining extensive knowledge and skills which are at his disposal independent of instinctual drives, and 5) an urge to acquire speech, enabling him to establish a second signal system as the basis of the unique human form of consciousness. The combination of the qualities 3, 4, and 5 are, as it were, man's accessories in his struggle for existence, and can be used to serve his aggressive needs. - Every cultural development leads in the course of generations to an increase of intellectual awareness, because an increasing share of indispensable knowledge must be passed on verbally. At the same time the importance of direct, practical first-hand experience and imitative learning declines. Especially for those men whose occupations primarily involve theoretical activities a discordance arises between the world of their imaginations and consciously-controlled ways of thought and behaviour on the one hand, and their endothymic impulses, moods and feelings (which mostly originate from the innate predisposition for gregarious life) on the other. If rationalistic processes predominate in shaping forms of social interaction, man will have to manipulate the behaviour of his fellow-men as well as his own mental capacities for emotional distancing, disregarding or even violating the incalculable \"endothymic\" part of his being. That may have disastrous effects.",

Mental health refers to our overall psychological well-being. It includes the way we feel about our self, the quality of our relationships, and our ability to manage our feelings and deal with difficulties. Good mental health isn’t just the absence of mental health problems. People who are emotionally or mentally healthy are in control of their emotions and their behavior. They are able to handle life’s challenges, build strong relationships, and recover from setbacks. Positive mental health is a state of well-being in which we realize our abilities, can cope with life’s normal stresses, and can work regularly and productively. Physical health means a good body health, which is healthy because of regular physical activity, good nutrition, and adequate rest. Physical health can be determined by considering someone’s height/weight ratio, their Body Mass Index. Another term for physical health is physical wellbeing. Physical wellbeing is defined as something a person can achieve by developing all health-related components of his/her lifestyle. It can be concluded that mental and physical health is fundamentally linked. There are multiple associations between mental health and chronic physical conditions that significantly impact people’s quality of life. Just as physical fitness helps our bodies to stay strong, mental fitness helps us to achieve and sustain a state of good mental health. When we are mentally healthy, we enjoy our life and environment, and the people in it.",

      "title": "Developing the Ego-Ideal of High School Students",
      "abstract": "The of individuals is the single element found in the personality structure of individuals that either fosters or prevents delinquency and crime; so if our goal in the high school is to prevent delinquency and crime it begins with the development of a satisfactory ego-ideal. It is the basic element in Third Force Psychology that explains the dynamics underlying all human behavior (Cassel, 2000; & Rogers and Dymond, 1954). The specific attributes and nature of an ego-ideal that prevents crime is always intimately related to the particular form of government an individual is expected to live and thrive in. For living effectively in a democracy it has to do with a meaningful configuration of some of the following: 1. First and foremost freedom to be one's self and to break away from dependence on all others, and to be able to make own decisions in a more or less scientific fashion. 2. Second, and equally important, is the ability and willingness to be a team member, playing daily roles in such a fashion that the whole is always greater than the sum of it's parts. It must be recognized and accepted that no team is ever stronger than the weakest member, so that each member must be assigned to make full use of talents possessed. 3. Third, that all individuals are equal and that each and ever one must fully recognize that equality and with full acceptance of the other, but that we are all human beings; each with our own particular weaknesses and strengths; so that in full team fashion one's strengths are emphasized and weaknesses are minimized. 4. Finally, there is the matter of play and honesty in a never ending episode that is always adapted to one's daily life and the conditions that emerge in special situations. Trustworthiness derives almost solely from honesty and fair play, and it is the most basic requisite for success in a democracy. Adolescent Years The adolescent years of individuals are typically associated with growing pains and with change, and the dream and desire of early becoming an adult; as only adults are free to make life choices. The typical high school in a democracy includes our youth between 14 and 18 years of age, the period of adolescence when change is the order of the clay and stability in life is often a dream away. It is during these years when typically the ego-ideal is being formulated and developed, and whether it is acceptable or not is determined by the success or failure of the individuals involved. Assessing the Ego-Status In true scientific fashion the effective fashioning of one's ego-ideal begins with some realistic assessment of the present ego-status of each and every individual involved. This is not to be a subjective estimate by a counselor or school psychologist, but rather the use of sound and effective psychological tests that seek to uncover the attributes that depict such critical elements as: (1) Personal maturity, (2) social integration, and (3) the presence and nature of cognitive dissonance Democratic Maturity The Democratic Maturity Test (DEMO) has been developed for purposes of assessing in scientific fashion the Personal Maturity and Social Integration of individuals (Cassel & Chow, 2000). It is based solidly on the definition of John Dewey for a democracy--The of independent individuals. The personal maturity part of DEMO has to do with assessing the independence factor, and the social integration with the interdependence element in the Dewey definition. Cognitive Dissonance The Cognitive Dissonance Test (DISS) has been developed to assess the presence of cognitive dissonance (unconscious type of hurts) that lie deep in the unconscious, and which are typically created by the presence of personal needs that have not been well gratified (Cassel & Chow, 2000). The purpose of the testis to bring those hurts to the conscious level so that individuals can find ways and means to gratify personal needs responsible for the dissonance. …",

      "abstract": "We develop a general method to solve models of interactions between multiple and possibly strategic agents. Our model explains apparently irrational or biased behaviors in a person. We argue that these actions could result from several rational structures having different goals. Our main example is a model of three agents, \"conscious\", \"unconscious\", and \"body\". Our main result states that, for an agent whose unconscious and conscious goals differ, the unconscious may influence the conscious, either directly or indirectly, via a third agent, the body. This three-agent model describes behaviors such as craving, excessive smoking, or sleepiness, to delay or dismiss a task. One of the main result shows that the unconscious' strategic action crucially depends on whether the conscious' actions are complementary in time. When complementary, and if the conscious is not sensitive to unconscious' messages, the unconscious may drive the conscious towards its goals by blurring physical needs. When not complementary, the unconscious may more easily reach his goal by influencing the conscious, be it directly or indirectly.",

For most of human evolutionary history, we have faced threats in the domains of predation, conspecific violence, contagion, status loss, and dangerous nonliving environmental features. We thus very easily acquire fears directed toward threats from these domains. This chapter argues that the nonrandom distribution of human fears is reflected in horror, which features stimuli that mirror evolved fears, often in incarnations that are exaggerated and/or counterintuitive for increased salience, including giant spiders, supernormal monsters such as evil clowns, and physics-violating ghosts. Many monsters are also equipped with contagion cues, thus exploiting an evolved disgust mechanism. Some monsters evoke moral disgust through their violation of norms. To strengthen audiences’ emotional responses to such monsters, horror artists often provide descriptions of characters’ reactions which are mirrored by the audience through an adaptive mechanism enabling emotional contagion.",

The tongue is able to cut and tear hearts without harming anyone's body. The tongue is sharper than a sword, which means we have to be careful in every word we say so as not to harm ourselves. The sin of the tongue is a sin that comes out of the mouth and is expressed in words that offend other people's feelings. Language is only a small part, but language can also detect a person's physical condition through speech like the one above. This means that someone can find out whether another person is an adult or not, all of this can be known through their words. With his tongue, man praises God's name, but with the same tongue, he curses creatures created in the image and likeness of God. It is in the same language that blessings and curses come (James 3: 1-12), where James emphasizes: \"My brothers, this must not happen to you\" (James 3: 1-12). James reminds Christians who are teachers to be careful in their words, because being a teacher is very difficult (James 3:-1). Christians must control their pronunciation, because they cannot avoid making mistakes in the words that come out of their mouths, because this can have positive and negative impacts.

      "title": "The psychology of volition",
      "abstract": "Volition can be studied from two perspectives. From the third-person view, volitional behaviour is internally generated, rather than being determined by the immediate environmental context, and is therefore, to some extent, unpredictable. Such behaviour is not unique to humans, since it is seen in many other species including invertebrates. From the first-person view, our experience of volitional behaviour includes a vivid sense of agency. We feel that, through our intentions, we can cause things to happen and we can choose between different actions. Our experience of agency is not direct. It depends on sub-personal inferences derived from prior expectations and sensations associated with movement. As a result, our experiences and intuitions about volition can be unreliable and uncertain. Nevertheless, our experience of agency is not a mere epiphenomenon. Anticipation of the regret we might feel after making the wrong choice can alter behaviour. Furthermore, the strong sense of responsibility, associated with agency, has a critical role in creating social cohesion and group benefits. We can only study the experience of agency in humans who can describe their experiences. The discussion of the experience of volition, that introspection and communication make possible, can change our experience of volitional actions. As a result, agency, regret and responsibility are cultural phenomena that are unique to humans.",

There is a need for phenomenological descriptions of these experiences and the ways in which they differ from culturally defined psychopathological states. In this semi-structured interview study, eight congregants attending an evangelical church in London were asked to describe their experiences of God communicating with them. Communications from God were related to current events rather than to the prediction of future events. These communications were received as thoughts and do not generally reveal metaphysical insights, but rather they relate to the mundane world. They provided direction, consolation and empowerment in the lives of those receiving them. Individuals recounted that on occasion God sometimes speaks audibly, or accompanied by supernatural phenomena, but in the vast majority of cases, the way God speaks is through thoughts or impressions. In all instances, agency is maintained, individuals can choose to obey the thoughts/voices or not. The findings are discussed in relation to externalisation of agency and the phenomenon of thought insertion in schizophrenia.",

When genuine social interaction is lacking, individuals may seek out or use sources of interaction that co-opt agency detection mechanisms vis-à-vis the human voice and images of people, called social snacking. Study 1 ( N = 240) found that ratings of how alone participants felt were correlated with frequency of talking to themselves and using the TV for company. Study 2 ( N = 66) was a daily diary study where loneliness was correlated with both Study 1 behaviors and singing to oneself. These solutions essentially trick the person's brain into feeling like they are socially interacting, thus, appeasing the relative dependence humans have on social interaction. Social snacking may satisfy one's need for social interaction because humans are unlikely to be able to differentiate between virtual and real people because this distinction did not exist in ancestral environments.",

Any character included in the system, has certain characteristics taking into account the opportunities of its combination with other characters (inscriptions, utterances) of the system. Signs are always directly related to subjects they denote. However, we should always remember that symbols are associates with both verbal and non-verbal ways of denotation. The latter include, for example, the pictorial image, motion or gesture. The level of abstractness in sign systems complicates denotation process itself. How, for example, should one show the cold character of a subject or express joy in non-verbal system of denotation? Is the expression of certain emotions equivalent to emotions themselves and is it always possible to change their expression into their illustration? Syntactic, semantic and pragmatic aspects are compulsory for constructing the scheme of any sign system. The main problem is rooted not in the plane of construction, but in the plane of functioning of the given system in which exemplification as a way of symbolizing, proposed by Nelson Goodman in notation theory, plays a key role.",

Adults are “such moral creatures,” he wrote, “that we invariably react to any generalization regarding human behavior … with questions of immediate applicability to conduct.”1 Judging others quickly, adults neglect to ask what human needs they might understand if, on witnessing others’ behavior, they would first try to understand the meaning of such behavior. Instead, they draw conclusions, assign blame, and prescribe remedies. By middle age in particular, superego development has taken its adult as prisoner, leading adults to fear that in their expected-to-be-perfect state, they are far from being as good as they should be, as far as childhood is now distant from the self. As Erikson had illustrated in his prejudice imagery, this leads to self-judgment, to the magnifying of others’ quirks, and to the defensive projection of real or feared flaws onto others. Observed flaws are one’s negative identity; they come from and are deflected backward onto the accusing self.",

These ordering activities meet resistance when overweight people stop dieting and/or define overweight as a personal choice and themselves as good enough, or even healthy and beautiful.

      "title": "Whose Sati?: Widow Burning in Early 19th Century India",
      "abstract": "Whose Sati? Widow Burning in Early 19th Century India Anand A. Yang Intentionally interrogatory, the title of this essay emphasizes the speculative nature of my remarks regarding the phenomenon of sati. Derived from the Sanskrit term for pure or chaste (sef)—the very term \"sati,\" therefore, is a misnomer—sati has come to signify both the act of immolation of a wife on the funeral pyre of her husband (in some areas a widow was buried with her deceased husband or took poison) and the victim herself rather than its original meaning of \"a virtuous woman.\"1 Generally, a woman was burnt together with her deceased husband, a practice termed sahamarana or sahagamana (dying together with). But if concremation was not possible, such as when a husband died in a distant place or a woman's pregnancy required that she wait till after delivery, a sati conformed to the practice of anumarana or anugamana: burning with the husband's ashes or with some other memento representing him, for example, his sandals, turban, or piece of clothing. * The title also has another meaning, a double trajectory: an interrogation of the historical literature on the subject and an interrogation of sati as a practice involving women of different times, places, and backgrounds. Both lines of inquiry seek to converge on the same objective: better questions and answers regarding the phenomenon of sati. Hitherto, much of the literature on sati has tended to favor an institutional approach.3 Not surprisingly, the most familiar aspect of sati is the British campaign against it culminating in the promulgation of Regulation XVII in 1829 \"declaring the practice of suttee, or of burning or burying alive the widows of Hindus, illegal and punishable by the criminal courts.\"4 Viewed from this angle, the history of sati has been appropriated by some scholars to represent the beginnings of \"a deliberate policy of modernizing and westernizing Indian society,\" as embodied in the person and policies of Governor-General Lord Bentinck who directed the official campaign against sati, and in the emergence of a Bengal \"Renaissance\" under the guiding hand of the \"Father of Modern India,\" Raja Rammohun Roy, who acted as the Indian architect of this and other social reforms.s The legislative prohibition of sati has also \"become a founding moment in the history of women in modern India.\" To continue in the words of this scholar, colonial rule, with its moral civilizing claims, is said to have provided the contexts for a thoroughgoing re-evaluation of Indian \"tradition\" along lines more consonant with the \"modern\" economy and society ©1989 Journal of Women-s History, Vol. ι No. 2 (Fall)____________________ 1989 Anand A. Yang believed to have been the consequence of India's incorporation into the capitalist world system. In other words, even the most antiimperialist amongst us has felt forced to acknowledge the \"positive\" consequences of colonial rule for certain aspects of women's lives, if not in terms of actual practice, at least at the level of ideas about \"women's rights.\"6 But as Lata Mani's deconstruction of the colonial discourse on sati reveals, women were neither the subjects nor the objects of this discourse, \"but rather the grounds of the discourse on sati .... For the British, rescuing women becomes part of the civilizing mission. For the indigenous elite, protection of their status or its reform becomes an urgent necessity, in terms of the honor of the collective—religious or national.\"7 For the political and ideological context in which the government campaign for social reforms was waged, whether focusing on sati, infanticide , lhagi (ritual murder), or human sacrifice, aimed at entitling the British with the right to proclaim the superiority of their own values, and ultimately , to justify their right to rule. Only they could usher in the morality they found wanting in the indigenous civilization. Consider the tenor of the following government pronouncement on sati: Of the rite itself, of its horror and abomination not a word need be said. Every rational and civilized being must feel anxious for the termination of a practice so abhorrent from humanity. . . . But to the christian and to the Englishman, who by tolerating sanctions, and by...",

Third, they have cherished various systems of beliefs an eternal search for philosophic or religious serenity.

Since they believe the activity of looking to be intrusive and devouring, hence dangerous, transparent screens are interposed between self and other, and serve as protective barriers. These screens function intrapsychically as well, to split off or hide those aspects of the self felt to be unacceptable. The analyst may witness the failure of the screen in several ways: it may create too great a distance, isolating the individual and keeping him from life; it may become contaminated by projections and turn into a persecutor, or trap the individual, a state of intolerable claustrophobia; most dramatically, it may suddenly shatter.

This disharmony was also manifested in that the CS appeared to act in the same manner as the US. On this basis a neurodynamic theory of the mechanism of mescaline's actions is postulated: that under mescaline intoxication and in some mental illnesses, a dissociation of the second and first signaling systems and the unconditional reflexes occurs in which each signaling system acts as if it were the same as the more primitive system on which it is based. The secondary signals—words and ideas—come to act like the primary signals of sensations and direct impressions of reality. This theory may help explain certain psychological phenomena, e.g. dreams, hysteria, compulsions, delusions, and hallucinations. While the content of these phenomena depends on the personality of the subject and all the environmental factors that determine this personality, their mechanisms are physiological, regardless of whether one prefers a pathophysiologic or psychogenic etiology. Based on our experimental findings and the work of others, a neurodynamic pathogenesis of the psychological effects of mescaline is described.",

The latter is called immediate consciousness. Empirical, or natural, knowledge is acquired by being passed from an individual and momentary observation towards a collective and temporal universe. This is a change from absolute truth to probabilistic knowledge. Seven basic hypotheses are presented to permit knowledge of the probabilistic universe. I have chosen an emergentist explanation for this universe, with an evolutionary explanation in terms of increasing levels. I observe presently different levels and I move simultaneously between these levels with causal interaction. Therefore, there is only one universe. In most animals there is a level called organism, a level which encompasses the whole animal. In human beings and in some nonhuman animals, there is a small part which knows itself. This part is called mediate consciousness. Mediate consciousness is the observer's own past consciousness (observer's mediate consciousness) or part of the organism of other persons or nonhuman animals (other's mediate consciousness). Research on others' mediate consciousness is similar to research on any other part of animals. In this case, others’ mediate consciousness is a part of an authentic universal occurence.",

      "abstract": "Extrastriatal visual cortex is known to exhibit distinct response profiles to complex stimuli of varying ecological importance (e.g., faces, scenes, and tools). The dominant interpretation of these effects is that they reflect activation of distinct \"category-selective\" brain regions specialized to represent these and other stimulus categories. We sought to explore an alternative perspective: that the response to these stimuli is determined less by whether they form distinct categories, and more by their relevance to different forms of natural behavior. In this regard, food is an interesting test case, since it is primarily distinguished from other objects by its edibility, not its appearance, and there is evidence of food-selectivity in human visual cortex. Food is also associated with a common behavior, eating, and food consumption typically also involves the manipulation of food, often with the hands. In this context, food items share many properties in common with tools: they are graspable objects that we manipulate in self-directed and stereotyped forms of action. Thus, food items may be preferentially represented in extrastriatal visual cortex in part because of these shared affordance properties, rather than because they reflect a wholly distinct kind of category. We conducted fMRI and behavioral experiments to test this hypothesis. We found that behaviorally graspable food items and tools were judged to be similar in their action-related properties, and that the location, magnitude, and patterns of neural responses for images of graspable food items were similar in profile to the responses for tool stimuli. Our findings suggest that food-selectivity may reflect the behavioral affordances of food items rather than a distinct form of category-selectivity.",

In the lack of self-image, an individual cannot feel self-conscious, ashamed, guilty, or embarrassed.

      "abstract": "When does the second half of life begin? Jung and his associates at one time considered that it began at around the age of 35. Freud thought that no one over 50 years old could benefit from analytic treatment. Who is it, today, who decides when we are regarded or designated as being middle aged and when we are seen as being old? To what extent is this culturally or psychologically determined? To what extent are our attitudes determined internally and subjectively as opposed to externally and objectively? These factors almost certainly influence our expectations. Many people do not look forward to their own ageing. The ageing process is inevitable but not popular. Generally it is assumed to be associated with a deteriorating process, with perhaps a few compensations, if one is fortunate. Perhaps age is like beauty, as Hungerford (1878) put it 'in the eye of the beholder' – in other words, much is projected by the beholder, whether the latter is an individual or society in general. As with the young, each older person is unique. The author has, therefore, deliberately moved freely between writing about the middle aged and the old, because there is no clear dividing line. To use the rule of chronological years is too simplistic.",

The first one relates to human declarations and commitments, while the second relates to the value actually realized. They indicate that health (e.g. socio-mental) is the greatest treasure of immeasurable value in human life, and at the same time actively diminishes its weight, in favor of other, subjective values. It often turns out that, for example, physical health only becomes a significant value when it is lost or when a disease appears that hinders proper functioning and the achievement of life goals. Body and health are the categories underlying lifelong education, a specific problem/issue in the field of education for old age (care and medical staff), to old age (the whole society), through old age (from the youngest generation) and education in old age (older people). The article attempts to define the contemporary framework of discourses about the body and health, as well as the directions of theoretical analyses (contexts) and to outline practical referencesin the areas of the mentioned forms of education.",

      "abstract": "We too often forget that the way words and other symbols are used is of vast importance and significance. The fabric of literature and history, of politics and philosophy-the whole structure of moder science-all depend in large measure upon the proper use of the words and symbols without which none of them have any substance or reality. In a very real sense, education, at least higher education, consists mainly of language courses, not merely languages like English and French and Spanish, but the languages of mathematics, physics, chemistry, and biology, of history, politics, and philosophy. Most literate people know the elementary rules that govern the rational use of words and symbols-the so-called laws of identity, contradiction, excluded middle and sufficient reason. They know how to identify and perhaps to avoid the more common fallacies of begging the question: ambiguity, accident and evasion, of non-sequitur and post hoc ergo propter hoc. They know or should know too how treacherous are all universals and either or propositions. more thing we need to remember about words and their usea use that transcends formal rules of science and logic: Words do express feelings, fear and hope, love and hate. Hayakawa, in his book, Language in Action, says that statements like John is a good boy are more properly called snarl and purr expressions. Human beings, he says, probably because they consider it beneath their dignity to express anger in purely animalistic noises, do not ordinarily growl like dogs, but substitute words such as, 'You dirty double-crosser!' 'You filthy scum!' Similarly, instead of purring or wagging the tail the human being again substitutes speeches such as, 'She's the sweetest girl in all the world,' or 'Oh, dear, what a cute baby!' More often than not words like Reds, Wall Street, Economic royalists, are snarl words while expressions like Free Enterprise, the Common Man, the New Deal, One World, may be classified as purr words. They do not offer reliable descriptions of objects or events in the outer world, but serve mainly to indicate symptoms of disturbance, unpleasant or pleasant, in the speaker. To a very large extent recent public discussion, both on the international and the domestic plane, has been a succession of snarl sessions.

      "abstract": "The term \"regression\" refers to events in which an individual changes from his or her present level of maturity and regains mental and behavioral characteristics shown at an earlier point in development. This definition has remained constant for over a century, but the implications of the concept have changed systematically from a perspective in which regression was considered pathological, to a current view in which regression may be seen as a positive step in psychotherapy or as a part of normal development. The concept of regression, famously employed by Sigmund Freud and others in his circle, derived from ideas suggested by Herbert Spencer and by John Hughlings Jackson. By the 1940s and '50s, the regression concept was applied by Winnicott and others in treatment of disturbed children and in adult psychotherapy. In addition, behavioral regression came to be seen as a part of a normal developmental trajectory, with a focus on expectable variability. The present article examines historical changes in the regression concept in terms of mapping to biomedical or other metaphors, in terms of a movement from earlier nativism toward an increased environmentalism in psychology, and with respect to other historical factors such as wartime events. The role of dominant metaphors in shifting perspectives on regression is described.",

The purpose of this presented work is to (a) list and describe these 25 Life APPs, (b) show how they can be interspersed into standard physiology courses, and (c) to offer a currently used “Matching Quiz”, constructed within Brightspace (D2L), as an aid in students in learning these concepts. The 25 Life APPs include the “top ten”: Positive and Negative Feedback; Structure and Function relationships; Mortality vs Morbidity; Physiology as Applied Physics; Acute vs Chronic actions, Symptoms or Signs vs Causes; Human Body was better optimized for past environmental conditions; Effects of biological rhythms on general physiology; Primary Effect vs Side Effects; Why do most people think that the average female body is physically inferior to the average male body and why they are wrong. The remaining fifteen Life APPs are: Why some biological processes are simple and others complex; Why all sustained evolved structures have both advantages and disadvantages; Why various biological processes and organisms evolve; You, Free Will and Consciousness; How we know what is real or true vs false; Where the mind stops and the brain or body begins; Prevention over Correction; Redundancy aids in Safety; Difficulties of Borders and Interfaces; The ABCs of critical care; Defining death; Digestive consequences of having evolved in a different environment; GI track optimized for symbiotic bacteria; Why so many bad side effects when we take medicines to solve primary medical issues; Why these Life AAPs are worth remembering. These 25 Life APPs are integrated into he presentations within a 1 st year 2 nd semester course in A&amp;P, as well as the advanced undergraduate course in animal or medical physiology at the University of Maine. They can be adapted, in part or in whole, to any undergraduate or graduate physiology course. They are easily modifiable or selectively parsed. In addition to interspersing them, where appropriate, into standard systems physiology courses, I either assign them or grant extra credit for completing them within a Matching Quiz embedded within Brightspace (D2L). How this is currently done will be demonstrated during the presentation. The author is willing and prepared to share their Brightspace courses used for both IN CLASS and ONLINE teaching. In sum, 25 unifying (physics, chemistry, biology, engineering, and all systems covered in physiology) concepts are described and coined as “Life APPs” (All Purpose Principles). These Life APPs have been integrated into standard lectures as well as in a stand-alone Brightspace Matching Quiz. These are made freely available to teachers of biology or physiology. There is no copyright on these Life APPS. There is no conflict of interest in the publication of this work. Private funding.

      "abstract": "Currently, we can observe a crisis of self and its respective weak ties with a group and lack of community bonds. All these make it that on the one hand there is a need for professional help, and on the other the effectiveness of such help is rated as low. The manners of empowering both he person, group and community are sought. We deal with such empowerment, among other things, at the level of self-help groups. Yet the source of that success should be sought not so much in the phenomenon of a group as in the very person and his activity. It is the person who thanks to his indispensable abilities can overcome biological and social limitations. Owing to self-help activity the person develops his abilities and frees himself from the sense of helplessness, powerlessness and hopelessness. The phenomenon of self-help activity requires that a new role and competence of the psychologist (and not only him) be defined in relation with self-help groups. On the one hand, he must be capable of arousing confidence in particular persons and groups to himself, to his own competencies, to use their own resources. On the other hand, he must be able to organize, facilitate and animate those social processes in which the division into the giving and the taking will be overcome. The reconstruction of a sense of community that is well underway in the self-help groups is an initial condition by which to join the broader trend of constructive social activities.",

      "title": "CURRENT ISSUES - PERSPECTIVES AND REVIEWS The Science of Animal Suffering",
      "abstract": "Can suffering in non-human animals be studied scientifically? Apart from verbal reports of subjective feelings, which are uniquely human, I argue that it is possible to study the negative emotions we refer to as suffering by the same methods we use in ourselves. In particular, by asking animals what they find positively and negatively reinforcing (what they want and do not want), we can define positive and negative emotional states. Such emotional states may or may not be accompanied by subjective feelings but fortunately it is not necessary to solve the problem of consciousness to construct a scientific study of suffering and welfare. Improvements in animal welfare can be based on the answers to two questions: Q1: Will it improve animal health? and Q2: Will it give the animals something they want? This apparently simple formulation has the advantage of capturing what most people mean by ‘improving welfare’ and so halting a potentially dangerous split between scientific and non-scientific definitions of welfare. It can also be used to validate other controversial approaches to welfare such as naturalness, stereotypies, physiological and biochemical measures. Health and what animals want are thus not just two of many measures of welfare. They provide the definition of welfare against which others can be validated. They also tell us what research we have to do and how we can judge whether welfare of animals has been genuinely improved. What is important, however, is for this research to be done in situ so that it is directly applicable to the real world of farming, the sea or an animal’s wild habitat. It is here that ethology can make major contributions.",

His use of the word \"autism\" was meant to convey this selfcontained quality but was, in some respects, an unfortunate choice of term since it introduced some confusion with the earlier use of the word, which described the idiosyncratic, self-centered thinking of schizophrenia. In addition to the problems in social interaction, Kanner noted the difficulties his patients had with many aspects of symbolization, abstraction, and communication. When language was present, it was remarkable for its literalness as well as other unusual aspects such as echolalia and pronoun reversal. In contrast to the child's lack of interest in the social world, Kanner noted that there was often a remarkable oversensitivity to the inanimate world, e.g., oversensitivites to sounds or other stimuli and sensitivity to even minor environmental changes. Kanner's description has proven remarkably enduring and remains the fundamental basis of current definitions of autism.",

      "title": "Self-Injurers as Loners: The Social Organization of Solitary Deviance",
      "abstract": "ABSTRACT In this paper we examine the social organization of people who deliberately destroy or damage their own body tissue without suicidal intent. Best and Luckenbill (Citation1982) have proposed two typologies of deviance performed by solitary actors: loners, who lack the regular association with fellow deviants and have no membership in a deviant subculture, and individual deviants, who are the actors and objects of their behaviors, yet socialize with others like them. Based on a convenience sample of 40 in-depth interviews with people who self-cut, burn, brand, scratch, bite, and bone-break, we describe and analyze the way their behaviors correspond to and differ from other forms of individual and loner deviance. Notes 1While people may do a variety of almost unimaginable things to themselves, such as self-amputating, drilling holes into their skulls, intentionally making themselves ill (Munchausen Syndrome), and decorating their bodies in extremely radical ways, these behaviors fall outside of the behaviors clinically associated with the specific syndrome known best at the turn of the twenty-first century as self-injury. We therefore restrict our focus to these practices not arbitrarily, but because they have been traditionally associated together in the medical literature and because they are performed by a constant group of people. In other words, people who intentionally make themselves ill or who cut off their limbs are not the same people who cut or burn themselves, and people who get tattooed or scarified come from a dramatically different etiology than people who self-injure, despite the fact that members of both groups may carve words or designs into themselves. These are different phenomena practiced by different people. 2Suyemoto and Macdonald (1995) also noted that most self-injurers desisted after adolescence. 3We were not permitted to interview participants under the age of 18 without parental consent, which blocked many current self-injurers from the study, as most ceased the behavior by the age of 18, and few under that age revealed their behavior to their parents. In addition, we were blocked from interviewing current students, who were the most frequent volunteers for our sample, and by making people wait a semester to be interviewed, we lost participants who transferred, moved away, or lost their nerve to participate in the research. 4Estimations of participants' cessation come from their own self-reports and may therefore not be completely accurate. 5They thus had many demographic similarities to the population of individuals with eating disorders. 6Some of the self-injurers we interviewed were neither loners nor individual deviants. Out of the 39 people we spoke with, three were clearly not loners because even though they performed the acts on themselves, they cut, branded, burned, or even electro-shocked themselves socially, in the company of one or more friends. Several more knew and spoke with others who self-injured, although their associations with them were deliberately limited. One of our participants was not an individual deviant, because he required the participation of others to perform the act (he and his friends held hands and electro-shocked themselves in a chain off of a generator or an electrical socket). These outliers are not the main focus of this paper, and they are probably rare, so for the main we will not include them in our descriptions and analyses. 7Some popular treatments that came to public attention leading up to or around this time included films such as \"Girl Interrupted,\" \"Nightmare on Elm Street III,\" and \"Secretary,\" television shows with episodes on cutting such as \"ER,\" documentary treatments on The Learning Channel, popular songs such as \"Hurt\" by Nine Inch Nails, \"Crawling\" by Linkin Park, \"Back to the Coast\" by Nikki Sudden, \"Last Resort\" by Papa Roach, and personal revelations from Richey Edwards, the guitarist and songwriter for Manic Street Preachers. See also Egan (Citation1997). 8Some of these included people such as Johnny Depp, Drew Barrymore, Angelina Jolie, Christina Ricci, Fiona Apple, Richey Edwards, Courtney Love, Marilyn Manson, Shirley Manson, Elizabeth Wurtzel, and Princess Diana. 9Hodgson (Citation2004) also talked about people who learned about self-injury from others as a route into the behavior. 10People weaned themselves from self-injury in much the same ways Granfield and Cloud (Citation1999) discussed drug addicts overcoming addiction without treatment. 11One social self-injurer was drawn in by a member of the other gender into a series of coupled sessions, where they cut and licked each others' blood. This was defined as very erotic. 12Rosenthal et al. (1972) found, in contrast, that over half of the 18 participants they studied made their cuts on Friday or Saturday nights, with another peak occurring on Wednesday afternoon. 13Favazza (1996) also noted that some self-injurers do not feel the pain from their body mutilation. 14Out of curiosity he used the knife later to try to cut himself. He wanted to experience the benefits of the self-injury firsthand. Yet, lacking the angst that brought most self-injurers to their behavior, all he got were some scars and a lot of pain. He offers an interesting example of a \"failed cutter.\" 15This sentiment clearly became more widespread, as self-injury diffused through the culture and websites devoted to it sprang up in the early 2000s. In a future work (Adler and Adler, in preparation), we discuss the proliferation of website chatting about self-injury, and the types of interactions and support people offer each other via these anonymous and distant, yet frequent, regular, and often intimate internet relationships and communities. 16Solomon and Farrand (1996) also reported a case where a young woman chose self-injury as an alternative to suicide, considering the former preferable. 17In this, self-injurers resemble the shifts and oscillations of deviants trying unsuccessfully to quit the deviant world but being drawn back in, only to foray out and relapse once again (see Adler and Adler 1983). 18In describing the self-injury of the cutters she studied, Hodgson (2004) also noted that they used non-normative means to appear normal.",

Like the eye and the nose, the ear scans that habitat across time and space, bringing in important information on events in that world. And submerged, like the eye, in a sea of electromagnetic energy, it perceives only a relatively small portion of the total spectrum of terrestrial sounds (Fig. 6–1). This aural habitat can be quantified and topologically described as having five dimensions: (1) a spectral or “horizontal” dimension of wavelength frequencies, (2) an energy-input or “vertical” dimension of pressure,* (3) a depth or “longitudinal” dimension, as expressed in reverberation period, (4) a dimension across time, and (5) a dimension of direction. Because many sounds can coexist in the same space at the same time, the sonic environment is very rich in aural stimulation; the ear has developed a corresponding capacity to perceive much of this complexity.",

      "title": "Toward applied behavior analysis of life aloft",
      "abstract": "This article deals with systems at multiple levels, at least from cell to organization. It also deals with learning, decision making, and other behavior at multiple levels. Technological development of a human behavioral ecosystem appropriate to space environments requires an analytic and synthetic orientation, explicity experimental in nature, dictated by scientific and pragmatic considerations, and closely approximating procedures of established effectiveness in other areas of natural science. The conceptual basis of such an approach has its roots in environmentalism which has two main features: (1) knowledge comes from experience rather than from innate ideas, divine revelation, or other obscure sources; and (2) action is governed by consequences rather than by instinct, reason, will, beliefs, attitudes or even the currently fashionable cognitions. Without an experimentally derived data base founded upon such a functional analysis of human behavior, the overgenerality of “ecological systems” approaches render them incapable of ensuring the successful establishment of enduring space habitats. Without an experimentally derived functional account of individual behavioral variability, a natural science of behavior cannot exist. And without a natural science of behavior, the social sciences will necessarily remain in their current status as disciplines of less than optimal precision or utility. Such a functional analysis of human performance should provide an operational account of behavior change in a manner similar to the way in which Darwin's approach to natural selection accounted for the evolution of phylogenetic lines (i.e., in descriptive, nonteleological terms). Similarly, as Darwin's account has subsequently been shown to be consonant with information obtained at the cellular level, so too should behavior principles ultimately prove to be in accord with an account of ontogenetic adaptation at a biochemical level. It would thus seem obvious that the most productive conceptual and methodological approaches to long-term research investments focused upon human behavior in space environments will require multidisciplinary inputs from such wide-ranging fields as molecular biology, environmental physiology, behavioral biology, architecture, sociology, and political science, among others.",

The first approach takes inspiration from human processes of personality attribution, whereby humans deploy knowledge about personality to attribute traits to other people, even those they never met before and even on the basis of very short sequences (down to a few seconds) of expressive behavior (so-called thin slices). The human attribution process can be described by means of Brunswick's lens model, as modified by Scherer. In this model, personality traits are externalized or made manifest in behavior by means of objectively measurable variables called distal cues, which the perceiver represents him/ herself as subjective/proximal percepts; the latter are then subjected to inferential processes leading to attribution. For instance, a distal cue (an externalization) of the extraversion trait can be the voice pitch, which the observer represents as loudness (the proximal percept) that he/she uses in the course of the inferential process.",

      "title": "Some mechanisms which distinguish the crowd from other forms of social behavior.",
      "abstract": "Social psychology may profitably adapt to its own uses the knowledge of abnormal behavior possessed by the psychopathologist. There is much group behavior which shows a lack of adjustment to social situations very similar to that of certain neuroses. Without entering upon the discussion of the question of the therapeutic value of the Freudian method of psychoanalysis, it is safe to say that we are greatly indebted to Freud for such knowledge as we possess concerning the determinants of many well recognized types of individual maladjustment to environment. The same unconscious mechanisms which cause the unadjusted individual to be out of harmony with his fellows may on occasion lead a group of men to forms of behavior which are in the true sense anti-social. The term is somewhat ambiguous. In one sense any reaction to the human beings in one's environment is social behavior, and anti-social behavior is that in which human fellowship plays no part, being present neither in the stimulus nor as a factor which modifies the mode of response. If we exclude certain very simple reflexes, it is doubtful if there is antisocial behavior in this sense. Psychopathology finds in such behavior a criterion by which the normal may be distinguished from the abnormal. Now unless we are content to regard any sort of social relationship as a norm, it would seem that we are justified in applying to groups of men the same criteria that are used to determine whether an individual is adjusted or unadjusted. Strikes are condemned because the behavior of those who participate in them frequently shows no concern for the public. Evolutionary groups are said to be intoxicated. Men with common sense have long regarded such phenomena as these as epidemic mental affections. Thus, I think, we may fairly say that there is a generally recognized distinction between that social behavior which results in satisfactory adjustment and that which fails in this respect. Not every group is a crowd, in the psychological sense of the term. When a group becomes a crowd, according to Le Bon, there is a stripping off of the layer of conscious personality along with all higher mental faculties. Hence the individual in the crowd descends several rungs in the ladder of civilization. Le Bon, fanciful as his explanation may have been, was on the right track. He saw that the behavior of crowds is a special phenomenon of social psychology; that the thought and behavior of people in a crowd is different from that which we find in their ordinary social relationships. On this point Le Bon's thinking was essentially empirical. The facts of behavior justify such a distinction and without it, it is difficult to see how a social psychology can be very significant. I give as an illustration an episode in the political history of New York City. There are three characteristics of the crowd mind, which so far as I can discover, are uniformly present. The three characteristics of crowd behavior which are so symptomatic that they may be used empirically to distinguish the crowd from normal forms of social behavior.

Further, different species engender different sorts of responses among lab professionals, a reality I describe as <italic>species preference,</italic> where iconic species of science (e.g., lab rats and mice, macaques) evidence this. The more specifically charismatic qualities of chimpanzees and dogs are especially powerful in this way, where affective responses can vary not only from one individual lab worker to another, but also within or across a lab’s labor hierarchy, consisting of researchers, animal technicians (also known as “caretakers”), and veterinarians.",

One may force beyond an object's legitimate extent or scope; to strain may then be to impair or to imperil the strength of a material thing by excessive tension.

In this sense, dhamma refers to the underlying pattern or order of the cosmos and also to the pattern and order realized in the social and ethical rules and laws of human beings. Understood in this way, dhamma includes the ideas of virtue, duty, or proper moral and ethical conduct. Finally, as a technical term, Dhamma also means the specific teachings of the Buddha.

      "abstract": "Melancholy Ontology, Evental Ethics, and the Lost (m)Other in Howard Barker’s Theatre of Catastrophe:An Analysis of 13 Objects Alireza Fakhrkonandeh (bio) Without a bent for melancholia there is no psyche, only a transition to action or play. —Julia Kristeva, Black Sun1 [The play] is not about life as it is lived at all, but about life as it might be lived, about the thought which is not licensed, and about the abolished unconscious. —Howard Barker, Arguments2 Howard Barker (1946–) creates a tragic world, the avowed arché and telos of which are death. However, far from being tantamount to cessation, nihilistic terminus, or the perfection of life, death comes to designate not just the unknown, but the unknowable. It thus involves a state of nonknowledge that forecloses the normative values of use and exchange, and the orders of meaning and morality.3 As such, death in Barker’s Theatre of Catastrophe features as essentially inscrutable, being at once phenomenon and nonphenomenon, which is to say, neither phenomenologically perceptible nor representable, belonging to the order of enigma, secret, and silence.4 Barker refers to his Art of Theatre as “crucially an art of death” and, endowing it with an ontologically liminal position, locates his theatre on the bank of the river, which serves as the border between the dead and the living.5 He declares tragedy “the labour of death” and characterizes tragic art primarily as an art that promotes the “feeling for death.”6 Resonant with Schopenhauer’s attestation to the pivotal role of death in human life and thought—whereby death is “the real inspiring genius or the Muse of philosophy,” without which “there would [End Page 365] hardly have been any philosophizing”—Barker discerns death as the most fundamental subject of art and philosophy, declaring it “the subject of all philosophy and all theatre.”7 Resonant with the later Freud’s postulation of death as a fundamental drive and ultimate aim of life (“life is a detour to death”)8 and Heidegger’s ontological-existential consideration of death as immanent in human life,9 Barker observes: “Tragedy’s a priori—that we live only to be destroyed by life—renders the notion of wrong decisions meaningless.”10 Indeed, death constitutes a crux around which other aesthetic principles of Barker’s tragic drama—prominent among which are ethical speculation, contradiction, pain, anxiety, loss, and excess—constellate. Notably for present purposes, having defined the objects of “loss” as (rational, utilitarian, commonsensical, and empirical modes of) “knowledge” and “morality,” he proceeds to associate it with melancholy: “The State of Loss describes a state of lost morality, an ethical vacuum, a denial, a rebuke to order, a melancholy and a pain.”11 Relatedly, as is pervasively evident in his theoretical and dramatic works, pain is pivotal to Barker’s tragic work in thematic, dynamic, and aesthetic terms. Pain, as Barker emphasizes, should be perceived as “not disorder but necessity.” Barker recognizes pain as “spiritually necessary” to the “tragic sensibility,”12 which—considering its association with loss, contradiction, complexity, ethical ambiguity, and transgression—fosters “a melancholy beauty,” which serves as the “whole justification for his theatre.”13 More specifically, Barker establishes a firm, yet fraught, relationship between love, pain, and beauty (though death is also intimately bound up with these three), and molds them into a tension-laden manifold. The ensuing statement confirms the point at issue, with Barker defining his Theatre of Catastrophe as “a theatre…which insists on complexity and pain, and the beauty that can only be created from the spectacle of pain. In Catastrophe…lies the possibility of reconstruction.”14 This aesthetics of loss and excess, this poetics of sacrifice, acquires further dimensions when juxtaposed with the crucial questions of nihilism, the death of God, and ontological inadequacy (that is, the poverty of existence and the paucity of possibility of human existence and experience)—questions with which Barker’s characters are obsessed.15 These features drive us inexorably to the question of melancholia in Barker, [End Page 366] but they also constitute focal points of both modernity and its diagnostic critique both in continental philosophy and modernist literature. The melancholic strain in Barker’s drama...",

The results indicate that children up to 8 years of age may have difficulty accepting the conservation of weight even when a transformation does not deform the object and that children up to 13 years may accept the conservation of weight but may find it difficult to explain why an object appears heavier in those instances where weight has to be coordinated with another spatial property. The theoretical implications of these results are discussed.",

Both of these senses are interdependent together providing the sensation of flavour of food and drink, but dysfunction of one may be misinterpreted as an abnormality of the other. Although loss of either sensation is rarely a major handicap, they are essential to detect noxious odours, such as smoke or gas, and to avoid spoiled food or potential poisons. Their loss could, therefore, have serious consequences. In addition, loss of smell or taste may indicate serious intracranial or systemic disease.",

The corpus of these ideas has a life of its own (although one can hardly accuse the mass media of neglecting them), is becoming institutionalized, is successful in lobbying for its interests, and is becoming an influential force in society, generating a unique emotional atmosphere that combines fear of the future with hopes that fate is more favorable to man than would be warrant...",

The phenomena all belong to a particular kind of symbolisation: each of them illustrates how an entity (object or person) sometimes acquires symbolic significance in virtue of a material link with the symbolised entity. Relics are the most obvious example of what happens here: they are cherished, desired or respected, not because of their intrinsic features, but because of their material link with some significant individual person. Crucial for the hypothesis we wish to defend, is the fact that a human being can in some cases and for some others function as a relic of what she used to be; in these cases a human individual has a specific significance in virtue of a material link (bodily continuity) with her own past. We argue that this phenomenon can be extended and that the importance of bodily continuity for personal identity is constituted by the kind of symbolisation upon which the existence of relics is based. 1",

To enter into discourse as a fact, whatever the case may be in the world that is of immediate concern must always already be symbolically mediated, that is, already a specialised version of that aspect of the world. To become a 'clinical' fact, however, 're'conceptualisation is required; before then the clinician has only details. Details become clinically significant when, implicitly or explicitly, they are situated and redefined in a context of interrelated clinical narratives. These narratives are based partly on dialogue and partly on the general theories or metanarratives provided by one or another school of psychoanalytic thought. During psychoanalysis, new clinical facts continue to be conceptualised, and these often alter their own formative contexts, for they include the consequences of previous conceptualisations. Consequently, facticity is always in flux as, over time, understanding alters meaning and emphasis. Even the apparently brute fact of corporeality changes with changes of age, culture, historical epoch, gender of patient, and phase of analysis. In analysis, a central role is played by insight into the functions served by the analysand's uses of 'fact' in the course of devising, unconsciously, transferenceAcountertransference enactments.

Other attributes, especially relational attributes between objects whose lifespans need not overlap, such as being an ancestor of everyone (someone) now existing, being remembered by someone now existing,3 etc., may very well be possessed by objects which no longer",

In so far as people are simultaneously social and biological organisms, is any biological process ever expressed devoid of social context?--or any social process ever unmediated by the corporal reality of our profoundly generative and mortal bodies?(1, 2) Yet, despite the seeming truism that social as well as biological processes inherently shape population health--a truism recognized even in the founding days of as a scientific discipline in the early 19th century-- not all is epidemiology.(3, 4) Instead, epidemiology (which first attained its name as such in English in 1950 (3, 5)) is distinguished by its insistence on explicitly investigating social determinants of population distributions of health, disease, and wellbeing, rather than treating such determinants as mere background to biomedical phenomena. Tackling this task requires attention to theories, concepts, and methods conducive to illuminating intimate links between our bodies and the body politic; toward this end, the glossary below provides a selection of critical terms for the field. One brief note of explanation. Some entries contain only one term; others include several related terms whose meanings are interdependent or refer to specific aspects of a broader construct.

They are bound more tightly than saying the gesture is an “add-on” or “ornament” implies. They are united as a matter of thought itself.

Nor can they be clearly distinguished from the feelings discussed in the last chapter under the terms of sneering and defiance. Disgust is a sensation rather more distinct in its nature, and refers to something revolting, primarily in relation to the sense of taste, as actually perceived or vividly imagined; and secondarily to anything which causes a similar feeling, through the sense of smell, touch, and even of eyesight. Nevertheless, extreme contempt, or, as it is often called, loathing contempt, hardly differs from disgust. These several conditions of the mind are, therefore, nearly related; and each of them may be exhibited in many different ways. Some writers have insisted chiefly on one mode of expression, and others on a different mode. From this circusstance M. Lemoyne has argued that their descriptions are not trustworthy. But we shall immediately see that it is natural that the feelings which we have here to consider should be expressed in many different ways, inasmuch as various habitual actions serve equally well, through the principle of association, for their expression.",

From origin to development, reaction to recovery, culture is the driver that facilitates, frames, and guides disaster. People's prior experiences of disaster also create a pervasive idea of what peril exists or what a disaster will entail. Tales of former disasters led people to deny weather predictions and remain in their houses during both Hurricanes Sandy and Katrina. The most mysterious factor in people's relation to the environment, and subsequently in their vulnerability to disaster, is place attachment. A people's social structure at times often corresponds to how the physical environment is owned and used, and also how disaster survival is accomplished.",

In the newborn child, the alternation has a periodicity of approximately one hour; under the influence of forced habits and other factors, the child gradually begins to sleep more during the night than the day and slowly assumes the adult rhythm (Fig. 21.1). This rhythm would appear to be governed by external factors such as variations in afferent input, and internal factors such as the fatigue that builds up towards the evening. However, even when the influence of these factors is eliminated, a regular rhythm remains (see p. 297).",

We will present some illustrations, in the field of the phenomeno-structural method, which, after having dedicated an important part of its works to the enlightment of the organization of the mental structure, from 1920 to 1950, felt the need, from the 50's onwards, to follow its evolution through a set of psychological modifications pointing in a main direction: during normal and pathological development throughout childhood or at the critical moment of the adolescence period, in psychosurgery or psychobiological practices, then in cases of appearing and disappearing of delusional processes, in the follow-up of determining transformation phases during alcoholic detoxification, or, more recently, in the appreciation of the psychotherapeutic practices (directed daydream, relaxation). We will show how this perspective, standing apart and suspicious to the restrictive current tendency towards evaluation, takes part in a much wider theoretical and methodological frame with a constant concern to consider the sustainable effects and the limits of various events, circumstances or procedures on the structure of personality, through a vast and coherent understanding of the underlying psychological mechanisms which steer them by giving them sense.",

      "title": "Creating Social Connection Through Inferential Reproduction",
      "abstract": "People are motivated to maintain social connection with others, and those who lack social connection with other humans may try to compensate by creating a sense of human connection with nonhuman agents. This may occur in at least two ways-by anthropomorphizing nonhuman agents such as nonhuman animals and gadgets to make them appear more humanlike and by increasing belief in commonly anthropomorphized religious agents (such as God). Three studies support these hypotheses both among individuals who are chronically lonely (Study 1) and among those who are induced to feel lonely (Studies 2 and 3). Additional findings suggest that such results are not simply produced by any negative affective state (Study 3). These results have important implications not only for understanding when people are likely to treat nonhuman agents as humanlike (anthropomorphism), but also for understanding when people treat human agents as nonhuman (dehumanization).",

      "title": "Queer/Disabled Existence: Human Rights of People with Disability",
      "abstract": "The literature has sometimes portrayed queer/disabled people as the “Other.” People with disabilities and queer sexualities are frequently subject to ridicule and abuse. Historically, the literature has aided in the social constructionism of disability phenomena in society by depicting the disabled as someone harmful and undesirable. Furthermore, traditional representations of queer and/or disabled existence have frequently been biased and are usually about how the “able-bodied” or the so-called normal people perceive people with diverse bodies and queer sexualities. However, it has been conspicuously silent regarding the plight of people with disabilities and queer sexualities. In a departure from traditional representations of queer and/or disabled existence, Firdaus Kanga presents a first-hand account of the lived experiences of his precarious life in the Indian sociocultural context and beyond. He has to his credit a series of critically acclaimed books such as Trying to Grow (1990), Heaven on Wheels (1991), The Godmen (1995), and The Surprise Ending (1996). As a severely disabled individual suffering from a crippling disease called osteogenesis imperfecta (brittle bones disease), Trying to Grow (1990), a semiautobiographical novel, is a narrative of his lived experiences of disability and tryst with queer sexuality. While his other work, Heaven on Wheels (1991), is a discourse on queer sexuality and disability from the perspective of queer and disabled existence. Kanga critiques the ableist society’s treatment of the queer and the disabled, which is tantamount to human rights abuse.",

      "title": "THE FORMATION OF SENSE & CREATIVE EXPERIENCE (Based on Critical Analysis of Edmund Husser/'s Works)",
      "abstract": "The human being lives in a meaningful (sinnvoll) world. Sense (Sinn) is an outcome of Man's spiritual activity; it is a mediator of communica­ tion, a stimulus for action, and yet it still remains among those human creations that have not been adequately analyzed. The impact of sense upon active human life is enormous. Though sense is not capable of af­ fecting physical, material things directly, it can determine understanding of an event or an object of the cultural world, and establish man's atti­ tude toward what is happening. A change in sense alters understanding of a phenomenon without affecting its material being: everything remains as it was, but acquires an entirely different sense. In a situation where sense changes human activities, they acquire a different orientation. The profoundness of sense is, indeed, striking. The sense of creations of the human mind is not confined to a single moment, an uttered word, a thought, or a realized activity; it continues to exist in history, connect­ ing past with present (as is vividly exemplified by works of Plato, Shakespeare, Dostoyevsky, and other giants of human culture) and projecting into the future to determine Man's orientation in life. However, what strikes me most, is the very process of the formation of sense in Man's creative experience, where we find the coexistence of what is given and what is created, of the unique and the unchangeable, of creation and reproduction, and of activity and passivity. The prob­ lem of sense formation involves issues of active consciousness, personal activity, the surrounding world (Umwelt), history, and truth, i.e., problems posed and tackled by phenomenology 1 in different ways, depending on the general evolutionary context of phenomenological philosophy. In Husserl's Logical Investigations several propositions are already outlined, that determine the way in which the question of sense (Sinn), which is identified with signification (Bedeutung), is stated and ap­ proached by him. Sense manifests itself in a sphere of consciousness the world of phenomena that are self-sufficient and not subject to substantional-causal relationships. The world of consciousness being",

      "abstract": "The public image of the typical psychoanalyst has been given expression in many jokes and satirical comments such as, He always answers a question with a question, or knew he was alive because I could hear him breathing. That image has been consistent with the classical analytic role of the blank screen which discloses no personal facts, reveals no emotions, but simply mirrors the projections of the patient. But there has been an evolution in the conception of the role of the therapist mirror to participant observer to human being or, as Michels (1986) puts it, from authority to collaborator (p. 288). Each succeeding role does not displace the former, as in the Kuhnian (1962) sense of a succeeding paradigm overthrowing a former one, but rather exists alongside of the others. That is, most analysts seem to function in each role at some time with the same patient and to varying degrees with different patients. Of course, the analyst's theoretical allegiance might be expected to govern the predominance of one role over others. In any case, each succeeding role does involve a greater degree of involvement on the part of the analyst than the former one.",

      "title": "Figures of Evil in the Business World",
      "abstract": "When you ask people What is evil?, their responses are striking in several respects. They tend to name individuals, singling out certain people as evil?e.g., Adolf Hitler, Saddam Hussein, or Joseph Stalin. They typically view evil as inhering in people or in quasi-personal agents (e.g., devils or vampires), not in animals or natural forces. Respondents never describe themselves as evil or as in any way complicitous in evil deeds. A recent poll of Americans who regularly attend church estimated that only three percent believe that they are the ones who might go to hell.1 And they perceive evil as an active, creative, and even autonomous force at work in the world. This last response suggests that perhaps the popular imagination knows something that ethical theorists do not. Ethicists who study busi nesses and organizations typically attribute malevolence and cruelty on the part of businesspeople to either a failure of moral reasoning or to a complete lack of empathie imagination. Some ethical lapses do appear to be the result of individuals' failure to think; they operate on a kind of moral autopilot, following a script they have never thought to question. The pilots who, during the 1950s, routinely dumped fuel into the ocean prior to landing did not set out to harm the environment. They were simply following the landing procedures they had been taught by those pilots who were their teachers. If evil is identical with mindlessness, then the best way to combat it is to instill habits of mindfulness. Those of us who teach ethics try to do so by asking our students to consider cases with a view to determining where and why people went wrong. We look for revealing patterns and causes. We",

In other words, the problem of man's authentic existence arises from man's historicity in the above sense of the word. Since it is man's thinking about the world and acting in the world that engender change, they form an integral part of reality, which is experienced by man as a dynamic process. Reality consists of a multiplicity of cultural projects which have come into existence as a result of man's thinking and acting in a particular existential situation. These projects are historical in that they take their origin in the basic experience of a specific group of men under particular circumstances of life, or what amounts to the same, a particular historical situation.",

In addition to representing the analysis or the analyst in general, the couch can represent the unconscious, or it may lake on the symbolic significance of the analyst's or mother's arms, lap, breasts, or womb. When the genetic roots of the patient's transference include substantial experiences of disappointment, narcissistic injury, and mistrust, the theme of falling from the couch may emerge as a dream, an association, or even an enactment. This theme usually implies the presence of a deepening but mistrustful transference, based on earlier disappointments by the patient's primary objects. Falling off the couch may be associated with being dropped as an infant, rolling out of bed as a child, birth, miscarriage, castration, death, termination, defending against passive wishes, punishment for sexual or aggressive transgressions, escaping an attack, descending into the unconscious, or wanting to be picked up and comforted.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The term near‐death experience (NDE) generally refers to a state of altered consciousness that can occur during real or presumed near‐death circumstances and/or life‐threatening incidents. The NDE usually includes the impression of being conscious while out of and/or away from the physical body, often accompanied by other specific features. Furthermore, when the experient has the impression of being in a perceived locality that transcends the observable physical Earth, it is referred to by researchers as a transcendental NDE. Whereas transcendental NDEs have been widely studied, there is also another type of experience that can occur under similar life‐threatening conditions that I refer to as an alternative life experience (ALE), which consists of a perception of living another alternative life where the experient is aware of the self, but does not believe at the time of occurrence that they are either out of or away from their physical body. After providing a total of 15 examples, I note some similarities and differences between ALEs and transcendental NDEs while providing some qualitative and quantitative results, suggesting that ALEs might be similar to some aspects of transcendental NDEs despite their neglect in the study of altered states of consciousness during near‐death circumstances. I further postulate that ALEs might be subjective psychological experiences of dissociation and/or absorption. It is then pointed out that symptoms of derealization are a common ALE aftereffect and so an awareness of that association is stressed as having therapeutic importance.",

      "abstract": "The new millennium man is living in a completely new context that many people have defined liquid, systemic, global, uncertain about the consequences it could generate. \r\nThis new man will be concerned to face his own context as well as his ancestors did; he will must actively change it and must be changed by it: he has to build his life through it and, together with the others, think about what are the ways they should take to complete their growth.\r\nIn this respect, the quality of the relationship he will be able to maintain with the “out-of-him” will be crucial: at the moment it seems that the fear leads him, i.e. the fear to lose the right street to his personal growth, failing his main task as a man. The relational fragmentation with himself, with the others and with his social and natural behaviour and the lack of plans for the future spread away, making the essential objectives of the human formation farther and harder to be reached. \r\nYet not anything is lost and from the same liquid fragmented context, new proposals and new possibilities appear: actually, often the Answer is not this novelty in itself but what is new is how it is used to interpret the present. So the communitas (community), an ancient form of human aggregation, comes back, with new ideas, new features and new aims.\r\nThis work aims to analyse the issue of community, in particular in its educational meaning and in its possibility to be a mean of growth of the human being where the humanization is an excellent place. The issue, having regard to its complexity has been treated considering two points of view, linked by a common aim. From one side the community has been treated by a theoretical multi-disciplinary point of view giving a definition of communitas that groups together knowledge from psychology, philosophy, politics, sociology, history, pedagogy, etc… through 8 main dimensions (spatial-territorial, temporal-narrative, relational, cultural, educational, socio-political, psychic-spiritual, utopici-eschatological). By the other side it has been analysed from a empirical point of view studying a particular community, the Programa Educativo de Ninos, Ninas y Adolescentes Trabajadores “Alejandro Cussianovich” (educational program for working children and teenagers “Alejandro Cussianovich”) operating in the suburbs of Peru’s capital Lima.\r\nThis research is composed by the collection, analysis and interpretation of some interviews, by a researcher’s diary, written after a period of about one and half year of in situ observation and by the analysis of some institutional documents of the educational program. \r\nIt has been then tried to join the theoretical research to the most practical one with the major aim to underline the central relevance of the community in forming people and to understand whether and how it could answer, for example, to the relational fragmentation problem. In particular, the theoretical research has been used to analyze and interpret data collected in the educational program using the already described 8 dimensions, while the practical research has allowed to find a new dimension (the working-economical one) and some other nuclei (like the family, the cross-culture, the fight, and so on) which must be taken into account when we want to study and/or to promote the community in the territory. \r\nAs a conclusion of this thesis, it has been said that is possible to link community experiences although far one from each other using the conceptual instrument elaborated, and that it would be desirable apply what understood in this research to the educational program work.",

      "abstract": "Culture is the whole system of ideas and feelings, actions, and works produced by humans in a social construct, which are made their own by learning. The word culture comes from the Sanskrit word buddhayah”, the plural form of buddhi which means mind or intellect (Koentjaraningrat, 2005). J.J. Honingmann in his book The World of Man (1959) distinguishes the existence of three cultural phenomena, namely ideas, activities, and artifacts. This is then confirmed by the opinion of Koentjaraningrat (2009) which states that there are three forms of culture, namely; (1) the form of culture as a complex of ideas, values, norms, rules and so on. (2) the form of culture as a complex of patterned activities and actions from humans in society. (3) the form of culture as objects created by humans. The first form is the ideal form of culture. It is abstract, cannot be touched or photographed, its location is in the head, or in other words, in the minds of the people in the community where the culture resides. The second form of culture is called a social system, regarding the patterned actions of humans themselves. This social system consists of human activities that interact, relate and associate with each other in every second, day and year, accordingly to certain patterns based on customary behavior. The third form of culture is called physical culture, taking the form of all physical products and activities, actions and works of all humans in society. They are most concrete in nature and are in the form of objects or things that can be made, seen, and photographed.",

      "title": "Spatial Patterning of Pines and Oaks in the New Jersey Pine Barrens",
      "abstract": "The spatial patterning of individuals in a community can provide evidence of dynamic interactive forces of ecological importance within and between populations. Three patterns are possible: (1) uniform, (2) random, and (3) clumped (Hutchinson 1953). Patterns which are uniform are best interpreted as indicating repulsive forces (e.g. competition) among the individual organisms because mosaic substrates which are statically or dynamically uniform are improbable. In contrast, the interpretation of clumped patterns is ambiguous because clumping can be generated by attractive forces among individuals (e.g. mutualisms) or a heterogeneous environment in which the organisms live. In plants inefficient seed dispersal can lead to clustering of seedlings around the parent plant. The lack of significant patterning (i.e. patterns not statistically different from random) is not proof that important interactive forces are inoperative; disturbance factors such as stochastic vagaries of climate, severe fire, or rampant predation may simply be stronger than the forces of biotic interaction or the underlying patterns of the substrate. The spatial patterns of pines and oaks in the New Jersey Pine Barrens were measured for evidence of competition among natural populations. This remarkable biome was selected because the pine-oak forest is strikingly homogeneous over a large area, and the pattern of trees appeared uniform, in contrast to the usual clumping of plant dispersions (Greig-Smith 1964). A genuine tendency toward uniformity would indicate the existence of competition or other ecologically important negative interactions among individuals. A second motivation for the study was the quantitative documentation of the spatial patterning and the relative abundance of tree species in selected sites of the Pine Barrens after a known period of time since the last forest fire. Repeated at regular intervals, the set of such studies can provide information about the dynamics of upland Pine Barrens succession. Very little quantitative or experimental work has been carried out on plant population dynamics or community structure in the Pine Barrens (Wood 1938; Little & Moore 1949; Buell & Cantlon 1950, 1953; Andresen 1959) compared to the large literature on the endemic fauna and flora (see Stone 1911; Harshberger 1916; McCormick 1970 for reviews).",

      "title": "Mark My Words",
      "abstract": "Whoever first said, “Sticks and stones may break my bones, but words can never hurt me” obviously had never heard of marked words. Marked words are those that take on a meaning beyond their definition when something that has no linguistic meaning in or of itself is added. Examples are the suffixes “ette” or “ess” to feminize a noun. Unfortunately, they often do more than that. Deborah Tannen, a linguistics professor, asks how confident you might feel if you were being treated by a “Doctoress” or the scalpel holder was a “Surgeonette.” In a similar manner, the same descriptive word may infer very different things depending upon the sex of the person being described. When applied to a male, “aggressive” infers that he is a real go-getter while an aggressive female (a.k.a. “the bitch”) frequently is viewed as an undesirable employee who will produce only trouble. The very descriptors we choose are also marked words in a sense, since some words like serene, pretty, giddy, perky (remember Ed Asner’s famous remark to Mary Tyler Moore, “I hate perky”) may or may not be intended as put-down terms, but they definitely remind one that the person is feminine. I wondered if this sort of descriptive sexism ever crept into letters of recommendation. I undertook a totally unscientific, nonrandom, retrospective, statistically insignificant study. I looked at the letters of recommendation we had received for 20 women and 20 men applying for a residency in our department of obstetrics and gynecology to determine how male and female faculty chose to describes applicants by looking at the adjectives used in the letters. Writers used 96 different adjectives. The one that appeared most often was “hardworking,” followed closely by “mature,” “bright,” and “enthusiastic.” All these words have much the same implication when applied to either sex and were used equally by faculty of either sex. However, other adjectives were much more interesting. The adjective “aggressive” appeared in only four letters. One woman described a man as aggressive whereas three men used the word, twice describing women, once describing a man. “Attractive,” “charming,” “well-dressed,” and “neat” were used exclusively by male writers to describe female applicants. No men were described using these adjectives, nor was there any reference made to a male’s physical appearance or dress by any writer. In this age of where physician-patient communication is of such concern, “articulate” was only used occasionally, and then only to describe female candidates. My favorite description is that of a female applicant who was described by a male writer as “well articulated.” Perhaps he meant that her jawbone worked well. “Thorough” was exclusively for women whereas “professional” was reserved to describe men. What can we learn from the small sample? Certainly we can draw no vast conclusions, but it does point out that occasionally, and probably unintentionally, our choice of words may hamper rather than help an applicant. Given a single opening and two equally qualified candidates, would you rather have a delightful, charming, attractive, well-groomed resident who might even be well articulated, or one who is professional, astute, organized, and energetic? Next time you sit down to write a letter of recommendation, mark my words, you’ll do your applicants a great favor if you reread it to make sure you haven’t marked yours.",

      "title": "Edusemiotics as process semiotics: Towards a new model of semiosis for teaching and learning",
      "abstract": "Standard definitions posit the sign as a discrete entity in relation with other signs and standing for an object (either physical or psychological). Thus the sign has two roles, as prompt and as substitutive representation. The latter raises difficult questions about the relationship of the semiotic to the non-semiotic or pre-semiotic, which can be resolved logically (as in Peirce) or rejected as unanswerable (as in Saussure), but which can never be satisfactorily resolved empirically as the phenomenal cannot be divorced from the semiotic. This impasse can be resolved if we drop the assumption that the sign is essentially substitutive. The assumption of discrete entities, at either the phenomenal or the noumenal levels, is a function of discredited substance metaphysics. On a process metaphysical account, the reality of the sign is not attached to the discreteness of any pre-existing entity. The sign remains as prompt and as relational but not (other than sometimes with respect to other signs) substitutive. Rather than defined as standing for an object, the sign can now be regarded much more simply as a feature of an event. This conception of the sign is explored in terms of its implications for teaching and learning.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Emergency situations cannot be defined as situations in which a person is facing contradictory moral duties. Rather, they are situations in which an asset secured also by moral norms is in imminent danger so that the situation is perceived as existentially threatening for a person, either by the person herself or by someone else, for reasons comprehensible also for a third person. Hence, emergency situations call for an emergency ethics since in an emergency situation an action can be morally permissible that would not be permissible in a different situation. As I will show in this paper, whether an action is morally permissible in such an emergency situation that would not be permissible in a different situation depends on five conditions. These conditions are individually necessary and jointly sufficient for the moral permissibility of an action that would be morally forbidden if they were not fulfilled.",

      "abstract": "In addition to perceiving the colors, shapes, and motions of objects, observers can perceive higher-level properties of visual events. One such property is causation, as when an observer sees one object cause another object to move by colliding with it. We report a striking new type of contextual effect on the perception of such collision events. Consider an object (A) that moves toward a stationary object (B) until they are adjacent, at which point A stops and B starts moving along the same path. Such \"launches\" are perceived in terms beyond these kinematics: As noted in Michotte's classic studies, observers perceive A as being the cause of B's motion. When A and B fully overlap before B's motion, however observers often see this test event as a completely noncausal \"pass\": One object remains stationary while another passes over it. When a distinct launch event occurs nearby, however, the test event is \"captured\": It too is now irresistibly seen as causal. For this causal capture to occur, the context event need be present for only 50 ms surrounding the \"impact,\" but capture is destroyed by only 200 ms of temporal asynchrony between the two events. We report a study of such cases, and others, that help define the rules that the visual system uses to construct percepts of seemingly high-level properties like causation.",

In opposition to such trends of thought, I feel the duty to reaffirm strongly that the intrinsic value and personal dignity of every human being do not change, no matter what the concrete circumstances of his or her life.

Reputation plays a vital role in accessing the performance and ability to deliver reliable results in the society. It is believed to be an important personal and professional requisite for success which signifies the esteem that individual holds and which distinguishes them from others in a positive approach. Reputation is the current standing the person has gained from previous actions or refusal of actions in helping others. Human dignity is the basic element amongst other human rights and thus right to reputation comes under the basic inalienable right to enjoy a decent and dignified life. Defamation laws enables an individual to keep his reputation whenever it is attacked by other person. Defamation occur in two ways, libel or slander, where both are detrimental to a person's reputation. In a society, every person should behave in a particular way such as not to harm the right of others and specifically not indulge in the damage of other's dignity or reputation.",

      "abstract": "Shift work is an employment practice designed to make use 24 hours of the clock. Shift work could have a serious impact on our health at least in two ways. Some of it may have to do with the lifestyle that shift worker maintains. The rest has to do with his biology.In terms of lifestyle, working odd hours leads to some obvious problems. People who do shift work tend to have sleep disturbances and sleep loss. They might feel isolated, since their jobs cut them off from their friends and families. They might find it harder to exercise regularly and may be prone to eat junk foods. A significant part of the problem with shift work is physiological. On a fundamental level, being awake at odd or irregular hours fights with our biological rhythms. Shift work disrupts the circadian rhythm - our internal body clock that is keyed to natural daylight and darkness. Because circadian rhythm affects how the body functions, disrupting it can throw everything out of whack - including our cardiovascular system, metabolism, digestion, immune system, and hormonal balance. That appears to have serious consequences.Thus shift work can lead to various short term & long term complications.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACTGratitude is a prototypical emotional response when life's blessings come from the intentional goodwill of other people, but many also attribute good experiences to the intervention of God, gods, a Higher Power, or other benevolent spiritual forces. This study investigated the differences between how United States participants (N = 610) experience interpersonal gratitude and spiritual gratitude. Compared to interpersonal gratitude, spiritual gratitude experiences were less often attributed to human action, more often attributed to supernatural beings and circumstances beyond human control, and elicited significantly less feelings of gratitude, indebtedness, and admiration, but greater awe. Participants reported the highest feelings of gratitude when they also believed in a personal God with a benevolent mind. These findings demonstrate the importance of perceiving benevolent agency in evoking feelings of gratitude, whereas experiences that are attributed to more abstract, less personified, or less external entities elicit a different profile of positive emotional responses.KEYWORDS: Godspiritualitygratitudeexternal attributions Disclosure statementNo potential conflict of interest was reported by the author(s).Supplementary materialSupplemental data for this article can be accessed online at https://doi.org/10.1080/17439760.2023.2239781Data availabilityAll data and analysis code for this article is available at https://osf.io/5dyhg/Open scholarship This article has earned the Center for Open Science badges for Open Data, Open Materials and Preregistered.

The former are ‘blocks of becoming’ or individuations, while the latter are ‘durations’. For Whitehead, the great question is again expressed by Locke. Whatever the scale of this duration – years, seconds or centuries – the question is to know how a ‘particular substance’ <italic>endures</italic>, that is, maintains a form of identity across the changes affecting it. The manner in which Locke poses the question of duration and how he attempts to define it is crucial here. He doesn’t say that duration could be measured on a uniform temporal scale, against a single measure that would apply to every substance. A thing that endures is not just something that occupies a longer or shorter measure of time. Locke’s definition is entirely alien to more classical approaches to time: time, for Locke, becomes a <italic>relation</italic><italic>between persistence and change</italic>.",

      "title": "Language, gesture and meaning",
      "abstract": "We speak; we gesture. A variety of gestures occur naturally when people talk to each other. First, self-adaptors are self-touching movements which can be meaningful in interaction. For instance, a simple touch of the nose could mean that someone was not being truthful. Such movements do not bear a direct semantic relationship with the utterance. Emblematic gestures, on the other hand, are meaningful in their own right. They have socially agreed-upon standards of well-formedness and are produced in much the same way across the users of a particular language, like waving the hand for 'goodbye' or making the okay gesture for 'approval'. The emblematic meaning may or may not be associated with speech (Ekman and Friesen, 1969; Goldin-Meadow, 1999; Kendon, 1984, 1995, 2004; McNeill, 1992, 2005). Beat gestures, however, are bound to utterance. They are typically small up and down or back and forth flicks of one or both hands that occur along with the rhythm of speech (McNeill, 1992; McClave, 1994). Beat gestures have no semantic association with speech, but can be used to emphasize portions of the speech content (Efron, 1941, 1972; Wagner et al., 2014). McNeill (1992: 15) found that in narrative discourse, \"the occurrence of beats is related to discourse structure, when there are shifts among the narrative, metanarrative, and paranarrative levels of discourse\". Next, deictic gestures have to do with pointing to linguistic referents in the immediate speech environment. Spatial gestures are used to allocate gesture spaces symbolically to the linguistic referents. Finally, iconic gestures bear a direct semantic relationship with speech (McNeill, 1992, 2000). The meaning conveyed by iconic gestures mainly rests upon context. Consider Figure 16.1. The speaker on the left, who first had the arms crossed under the chest, moved the hands to the front; then, the hands in lightly formed fists, the left one slightly above the right, moved in a curve from the center to her right periphery. It is difficult to comprehend what such gesture means in the interaction without the presence of speech, despite the fact that the hand movements are conspicuous, noticeable, and produced in the center space (see the Gesture Space in McNeill, 1992).",

Contrary to many clinical psychologists and psychiatrists, the author considers language in psychosis not as language deficit, or dysfunction, or a brain-based and driven phenomenon. For a long time, clinicians have remarked on the strange language of psychosis, particularly schizophrenia, characterizing speech as \"gibberish\" or \"word salad.\" In psychosis, the subject takes the position of witness to a ghastly other in social isolation. The author shows that the psychotic bears enigmatic traces of questions and experiences beyond a shared language, beyond what can be known or spoken in any social link. He looks at a very different first encounter with an alien and enigmatic other. The author offers a brief glimpse into the bare beginnings of psychosis, that is psychosis as an experienced, vivid, very real imposed Other that is ghostly, ghastly, and enigmatic.",

Every human move that an individual makes has these Burkean features. Such moves are used to engage in either convivial dramas or confrontational ones.",

Pretense presupposes some BIC-based human interaction, where a normal, practical behavior is used for signifying something, based on a sign that is not a conventional one.

Indeed, the capacity to adapt \nand respond to the various circumstances of existence may be a deﬁnition of life itself (and see \nSchrodinger, 1946).

In these perilous times for our world, how people \nreact in unusual and even unprecedented situations goes well beyond just an academic exercise or \nyet another text book. Understanding these effects may well be the key to our collective survival. \nIf you do not believe this assertion simply ask the people, of Baghdad, Kabul, New York, London, \nMadrid, Washington, and Beirut.

Act 1 inciting incident, an event that kicks the action of the game into motion sex can be an inciting incident! Act 2 rising action, as the stakes and tension of the game grow higher sex becomes part of story and character development along the way. Act 2 before the climax, or Act 3 climax sex as a dramatic \"deep breath\" before the final plunge, or the final step of a developing relationship arc. Act 3 resolution sex as part of the \"happily ever after.\" Outside the three-act structure some games and/or sex scenes aren't attached to a central narrative and may take place separately (e.g., open-world encounters). The chapter also stresses that if there is only one sex scene in a game, its place in the larger narrative structure takes on bigger story importance as The Big Sex Scene, while having multiple sex scenes can spread this out and ameliorate the effect. The chapter ends with questions on applying this structure to existing games or the reader's projects.",

The first step towards the aggregation of men into a community, or the first departure from a state of perfect isolation, could that state ever have subsisted for a single day, is the patriarchal arrangement. No sooner indeed is the infant creature ushered into being, than it is met by the cares and the caresses of those who are around it, and who have either attended or welcomed its entry on this scene of existence—as if, in very proportion to the extremity of its utter helplessness, was the strength of that security which nature hath provided, in the workings of the human constitution, for the protection of its weakness and the supply of all its little wants. That there should be hands to receive and to manage this tender visitant, is not more obviously a benevolent adaptation, than that there should be hearts to sympathize with its cries of impotency or distress. The maternal affection is as express an instance of this as the maternal nourishment—nor is the inference at all weakened, by the attempts, even though they should be successful, of those who would demonstrate of this universal fondness of mothers, that, instead of an original instinct, it is but a derived or secondary law of our nature. Were that analysis as distinct and satisfactory as it is doubtful and obscure, which would resolve all mental phenomena into the single principle of association—still the argument would stand.",

Pongo algunos ejemplos: movidos por el fervor de extender los Ejercicios a los jovenes, hemos cometido el error de hacer juicios espirituales sobre los estados animicos de un adolescente, sin tener en cuenta la crisis vital por la que esta atravesando. Tambien ha sido frecuente encontrarme con este axioma: “estar desolado es sinonimo de andar mal, y estar consolado signo de andar bien”. Es decir, la consolacion es –ipso factosenal de tranquilidad, y por contrapartida la desolacion cae bajo un manto de sospecha, sin distinguir si es mala solo porque es desagradable, y sin contemplar si la desolacion pertenece a quien transita la primera semana, o es de quien vivencia como en su propia carne la Pasion de Jesus, propio de la tercera semana. Lo mismo ocurre con la consolacion: suele identificarsela como senal del cielo y confirmacion del camino emprendido, sin tener en cuenta la sospecha de tentacion bajo especie de bien (EE 331), como se plantea en la segunda semana. En definitiva, no debemos vincular de manera acritica las consolaciones con el buen espiritu, ni las desolaciones con el malo, pues si Ignacio decia que de 100 personas haciendo oracion, 99 se enganaban, bien podriamos aplicar las mismas proporciones al discernimiento.

In fact, today the potentialities available for people who are more mature in years, are countless to the point that they can become a source of remarkable positive change. This moves the traditional boundaries of geriatrics/gerontology (in the past almost exclusively the dominion of the bio-medical sciences with a strong pathological-clinical perspective) towards softer areas, where psychology particularly the one dedicated to health and wellbeing is able to make a positive contribution to a fulfilling passage through this “phase” of life. Therefore, this period can be lived as a further “evolution”, consequently as a cognitive-emotional enrichment, as well as a preparation for the so-called deferred “old age”.

      "title": "Learning for safety in health care and air traffic control",
      "abstract": "Introduction\n\nRisk management in enterprises, organisations and companies has had a long and complicated history. \nDuring the eighties, and at least during the beginning of the nineties, the notion concerning risk management was that if an accident happened in an otherwise perfect system it was due to the human operator in some way being the cause of the error. The cause for the accidents was described in terms of “negligence”, “lack of competence” and such similar statements.\n\nGradually, during the late nineties, the risk management paradigm shifted. \nJames Reason, a psychologist, made a tremendous impact with his book Human error, published in 1990.\nHe introduced the term latent failures (or latent conditions). These, he said, are “resident pathogens”, built into the system. They are latent since the system can live with these pathogens for months and even years, and perform adequately, until something happens, which hampers the “immune system of the system”.\nReason states that the human operator goes to work everyday with the intention of doing a good job. The human operator has no wish “to screw up things”. When accidents happen, and operators make mistakes, it is therefore not a deliberate action. The causes should be sought in design flaws in the system. \n\nIn this thesis we are dealing with high-risk systems, though not high-risk technologies. We are studying acute somatic health care, air traffic control, pharmacy and cancer treatment. We will explore different ways for an organisation to receive feedback from safety related occurrences, in order to improve safety.\n\nThe aim with this thesis will be to explore methods for obtaining safety feedback in the above mentioned domains. \nFour different approaches will be attempted:\n\n•\tRetrospective learning from accidents (paper I)\n•\tProactive learning using an external agent (paper II)\n•\tOperator centred learning (paper III)\n•\tUser centred proactive learning (paper IV) \n\nMethods and material\n\nMethods\n\nIn paper I we used MTO (Man-Technique-Organisation) analysis as described by the nuclear power operators in Sweden, with a certain adaptation for health care. \n\nPaper II was inspired on the work with paper I. During the numerous interviews with doctors and nurses a quite common reaction was: “Why did we not think of these risks before? It is so obvious!”\nAnother concern was the limited value of retrospective investigations when it comes to improving safety. \nThis started us on designing a method for proactive risk analysis. Several methods were already described for this, but they were mainly tuned to technical systems with more or less tight coupling, assuming a high degree of linearity (as for instance the Failure Mode and Effect Analysis, FMEA). We felt these methods did not fit the way in which our studied organisations functioned. The result was the DEB (Disturbance- Effect-Barrier) analysis used in paper II. The identified system weaknesses by using this method was compared to system weaknesses extracted from the analysis (done by headquarter analysts) of 15 loss of separation incidents at the unit.\n\nWhen working with this it became obvious that one category of incidents, i.e. the loss of separation incidents (AIRPROX) , was only the tip of the iceberg. Each day there were a number of near misses that did not result in loss of separation, and therefore not used for safety feedback. Talking to the controllers also revealed a hidden knowledge on questionable procedures that might constitute risks. Thus the idea was fairly simple: Why not let the controllers do the job of analysing safety occurrences? This led to the design of a method for operator-centred learning, i.e. paper III. The method included a brief to the controllers for 1½ days on system thinking.\n\nThe starting point for paper IV was particularly tragic. I investigated a case where an eight-year-old girl with cancer was killed by mistake. She was administered the total dose of cytotoxic agents each day for three days, i.e. a 300% overdose. We used the DEB analysis again, for a proactive risk analysis of the process of treating patients with cytotoxic drugs, but this time using a formalised user group. \n\nMaterial\nThe material for paper I was a consecutive series of eight reports to the National Board of Health and Welfare, from acute somatic health care.\n\nThe material for paper II was a DEB analysis performed for the processes at the Malmoe air traffic control unit in Sweden.\n\nIn paper III a trial was performed for half a year with extended reporting of learning occurrences. In this way an additional 45 occurrences were reported which otherwise would not have been documented and analysed.\n\nIn paper IV the DEB analysis were performed at one ward unit at the department of oncology at the Lund University hospital, taking into consideration interface problems between the ward unit and the hospital pharmacy (which prepared the cytotoxic infusions).\n\nResults\nIn paper I we could demonstrate that the notion of latent conditions was fruitful for analysing and learning from medical accidents. We identified a number of system weaknesses in seven out of eight cases, providing a good potential for improving safety.\n\nIn paper II we identified a number of risks (latent conditions) in the air traffic control system. We compared the identified system weaknesses with 15 loss of separation cases, investigated by the regulator. We identified all system weaknesses from 14 out of 15 as loss of separation analyses. \nIn paper III we could demonstrate that the operators indeed were able to analyse “learning occurrences”, and to identify preventive actions, one of these being training on the aircraft flight management system for controllers. Also, they could show that quite a few number of “unexpected flight behaviours” actually were actually partly caused by air traffic control actions.\n\nIn paper IV we refined the DEB analysis by using a formalised reference group of staff from the very beginning.. The analysis disclosed a number of system weaknesses, which were presented for the staff. The disclosed risks were accepted as valid, and quite a few of our recommendations were implemented during the next couple of years\n\nDiscussion\nWe discuss our methods in relation to current research, particularly we discuss MTO analysis in relation to root cause analysis, and DEB analysis in relation to FMEA. We are critical to both. We find that both methods could benefit from using the notion of latent conditions, and even applying the concept and vocabulary from the ISO 9000 quality management standard when describing risks.\n\nWe discuss the learning potential of retrospective vs. proactive analysis and are in favour of proactive methods.\n\nWe introduce complexity theory and relate this to our results. Our conclusion is that the operator-centred approach (paper III) seems to be the most effective way of influencing a complex system in a desirable manner, concerning self-organising and emergent properties.",

Character can also be interpreted as a habit or habit. In general, character is associated with a distinctive or special trait, or a person's pattern of behavior that distinguishes him from others. Imtaq is the formation of two words, namely, faith and taqwa. Faith comes from the word yu'minu-fahuwa mu'min. According to scholars, the meaning of al-iman means \"at-tashdiq\" or justifies. Al-iman according to shari'ah means to justify by heart everything that was brought by the Prophet Muhammad. Iman means to believe. Believing means that we believe with all our heart that Allah SWT is the only God worthy of worship. While Taqwa comes from the word waqaa-yaqii-wiqaayatan-waqan, which means to maintain and guard. The word taqwa comes from the word ittaqa, thus taqwa is self-preservation and care. Allah SWT with full awareness and devotion, both to His commands and to His prohibitions.",

      "abstract": "The capacity of the infant to bear affect relies on the capacity of the caregiver until it has achieved enough strength to perform this task itself. In the case of neglect the necessary strength to contain, metabolize and think about affect so that it may be converted into differentiated feelings cannot develop because of the absence of a caregiver capable of sustaining the infant in its emotional development. Instead a system of defence against affect arises in which the affect itself is perceived as intrusive and abusive. Because of neglect a confusion between abuse and affect can be observed, with catastrophic consequences for the growing child. Furthermore neglected children can be seduced by external abuse in the hope of being protected from affect that threatens to feel abusive from within. Paradoxically these children are drawn toward abusive situations in the hope of finding some ongoing shelter from unmanageable affect. A corollary of this is that actual containment comes to feel abusive to them: if they are made to feel affect, they perceive the other, who put them in touch with affect, as abusive: thus affect, abuse and containment are confused. Clinical material will support this thesis.",

Originally used to designate chemical or biological processes that oppose the process of “composition,” the expression underwent a change of meaning when linguistic images of such processes were projected onto developments in social and political spheres. The idea of a disintegrating quality is attributed to Jews in an essentialising way as a habitual, formative behaviour that aims at the dissolution of state, social and spiritual order. The central moment of the stereotype of disintegration manifests itself in the idea of a people as a single organism that can only carry out its activities if all its parts or members are intact and work together. Jews are excluded from this organism as foreign bodies, frequently portrayed in biological terms as “viruses” or “parasites.” Jewish participation in that organism supposedly poses a threat of “infection,” “decay” and finally “dissolution.”",

      "abstract": "The expressions we see in the faces of others engage a number of different cognitive processes. Emotional expressions elicit rapid responses, which often imitate the emotion in the observed face. These effects can even occur for faces presented in such a way that the observer is not aware of them. We are also very good at explicitly recognizing and describing the emotion being expressed. A recent study, contrasting human and humanoid robot facial expressions, suggests that people can recognize the expressions made by the robot explicitly, but may not show the automatic, implicit response. The emotional expressions presented by faces are not simply reflexive, but also have a communicative component. For example, empathic expressions of pain are not simply a reflexive response to the sight of pain in another, since they are exaggerated when the empathizer knows he or she is being observed. It seems that we want people to know that we are empathic. Of especial importance among facial expressions are ostensive gestures such as the eyebrow flash, which indicate the intention to communicate. These gestures indicate, first, that the sender is to be trusted and, second, that any following signals are of importance to the receiver.",

We are not responsible 2 for all our intentional actions (actions under hypnosis, for example), but we can nevertheless be responsible 2 for actions we do not adequately control, for negligent actions, and for non‐intentional omissions. Appreciating this helps show that familiar principles of responsibility are false: those which delimit responsibility to intentional actions or to actions and outcomes under our control. In the attempt to fashion an alternative principle, cases of negligence prove pivotal. We hold ourselves and others responsible 2 for conduct within our respective ‘domains of secure competence’, (i.e. that within which we are confident of doing what we set ourselves to do, barring events which defeat our competence), even when actions within that domain fail. The significance of this practice of holding ourselves and others responsible 2 lies in the way it maintains our sense of who we are and of how we are related to the world in which we act. 1",

      "abstract": "Individuals who have not been victimized by negative life events, such as serious illness, accidents, or crime, tend to perceive themselves as “uniquely invulnerable,” as less vulnerable to victimization than others. The actual experience of victimization, however, appears to shatter this illusion of invulnerability, creating in victims a new and unfamiliar sense of vulnerability often accompanied by psychological distress. This article reviews literature documenting nonvictims' perceptions of unique invulnerability and victims' heightened perceptions of vulnerability, and addresses the potentially adaptive versus maladaptive consequences of these perceptions. It is argued that victims who have the most difficulty coping with their misfortune may be precisely those individuals who initially felt least vulnerable prior to being victimized. Therefore, how victims cope may depend in part on their prior beliefs about risk. In addition, a distinction is made between victims who feel “uniquely vulnerable” (more vulnerable than others) and those who feel “universally vulnerable” (equally vulnerable as others) to future misfortune. It is proposed that perceptions of universal vulnerability may be a more adaptive reaction to victimization than are perceptions of unique vulnerability.",

The widespread usage of the term conscious is 'not unconscious' so a conscious individual is an individual that has the capability to perceive and respond to sensory stimuli. It is confusing and scientifically undesirable if conscious is also used to mean aware. Hence it is proposed that conscious should be used only as above. Fully functioning and adequately developed humans and members of many other animal species are sentient. Sentience means having the capacity, the level of awareness and cognitive ability, necessary to have feelings. The welfare of an individual is its state as regards its attempts to cope with its environment. This includes feelings, which are important coping mechanisms, and health. Since feelings involve awareness, there is overlap between welfare assessment and awareness assessment. Methods for assessing awareness, consciousness, sentience, and welfare and links to morality are briefly discussed.",

      "abstract": "Religious authorities generally disapprove of Gambling. Gambling is the betting of money or something of material value on an event with an unsure result with the main target of winning additional money or material goods. Normally, the result of the bet is clearly to be seen within a short period. It has often been seen as having social consequences. For these social and religious reasons, most legal jurisdictions limit Gambling. But it increases in our present society day by day. The Vedic seers also feel the harmfulness of the Gambling and stated it in the thirty fourth hymn of the tenth ma ][ ala of the Rgveda. This hymn (X.34) brings out the picture of a person who because of his addiction of dice play is completely ruined but can’t resist the temptation even when he is lent in a measurable condition. It is also elaborated (itih sapur ] bhy veda I samupab aI hayet) in the great epic Mah bh rata ( Dyutaparva, 65th chapter, sub parva of Sabh parva ) through the dice game between Duryodhana’s uncle Sakuni (Kauravas) and Yudhi ^@ hira (Pandavas). Yudhi ^@ hira loses all his wealth in the bet, then his kingdom. He then even gambles his brothers, himself, and finally his wife Draupad C into servitude. At last the Pandavas are required to go into exile for 12 years, and in the 13th year must remain hidden. If discovered by the Kauravas, they will be forced into exile for another 12 years. An attempt has been made here to highlight the mal practices like gambling in the present day society.",

Bio-Psycho-Social, Patient-Centred and Individualised ApproachAl-Balkhi illustrated how physical and psychological factors interact to form psychosomatic disorders; \"since man is composed of a body and a soul, he must have from each of them a condition of health or sickness balance or imbalance.The body can preserve its health in two ways, external -protecting it from hazards such as extreme heat or cold; and protection from internal elements by modifying one's diet, taking what is beneficial and avoiding what is harmful.To protect the soul from inside elements such as negative thinking and outside elements such as what a person hears or sees that may disturb him\" 3 .This approach of Balkhi is rather similar to Engel's biopsychosocial model 5 .Balkhi stresses an individualised and patient-centred approach stressing \"people differ with respect to the intensity of their feelings in response to distressing factors.This is because each person responds according to his temperament and the foundation of his constitution with respect to strength or weakness\" 3 .This observation corresponds to Zubin's stress -vulnerability theory, accepting individuals carry predisposition to mental illnesses 13 . De-Stigmatisation and Prevention of Mental Disorders and Emotional First AidBalkhi's views on psychoeducation, prevention of mental disorders and identification of early signs of relapse of mental illnesses are impressive; \"The world is abode of anxiety, sadness and calamity.So, it is only normal for man to expect, in spite of his efforts, the onslaught of misfortune to disturb the calmness of his soul.One may live for long time without complaining of bodily pains, but it is unlikely that one will pass a day without experiencing something that causes anger, anxiety, sadness or gloom.And it is for this reason that man should do his utmost to protect his soul from emotionally disturbing events.One suffering from psychological disturbance can fight his symptoms internally by developing thoughts that neutralise the symptoms and desensitize their provocation.The tranquil thoughts should not only be generated during the illness; but also during times of psychological health.This, could be used as a source of first aid in the absence of a physician\" 3 .",

Implied motion rather than smooth or continuous motion was presented. The initially moving object was rated as more causal and as exerting more force if upon contact the initially stationary object was launched into motion or shattered, but the initially stationary object was rated as more causal and as exerting more force if upon contact the initially moving object stopped or shattered (and the initially stationary object remained stationary and intact). An object that did not shatter or that shattered into fewer fragments was rated as more causal and as exerting more force than an object that shattered into more fragments. If the initially moving object stopped upon contact and the initially stationary object remained stationary, the initially stationary object was rated as more causal. The results are not consistent with theories of phenomenal causality that suggest (1) moving objects are always perceived as more causal and as exerting more force than stationary objects and (2) perception of causality is identical to perception of force.",

'What decides the purpose of life', argues Freud, 'is simply the programme of the pleasure principle' (1930, p. 263). Unfortunately, the programme of the pleasure principle also happens to be 'at loggerheads with the whole world, with the macrocosm as much as with the microcosm' (ibid.). This is for two main reasons. First, there is the problem of the nature of pleasure itself. Pleasure is a transient phenomenon, which can only come about as a process of reducing tension, tending towards but never fully achieving a state of ease and total inactivity. Prior to death, absolute nirvana cannot be attained because of all the internal and external sources of stimulation which impinge on the psyche. The sensations of unhappiness, by the same token, are much less difficult to experience. All stimulation creates tension, an unpleasurable state that motivates activity of the body or mind in the search for resolution. In addition, humans are faced with real pain from three unremitting sources: the feebleness of their own bodies, the superior power of nature and — most significantly — the activities of other people.",

      "abstract": "The aim of this book is to establish an historical and clinical appraisal of the presence within absence of the deceased to outline its normative presentation, demography, dynamic functions, and to review methods of healing with its aberrant fixation. Through its private retelling, the presence within absence of a loved one (more commonly called soul, spirit, or phantom) assumes a narrative structure and its private and public retelling may be an early adaptive response after dying and death. The imaginal stories of emergence from and transcendence beyond death, separable from the reality-based recounting of dying and death, have been retold for thousands of years. Retelling this confluence of imaginal and reality-based stories privately or shared with family, close friends, and community members may recede in the early weeks and months, relegating the duration of the presence within absence to a chronologic past, but remaining implicit as a private, comforting interchange that can be summoned or come unbidden. For some grievers, the presence within absence may persist as a disabling fixation, necessitating an intervention guided by a shaman, clergy, or therapist who shares common elements in their healing practices.",

To say that man sustains the changes in his physical environment does not mean he adapts well to his psychosocial environment, for the latter is much more difficult to do. Individual death is only an element in the endless chain which is life. An individual can disappear, but the species continues, despite everything, to carry on. The author specifies that the fear of death enters in the health education domain; this is in the back of our anxieties and shapes our way of confronting life and our attitudes when dealing with others. To learn to live is necessary to us. However it is also necessary to learn to die to accept death and to demistify it, thus limiting the anxiety which is caused by it.",

      "abstract": "We here review the communicative and cognitive processes underpinning collective group movement in animals. Generally, we identify 2 major axes to explain the dynamics of decision making in animal or human groups or aggregations: One describes whether the behavior is largely determined by simple rules such as keeping a specific distance from the neighbor, or whether global information is also factored in. The second axis describes whether or not the individual constituents of the group have overlapping or diverging interests. We then review the available evidence for baboons, which have been particularly well studied, but we also draw from further studies on other nonhuman primate species. Baboons and other nonhuman primates may produce specific signals in the group movement context, such as the notifying behavior of male hamadryas baboons at the departure from the sleeping site, or clear barks that are given by chacma baboons that have lost contact with the group or specific individuals. Such signals can be understood as expressions of specific motivational states of the individuals, but there is no evidence that the subjects intend to alter the knowledge state of the recipients. There is also no evidence for shared intentionality. The cognitive demands that are associated with decision making in the context of group coordination vary with the amount of information and possibly conflicting sources of information that need to be integrated. Thus, selective pressures should favor the use of signals that maintain group cohesion, while recipients should be selected to be able to make the decision that is in their own best interest in light of all the available information.",

Yet there is a potential army of others waiting in the wings and potentially 'hearing' that communication: supporters and those close to both harmer and harmed, the community or communities into which the harmer (and the harmed) need to re-find their place, and powerful voices (such as the media) on what is seen to be the moral order of those communities. It has been said that a criminal offence causes ripples of concern and potentially fear spreading out from the offence into the community. Can and should forgiveness be seen similarly - and what effects may this ‘forgiveness ripple’ have on the person harmed, the person who has harmed and the community?",

      "title": "Mental Modeling in Conceptual Change",
      "abstract": "IntroductionThe nature and processes of are problems that are of considerable interest to researchers across several disciplines occupied with developing understandings of science, learners, or cognitive development. Although the problems and methods to address them have different formulations in these areas, there is a long history in each of specifying the beginning and ending states of deep conceptual changes, such as what constitutes the nature of representational changes from Newtonian mechanics to the theory of relativity, or from a naive understanding of physical phenomena to a scientific understanding provided by physics or biology, or from individual early (possibly innate) representational structures to adult community representations of a whole range of phenomena, including of other humans, during processes of cognitive development.A major outstanding problem in all of these areas is the nature of the processes - or mechanisms - through which concepts and conceptual structures change. In part because of similarities in features of conceptual changes across these areas, such as ontological shifts and degrees of incommensurability, some, myself included, have proposed that the same or related processes are at work in the several kinds of conceptual change. Clearly one would expect differences between, for example, the practices used by scientists in constructing new concepts and students learning new (for them) concepts. For one thing scientists have articulated theoretical goals and sophisticated metacognitive strategies while children and students do not. However, in conceptual processes, a significant parallel is that each involves problem solving. One way to think of learning science, for instance, is that students are engaged in (or need to be enticed into) trying to understand the extant scientific conceptualization of a domain. In this process, learning happens when they perceive the inadequacies of their intuitive understandings - at least under certain conditions - and construct representations of the scientific concepts for themselves. The impetus for a problem solving process can arise from many sources: acquiring new information, encountering a puzzling phenomenon, or perceiving an inadequacy in current ways of understanding.Concepts provide a means through which humans make sense of the world. In categorizing experiences we sort phenomena, noting relationships, differences, and interconnections among them. A conceptual structure is a way of systematizing, of putting concepts in relation to one another in at least a semi - or locally - coherent manner. But a conceptual structure is complex and intricate and it is not possible to entertain it in its entirety all at once. Trying to understand new experiences or how a concept relates to others can reveal hereto-fore unnoticed limitations and problems in the representational capabilities of current conceptual structures and even reveal inconsistencies with other parts. Although how reflectively they engage in the process differs, scientists, learners, and developing children all engage in this kind of sense-making which suggests that to a greater or lesser extent conceptual is a reasoned change in view (Karman, 1986).Thinking of conceptual in this way focuses attention on the nature of the reasoning scientists use in solving representational problems. Creating models as systems of inquiry is central in the problem solving practices of scientists. There is a large literature in history and philosophy of science that establishes that processes of constructing and manipulating analogical, visual, and simulative models play central role in episodes of conceptual across the sciences. On the account of conceptual in science I have been developing, reasoning through such models (model-based reasoning) provides a significant means (not necessarily the only means) through which conceptual innovation and occur (See, e. …",

      "title": "The 'inclusive engineering' approach: an optimum diameter for ease of opening",
      "abstract": "Social equality demands a shift in attitude, away from treating older people and people with disabilities as special cases requiring special design solutions, and towards enabling them to have equal access to any product or service through a more inclusive approach to the design of buildings, public spaces and, more recently, products and services. This is not just important for social equality but also for business growth through new products and services and through creating wider potential markets.\r\nIt is a sad fact of life that as people get older there is a massive decline in their strength and dexterity. Due to the fact that we handle and manipulate so many things\r\nthroughout our life time, from the tiniest and most dexterous of tasks to heavy manual labour, this decline is very noticeable in our hands. In nearly all the actions that we use our hands for there is some form of grip used in order to hold onto an object before manipulating it. The natural decrease in strength combined with debilitating illness such as arthritis, means that hand grip strength or finger grip strength are very seriously affected.\r\nThis has a knock on affect of making it much harder to twist things or pinch and pull things. Therefore there is often a measured decrease in torque strength with age caused not so much by a decrease in wrist strength but more often than not by a decrease in grip strength.\r\nConsumer packaging is a field in which many people, including young able bodied people, often struggle in relation to openability. Yet it is present in even the most mundane and neccessary of every day tasks such as eating, cleaning teeth, even drinking. Human interation with consumer packaging requires a wide range of hand dexterity and strength and a variety of differing hand actions. This paper looks at just one such set of actions; that used to open bottles and jars. It outlines all the arguments for inclusive design, stressing the importance for both consumers and business. This paper also outlines an engineering design approach for inclusive design that uses real human factors as design limits, resulting in packaging that will be easily opened by all it’s end users without the expensive trial and error approach that has been used up to this point in time. This paper examines the affect of\r\ngrip strength on the required trorque to open closures and concludes that there is an optimum diameter for ease of opening that will decrease the required strength to open such closures.",

      "title": "Newton's (Often Misunderstood) Third Law of Motion",
      "abstract": "For every action there is always an opposed equal reaction. That may sound straightforward, but Newton's third law, generally called the law of action and reaction, is the most misunderstood of his three laws of motion. Often Newton's third law is applied inappropriately. For example, the telling of a lie sooner or later elicits another lie in reaction. Treating a friend harshly results in an equal harshness by that friend. What goes around comes around. What you sow is what you reap. True enough, how someone acts socially often has consequent reactions. But these are not examples of Newton's third law. I confront this misconception early so that students will be clear that the third law, like the first and second laws, is about force. [FIGURE 1 OMITTED] Action and reaction forces make up a single interaction Action and reaction refer to the interaction of forces, which may be gravitational, electrical, magnetic, or any kind of push or pull. If you push on a wall, you are interacting with the wall, which pushes back on you (Figure 1). Every interaction involves a pair of forces: one action and the other reaction. If you pull on a wagon, the wagon pulls back on you. It doesn't matter which force we call action and which we call reaction. Neither force has to be identified as exerter or receiver. Both are equal parts of a single interaction. [FIGURE 2 OMITTED] An inanimate object can exert a force Students may experience disbelief when told that a wall pushes back on them. A widespread misconception is that only live things can push or pull. Not so. I ask students to push the fingers of their hands together. The fingers bend. But they bend just as much when fingers of either hand are pressed to a wall. When you push on something, animate or inanimate, it really does push back just as hard. Action and reaction forces act simultaneously Newton's third law is more precisely stated as: Whenever one object exerts a force on a second object, the second object exerts an equal and opposite force on the first. The key word in this definition is whenever, as in the same If you pull on a shopping cart today, and the cart pulls on something else tomorrow, the two pulls do not constitute an action-reaction pair. An action-reaction pair of forces occurs at the same time. When you pull on a cart, the cart pulls back on you simultaneously. These simultaneous forces constitute a single interaction. Action and reaction forces occur in pairs Forces occur only in pairs. Any force by one object on another cannot exist without the existence of an equal and opposite reaction force. A single force without a reaction counterpart does not exist in the world of physics. I repeat this for emphasis: A single force without a reaction counterpart does not exist in the world of physics. Figure 2 illustrates four interactions and the associated action-reaction force pairs. When walking, you interact with the ground. One force, your push backward against the ground, is accompanied by a second force, the ground pushing forward against you. Action and reaction constitute a pair of forces--always. Similarly, the tires of an automobile push back against the road while the road pushes forward on the tires--the tires and road simultaneously push against each other. In these examples, reaction forces depend on friction to account for the motion produced. [FIGURE 3 OMITTED] A person or car on ice, for example, may not be able to exert the action force to produce the needed reaction force. …",

From this conception the relevant kind of entities with which we (adults) establish and design interactions and predictions to move us in the world is the kind of concrete entities known by us as agents –i.e. the kind of entities which we effectively could touch, manipulate, reconstruct, and such objects that we could avoid etc. Shadows and holes seem to remain outside the domain of this kind and then the relevant kind to establish and design interactions and predictions by adults not includes these non-concrete entities.

      "title": "An Exploration of the Principles of Loss of Character through Fundamental Cognitive Mechanisms",
      "abstract": "In the 21st century, humanity is hearing warnings that its very existence is threatened in a serious crisis not only socio- environmentally, but also in the natural environment. As one of the fundamental causes, the seriousness of loss of character is pointed out throughout society, and the need for character restoration is in strong demand. However, due to the absence of agreed upon knowledge about what character is and how it is lost, effective character education for essential character healing or the prevention of fundamental loss of character is not possible. Unlike other studies on character, the reality of character was essentially explored from the origin of the mind, where various mental phenomena arise (Song, 2022). According to the study, character is composed of two conflicting desires of nature: a nature for ‘emptiness,’ which is a mind that tries not to think and thus any cognitive structure (knowledge) does not appear internally, and a nature for ‘appearance,’ which is a mind that tries to think of forming knowledge and thus knowledge appears internally. According to this study, loss of character refers to a situation in which emptiness is weakly or barely expressed compared to manifest nature, which is excessively expressed, meaning that the mind of knowledge appears excessively inside, while the empty mind appears in a small or almost non-existent manner. Accordingly, this paper explored how this loss of character occurs through fundamental cognitive mechanisms (Song &amp; Porath, 2006). According to the results, this study confirmed that the loss of character is due to ‘obsession’ with material phenomena caused by ‘autistic phenomenon’, where the brain's cognitive space grows excessively and too much attention is drawn inward and consciousness becomes trapped within it. Based on this character loss mechanism, this paper provides a discussion on the direction of character loss prevention education that can prevent character loss or its deepening.",

      "title": "Influence of Implicit Beliefs and Visual Working Memory on Label Use",
      "abstract": "Influence of Implicit Beliefs and Visual Working Memory on Label Use Amanda Hahn (achahn30@gmail.com) Takashi Yamauchi (tya@psyc.tamu.edu) Na-Yung Yu (nayungyu@gmail.com) Department of Psychology, Mail Stop 4235 Texas AM Reasoning; Decision Making; Labeling; Visual Working Memory; Implicit Beliefs Introduction When introduced to novel items, people use cues in order to assimilate those items into previously formed categories. We categorize items in a variety of ways: such as living or non-living, color and shape, or by how the item is used. When categorizing, language plays a key role through labeling because labels are one of the indicators people use to make categorical decisions and generalizations. For example, by knowing an object is called ―oven‖, we make assumptions about the object (e.g. it is used for cooking or crafts, it has a timer, etc.) Likewise, labeling people as ―Hispanic‖ or ―feminist‖ leads others to make generalizations about them, sometimes faulty ones. However, not everyone influenced by labels to the same degree. What influences some people to use labels to judge and generalize more than others? Previous studies have focused on label use itself, finding that participants tend to judge dissimilar looking pictures as more similar when the two pictures have the same label. Furthermore, labels have been shown to have an influence on several types of decisions. For example, children believe that the name of an animal will not change even if its surface features change to make it appear like another animal (Rips, 1989). The effect of labels goes beyond the superficial as category labels have been one factor that represents people‘s inner beliefs. Research shows that category membership, especially when it is denoted by verbal labels, influences the way people perceive attributes of stimuli (Goldstone, 1994, 1995; Livingston, Andrews, & Harnad, 1998; Yamauchi & Yu, 2008; Yamauchi, Kohn, & Yu, 2007). The category membership also affects subjects‘ perceptions of similarity between images (Yu, Yamauchi, & Schumacher, 2008; Yu & Yamauchi, 2008). One source of labeling‘s power is that people believe surface features are representative of deeper properties of an item and that these properties are stable and innate (Medin & Ortony, 1989; Gelman, Heyman & Legare, 2007). In this regard, previous research has suggested that labels not only represent categorical membership (Yamauchi & Yu, 2008) but also evoke innate qualities of items, such differentiating between animate or inanimate objects (Yu et al., 2008). These research findings suggest that category labels are a part of people‘s assumptions. However, individuals have been shown to possess different belief systems which hold varying assumptions. Although there has been extensive research on how different types of labels influence decisions, there has been little illumination on how these individual differences and beliefs affect the tendency to rely on labels when making categorical and similarity judgments. Social cognition studies show that there are individual differences regarding how a person views the world in terms of the rigidity (fixed/rigid theory) or malleability of traits (flexible/entity theory) (Dweck, Chiu, & Hong, 1995). How these systems influence an individual‘s use of labels is unclear. We believe the extent to which a person believes that features and properties are unchanging and that those features are reflective of deep, innate properties will likely affect a person‘s tendency to view a label as a representation of the similarity between items. Although the effect of labels is very strong, the effect is not absolute. Some people disregard labels and instead focus on physical appearance when making judgments. One influential factor may be an individual‘s visual working memory (VWM) span. Studies have shown that individuals differ in the ability to process visual information (Palmer, 1990; Luck & Vogel, 1997). This capacity for visual information can be measured by a visual working memory span task (Luck & Vogel, 1997). Research on working memory suggests that there are different systems for verbal and visual working memory and that the two interact (Baddeley, 1992; Morey & Cowan, 2004). Furthermore, identifying labels is interrupted by processing visual information at the same time as shown in task such as the Stroop Test (Stroop 1935). Thus, we suggest that having larger visual working memory can result in less use of",

      "abstract": "The aim of the paper is to emphasise the significance of physical activity as an element directly or indirectly modulating the perception of pain during ontogenesis. Pain is a distinctive sensory sensation and also a subjective criterion of health or disease. In contrast to other modalities (taste, smell, touch), it triggers solely negative emotions and sensations. Pain is a highly individualised sensory phenomenon, involving the physical, cognitive and emotional spheres of human life. Different reactions to pain during ontogeny most often result from the loss of communication skills, a systematic decrease in the functions of all systems and organs, in particular the nervous system, and limited physical activity. Motivation for physical activity translates into motivation to improve the quality of life. From the ontogenetic perspective pain perception cannot be limited to nociception, because the perception of pain is subjective and depends on the community in which we live, our religion, individual life philosophy, as well as intellectual interests.",

I may not have thrown the baby into the river to drown and yet I can be blamed for not jumping in to save her for fear of getting my clothes wet. In such instances, “not doings” can be as violent as some doings. It is important, therefore, to take seriously the ontological status of absences, failures or omissions and to consider (for instance) “not attempting to save the drowning child” as having a distinct moral status. While not leaping to the rescue of the drowning child in our example, I may look the other way or walk away fast; and surely the acts of “looking away or walking fast” cannot be construed as violent. But even though the primary locus of moral evaluation may be the “negative action,” the positive acts (of looking away, of walking fast) become alibis by covering up for the omission. We have here not just “turning my head the other way” but of doing it “instead of attempting a rescue—a quite different matter.",

      "abstract": "Norms are instructions how to act. Their form is the imperative or hypothetical imperative: ‘Do X’, ‘Don’t do X’, or ‘if Y, then do X’. There are moral norms, epistemic norms, norms of practical rationality, and social norms. In following norms we come to believe truths, to be justified in our belief, act rationally, lead a virtuous life, and act in morally permissible ways. In following social norms we come to lead a life that is acceptable to a given society, a life that conforms to this socially established way of living. Social norms thereby differ from other norms in that their prescriptions are relative rather than universal. At the most trivial level these norms can be no more than a matter of etiquette: they are a matter of adopting the right register, wearing the right clothes, or, for instance, using the outermost knife and fork first. In these matters most would accept that when in Rome one should do as the Romans do. But this easy-going relativism towards the prescriptions of social norms is not always so easy: social norms can be strongly felt. And nor are all social norms trivial: adopting the right register, for instance, can shade into treating someone the right way and thereby engage moral norms. Similarly, prescriptions of politeness can overlap with epistemic prescriptions. ‘Believe people’ might be a matter of politeness, but it could also be an epistemic norm if truth-telling were the norm. Is ‘tell the truth’ a social norm, and so the norm? Should we believe people? This chapter aims to argue that, roughly speaking, we have these social norms. It aims to offer an explanation of these social norms and an account of how this bears on epistemological theories of testimony as a source of knowledge.",

      "title": "Introduction: Groningen Naturalism in Bioethics",
      "abstract": "Talk of “naturalizing” ethics carries different messages to different ears. If naturalism is a trend or a theme in many areas of philosophy at the beginning of the twenty-first century, it is not one trend or theme but several that may cohere or compete. Minimally, naturalism in ethics is committed to understanding moral judgment and moral agency in terms of natural facts about ourselves and our world. To some moral naturalists, this commitment means that moral judgments capture (or fail to capture) facts about the world that obtain independently of human opinion or feelings. Here naturalism means a metaphysical commitment to a kind of moral realism that can take forms as diverse as Aristotelian teleology and consequentialist appeals to facts about human welfare or happiness. For other naturalists, though, our capacities for moral judgment do not track truths in the world independent of us but are part of the naturally given expressive and adaptive equipment of human beings: we are a norm-hungry social species whose members need to coordinate actions and attitudes and that evolutionary pressure has “designed for social life.” These naturalists seek the explanation of our moral capacities in facts about the human beings, who, as a naturally occurring species, without recourse to supernatural or transcendent realities, bring morality into the world with them. Despite intense debate among realist and antirealist naturalists in ethics, there is widespread agreement that a scientific view of ourselves and the world is ultimately (and perhaps exclusively) authoritative, a touchstone and resource for naturalism in ethics.",

For the protection of health and production of ailments Hita and Ahita anna is responsible respectively.

Agni converts food in the form of biological energy, which is responsible for all the vital functions of our body. Grahani is the disease of Annavaha Srotas, as well directly related to status of Agni and diet habits. Passage of stools alternating with constipation or diarrhea (muhur baddham muhur dravam) is the fundamental symptom of Grahani Roga. Ayurveda regards Grahani as a Tridoshatmaka, which is the disorder of digestive system caused by reason of vitiation of Jatharagni, Saman Vayu, Pachakagni, Kledaka Kapha. The failure in digestion of ingested food (production of Pakwapakwam), malabsorption of the food absorption, excessive motility of gut resulting in recurrent emigration of the bowel. All the unpredictable variations of Agni i.e., Mandagni, Tiksnagni and Vishamagni are treated as Grahani Roga.

Every man has certain expectations about remaining alive and an untimely death (i.e., one before the normal span of life is complete) is one that human beings are naturally averse from, but that is not the real point. The point is being killed: or at any rate that's where we begin. But it is not being killed in any manner (e.g., struck by lightning or buried in an earthquake); it is only being killed by another man. Why is it this and not other ways of being killed that are relevant? What does being killed by another man signify? It signified failure in the 'race' for precedence which constitutes human life-failure, not in competition with the natural world, but in competition with other human beings. And this I take to be the central point; and this is what is meant by shameful death. To be killed by another man is eo ipso shameful or dishonourable because it signified that inferiority vis-a-vis other men which is the centre of all human aversion. In other words, desire is directed, not towards survival, but towards being first (and thus being 'honoured' and meriting 'honour'); and aversion is",

The application of means of restraint from the space of physical strength, which usually precedes the activity of cuffing, requires a good knowledge of individual fighting techniques, and especially levers which serve to bring the person into the cuffing position by creating the feeling of acute pain. In that sense, lever is a good choice, because by executing lever, a person can be kept under control both for a shorter and a longer period of time, i.e. as long as it takes for cuffing to be performed safely. For that reason, it is important to know and distinguish the factors that define the individual value of each lever: possible level of infliction of pain (availability of body part, possibility of precise support, required level of force, time required for realization, etc.), as well as basic consequences of lever application. The applied lever, whose execution is harmonized with the previously mentioned factors, will produce sufficiently intense acute pain. Pain is an unpleasant sensory or emotional experience that is caused by potential or existing tissue damage or one that is described in words that would correspond to the said damage.",

When, for some reason, an action is interrupted, suspended, diverted or stopped, the production of meaning and sense continues beyond the interruption or breakage. The suspension is, in addition to being an observable motor fact, the sign and the index of other alternative senses.

      "title": "Health, Health Care, and Systems Science: Emerging Paradigm",
      "abstract": "Health is a continuum of an optimized state of a biologic system, an outcome of positive relationships with the self and others. A healthy system follows the principles of systems science derived from observations of nature, highlighting the character of relationships as the key determinant. Relationships evolve from our decisions, which are consequential to the function of our own biologic system on all levels, including the genome, where epigenetics impact our morphology. In healthy systems, decisions emanate from the reciprocal collaboration of hippocampal memory and the executive prefrontal cortex. We can decide to change relationships through choices. What is selected, however, only represents the cognitive interpretation of our limited sensory perception; it strongly reflects inherent biases toward either optimizing state, making a biologic system healthy, or not. Health or its absence is then the outcome; there is no inconsequential choice. Public health effort should not focus on punitive steps (e.g. taxation of unhealthy products or behaviors) in order to achieve a higher level of public’s health. It should teach people the process of making healthy decisions; otherwise, people will just migrate/shift from one unhealthy product/behavior to another, and well-intended punitive steps will not make much difference. Physical activity, accompanied by nutrition and stress management, have the greatest impact on fashioning health and simultaneously are the most cost-effective measures. Moderate-to-vigorous exercise not only improves aerobic fitness but also positively influences cognition, including memory and senses. Collective, rational societal decisions can then be anticipated. Health care is a business system principally governed by self-maximizing decisions of its components; uneven and contradictory outcomes are the consequences within such a non-optimized system. Health is not health care. We are biologic systems subject to the laws of biology in spite of our incongruous decisions that are detrimental to health. A biologic system/a human body originates from structural, deterministic genes as well as shared epigenetic memory of our ancestors affecting our bodily function and structure. The political governing systems’ vertical hierarchy has control over money and laws, neither of which materially affect individual lifestyle/behavioral choices toward health. Improved health comes from focusing on enhancing the biologic age and not the chronologic one, which simply represents a linear time from a birth certificate to a death certificate and is applicable only in its extremes. “Age-related diseases” are simply reflections of a given culture. Biologic age, reflecting the actual state of health, could be used in all health-related assessments including health-life insurance premiums, licensing of job categories, etc., all with a broader and healthy societal impact.",

In Ayurveda, the global problem of obesity has been mentioned to as Sthoulya or Medhoroga in classical texts by the majority of Acharyas under the moniker of Santarpanottha Vikara. An individual having greatness and massiveness of the body because of broad development particularly in Udaradi area is named as “Sthoola” and this Bhava (province) of Sthoolata is called as “Sthoulya”. Sthoulya has been characterized as an individual who by virtue of the excessive increment of fat and tissue is recognized with pendulous rear end, tummy and bosoms and whose expanded mass isn’t matched by a comparing expansion in energy. Ahara plays an important part in Swasthya Rakshana due to its pathya aspect, and pathya can become Ayatana (reason or Nidana) for both health and disease. Despite the reality is oushadha has a therapeutic impact, Oushadhamatra (Quantity of Medicine) is always lesser than AharaMatra (Quantity of Food). Aims &amp; Objectives: To assess the efficacy of Scheduled diet and Udvarthana in Sthoulya. Setting: Swasthavritta &amp;Yoga OPD of R.P. Karadi Hospital ILKAL. Method: Udvarthana and Scheduled diet was advised, assessed before and after treatment, advised for follow up. Discussion: The present study was undertaken to explain the concept of sthoulya (Obesity) and then to formulate proper scheduled diet and udvarthana. Conclusion: In the present study, the scheduled diet and udvarthana procedure are designed to effectively reduce the weight, BMI and anthropometric measurements.",

      "abstract": "The author was a mathematician and an engineer. His view of longevity is similar to his past experience on designing and building a structure or a machine which he calls an “object”. The expected lifespan of an object is similar to the longevity of a human being based on the following three factors: (1) The availability of good and strong building materials that are similar to the genetic factors of a human body health conditions. (2) The engineering design and site construction of this object are similar to the lifestyle, life-long habits, and environmental factors which are related to the health of the human body. (3) The building’s damaged cracks or the machine’s malfunctioned parts under external forces are similar to the medical conditions and symptoms of disease in the human body. If the object suffers from operational problems due to external forces that is similar to the human body being affected by various diseases, then we can repair the object such as adopting the reinforcement of the building structural part or replacing the operational part of the machine. They are similar to the medical treatments including medication interventions, different surgeries, or organ transplants. Once the author understood the analogy and similarity between an engineering object and a human body, he can then distinguish the differences among genetic reason, lifestyle maintenance, disease control, and medical treatments. It is extremely difficult, almost impossible at present time, to change our genes because we cannot select our biological parents; however, we can focus on our daily lifestyle management to either prevent from having diseases or controlling the progression of existing diseases.",

      "abstract": "Language is a method of communication that transmits intended and unintended meanings. Unintended stigmatizing meanings, which are probably more insidious and dangerous (than language that clearly communicates intended meanings) can perpetuate socially constructed power dynamics and become so “commonplace” that they are invisible. Persons must be aware of these unintended stigmatizing meanings. This is especially important in language about marginalized persons such as persons with mental illness.",

      "abstract": "Humans are immersed in an ocean of words — we understand them, think with them, repeat them, play with their sounds and meanings, and create novel combinations that are understandable to other humans adrift in our part of the ocean. The skill with which a human uses words in speaking has long been a key element in the perception of his or her intelligence. We have a marked tendency to treat people who are articulate as more intelligent than those who are speak poorly. For example, I am startled when a well-spoken ‘customer service representative’ on the telephone is unable to spell psychology or to retain a seven-digit phone number. I am surprised in the opposite direction when someone who speaks English poorly, or with a large proportion of uninterpretable slang, suddenly conveys a subtle and discerning point or quickly fixes a complex problem with my computer software. This language test also has traditionally been used to separate the intellectual ability of humans from that of other animals. Put simply, if other animals can’t understand and generate words or signs in sentencelike combinations, we judge them as less intelligent than humans. The language-based divide that we have constructed between humans and other animals is well defended. During the last 30 years, work suggesting language-related communication in species ranging from chimpanzees to sea lions has attracted a firestorm of criticism that questioned its accuracy, efficacy, and importance. Objections have included claims of outright fraud, inadvertent cuing, and dismissal of results as ‘mere trial-and-error learning’. Perhaps the most common academic complaint is that the language-like productions of nonhumans lack the grammatical constraints and generativity characteristic of human language. Why are humans, certainly academic humans, so intent on distinguishing human language reception and production from the abilities of nonhuman animals? One possibility is that language is the key to a number",

      "abstract": "The theory of Gesellschaft takes as its starting point a group of people who, as in Gemeinschaft, live peacefully alongside one another, but in this case without being essentially united – indeed, on the contrary, they are here essentially detached. In Gemeinschaft they stay together in spite of everything that separates them; in Gesellschaft they remain separate in spite of everything that unites them. As a result, there are no activities taking place which are derived from an a priori and pre-determined unity and which therefore express the will and spirit of this unity through any individual who performs them. Nothing happens in Gesellschaft that is more important for the individual's wider group than it is for himself. On the contrary, everyone is out for himself alone and living in a state of tension against everyone else. The various spheres of power and activity are sharply demarcated, so that everyone resists contact with others and excludes them from his own spheres, regarding any such overtures as hostile. Such a negative attitude is the normal and basic way in which these power-conscious people relate to one another, and it is characteristic of Gesellschaft at any given moment in time. Nobody wants to do anything for anyone else, nobody wants to yield or give anything unless he gets something in return that he regards as at least an equal trade-off.",

      "abstract": "According to the traditional views of the New Guinea natives sudden violent illnesses, epidemics, disabilities, congenital deformities, mental handicaps, accidents, violent deaths are most of the times being ascribed to actions of the supernatural forces, usually to ghosts and magic. Only the slight wounds and insufficient functions weaknesses if their physical base was evident, suicide, senile or death at war (although not always) were considered as \"natural\". According to the natives, breach of common law granted by the supernatural, especially of taboo is the basic cause of sickness and death. The diagnosis and treatment of the patient is carried in accordance with this concept. Quacks start with trying to establish the \"actual\" cause of sickness or death; often the blame is attributed to effect of destructive magic of several kinds. Especially dangerous is the so called \"death spell\", particularly the one connected with \"poisoning\" or \"destruction of interior\" by a witch or wizard. On the basis of established cause the quack applies treatment consisting usually of many elements. At first the actual cause is to be removed, i.e. the sick person has to undo the damage he made or ease the wrath of the supernatural and, if need be, the soul of the patient which got lost or was abducted has to be found. Sometimes the wizard who cast the spell has to be identified and made to give an antidote to the sick person. Occasionally the quack extracted the foreign body from the body of a sick person. Customarily the sick person received also the multi-component curing specimen consisting of, among others, herbs of great curing effect. The composition of those specimens, especially of antidote for \"magic poisons\" is kept secret.",

Celtic supernatural beings described in folktale (Scottish elves, witches or ‘selkies.’ Irish síth, Breton korrigan, Cornish Spriggans and so on) may use song (and less often, dance) in various tactical ways and modes: to decorate their own ‘parallel’ (but Other) cultural realm, to celebrate and show the superior Otherness of this realm, to lure humans into their power (often breaking the boundaries of ‘human’ time and space in the process) or for other reasons. Eastern and South Slavic supernatural beings (Russian rusalka, Serbian vile and others) show some similar characteristics, though the vila herself has variant forms (which can be related to the Dumézilian fonctions) – and some shamanistic modes seem possible here. In the end, in both contexts supernatural beings are described as separated from humankind – but then ‘song and dance’ brings them back into the human realm again. Their acts and intentions may be benignant or malignant, but what is shown is the imagined power of the Other, and we can indeed find valuable comparanda in the two Indo-European (Celtic and Slavic) cultural-linguistic areas.",

      "abstract": "The central premise of the present chapter is that humans routinely undervalue animals relative to themselves. This devaluing has implications not only for animals, in terms of welfare and exploitation, but also for humans. For instance, devaluing animals increases the social value of representing other social groups as animal-like, thus denying these human groups the protections otherwise afforded to humans (and one's own group). But there are also implications for those who protect animals or, at minimum, refuse to engage in the exploitation of animals. Recent research demonstrates that among many meat eaters, vegans and vegetarians are relatively disliked and viewed as threatening. This is particularly the case for vegans and vegetarians who cite animal justice (vs health or environmental concerns) for their renunciation of meat. Overall the research record increasingly shows that our thinking about animals is intimately and systematically linked to our thinking about other human groups in ways that entrench dominance over animals and those mentally associated with animals. The implications of these associations are explored.",

One of the unusual features of Scone is its multiple-context system. Each context represents a distinct world-model, but a context can inherit most of the knowledge of another context, explicitly representing just the differences. We explore how this multiple-context mechanism can be used to emulate some aspects of human mental behavior that are difficult or impossible to emulate in other representational formalisms. These include reasoning about hypothetical or counter-factual situations; understanding how the world model changes over time due to specific actions or spontaneous changes; and reasoning about the knowledge and beliefs of other agents, and how their mental state may affect the actions of those agents.",

      "title": "Excitation of visual sensory experiences by electromagnetic fields of lightning",
      "abstract": "Lightning flashes can interact with a human in six different ways [1-3]. These are through direct strikes, side flashes, ground currents, shock waves, connecting leaders, and electromagnetic fields. A direct strike results when the lightning channel terminates on the person's body. In this case, there is a direct current injection from the lightning flash into the body as a result of which the person generally may experience cardiac and/or respiratory arrests; about 20% of the victims die as a result. A side flash happens when the human is located close to an object struck by lightning. The potential gradient created by the current flow along the object may give rise to a discharge between the object and the human. A portion of the lightning current will flow along this discharge path and pass through the body. Depending on the path along which the current travels through the body, the injuries could be similar to that of a direct strike. Someone standing close to the point at which lightning strikes could be injured by ground currents as the current flowing through the ground short-circuits its path by passing into the body from one leg and flowing out from the other. Since the current path is not directly through the brain or the heart, the injuries tend to be less severe than those caused by a direct strike. Injuries can also arise from shock waves created by the lightning channel. During a lightning strike, the channel temperature can rise to about 25,000 K and the channel pressure can increase to several atmospheres. The rapid expansion of heated air creates a shock wave that can injure a person located close to a lightning strike. Someone standing in the vicinity of a lightning strike could also be injured by an aborted connecting leader. Connecting leaders are initiated from grounded objects, including humans, under the influence of the electric field generated by the down-coming stepped leader. The resultant electric field is concentrated on sharp points and on the tips of grounded objects, increasing the electric field at these points to several times the background electric field. In the case of a person standing, the maximum field enhancement would take place on the top of the head. The electric field continues to grow as the stepped leader approaches the ground, and when the electric field at the tip of an object exceeds a critical value, a corona discharge (known in the popular literature as St. Elmo's fire) is initiated from it. This corona discharge continues to grow as the stepped leader approaches the ground and when the charge associated with it reaches a critical level, a thermalized electrical discharge travelling from the tip towards the down-coming stepped leader is formed. Several objects, including humans, in the vicinity of a lightning channel may launch connecting leaders, but only one of them will succeed in joining with the stepped leader. The object that initiated the 'successful' connecting leader will receive a direct strike. As the electric field collapses during the lightning strike, the connecting leaders issued by other objects will be aborted, but the current generated by these aborted leaders could be large enough to cause injury especially if it happened to be created from a person's head. When the person is located at a sufficiently large distance where the electric field is not large enough to launch a connecting leader, a corona discharge may still be issued from the person's head.The electric current passing through the body during a direct strike or during the launch of a connecting leader can be large enough to cause either cardiac arrest or a respiratory arrest, or both. If, however, someone is located at a distance large enough to ensure that they will not be affected by direct strikes, connecting leaders or ground currents, the person can still be affected by the lightning-generated electromagnetic fields and the corona currents generated from the body.In this chapter, we will consider the possible interactions, either direct or indirect, of the lightning-generated electromagnetic fields with the brain or the visual system of humans to induce visual sensations. Some of these visual sensations are known as phosphenes in the medical literature. Since some of these visual sensations could be misinterpreted as ball lightning, this subject is of interest for lightning researchers due to the still unsolved problem of the origin of ball lightning.",

      "title": "On Death and Human Existence",
      "abstract": "The topic of death, now fashionable and much discussed, raises questions in almost every field of thought. Death has always been thought hateful, or almost always; hateful, and enigmatic. In the Christian and Jewish traditions death has always been terrible, something that reveals the distance between God and man and man’s dereliction; and it is therefore thought to be something that in some obscure sense ought not to happen. The primitive account of the passion in Mark and Matthew—characteristically and no doubt deliberately omitted by Luke—records the great cry of agony taken from Psalm 22: “My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?” In the same psalm we find: “I am poured out like water, and all my bones are out of joint; my heart is like wax, it is melted within my breast . . . and my tongue cleaves to my jaws; thou dost lay me in the dust of death.” Here is no attempt to prettify death or to make the process of dying acceptable. Death is intolerable. Of course, there are other biblical ways of looking at death. In (and out of) the Bible we are given the picture of the just man full of years and honour who dies surrounded by his children and his children’s children. This is a fortunate death, and if to this we add the element contributed by Christianity, namely, the reception of the eucharist (viaticum, journey money, analogous to the placing of a coin in the dead man’s mouth to pay Charon’s ferry charges), and the anointing (formerly) of those parts of the body that have so often taken us away from God, and the sacramental remission of sin through confession and absolution, we understand how this can properly be called “a happy death.”",

      "abstract": "In a previous paper (“Proceedings,” vol. xxvii, p. 410) we communicated experimental results relating to the phenomena which present themselves in the ventricle of the heart of the frog, when mechanically or electrically excited. Our present purpose is to report what has been done during the past w inter towards the further elucidation of the subject. By the term “excitatory state” we mean, as in our former communication, nothing more than the condition which is produced in any excitable structure (whether in plants or animals) by excitation. So far as it has been as yet investigated, this state is characterised (1) by the appearance of electromotive properties in the excited part, which did not exist before excitation, and cease to exist as soon as its effect is over; (2) by diminished excitability (showing itself in the suspension or diminution of the power which the structure before possessed of responding to a second excitation); (3) by the fact that it is propagated from the part first excitei to contiguous parts at a rate which is different in different structures and in the same structure at different temperatures. Hitherto the relations of these three facts have been chiefly studied in the excitable tissues of the higher animals. Our investigations lead us to conclud that they are equally characteristic of the excitatory state in plants We attach great importance to them, as being the only outward and visible signs by which the hidden process of excitation constantly reveals itself. For those more obvious changes which, in the contractile structures, follow excitation, are wanting in those which art merely excitable, and thereby lose their value as characteristics.",

      "title": "The paradox of the act",
      "abstract": "An act, unlike other forms of action, is characterized by the fact that the subject who performs the act is changed, on the symbolic level, into someone else, often irreversibly, as in the example of a woman who is transformed from single to married in the act of matrimony. The paradox is that the person performing the act is not present because she is no longer who she was and not yet who she will be. Clinical phenomena like inhibition can be viewed as a refusal to disappear in the act. Once this is acknowledged, change may be more possible. For example, if a person realizes that in quitting smoking he or she is quitting the existence as a smoker, they may be more ready to take on such a challenge.",

      "abstract": "Communication in primates is biased towards vocal behavior, and humans are a particularly dramatic example. Across species, sounds are produced by an anatomically similar vocal tract, with humans having exceptionally large amounts of control over it. Vocal communication has also been one of the most formidable windows into the primate mind, which has resulted in considerable progress in understanding the cognitive capacities of primates. There is good evidence that primates understand a call as produced by a specific individual engaged in a specific social interaction or with an external event. In chimpanzees and bonobos, call production is goal‐directed, often strategic, and individuals can be aware of the social consequences of their calls, based on their prior interaction histories. However, so far, there is little evidence that any primate, apart from humans, communicates just to maintain a social bond or actively provides information for another.",

      "title": "The Unconscious",
      "abstract": "In discussing the extent of personal agency at the end of Chapter 7, I raised the issue of unconscious action. It is not at all unusual for us to see people doing something that they appear to be completely unaware of. By this I don't just mean that they might be doing things that are just outside the focus of their consciousness, like twitching or tapping their feet. We always exhibit behaviour that we are not conscious of in this sense. This sort of 'preconscious' behaviour is not controversial (Freud, 1957). But it may be that I think they are purposefully and subtly putting me in a difficult position, irritating me or making me feel guilty. If challenged, they would strenuously deny what I think they're doing, disavowing it as a purposeful action. Now it could be that it's just me who is being oversensitive. Perhaps I often think other people are trying to irritate me or make me feel guilty — it's a characteristic of my construing and not a feature of their personality. There is always a danger of confusing what we read into or project onto other people with what is really their property.KeywordsCausal PowerInternalise HomophobiaCartesian DualismObject Relation TheoristUnconscious MindThese keywords were added by machine and not by the authors.

Exactly through inactivity, the internal will of a person materializes due to which a person becomes a participant of public relations. At the same time in the absence of external expression of will inactivity of a person can not cause the occurrence of legal consequences, in particular, to be examined as a reason of origin of tort liabilities. If a person enacted because of negligence or poor awareness, it should be defined: whether a person knew or had to know about the necessity to perform a certain action. Accordingly, if a person possessed such knowledge this form of behavior will be treated as guilty omission, if not – this is an example of innocent omission. Responsibility for illegal omission can arise only when appropriate persons are included in the system of civil and legal relationships, thus are the subjects of civil relations. Damage caused by “reflexive movements” testifies the carelessness of a person to his/her behavior, which reflects his/her will. Therefore, such behavior of a person is considered to be wrongful.",

Thus, if a single organ or system of the human body was elevated to one of these higher symmetry states at birth and the rest of the body was not, seemingly all functions of the body could be driven via this energy source to exhibit what we call life, i.e., the heart would pump blood, nerve synapses would switch on and off, electric currents would flow, the brain would be activated to direct various body processes, etc. Interestingly, experimental data shows us that there is at least one important body system that is at one of these higher EM gauge symmetry states!",

These are questions to which we might seek answers in the mythologies of ancient Greece and India, medieval Germany, and 20th and 21st century America. Many of these texts seem to regard invisibility as a subjective mental state, subject to suggestion and the projection of ideas, while others think of it as a more physical, scientific phenomenon, residing in the eye and subject to chemical or electric forces or the projection of rays of light. The two views combine when myths treat invisibility as the projection of a false or absent self from the mind and/or eyes of the magician into the mind and/or eyes of the beholder. In both cases, invisibility often shades off into masquerade and shapeshifting, as shadows, doubles, reflections, or camouflage hide the one true self from the observer or confuse the object of the gaze with the background or with another person.",

If early humans had not discovered that their draw ings conveyed meaning to others as well as to themselves, the earliest form of pictorial communication, picture-writing, would never have begun. Therefore, a deeper study of the writing processes may lead to better understanding of reading problems. The interaction between language and drawing is not surprising if one considers that both are part of the symbolic function of the brain which makes possible the representation of an object, event, or conceptual scheme by means of a signifier or sign. Several behavior patterns fall under this representative or figura ti ve ability of the mind, and all are based on the evocation of an object or event which is not present. This absent object may be evoked through imitative play activities, mental images, graphic images, physical gestures, or verbal actions. These functions appear toward the end of a child's second year and in crease in complexity through the sixth year when they are incorpo rated into more concrete operations which combine representation and abstract thinking. A study was undertaken in the Washington, D.C, elementary schools to discover new approaches to reading that would take advantage of the child's symbolic thinking and employ language and images relevant and credible to children, particularly disadvantaged children. Of the various symbolic behaviors, the graphic image is the easiest to",

One important factor is fear, forcing the patient away from the analyst; another defiance, 'not taking things lying down'; a third, curiosity; a fourth, naughtily testing out the analyst's tolerance, and so on. Objects are skilfully and carefully avoided, while constant watch is kept on them, especially on the most hazardous object, the analyst. The analyst should not be an entity in his own right, with his own ideas, clever suggestions, and profound interpretations, in fact not a separate sharply contoured object at all; but should merge as completely as possible into the 'friendly expanses' surrounding the patient.",

Whether the organism is a single cell, an individual, a small group, or a large aggregate of people, its struggle both to use and to withstand its environment is filled with drama. The environment is constantly changing and, as a result, it always poses a threat to the integrity and survival of the organism. Can the organism adjust to the changes? Can it take advantage of them and prosper? Or will it succumb to them and disappear into its environment? If it is able to remain distinct from its environment, what price will the organism have to pay for its survival? Will radical alterations have to occur in its own internal structure, or can the demands of the environment be readily absorbed and adaptation smoothly accomplished? Such questions are fascinating partly because the survival of the organism can never be taken for granted and its struggles thus attract attention, partly because the questions evoke feelings about the dignity of life and thus command sympathy, and partly because the answers to them are not easily acquired and thus arouse curiosity and tax the imagination.",

      "abstract": "The five-factor model of personality (FFM) is a set of five broad trait dimensions or domains, often referred to as the “Big Five”: Extraversion, Agreeableness, Conscientiousness, Neuroticism (sometimes named by its polar opposite, Emotional Stability), and Openness to Experience (sometimes named Intellect). Highly extraverted individuals are assertive and sociable, rather than quiet and reserved. Agreeable individuals are cooperative and polite, rather than antagonistic and rude. Conscientious individuals are task focused and orderly, rather than distractible and disorganized. Neurotic individuals are prone to experiencing negative emotions, such as anxiety, depression, and irritation, rather than being emotionally resilient. Finally, highly open individuals have a broad rather than narrow range of interests, are sensitive rather than indifferent to art and beauty, and prefer novelty to routine. The Big Five/FFM was developed to represent as much of the variability in individuals’ personalities as possible, using only a small set of trait dimensions. Many personality psychologists agree that its five domains capture the most important, basic individual differences in personality traits and that many alternative trait models can be conceptualized in terms of the Big Five/FFM structure. The goal of this article is to reference, organize, and comment on a variety of classic and contemporary papers related to the Big Five/FFM. This article begins with papers that introduce the Big Five/FFM structure, approach it from different theoretical perspectives, and consider possible objections to it (General Overviews, Theoretical Perspectives, and Critiques). Next, it discusses papers providing evidence for the Big Five/FFM as a model of basic trait structure (Big Five/FFM Structure). Third, the article considers hierarchical trait models that propose even broader personality dimensions “above” the Big Five, or more-specific traits “beneath” the Big Five (Big Five/FFM in Hierarchical Context). Fourth, it references a series of handbook chapters that each considers an individual Big Five domain in depth (Individual Domains). Fifth, it references several widely used Big Five/FFM measures as well as papers examining the accuracy of Big Five self-reports and observer-reports (Measurement). Sixth, the article discusses the biological and social origins of the Big Five (Biological and Social Bases). Seventh, the article considers stability and change in the Big Five across the life span as well as the developmental mechanisms underlying stability and change (Development). Finally, this article cites evidence that the Big Five influences a variety of important behaviors and life outcomes, from political attitudes to psychopathology (Predicting Behaviors and Life Outcomes).",

      "abstract": "Given Descartes’s metaphysical and natural-philosophic commitments, it is difficult to theorize the pregnant human being as a human being under his system. Specifically, given (1) Descartes’s account of generation; (2) his commitment to mechanistic explanations where bodies are concerned; (3) his reliance on a subtle individuating principle for human (and animal) bodies; and (4) his metaphysics of human beings, which include minds, bodies, and mind-body unions, there is no available human substance or entity that may clearly be the subject of pregnancy. The incompatibility of any of the three options found in commitment 4 with commitment 1, 2, or 3, together with other undesirable consequences should any be selected, results in what I call the pregnancy problem. The pregnancy problem is a previously unconsidered problem for the Cartesian philosophy. Given the pregnancy problem, commitment 1, 2, 3, or 4, or a combination of these would have to be revised for Descartes’s system to avoid a variety of tensions; alternatively, counterintuitive consequences may have to be accepted. Ironically, given Descartes’s interest in generation and medicine more generally, the Cartesian framework struggles to accommodate pregnancy in human beings. This may have implications for the systematicity and sex neutrality of dualist metaphysics in general.",

      "abstract": "This text explains the importance of the concept of \"Being Me\" in the family and what needs to be done about it. \"Being me\" is possible when the individual knows himself, is spiritually strong, determines his priorities, knows and fulfills his limits and responsibilities, and is also aware of the psychological wounds he has experienced in the past. This process begins with the individual’s increasing deep awareness of self-knowledge. The process of self-knowledge enables the individual to explore his inner world and understand emotional states. “Being me” requires being spiritually strong. Spiritually strong people manage their emotions, thoughts and behaviors in a way that provides them success in life. Determining priorities means understanding what the individual values in life and acting accordingly. Likewise, knowing responsibilities and boundaries allows for a healthy balance in social relationships and maintaining the necessary space for personal growth. Recognizing wounds means recognizing past traumas and taking steps towards the healing process. It refers to the individual’s selfishness of prioritizing his own needs in the process of \"being me\" as \"not being able to break away from me\". On the contrary, it refers to situations such as being unable to protect one’s own freedom and personal identity and creating one’s own happiness through the happiness and preferences of one’s partner, as \"getting lost in you\". In this context, the process of \"Being Me\" is an important journey for the individual to discover himself and become spiritually stronger and mature. When spouses who have completed this process come together, a family that is happy, healthy and knows what it wants is formed.",

      "title": "The Importance of Language: A Quest for Accurate Definitions of Oromandibular Movement Disorders",
      "abstract": "Nelson Mandela once said: \"If you talk to a man in a language he understands, that goes to his head. If you talk to him in his own language, that goes to his heart\". In other words: if we genuinely want to connect with each other, we have to speak each other's language. Translating this to healthcare, this means that we should promote interdisciplinary and interprofessional collaboration, and this starts with clear language, hence accurate definitions. In otherwise healthy individuals, bruxism is defined as \"a repetitive jaw-muscle activity characterized by clenching or grinding of the teeth and/or by bracing or thrusting of the mandible\".1, 2 Bruxism can occur during sleep (indicated as sleep bruxism) or during wakefulness (indicated as awake bruxism)\". It can be a risk factor for negative health outcomes (eg, temporomandibular pain),2 but also a protective factor for positive health outcomes (eg, increasing upper airway patency).2 Therefore, bruxism is no longer considered a disorder but rather a motor behavior.2 However, in non-healthy individuals, it is still unclear how to label the jaw-muscle activities. Using \"bruxism\" for such activities is precluded by its current definition that is only valid in otherwise healthy individuals. Traditionally, bruxism has been a major issue in dentistry, while medical doctors have primarily dealt with oromandibular movement disorders like dyskinesias, dystonia, and tremors. During an open peer-review process, the reviewer asked a critical and empirical question: \"For people with Parkinson's disease, is masticatory muscle activity 'bruxism' at all?\".3 Also Yoshida (2023) questioned whether oromandibular dystonia is bruxism or vice versa.4 Unfortunately, interprofessional collaboration on the issue of bruxism and oromandibular movement disorders has been hampered by a silo approach, with medicine and dentistry working in their own settings.5 Yet, similar characteristics can be found for bruxism and oromandibular movement disorders (eg, [partly] involuntary, recurrent, repetitive), although not every movement in the orofacial area is difficult to distinguish from bruxism (eg, jaw-opening dystonia). The question therefore arises whether it is actually possible to distinguish bruxism and oromandibular movement disorders from one another by applying the existing definitions? We hypothesize that there are three possible answers to this question: (a) there is no overlap between definitions, in which case the above-identified silo approach could be acceptable after all; (b) there is partial overlap, suggesting that medical doctors and dentists should work together; and (c) the definitions are alike, so that we have to conclude that it is not correct that separate definitions exist. To examine these hypotheses, the bruxism definition should be expanded to include non-healthy individuals; interdisciplinary expert meetings should be organized to identify all existing definitions of oromandibular movement disorders, to scrutinize their complexity, and to analyze the possible overlapping characteristics with bruxism; and research must be carried out, eg, with face-recognition software, to address this issue from a clinical point of view. After the completion of the above actions, it is possible to see if, and if so, to what extent, bruxism and oromandibular movement disorders overlap, and thus whether medical and dental professionals should collaborate more than they currently practice.

The study of motivation should stress ultimate rather than partial goals, ends rather than means to ends. a) not only conscious but also unconscious motivations must be accounted for in a theory of motivation. There are, customarily, different cultural paths to the same goal. Therefore, conscious, specific, local desires are not so useful for motivation theory as fundamental, unconscious goals. Motivated behavior, either preparatory or consummatory, must be understood to be a channel through which many needs may be expressed or satisfied. Usually acts have more than one motivation. Practically all organismic states are to be understood as motivated. Man is a perpetually wanting animal; the appearance of a need rests on prior situations, on other prepotent needs; needs or desires must be arranged in hierarchies of prepotency. Lists of drives will get us no place for various reasons. Any classification of motivations must deal with the problem of level or specificity of classification. Classifications of motivations must be based upon goals rather than upon instigating drives. Motivation theory must be anthropocentric, not animalcentric. The situation or the field in which the organism reacts must be taken into account but it must be done with a dynamic interpretation of the situation or the field. Not only the integration of the organism must be taken into account but also the possibility of isolated, specific, partial or segmental responses must also be included.12",

      "abstract": "Liberty, Equality, Fraternity, and . . . Vulnerability Julia Kristeva (bio) Translated by Jeanine Herman Disabilities are multiple—motor, sensory, psychical, mental—and singular. Each disabled person is a singular person experiencing his or her situation in a specific, different, unique way. Yet whatever the disabilities, they confront us with incomparable exclusion, different from the others: the disabled person opens a narcissistic identity wound in the person who is not disabled; he inflicts a threat of physical or psychical death, fear of collapse, and, beyond that, the anxiety of seeing the very borders of the human species explode. And so the disabled person is inevitably exposed to a discrimination that cannot be shared. If I attempt to share this situation, however, it is not only because of my son's neurological difficulties, which led to an atypical education for him and exposed me to the singularity of each disabled person. Nor is it because, as a psychoanalyst, I have treated psychical disabilities (depression, psychosis, borderline states, and other disorders). But because my frequent visits outside the Hexagon have convinced me that, compared to countries such as Sweden, Norway, Belgium, Canada, the United States, and many others, France has been slow to establish a true solidarity with disabled people and to provide personalized support for each of them.1 In fact, at the dawn of this millennium, while biology, anthropology, and astrophysics explore human frontiers and the most advanced democracies refuse discrimination against people whose bodies and minds test our notions of human identity, trying to incorporate them into every level of society, France, in this difficult, provocative, and promising moment, is still a long way from creating what one would be right to expect from the country of the rights of man. [End Page 251] More fundamentally still, faced with the rather cynical pragmatism of some and the religious clashes of others, I am convinced that humanism—which has always been in search of itself, from its emergence in the past to its crises or revitalizations today and in times to come—can find a chance to revitalize itself in the battle for the dignity of the disabled by constructing what is still sorely lacking: respect for a vulnerability that cannot be shared. My ambition, my utopia, consists of believing that this vulnerability reflected in the disabled person forms us deeply, or, if you prefer, unconsciously, and that as a result, it can be shared. Could this humanism be the \"cultural revolution\" with which to construct the democracy of proximity that the postmodern age needs? The outsize nature of this ambition is actually built on ordinary, painful, everyday experiences. Here are three, among many others: John, Claire, and the Woman on Television People Say I'm Crazy was the title of a documentary shown on TV in the United States, which I saw during a recent visit. The film aims to show how a schizophrenic person can be \"cured\" and \"integrated\" into society. The hero, stuffed full of medications that make him \"obese\" (his complaint), might be saved by his sister, a filmmaker who comes up with the idea of filming poor John, who likes to draw and make woodcuts. Thanks to the film, his works are soon made public; he has an exhibition; he is showered with grants. The madman has become \"a disabled artist.\" He can leave the appalling shelter he shares with a few others of his kind, and even find a certain serenity, because social services now pays for a home worthy of being called one. Now he is cured. The only thing left to do is to award the film a prize, which happens shortly thereafter. From time to time, the artist protests against the camera that is trained on him and, to some extent, against those who are making his illness a work of art. But he ends up going along with it, and participates, so to speak, in the filming. Isn't the camera a third party that recognizes him, a bit of space between his ill-being and his family? John is not crazy enough to deprive himself of that. More than the charming, \"very American\" therapist who encourages him with her kind, \"social worker...",

A mechanical theory must recognize four salient features: (1) that any sound pervades the cochlea no matter whether the window flexibility is considered in theorizing or put down as negligible in theorizing or is actually (pathologically) impaired—just as any sound pervades any building with all its rooms and partititions, and that such a primitive function is almost certain to have at least a weak and otherwise limited stimulating effect; (2) that the main and more adequate (but not exclusive) stimulating effect in mammalian animals (having an elongated cochlea tube) is likely to result from displacements of the phragma due to pressure differences between the windows, which are unsymmetrical to the meatus; (3) that the bulge formed by the displaced phragma can not travel, but can only lengthen itself, as is demonstrated by inspection of the hydraulic model; (4) that the formation of a bulge on either side of the average location of the phragma is succeeded by the development of stress in the phragma, as is demonstrated by inspection of the hydraulic model.",

      "title": "The Social Meaning of Pets",
      "abstract": "When companion animal interact closely with people, the roles they play may be categorized in terms of three major functions. The projective function involves the extent to which pets may serve as a symbolic extension of the self. The sociability function involves the role of pets in facilitating human-to-human interaction. The surrogate function involves the extent to which interaction with pets may supplement human-to-human interaction, or serve as a substitute for it. A person publicly identified with a companion animal makes a symbolic statement of their personality and self-image. Whether or not this process is intentional, the presence of a pet and the way it is treated become factors which are taken into account in the assessment of the social self. Pets facilitate interaction by being social lubricants. They provide a neutral subject of conversation, and perform a variety of functions as social catalysts. Since interaction with companion animals can approximate human companionship, the presence of pets may serve to supplement the benefits usually derived from the roles of friend, parent, spouse, or child. Alternatively, pets may serve as surrogate antagonists. In the extreme, interaction with companion animals may not only supplement human companionship, but may actually replace it. These three major functions are discussed with examples. Implications are noted for future research on companion animals.",

      "title": "Architecture [Caring about Places]",
      "abstract": "Caring about Places: Architecture Architecture, the deliberately made physical structure of place, creates opportunities for people to position themselves in space, in time, and in the order of things. To choose one's position in space is one of the continuing ubiquitous pleasures in life, a pleasure that we seek instinctively throughout the day. To be next to something (someone), to be above or below, behind or in front, inside or outside, are existential conditions that give distinct qualities to our actions. T o look out over, to shelter within, to rest against, to stand up to and to face directly are actions we can imagine, actions with generic significance that we all understand. To be able to choose among such conditions is part of being able to be human. We should imbue our buildings and landscapes with occasions for choice. Functionalism and determinism, not modernism, prescribe specific limited actions in a building—for whatever good or evil purposes—and deny, thereby, the expressive potential of relationships between people and things. O f course we do more in a building, in life, than stand about. Architecture, properly done, enables us to reflect upon our position, to imagine our relationship to the building, not just to act it out, and to see the acts of others reflected in a building's form. Architecture has the capacity to nurture our attention, to bring things to mind, to strike associations, and to reward curiosity. Architecture gives us places to inhabit, to make a part of our lives. To take position is a figure of speech used more often w i t h ideas than with things. We take position on the issues of the day, align ourselves for or against the large scale forces and purposes of society. Architects and architecture do that, too. A n d we should do it deliberately. H o w our buildings provide choice for people, what attentions they nurture, w h o m they serve, and to w h o m they can belong, are cultural and political questions of consequence. The positions we take on those questions are embedded in the places we build and give rise to their form. We consider it necessary for architecture to bring attention to people and to place: to make places that are filled w i t h opportunities to choose, that are visibly related to human actions, that sustain detailed attention, that can belong to those w h o use them, and that are related always to the larger place of which they form a part.

      "abstract": "Culture is the whole system of ideas and feelings, actions, and works produced by humans in a social construct, which are made their own by learning. The word culture comes from the Sanskrit word buddhayah”, the plural form of buddhi which means mind or intellect (Koentjaraningrat, 2005). J.J. Honingmann in his book The World of Man (1959) distinguishes the existence of three cultural phenomena, namely ideas, activities, and artifacts. This is then confirmed by the opinion of Koentjaraningrat (2009) which states that there are three forms of culture, namely; (1) the form of culture as a complex of ideas, values, norms, rules and so on. (2) the form of culture as a complex of patterned activities and actions from humans in society. (3) the form of culture as objects created by humans. The first form is the ideal form of culture. It is abstract, cannot be touched or photographed, its location is in the head, or in other words, in the minds of the people in the community where the culture resides. The second form of culture is called a social system, regarding the patterned actions of humans themselves. This social system consists of human activities that interact, relate and associate with each other in every second, day and year, accordingly to certain patterns based on customary behavior. The third form of culture is called physical culture, taking the form of all physical products and activities, actions and works of all humans in society. They are most concrete in nature and are in the form of objects or things that can be made, seen, and photographed.",

Such signals could only be significant if past records are scanned and relevant experiences are selected for comparison with present experience. This is a subconscious process. But it may well be that this scanning of past experience and selection from it also renders the relevant past available for conscious consideration as well. Thus, the individual may refer to the record as he employs other circuits of the brain. Access to the record of the past seems to be as readily available from the temporal cortex of one side as from that of the other. Auditory illusions (or interpretations of the distance, loudness, or tempo of sounds) have been produced by stimulation of the temporal cortex of either side. The same is true of illusional emotions, such as fear and disgust. But, on the contrary, visual illusions (interpretations of the distance, dimension, erectness, and tempo of things seen) are only produced by stimulation of the temporal cortex on the nondominant (normally, right) side of the brain. Illusions of recognition, such as familiarity or strangeness, were also elicited only from the nondominant side, except in one case.",

Animal communication is not the only source of at least suggestive evidence that animals engage in some sort of thinking. On the basis of this sort of common observation of pets and other domestic animals, those concerned with language and thinking have tended to conclude that animal communication always relates to very pressing and immediate situations and stimuli. The communication conveys information about things that are remote in both time and space from the sensory stimuli reaching the communicating animals at the time the communication takes place. Virtually all ethological evidence concerning the information conveyed by animal communication signals is necessarily limited to observing their effects on other animals.",

      "abstract": "Human sensing abilities have been shaped and refined over long evolutionary periods. Hearing has adapted to serve us well in many different tasks and situations, helping us to orient ourselves and to survive in the world. The general properties of peripheral and central mechanisms of hearing are highly conserved across vertebrates due to very similar environmental conditions. Species specific variations do exist, such as the use of ultrasound for orientation in bats and cetaceans, but they are usually founded on quantitative and not qualitative differences to generally applicable principles of hearing and brain mechanisms. Basic hearing tasks for survival include detecting, localizing and identifying sound sources in cluttered or noisy environments. Another critical role of vertebrate hearing is the control and analysis of communication sounds which, in humans, lead to the highly developed ability of speech production and perception. Speech, like many other sounds involving resonance phenomena, contains harmonic elements, i.e. frequency components that are integer multiples of a common ‘fundamental’ frequency. These sounds can evoke a perceptual phenomenon, periodicity or virtual pitch that is distinct from other perceptual dimensions of sounds. A most human endeavour, the production and enjoyment of music, is fundamentally based on this perceptual phenomenon. Studies of the brain mechanisms that lead to this perception, its psychophysical manifestation and, eventually, cognitive and emotional benefits have progressed for more than a century, as is outlined in this volume, but still many aspects remain unresolved.",

      "abstract": "The rise of non‐representational theory in human geography has prompted searching questions about how researchers might ‘represent’ what they encounter in their fieldwork. A central problem is that we reach an insurmountable impasse, an aporia, because we cannot share thoughts, meanings, feelings, etc., in a manner faithful to our experience of them or equally that certain spectacular or horrific events and encounters escape their retelling. We argue that this impossibility should not become a warrant for withdrawing from the world, and instead propose that close descriptions can still be offered of particular encounters, attending in the process to the situated, embodied sense‐making work being (unavoidably) undertaken by the peoples involved that makes those encounters what they are. Such work may be threatened by scepticism, because it assumes the possibility of representation being at least partially successful, here and now, and relies on the ‘just‐thisness’ of things. Scholars of social life can, scepticism contained, learn much from taking seriously how any encounter unfolds without transcendental or structural guarantee in the immediacy of the life‐worlds where it is made and re‐made.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Awareness of the self and awareness of others are difficult faculties to define. Part of the problem lies in the wide range of abilities that involve various aspects of awareness. Some of the most commonly studied abilities focus on the self-awareness of the individual. These abilities range from the capacity to distinguish self from non-self to the competency to reflect on one's past, present or future condition. Another set of abilities that is relevant to the study of awareness involves the interactions of individuals, and includes behaviours such as deception and empathy. We explore the possibility that species other than humans engage in deception and empathy, and consider the implications of such behaviours for self-awareness and other-awareness in these species. Although examples from a variety of species are provided, many examples come from dolphins and whales. This reflects both the authors’ interest in these animals and the possibility that large-brained creatures are more likely to engage in deliberate deception and/or true empathy.",

These matters are distinct and must be distinguished. Then conditions must be stated under which one can validly speak of and measure the appropriate flow. In this paper it is shown that within the field of Notification (mention and delivery of recorded messages to users) there are twenty basic activities formed by choosing triads from the six variables, Message, Code, Channel, Source, Destination, and Designation. “Flow” has meaning only when two such triads have two variables in common, forming a tetrad. Then flow or correspondence between any pair of variables is inextricable from a conjugate flow or correspondence between the other pair. Between any pair of endpoints there are six possible distinct types of flow, according to which two of the remaining four variables are directly used to achieve the flow.",

      "title": "Topography of Representation",
      "abstract": "Representation carries a promise of a performative act. As Mark Taylor observes, in contrast to the so-called constative utterances which describe facts, a promise realizes ‘a state of affairs that did not exist prior to the language event’ or, as is the case here, prior to the events unfolding in a theatrical or any other space. Such an act signifies that the ‘I’ or ‘we’ making a promise understands or knows the problem or the text, plays the part of the agent authorized by a convention or its systems to execute a promise, and the act requires that representation assumes the function of reality maker that produces the real by simulating verisimilitude. For this process to be complete, the mode of operation needs to be clearly delineated by cultural or social practices and institutional structures that safeguard the promise, its execution, and its use. Even though the general tenets are still dominant in everyday practice, the concept of representation has been championed and problematized ever since the fragmentation and the split within the subject became evident in the twentieth century. The ‘I’ and ‘we’ ceased to be valued as universally defined nouns. As a corollary, the promise of representation was no longer able to express the subject's desire to impose linear transfer and ideological order upon both human beings and the objects of their creation (theatre and drama). Once the subject was undone, the order of representation disseminated into pieces scattered throughout space. It became dispersed in contradictory meanings, which now could be assigned to objects that had been kept outside of its boundaries.",

A clinical examination has to take into account the different dimensions of space, which is acted, organized, inhabited, experienced, represented and imagined. A clinical examination also consists in different stages: the person who is talking about his spatial organisation is looked at, listened to and his spatial representations are studied. Failures in the spatial organisation have consequences on the treatment course, and especially on the way the therapeutic environment can be experienced and accepted. Adjustments could be foreseen according to the clinical diagnostical study. The environment is the trustee of archaic glischocaric anguishes, but the patient keeps his own representation of his environment.

      "title": "Case Studies in Interdisciplinary Research",
      "abstract": "Humans are capable of understanding an incredible variety of actions performed by other humans. Even though these range from primary biological actions like eating and fleeing, to acts in parliament or in poetry, humans generally can make sense of each other’s actions. Understanding other people’s action, called can transcend differences in race, gender, culture, age, and social and historical circumstances. Action understanding is the cognitive capability of making sense of another person’s action by integrating perceptual information about the behavior with knowledge about the immediate and socio-cultural contexts of the action and with one’s own experience. Since it is necessary to integrate multiple sources of information, it is not surprising that failures to understand a person’s behavior are also common. Well known is the case of an autistic professor who compares herself to an anthropologist from Mars. Incapable of spontaneously understanding why someone cries, she has learned rules that help her to infer that people who rub their eyes while tears are running down their cheeks are weeping and probably feel unhappy (Sacks, 1995). By contrast, normal individuals automatically allow stereotypes, prejudices, self-interests and the like to influence their understanding a person’s behavior (Bargh & Chartrand, 1999). More generally still, humans can easily misunderstand unfamiliar symbolic actions or rituals if they rely too much on their own socio-cultural expertise (Gadamer, 2004). Given the importance of action understanding in every domain of human life and society, and in light of the complexities that surround it, a comprehensive scientific understanding of this capacity is needed. Apart from satisfying intellectual curiosity, such insight would serve to improve our action understanding and mitigate several forms of misunderstanding. Indeed, in studying action understanding, we as scientists are engaged in the very process that is central to our concerns (Gergen & Semin, 1990, p. 1). Scholars are increasingly dissatisfied with mono-disciplinary approaches to understanding human action. Such one-sidedness can rest upon various motives. For example, hermeneutic interpretations of action understanding tend to emphasize historical and cultural influences while overlooking that ultimately such influences depend upon individual cognitive processes.1 This has led to a critique of the assumption that humans are born as a blank slate and that culture is solely responsible for all cognitive contents. However, such critique easily slides into an overemphasis on the biology of human nature and a denial of socio-cultural influences on cognition (Pinker, 2003). Fortunately, recent interdisciplinary endeavors have shown that an interdisciplinary approach is preferable when investigating complex functions like action understanding. Such research often involves developing a new interdiscipline such as cultural psychology (Bruner, 1990) or combining insights from the social sciences and psychology (Shore, 1996; Sperber, 1996). Evidence shows that throughout human evolution there have been mutual influences between biological and cognitive processes that shape human capacities and socio-cultural influences on those processes (Bogdan, 2003; Donald, 1991; Tomasello, 1999). In addition to these interdisciplinary investigations, computational sciences and artificial intelligence research are developing computer models of human understanding that allow new types of experiments and simulations (Churchland, 1995). Such insights underscore the necessity and fruitfulness of disciplinary boundary crossing and require that various disciplinary methods, concepts and theories be combined in innovative ways.",

Life longing refers to an idealized expression of life that contrasts with current life realities. Both are accompanied by negative emotions and were found to negatively relate to individuals' concurrent well‐being, especially when uncontrollable. At the same time, they are assumed to serve important self‐regulatory functions: a goal‐ and behavior‐corrective function in the case of life regret, and a directive and compensatory function in the case of Sehnsucht .

      "abstract": "This working paper seeks to explain the influence of the inner man on human behavior in general and the Christian believer in particular . Because there is a complete conviction among some that the inner man (unseen) is responsible for sin -as in the case of righteousness- and it may also stem from it, since the fall into Original sin until today. If it is not directly by: heart, soul, spirit, mind with free will, then it will be through responsibility or tacit participation (by lack of prohibition or taming) for sinful behavior that may come from outside through the flesh and its senses (sight, hearing, etc.), because: The good man out of the good treasure of his heart brings forth good things, and an evil man out of the evil treasure brings forth evil things (Matt. 12:35). And this is done through the behavior of human satisfaction of needs (physical and spiritual), because the flesh lusts against the spirit, (Galatians 5:17). With taking into account all factors of the surrounding external environment -economic, social and cultural environment, etc- which is difficult to control. In confronting the believer's faith and religious convictions that affect his behavior. The study also assumes that satisfying the human needs of the believer -originally- is spiritual satisfaction and not physical, for it is written: But you are not in the flesh but in the spirit, if indeed the Spirit of God dwells in you (Romans 8:9). But this also does not prevent from being the opposite to be the correct . not only because what is born of the flesh is a flesh -John 3: 6- but also because of the negligence and weakness of the spirit and his distance from God (and all inner man). This study is complementary and explanatory to previous studies by the researcher in the same field, which also means that this study does not agree with Abraham Maslow's hierarchy of needs (1943).Although spiritual human satisfaction is difficult to deal with quantitatively -because who can be filled and satisfied from God's love and mercy- the study assumes metaphorically to simplify the explanation: that the sum of the physical and spiritual needs of a person is (100%). (50%) for the flesh, (50%) for the spirit. And that the competition between them to achieve the maximum satisfaction (material or spiritual) -according to the nature of the formation of each one- will be at the expense of the other. But this level of equilibrium (50, 50) is rejected in the Holy Book (Deuteronomy 30: 19; Gal 5: 17; Revel 3: 15). So let us assume that the human spirit has reached a saturation level (90% spiritual satisfaction). And let us also borrow from the science of physics : “ The law of communicating vessels” to use it in: Analyzing human behavior of satisfaction. Therefore, according to this law : Thelevel (90 %) of spiritual satisfaction means that the spirit will lead the whole person (as one unit) -the whole flesh (and the senses, feelings) and the whole inner man (the heart, mind, etc.)- to be under his Control. At the same level -(90 %) approximately. The opposite is also correct. That is, when physical satisfaction reaches ( 90 %), the spirit and the whole inner man will weake and slip into materialistic and mundane -approximately- with the same rate (90 %). As so on, with all cases of human satisfaction -be it 70% or 60%- (spiritual or physical), which we will study to clarify and explain the subject of the study.",

      "title": "Time-Specific Life Tables Contrasted with Observed Survivorship",
      "abstract": "In obtaining life tables for any group of individuals, biological or physical, there are two basically different types of observation which are commonly used. One of these consists in the classification of individuals at a fixed time into separate age groups and then in the recording of deaths for all the various ages simultaneously. The life table derived from this evidence is a time-specific or static life table because the deaths for all the ages are recorded at the same time. The second type of observations consists in following a group of individuals born at approximately the same time, from birth to the death of the longest-lived member of the group. In this case the survivorship curve is determined by direct observation. It has been called a generation or cohort or fluent life table [1]. The life tables resulting from these two different types of evidence on longevity will, except under unusual circumstances, be different in form, and in any case will be quite different in meaning. To consider an example of the two life tables, suppose we wish to study the present day survival of Ford automobiles. We may ask two different questions: what is the longevity of Fords at the current rates of survival, or what is the survival of the current model of Ford? That is, in one case we ask about current rates of cars existing at the present time and in the other about the present model and its future rates. To answer the first question we might get the date of manufacture (that is the age) of all the Fords registered on January 1, 1947, and during the following year get, by date of manufacture, the number of these cars irrevocably eliminated from service, that is, the deaths. Death in this case would be due to accidents, old age, or perhaps disease and malformations. From the age-specific death rates we could construct a survivorship curve for Fords for the year 1947. It would give us the way in which a group of Fords would survive if the 1947 rates pertained throughout their careers. The other life table could be obtained by following the 1947 models throughout their future existence to determine the number finally retired from service up to successive dates. This would give us the survivorship curve for the 1947 models, by direct subtraction. These two survivorship curves * Paper No. 233 from the Department of Biostatistics, School of Hygiene and Public Health, The Johns Hopkins University.",

      "abstract": "Modern practical psychology is rather a many-colored and, at the same time, a sad picture. A great number of empirical data (which very often tell about something they do not know), handmade, everyday in their essence theoretical schemes, which usually describe only one thing – peculiarities for mental process of their authors and somewhere quite apart – the fundamental philosophic methodological provisions about being and awareness, activity, essence and phenomenon, etc. The important motive of our higher attention to methodological bases for genesis of psychics is the desire to get moving a number of problems in psychological practice. The absence of efficient theoretical basis causes, for example, to the situation when such necessary and important work in the sphere of child developmental psychology is just absent or is based only on everyday notions of general psychologist. Our data also tell that the integrity in ontogenesis of psychics should be considered in another plane – as integrity of human life journey since birth until death. Hereby we should not abstract from anatomic morphological structures (dispositions), about which our psychology shyly kept silence for many years. So, the specificity of ontogenetic human development is that it is subject to effect of biological laws (as development of animals) and effect of social historical laws. Thus, the object of genetic psychology is personality, spiritual physical individual, born by its own subject-based practical activity, which later is transformed into its own activity in some aspects.",

      "title": "Future Effect on Fatigue Damage",
      "abstract": "The term“Fatigue Damage”is very ambiguous and has been used as different meanings. In some cases, fatigue damage is represented by the degree of changes in physical or mechanical properties of materials due to stress reversals, such as changes of shock resistance, damping cofficient, and others. But the author believe teat these changes do not represent the true fatigue damage, because they do not always mean the decrease of fatigue life of materials. On the contrary, in some cases, they mean even the incresse of it. In such cases, these changes are training rather than damage.In some cases, fatigue damage has been represented with the decrease of the endurance limit of materials. But the author cannot agree with this representation, because it seems to contain the following unreasonableness. The term “Fatigue Damage” is used when we consider the fatigue life of materials at the stress levels over the endurance limit. If we attempt to keep working stresses always less than endurance limit, the conception of fatigue damage is needless, because fatigue failure does not occure at the stress levels below endurance limit. Fatigue damage is the matter concerning with fatigue life and not with endurance limit. So fatigue damage should not be represented with the decrease of endurance limit.Then the author believe that it is most reasonable to represent fatigue damage as the rate of diminution of fatigue life in future. This representation has been already adopted by many researchers. (Refer to the Notes (2), (3) at the end of the paper.) If we adopt the representation, fatigue damage cannot be decided only by the stress history in past, but must be influenced by the stress which will be applied in future. It is self-evident that the life in future depends on the stress in future. This is the so-called future effect on fatigue damage.In this paper the future effect on fatigue damage was obtained by experiments in some cases.",

      "title": "Shakespearean Revivifications: Early Modern Undead",
      "abstract": "IN THE MEDIGAL TREATISE A Briefe Discourse of a disease called Suffocation of Mother (1603), Edward Jorden is particularly descriptive about distinctive symptomology and uncanny appearance of undead women, conscientiously inscribing his report within classical tradition of medicine. While recent scholarship has found Jorden's work increasingly noteworthy for exploring facets of minefield that is early modern medical praxis, (1) it is yet necessary to quote 1603 text at some length so that full extent of interest in this peculiar subject of female undead may be more readily apparent: in that Symptom which is called Syncope or swounding, very image of death, where pulse is scarcely or not at all perceyved; breath or respiration cleane gone [...] lying like a dead corpse three or foure houres togither, and sometimes two or three whole dayes without sense, motion, breath, [external] heate, or any signe of life at all (like as wee see Snakes and other creatures to lie all winter, as if they were dead, under earth) insomuch as diverse errors have beene committed in laying foorth such for dead, which have afterwards been found to have life in them, and have risen up in their burials, whereupon there have beene laws enacted, as Mercurialis reporteth, that no woman which was subject to this disease should be buried until she had beene three dayes dead.... Plinie maketh mention out of Heraclides, of a woman who for seven dayes together lay for dead in a fit of and was restored againe to life: which (saieth Marcellus Donatus) is not to be thought a fabulous tale, seeing it is not repugnant to rules of Philosophie and Physicke. And Galen making mention of verie same hystorie under name Apnaea, discourseth of reasons of it.... Many more examples to this end could I produce out of Authenti call writers, and late experiences.., but these may suffice to shew how wonderfully vitall facultie is overthrowne in this disease. (2) Women suffering from uterine disease known as suffocation or strangulation of (or fits of the mother, and all of other variants), have a special place in early modern medical and literary history and, moreover, in imagination. These women present most spectacular of all symptoms available to category of hysterical, with their rigid limbs' paroxysmal contractions, falling into syncopic fits, refrigerated frigidity of temperature, moribund appearance, and breathing so barely perceptible that it takes a practiced doctor indeed to discern truly dead woman from those merely suffocated and capable of reviving. Simply put, female revivification cases center on female hysterics whose uterine maladies--usually displaced wombs--create symptoms that cause others to believe they are dead. It is a commonplace of criticism to state that early modern medicine believed in a womb that wanders unmoored around female body and is responsible for choking sensation described as predominant symptom of the mother, but few have taken trouble to define mechanistic models for illnesses of womb that existed in Renaissance as set apart from much later psychoanalytic definitions of hysteria--the term hysteria is not even available to English until 1801, though hysterical is. (3) Even fewer note disjunctiveness of literary analyses that make a gesture to historicity by first citing antique theories of wandering wombs to preface discussions of Shakespeare's or Middleton's works and then discuss hysteric in psychoanalytic terms, a connective logic properly outside Renaissance-specific modes of representation or etiological models. If we pay attention to early modern period's different set of representational strategies for depicting a category of illness properly identified broadly as hysterical, a new set of accompanying literary representations comes to light that looks quite different from what we would normally expect from a hysteric: not a psychosomatic disorder but a malady caused by a displaced and freely wandering uterus wreaking havoc upon a woman's body wherever it presses upon other organs or blocks critical passages. …",

      "abstract": "David Hume, like Locke, is very sceptical about the nature of substance, whether material or immaterial. And he goes much further than Locke's agnosticism, saying that both sorts of substance are inconceivable. He thinks we cannot get beyond our impressions (roughly, our sensations) to know anything whatever about their causes. For all we know, our impressions could be caused by any of the following: material objects (whether similar to our impressions or wholly unlike them); God (as Berkeley might say); our own minds (either dreaming or hallucinating), that is, nothing at all external; an arch deceiver; any other as-yet-un-imagined cause. But knowledge of these causes is in principle impossible for us: like Berkeley, Hume holds that we only ever know or have experience of mental items. We thus have no standing to hypothesize, let alone any grounds for inferring, the existence of anything that is, as Hume says, “specifically different” (of a different species or kind) from impressions and ideas: the two sorts of mental items that are the only ones he recognizes and which he refers to in general as “perceptions” (T I.ii. vi, 67–8).",

      "abstract": "A positive effect of differentiation of natural conditions on intensity of manifestations of human activities in the light of currently prevailing views seems to be indisputable (see, for example, Goclowski 1986).However, this regularity is not always confirmed in the particular cases.Regardless of the possibility of occurrence of various disturbances caused by other, including supernatural factors, a lack of positive correlation between the two phenomena may result from some mechanisms in the Nature itself which have not been identified so far and which operate contrary to the above-mentioned regularities.One of them is the problem of the occurrence of limitations in differentiation of natural conditions advantageous to man, which has been barely outlined in literature.In other words, along with the growing diversity of Nature, there increases a probability of appearance of limitations (also natural but unknown exactly) of human activity which gradually reduce a positive influence of differentiation on social development, sometimes leading to predominance of an adverse tendency, that is the \"effect of repelling\" of man by various natural conditions.This hypothesis implies that there may be a clearly defined (limited) level of differentiation of the Nature which is optimal for human activity in the particular conditions.This level does not have to (though it may) be identical with the maximum differentiation.But how to find out such a \"level of optimum of differentiation\" if it would have to be changeable in time and space by assumption, i.a.dependent on cultural context?It seems that no clear answer can be found at present.Yet we can try to verify this hypothesis using the models of mechanisms that are active in the Nature and have already been verified by other research disciplines.This may be the direction suggested by E. Kantowicz (1981) of using an ecological concept of \"limiting factors\" originating from Liebig's \"law of the minimum\".It holds that the life of organisms is determined by one of those indispensable environmental factors which is currently \"most scarce\" (that is the \"limiting factor\").",

The anthropological evidence suggests that there are three patterns of hallucinations: experiences in which hallucinations are rare, brief, and not distressing; hallucinations that are frequent, extended, and distressing; and hallucinations that are frequent but not distressing. The ethnographic evidence also suggests that hallucinations are shaped by learning in at least two ways. People acquire specific representations about mind from their local social world, and people (particularly in spiritual pursuits) are encouraged to train their minds (or focus their attention) in specific ways. These two kinds of learning can affect even perception, this most basic domain of mental experience. This learning-centered approach may eventually have something to teach us about the pathways and trajectories of psychotic illness.",

      "abstract": "The article defines an event as a unit of recognition of rejected life alternatives. Criteria have been established that reflect the individual’s awareness of a certain range of events. The life alternative is considered as one that acts as a phenomenon of personal development and is defined in the context of the formation of personal maturity and subjectivity. It has been suggested that the life alternative may have a structure that is represented by events and series of events and recognition. The event, being conscious, becomes identical with the life alternative, and if it deviates, it implies the rejection of the individual of one or another significant event. The obligatory condition for the realization or rejection (which involves the implementation of certain life choices) of a life alternative and its realization in a particular event, forms a choice. Since choice is also an event that is materialized and presented in time, it must be conscious.The article establishes the significance of the text as such, which makes it possible to define not only the event as a whole, but also the internal event as an episode, which is defined by the person and is brought into narrative form. Cognitive reflection and the formed metaphorization of the rejected life alternative are considered as indicators of the attitude to it. The main method of analysis is interpretation.The significance and role of emotions in the perception of events are considered. The&nbsp;content of the subjective narrative as a metaphorical representation of a rejected life alternative is analyzed.",

      "title": "Consciousness Travels in Waves — The Conwave Model",
      "abstract": "There are three common approaches to resolving Chalmers' hard problem of consciousness in the academic literature, especially within scientific circles: Consciousness as an emergent property of complex or complicated neuronal computation in the brain; consciousness viewed as spiritual trait or quality of the Universe, which is distinct from purely physical actions; and consciousness composed of discrete 'proto-conscious' events occurring in a manner which obey physical laws of nature that are not yet understood fully. However, for one reason or the other, all three positions are problematic and are not able to address the hard and binding problems of consciousness. The Conwave Model, part of the author's larger The TEMIC Framework of Reality (TemFrame), resolves the hard and binding problematic issues in these positions by positing that consciousness is a fundamental, intrinsic, and primordial property of the Universe that transmits information (self-awareness, awareness of the surroundings, experience) and energy traveling in waves called conwaves (consciousness waves) from the absolute vacuum to any matter serving as a host to consciousness. Nervous systems (such as brains in animals) in relatively highly evolved organisms such as animals, information processing and/or signal transmission system in plants, micro-organisms, and other organisms are aspects or organs of consciousness in these living organisms (complex systems). Importantly, the Emergent Model of Inner-Outer Universe Cosmogeny (TEMIC) in TemFrame proposes that Big Bangs can also be regarded as expansions or explosions of fundamental consciousness in the absolute vacuum giving rise to individual consciousnesses in stars, planets, organisms, and others in the Universe, and fundamental consciousness, being one of the key forces of nature, is driving the accelerated expansions of the Universe.",

      "title": "How might veterinarians do more for animal welfare? Comment les vétérinaires peuvent-ils faire plus pour améliorer le bien-être des animaux?",
      "abstract": "This point reflects today’s holistic understanding of welfare as the state of the animal’s mind and body and the extent to which its nature is satisfied (3). If veterinarians are to do more for animal welfare, it is not enough for them to identify that herd productivity is down, that an animal is sick, or that the environment predisposes animals to illness. Even when an animal is healthy and the environment meets its physical needs, the environment should also promote mental welfare and enable the animal to satisfy its nature. For example, a horse may have a clean, spacious stall, but lack social contact; a hospitalized cat may have a clean cage, but have inadequate separation between its food and its litter-tray and have nowhere to hide (4). Veterinarians also need to be aware that clinical signs associated with compromised physical welfare may be associated with reduced mental and natural aspects of welfare. For example, dairy cows in tie-stalls may develop muscle cramps by the end of the winter due to lack of exercise. The same lack of exercise also frustrates expression of the bovine nature of moving about to graze and interact. Thus, an exercise yard is desirable to promote all 3 aspects of welfare, not only health. These examples of a more inclusive approach to veterinary assessment indicate how veterinarians might do more for animal welfare in the course of their clinical work.",

      "title": "Introduction: Studying Narrative, Studying Emotion",
      "abstract": "When empirical researchers in the social sciences consider the nature of emotions and emotion concepts, they most often conduct anthropological interviews, send out surveys, analyze linguistic idioms, test stimulus response times, and so on. They may move toward medical and biological study as well, giving injections to test subjects, engaging in neuroimaging, and the like in order to gather as much relevant data as possible. But, with only a few exceptions, they almost entirely ignore a vast body of existing data that bears directly on feelings and ideas about feelings – literature, especially literary narrative. Stories in every culture both depict and inspire emotion. Indeed, the fact that some stories are highly esteemed in any given culture suggests that those stories are particularly effective at both tasks – representing the causes and effects of emotion as understood or imagined in that society and giving rise to related emotions in readers. Of course, one cannot assume that depictions of emotion accurately represent those emotions. This is the common, and quite reasonable, objection to treating literature as empirical data. However, we have very good reason to assume that widely admired depictions of emotions tell us something important about the way people in a given society think about emotions. In other words, we have a body of commonly enjoyed, elaborate, narrative portrayals of emotion scenarios. At the very least, these would seem to tell us far more about common emotion ideas than some verbal definition of an emotion term.",

      "title": "Discovery",
      "abstract": "We begin with some questions. What constitutes a scientific discovery? How do we tell when a discovery has been made and whom to credit? Is making a discovery (always) the same as solving a problem? Is it an individual psychological event (an ahal experience), or something more articulated such as a logical argument or a mathematical derivation? May discovery require a long, intricate social process? Could it be an experimental demonstration? How do we tell exactly what has been discovered, given that old discoveries are often recharacterized in very different ways by succeeding generations? What kinds of items can be discovered, and how? Is the discovery of a theory accomplished in much the same way as the discovery of a new comet, or is \"discovery\" an inhomogeneous domain of items or activities calling for quite diverse accounts? Must a discovery be both new and true? How is discovery related to (other?) forms of innovation, such as invention and social construction? Can there be a logic or method of discovery? Just one? Many? What could such a procedure be? How is it possible that an (a priori?) logic or method available now has so much future knowledge already packed into it? How could a logic of discovery itself be discovered? How general in scope must a method of discovery be? Must it apply to all sciences, independently of the subject matter (as we might expect of a \"logic\"), or might it apply only to problems of a certain type or depend on substantive scientific claims? How, if at all, is their discovery related to the justification of scientific claims? Is the manner in which scientists make discoveries at all similar to the way in which they test them? Is this justificatory \"checkout\" procedure really part of the larger discovery process rather than distinct from it? Can discoveries be explained rationally, or do they always contain irrational or nonrational elements, such as inspiration or blind luck? Are historians, sociologists, and psychologists better equipped than philosophers to explain scientific creativity? Can a methodology of discovery help to explain the explosion of scientific and technological progress since 1600? If there is no logic of discovery, and if discovery is irrelevant to justification, then why include the subject of discovery in the domain of philosophy (epistemology or methodology of science) at all? What could philosophers have to say about it? Are there historical patterns of discovery, for example, that tell us something about the rationality, if not the logic (in the strict sense), of the growth of scientific knowledge?",

      "abstract": "The analogy of a moving flashlight enables us to integrate three concepts that are basic but not ordinarily seen as related to each other: William James's \"stream of thought,\" Kurt Lewin's \"lifespace,\" and Harry Stack Sullivan's \"selective inattention.\" Lewin's lifespace, conceived as the psychological field at a given moment, resembles the field of objects lit up by a moving flashlight at a given moment; it has a bright center consisting of what is at the focus of attention and a fainter periphery or penumbra consisting of what is in the field but with little or no salience. James's stream of thought resembles the continual changing of this field as attention shifts and new objects of thought pass through the periphery into the center or vice versa. Sullivan's selective inattention is motivated resistance to the change from periphery to center. War becomes more likely when there is selective inattention to the following: * the enormity of the nuclear danger and possible ideas about how to prevent it (Lifton's \"psychic numbing\"); * the enormous deficit, caused partly by spending on nuclear weapons; * the human side of an enemy; realistic empathy with an enemy's fear of the self or anger at the self; and * incipient guilt feelings, such as Soviet qualms about Afghanistan or American qualms about Nicaragua.",

      "title": "Body Movements Generation for Virtual Characters and Social Robots",
      "abstract": "It has long been accepted in traditional animation that a character's expressions must be captured throughout the whole body as well as the face (Thomas & Johnston, 1995). Existing artificial agents express themselves using facial expressions, vocal intonation, body movements, and postures. Body language has been a focus of interest in research on embodied agents (virtual humans and social robots). It can be separated into four different areas that should be considered when animating virtual characters as well as social robots. (1) Postures: postures are specific positions that the body takes during a time-frame. Postures are an important modality during social interaction and play an important role as they can signal liking and affiliation (Lakin et al., 2003). Moreover, it has been established that postures are an effective medium to express emotion for humans (De Silva & Bianchi-Berthouze, 2004). Thus, virtual humans and social robots should be endowed with the capability to display adequate body postures. (2) Movement or gestures: throughout most of our daily interactions, gestures are used along with speech for effective communication (Cassell, 2000). For a review of the types of gestures that occur during interactions the reader can refer to Cassell (2000). Movements are also important for expressing emotions. Indeed, it has been shown that many emotions are differentiated by characteristic body movements and that these are effective clues for judging the emotional state of other people in the absence of facial and vocal clues (Atkinson et al., 2004). Body movements include the movements themselves as well as the manner in which they are performed, i.e. speed of movements, dynamics, and curvature – something captured by the traditional animation principles (Thomas & Johnston, 1995; Beck, 2012). Moreover, it should be noted that body movements occur in interaction with other elements, such as speech, facial expressions, gaze, all of which needs to be synchronised. (3) Proxemics: it is the distance between individuals during a social interaction. It is also indicative of emotional state. For example, angry people have a tendency to reduce the distance during social interaction, although this reduction would also be evident between intimate people.",

      "abstract": "Balance disorders may result from an impairment of one of the sensorial modalities involved in the perception of the self-location in space: vestibular, proprioception and vision, a deficit of the neuronal multisensorial integration, a less effective motor or loco-motor system, the medication side effects or psychological interferences. The basic examination of a dizzy patient implies the assessment of these different aspects. The balance is not restricted to à set of reflexes. It is a distinctive expression of the sixth sense : the sense of orientation. For every moving being, to go around in circles is ineffective to find new sources of food or avoid a predator. So, the ability of self-orientation in space is a primitive, unconscious function, critical to stay alive and closely related to the limbic system. The experience of the mobility, that required the spatial memory, which evolved towards the episodic memory, could be considered as the foundation of our thought.Les troubles de l’équilibration trouvent leurs origines dans une défaillance des modalités sensorielles de la perception de soi dans l’espace : vestibulaire, somesthésique ou visuelle, d’un déficit de l’intégration neuronale de celles-ci, dans une perte d’efficacité du système moteur ou loco-moteur, ou en raison d’une interférence de facteurs médicamenteux ou psychiques. L’examen de base du patient instable cherchera à évaluer ces différents axes. L’équilibration n’est pas une combinaison de réflexes. Elle est un aspect particulier d’un sixième sens : le sens de l’orientation dans l’espace. Pour tout être mobile, tourner en rond est sans utilité pour trouver des ressources nutritives et échapper aux prédateurs. L’orientation dans l’espace est donc une fonction primitive, inconsciente et souvent vitale, ce qui explique sa relation étroite avec le système limbique de gestion des émotions. La mobilité a imposé le développement d’un sens de l’orientation puis une mémoire spatiale qui a évolué vers la mémoire épisodique, fondement de notre pensée.",

In the case of ‘magic’ the word does not stand for something; it does not represent a certain object, but rather presents a certain meaning. The meaning itself may be manifold. Magic can be performed, and it can have consequences – if you believe in it. Individuals may have certain superstitions, or they might wear lucky charms. When did you last throw a penny into a fountain? Even if one does not believe in magic or has never performed magical practices, certain incidents may still lack a rational explanation. When falling in love, for example, one might feel as if one is under someone’s ‘spell’. If we actually believed that a spell was laid upon an individual, the articulation of linguistic forms would be ‘endow[ed] … with the potency of real objects or actions’. But do we really ‘believe’ in magic? Is it not only something for the ‘primitive’ mind? In this article, it will be shown that the belief in magic has not (yet) disappeared, and that it may even be of protective value for an individual’s well-being.",

As a biological organism, the body has long been an object of scientific investigations, medical objectification, and scientific discourse. It is, however, much more. In this chapter, we discuss the symbolic, aesthetic, sexual and scientific nature of the body. The body holds significance for individuals in the way that it can be owned or disowned, the latter often associated with illness. Further, it is both self and other, object and subject—and, thus, holds a number of binary oppositions. Within this chapter we explore the links between the body and philosophy, such as bodily awareness and myness, highlighting pertinent considerations for both contemporary curriculum development and clinical practice. Within health, the default is to view the body through a scientific lens, as an object. Alternatively, we highlight the importance of the lived body (e.g., the foot hurts versus my foot hurts), the complexities between body as subject/object (e.g., in diagnosing another's body), and the problems with a scientific view (whiteness, gender bias).",

      "title": "Expansive Posture",
      "abstract": "Much can be gleaned about the affective, cognitive, and motivational states of others by attending to various channels of nonverbal communication. Although there are a variety of ways to organize the body of research on the psychological correlates of nonverbal behavior, researchers in social psychology and communication often distinguish between two dimensions: the hierarchical dimension (status/dominance/power) and the affiliative dimension (liking/romantic interest). Most nonverbal cues have implications for both of these dimensions, and postural expansion is not an exception. Postural expansion includes “enlarging” behaviors such as sitting more erectly, opening up the torso, and extending limbs away from the body. In contrast, postural constriction involves postures that ultimately make an organism appear smaller (such as slumping the shoulders, wrapping limbs around the body, or averting the gaze downward). Numerous researchers have noted the comparative similarity between postural expansion and constriction in humans and, respectively, dominance and submission displays in animals. For example, the bristling of a cat’s fur (piloerection) in response to threat serves to make the animal look larger and more threatening, while the exposure of a dog’s stomach in submission or appeasement serves to make the animal appear smaller, less threatening, or more vulnerable. Substantially more literature has investigated the association between postural expansion and the hierarchical dimension than the affiliative dimension, a bias that is duplicated here. Furthermore, it is important to note that the “hierarchical” literature addresses several related, but unique, questions: (1) How does postural expansion affect perceptions of others’ status/dominance/power? (2) Is postural expansion linked with actual differences in status/dominance/power or other relevant dependent measures? (3) Is postural expansion reliably linked with an important universal nonverbal expression?",

      "abstract": "Physician has to know the patient in the disease and not only the disease in the patient, from the dual perspective of the body as object and the body as subject. This also affects the patient who has to cope with the reality of having a body that bursts into the subject's consciousness as a vital threat, as source of discomfort and inability and being a body (Marcel). The human body in its dual aspect has been and is a great unknown, if not a great outrage in spite of the fact that we are our body and our body is each of us. We sometimes do not feel as we are and thus a confrontation arises, sometimes more normal, others more morbid. This forces the physician to face complex ethics considerations and the scientist to accept a personal identity disorder. Dualism considers that there are two substances in us, one that distinguishes us from other beings and from the rest of the individuals of the human species, the soul, the psychic life, mind or consciousness, and another more insubstancial one, the body. The aim of the first substance is to dominate the body, to survive it after death when it is, already a corpse is meant to become putrefied, is buried, incinerated or thrown to the depth of the sea. This dualism aims to explain the origin of the evil and the attitude to defeat it and it does so efficiently. This anthropology has very ancient roots (the Upvanishads, in the orphic texts, in Plato), it is the core of Gnostic thought and the foundation of the modern science since Descartes. Some monist perspectives are a masked dualism or a mereologic fallacy, according to which, the brain is conscious, when that what is conscious is the subject, although the subject, with the brain could not be conscious. Therefore, a new perspective is proposed, chiasmatic or janicular monism, that considers the adaptive value of focusing on the reality from two perspectives, as physical universe and the world of interpersonal relationships. In the agnosias and in the phantom limb there is a confrontation between the body object and the body subject that has made it possible to investigate how the perception of the own body is and how the brain generates the schema and the body image. The study of the body experience, from the phenomenology and the anthropological psychiatry perspective, has made it possible to go greater in-depth into the knowledge of the alterations of the experience of the own body in different mental diseases, especially in those in which a confrontation between the body and the personal identity arises makes it necessary to consider the process of individual identification and a category of personal identity disorders that would include body dysmorphic disorder, erythrophobia, anorexia nervosa, body integrity identity as well as the gender-type disorders (transsexualism, nonfetishistic transvestism, gender identity disorder during childhood). Key words: Dualism, Monism, Agnosia, Phantom limb, Cenesthesia, Body schema, Body image, Body experience, Personal identity disorders, Body dysmorphic disorder, Anorexia nervosa, Personal integrity identity disorder.",

Interpreters (astrobiologists) will then need to make connections between the expression (the biosignature) and the content (the living organism). The problem with biosignatures is semiotic and epistemological: how can meaning be discovered, deciphered, interpreted, or even invented, starting from material markers. One general epistemological problem of biosignatures is how to recognize the signatures as meaningful: individuate them as expressions that refer to content (i.e., life). A further problem is how to establish the connection between the expression and the content – the biosignature and the biological process that we call life – while ruling out, with a certain degree of certainty, explanations for the signatures that are not of biological nature. This chapter focuses on two major issues in astrobiology: (1) the differentiation of fossils from pseudofossils; and (2) the differentiation of biotic from abiotic processes.",

      "title": "The role of the companion animal veterinary surgeon in behavioural husbandry",
      "abstract": "An American Veterinary Medical Association mission statement regarding the human-animal bond reads, veterinary surgeon's role in the human-animal bond is to maximise the potential of this relationship between people and animals. To fulfil this aim and implicit obligations, as well as enhancing the welfare of both human and animal companion, it is impossible to ignore the emotional and behavioural aspects of this relationship in favour of purely physiological illness and disease. Rather than only addressing defects in the dog-human relationship which have already occurred – the client complains about destruction in the home, urinating indoors or being snappy towards the children for example – the onus is now on all veterinary surgeons to be rather more pro-active in their approach. It must be appreciated that a relationship does not exist merely between a particular pet and members of their family, but also between that animal and all the humans it may happen to come into contact with elsewhere, including those inhabiting veterinary surgeries. The dog which becomes progressively harder to handle in the surgery over time, although frequently labelled as 'difficult', 'aggressive' or simply 'vicious', is in reality simply one whose behavioural needs and emotional welfare have been inadvertently damaged in the process of maintaining physical health or attending to physical disease. On the other hand, a dog who is genuinely pleased to enter a veterinary surgery, and whose behaviour and emotions have been nurtured in the same way as its physical needs, is a tribute to the attending veterinary surgeon as well as its owner.\r\n\r\nAt present, lack of adequate and appropriate behavioural management is routinely compromising much of the treatment vets try to deliver to their patients, both medical and surgical. In the UK, the new Animal Welfare Act (2007) stipulates that all those in contact with an animal have a 'duty of care' towards it, which encompasses both physical and mental needs, health and well being. It is therefore a legal, if not also moral, obligation of veterinary surgeons in the UK to ensure that necessary, effective and humane behavioural management is in place, bearing in mind these requirements. It would however often seem that farm animals have the better deal in this regard. Management systems and environment are routinely considered to have a bearing on the cow, sheep or pig's physical health and the development of disease, and are therefore automatically included in the large animal veterinary surgeon's remit. Not so for the domestic dog, which may be skidding uncomfortably on a fashionable laminate floor, subjected to the impact of noise from a multitude of household gadgets, or contained and punished with electric shock, and yet its small animal veterinary surgeon be completely unaware of its plight. How can we truly say such animals are 'under our care' if this is the case?\r\n\r\nThis poster presentation will summarise some of the very simple means whereby not only appropriate behaviour, but also accompanying emotions, can be generated and maintained in dogs in all veterinary contexts. Using basic knowledge of learning theory and its practical application, the behavioural repertoire of a dog can be manipulated and cared for in such a way as to ensure emotional welfare and maximum success of medical and surgical veterinary interventions. Not only will such care have benefits within the context of the surgery, as a dog's need to become aggressive will be diminished, but veterinary surgeons and nurses will be presented as 'role models' to be emulated by their clients in all aspects of the animal's life. It will help prevent iatrogenic behavioural damage, allow 'best practice' in terms of clinical care, and result in much improved client loyalty and compliance. Above all, the field of behaviour must not be viewed as time-consuming and financially inefficient, only to be tackled on a 'case-by-case' basis. Instead, it must become second nature for any veterinary surgeon to consider both external behaviour and underlying emotions as part of his or her daily clinical repertoire and demonstrate routine care for them. This is the basis of 'behavioural husbandry'.",

The world of appearance emerges from a simple, absolute nothing: there is nothing behind or before the world. There are right away many things, a world: one thing implies others, since for one to be it must distinguish itself from another. Thus, if ‘to be’ means ‘to distinguish,’ Being begins with the parting of things that makes their connection possible. Thus the thing in itself is straightaway the undergoing of its own parting; being is a passion. The Imago, then, is not a picture or figure, but the arriving in presence, which imagination elicits or welcomes by advancing in response. Imagination, then, is not first of all open to an image, but to world. It opens itself to the Thing, to the possibility of something, to parting, and in so doing brings itself toward creation.",

      "title": "Experiencing the presence of the deceased: Symptoms, spirits, or ordinary life?",
      "abstract": "Experiences of presence are common in bereavement. The bereaved person may see the deceased, hear their familiar voice, or otherwise feel they are close at hand. But although common, they are experiences not without controversy. They have come under a variety of descriptions, from 'hallucinations', lacking in meaning and even essentially meaningless, to 'continuing relationships', of rich personal significance. The current thesis represents the first systematic investigation of the properties and meaning of experiences of presence. Narrative biographic interviews with bereaved informants were analysed using Ethnomethodology and Conversation Analysis. Analytical focus was on the ways in which participants made such experiences meaningful. As a novel approach, this thesis reports several new findings about these phenomena. Firstly, the experiences happened in a variety of bonds (including spouses, parents, grandparents, children, siblings and others), and in a variety of circumstances of the bereavement (including sudden and expected deaths). In all cases, they were described as richly meaningful experiences and as relying on several sources for this meaning. The personal histories of participants were of particular importance in making sense of experiences of presence. Within this context, the experience acquired sense as a continuation of some aspect of the relationship with the deceased. The experiences also had diverse functions, from soothing to destructive. Sometimes, the experiences helped the bereaved to resolve unfinished business with the deceased; at other times, the help was with a much more ordinary problem. On some occasions the experiences of presence caused the bereaved more problems; they simply pronounced the grief or continued a fraught relationship. Participants showed that they had many cultural resources available to them in making sense of their experiences but they did not use all of them. Many informants used some spiritual and psychological ideas to make sense of their experiences. The thesis concludes that many of the most popular theories for these experiences impoverish them by stripping them of their diversity and important aspects of their meaning. The thesis also makes recommendations for psychotherapy for those who have problems of living as a result of their experiences of presence. The study also has implications for psychological research as none of these findings could have been observed through the use of an experimental methodology.",

      "abstract": "When we say something is ‘complex,’ we may define its complexity in terms of 1) the number of its components, 2) the number of kinds of components, 3) the number of connections among components, 4) the number of kinds of connections, or 5) strata of such connections. This means that we can only define and treat complexity by decomposing the thing to its components. Contradictorily, however, the most evident characteristics of complex systems, such as society, are not usually simple sum of their components. When ‘social complexity’ of primates or other animals is discussed, its presupposed components are, in most cases, individuals. In this paper, I aim to introduce the current situation in primatology where ‘social complexity’ society is often reduced into sum of individual behaviors, and then I will raise a problem in relation to individuals and the society. By doing so, I would like to relativize the predominant standpoint that easily presumes ‘autonomous’ individuals in a society. In the predominant standpoint, infants are often measured as pre-social existence because they are usually attached to their mothers and do not often actively perform social behaviors such as grooming. Thus they are placed peripheral to the social network and are often said ‘dependent’ to their mothers. However, it is evident that even infants have various means to interact socially with other individuals. Their social interactions may be different from adult conspecifics to some extent, but they are not pre-social or incomplete beings. Although we are tempted to view society as a sum of autonomous individuals or their behaviors, society has its own autonomy. In addition to this, it is essential to understand society in the ‘historical’ current, in which individuals and their relationships are always embedded.",

We tend to value self-rule-i. e., the possession and exercise of the capacity or capacities that allow individuals to govern their lives. However, our sociality can call the possibility and value of such autonomy into question. The more we seem to be social animals, the less we seem to be capable of running our own lives. Empirical psychology has revealed surprising details about the extent to which our minds are subject to social influence. Such influence is sometimes taken as a threat to self-rule. The debate over the Extended Mind Hypothesis (EMH) might seem to exacerbate the social threat to selfrule. If minds are spread across individuals, perhaps it no longer makes sense to speak of individual selves who may or may not rule themselves. I argue that no general threat to self-rule stems from human sociality. Further, the adoption of EMH is consistent with extensive attribution of psychological states to individuals, thus vouchsafing individual selves and autonomy.",

      "abstract": "God is thought of as hidden in at least two ways. Firstly, God's reasons for permitting evil, particularly instances of horrendous evil, are often thought to be inscrutable or beyond our ken. Secondly, and perhaps more problematically, God's very existence and love or concern for us is often thought to be hidden from us (or, at least, from many of us on many occasions). But if we assume, as seems most plausible, that God's reasons for permitting evil will (in many, if not most, instances) be impossible for us to comprehend, would we not expect a loving God to at least make his existence or love sufficiently clear to us so that we would know that there is some good, albeit inscrutable, reason why we (or others) are permitted to suffer? In this paper I examine John Hick's influential response to this question, a response predicated on the notion of ‘epistemic distance’: God must remain epistemically distant and hence hidden from us so as to preserve our free will. Commentators of Hick's work, however, disagree as to whether the kind of free will that is thought to be made possible by epistemic distance is the freedom to believe that God exists, or the freedom to choose between good and evil, or the freedom to enter into a personal relationship with God. I argue that it is only the last of these three varieties of free will that Hick has in mind. But this kind of freedom, I go on to argue, does not necessitate an epistemically distant God, and so the problem of divine hiddenness remains unsolved.",

      "abstract": "“God has No Allergies”: Immanent Ethics and the Simulacra of the Immune System Adrian Mackenzie “[T]he science of life always accommodates a philosophy of life.”1 Conventional approaches to bioethics long for a purified set of principles in order to guide the application of scientific knowledges of the body — the life sciences — to individual “cases.” In the realm of bioethics, the possibility that these knowledges might themselves constitute entities such as the individual, or the possibility that the individual body might itself be something other than the more or less governable a-historical object of technoscientific action, awakens a kind of horror autotoxicus. Nor do the prevalent modes of ethical discourse react kindly to the possibility that the “living” body of an individual is also a self, an actor within a complicated set of narratives, codes and apparatuses whose various registers — medical, economic, racial, sexual, religious, and so on — intersect. In short, conventional bioethical discourses refuse to acknowledge that, as Emmanual Levinas has written, “the body is a permanent contestation of the prerogative attributed to consciousness of ‘giving meaning’ to each thing; it lives as this contestation.”2 Traditional bioethics disappoints us insofar as it overlooks the ways the body contests the prerogatives of consciousness, contests reason and self-identity. Instead of opening onto the possibility of divergent ethea, bioethics’ universalizing adjudicative principles legitimate the biomedical normalization of differences by trying to deal only with the moral rights of the rational self and by leaving the differing character of embodiment — a most profound aspect of the ethical habitat — aside. In its separation of scientific theory and “ethical” practice, and in its unwillingness to transit any borders into the epistemological territory of science, conventional bioethics misapprehends the active and ambivalent role of technoscientific intervention, an intervention which both produces these crucial differences in embodiment and participates in their effacement. Traditional bioethics allergically responds to the ethical issue — the maintenance of ethos, of embodied differences, of the character and habits of individual bodies. Bios: nomó “Now it is over life, throughout its unfolding, that power establishes its dominion.”3 Foucault’s well-known description of a shift during the last two centuries from sovereign to disciplinary power or “bio-power” implies a displacement in the substance of ethics.4 In diverse discourses and domains, it becomes increasingly obvious that the presumed exclusion of ethics from the theoretical-pragmatic complex of science itself, from the very concrete operations and forces of technoscientific discourses engaging living bodies, significantly limits the relevance and effectiveness of the traditional notion of ethics.5 As Donna Haraway describes it, “the power of biomedical language . . . for shaping the unequal experience of sickness and death for millions is a social fact deriving from on-going heterogeneous social processes.” 6 The morality-displacing power of biomedical discourse and practice does not confine itself to sickness and death, but branches out into the normalization of whole populations. At many different scales and under different aspects — birth, death, sexual relations, work, fitness, stress, leisure, and so on — life is targeted by the vectors of biomedical intervention. Again, Foucault makes this point succinctly when he writes of the emergence of bio-power: “For the first time in history, no doubt, biological existence was reflected in political existence; the fact of living was no longer an inaccessible substrate that only emerged from time to time; amid the randomness of death and its fatality; part of it passed into knowledge’s field of control and power’s sphere of intervention.”7 The propagation of bio-power — designating “what brought life and its mechanisms into the realm of explicit calculation and made knowledge-power an agent of transformation of human life”8 — powerfully challenges any responsive ethics to address the realm of physiology and to reframe the ethical substance to include the embodiment of biomedical materiality. In other words, so-called “physiological” or “biological” questions increasingly raise ethical issues in ways that cannot be disentangled from the historical conditions of life as a locus of power relations or, conversely, solved through an a-historical ethico-moral calculus. Under the auspices of bio-power, biological knowledge increasingly presents itself as the ground of self-realization and governance...",

(1) A mind and a body are two different entities and each is “had” by a man. A man is thus a composite being with two components, one “inner”, the other “outer”. You, for example, are a man and your mind is “inner” in the sense that you alone can reflectively experience yourself thinking, or feeling pain, or seeing colours (or at least that you alone can reflectively experience your own thoughts, feelings and visual experiences). I can in a sense observe you thinking, but only by observing you use your body in certain ways—e.g. to make certain sounds, write certain things, look at the pages of an open book and frown. My “experience” of you thinking (or of your thoughts) is thus not a reflective experience. Your body is “outer”, on the other hand, in the sense that you cannot experience it or its (non-relational) properties in any exclusive way. That is, in whatever sense you can be said to experience your body, someone else can equally be said to experience it.",

The immediate result of this is that animals neither speak nor laugh, but the mediated result is the many and significant ways in which human life is distinguished from that of the animal. For a different sort of motivation has now come about through the addition of abstract representations. Although the actions of humans follow with no less strict necessity than those of animals, because of the kind of motivation humans have, insofar as it consists of thoughts whichmake possible elective decisions (i.e. the conscious conflict of motives), purposeful, deliberate action, in accord with plans and maxims, in unison with others, etc. has replaced the mere impulse from present objects of intuition. But this has brought about everything that makes the life of humans so rich, so cultivated, and so terrible, that here in theWest, which has made them pale and white, and where the ancient, true, profound, original religions of their homeland could not follow, humans no longer recognize animals as their brothers, but believe them to be something fundamentally different from themselves; and to maintain this illusion, humans call animals beasts, assigning derogatory terms to all the vital functions which humans have in common with them, considering them to be without rights, as humans steel themselves against the identity of essence they share with the animals, an identity which still presses itself upon them.",

      "abstract": "Abstract For a fully developed economy, esteem must be something that people are able to supply in response to the demands of others, not just to demand themselves; there must be a possibility of exchanging esteem, whether for reciprocal esteem or for other benefits. As with demand, there may seem to be a problem in maintaining that it is possible for people to supply esteem in this way. After all, I cannot make a gift of my esteem, nor can I offer it in a trade with another person, nor can I pass on the esteem I receive from others. But while esteem itself may not be alienable in these ways, certain ‘esteem-services’ are: I can voluntarily offer you my attention, my testimony, and my company, and do so in a way that promises to increase your positive esteem. And I can do this without self-defeat so far as I can hide my motives or, more plausibly, can do so in a virtually but not actually strategic way: I give my attention, testimony or association quite spontaneously but will be led to think again if it fails to secure suitable reciprocation.",

      "title": "Early Expatriates: Displacement and Exile in Archaic Poetry ()",
      "abstract": "The English term ‘exile’ and the romance languages’ ‘exil’, ‘esilio’, etc., all derive from the Latin word exilium. This Latin term, however, does not share the assumption of these modern terms that the individual who moves out of a community (the exul) does so involuntarily, and that in more cases than not this departure is required or sanctioned by the community’s authorities or legal system. Ancient Greek terminology also observes different boundaries. The verb φεύγω, ‘I go into exile’, also has the meaning ‘I flee’ and ‘I run away from’, and in both senses the group or individual who φεύγει may do so voluntarily or unwillingly, and the thing or person which prompts evasive or fugitive action need have no legal or authoritative backing. Hence, the ancient Greek discourse on exile cannot be considered in isolation from the similar discourses on other forms of displacement such as fleeing, migrating and engaging (less than willingly) in travel.1",

      "title": "Synchronization and Self-Organization in Organizations. The Combinatory System© View.",
      "abstract": "In any organization people may be observed from two different points of view: first of all as organs (or components of organs), in the sense that organizational relationships assign them a precise spatial and temporal placement, they carry out a specialized function in relation to the entire structure, they have a specific functionality that delimits the admissible interactions with the other elements, and they show a particular functioning; secondly , as members of a social collectivity in which, independently of their organizational role and connections, they appear as similar agents , moved by private objectives, capable of producing micro decisions, behaviours and effects relatively analogous to that of the others. My study considers the second aspect of human behaviour in organizations and aims to present a simple theory - the Theory of Combinatory Systems - which may allow us to describe, explain, and to a certain extent control many relevant and intriguing collective phenomena and their observable effects, which are produced by agents acting as unorganized social systems, even if they are also members of an organizational structure. In plain words I define as a combinatory system any collectivity (composed of individuals or organizations) whose agents, consciously or unconsciously, act (exclusively or prevalently) on the basis of global information which they direcly produce and update as the consequence of their micro behaviours. On the one hand, the global information is - or derives from – a synthetic variable whose values are produced by the combination of the micro states of the agents (hence the name Combinatory System ) but, on the other, these values affect the subsequent states as a result of a micro-macro feedback , acting over a period of time, that produces self-organization in the agents’ micro behaviours. If we accept the traditional definition of self-organization as the macro behaviour of a collectivity of agents in which the micro behaviours appear to be “directed”, or “organized”, by an Invisible Hand , or Supreme Authority , in order to produce the emerging phenomenon represented by the formation of ordered structures, of recognizable patterns, then it is easy to recognize that the macro phenomena produced by the macro behaviour of the system become factors in self-organization, since they are interpreted by the agents as information they can base their decisions on. In other words, the invisible hand is nothing other than the synergetic effect of the micro-macro feedback action (or circular causality ) that generates and updates the global information that produces self-organization and emerging macro behaviours attributable to the collectivity.",

      "abstract": "Psychoanalytical situation is mainly speech relation, a speech event. Speech communication cannot be reduced to semantic domain. To speak is not solely to say. Speech can have concrete effects. In psychoanalytical situation, as in any speech relation, listener is exposed to both prosodic effects and effects of words. At primitive mental organizations, inability of semiotization of inner states leads to specific intrusion of prosodic elements in subject's speech. These acoustic elements, which can be in function of evocation of rudimentary metalized, unnamed, non-semiotized inner states, can, potentionaly, have effect on recipient. In interpretation, whether working with patients with primitive mental organizations or with neurotics, it is necessary to have in view these performative effects of speech. Discourse characteristic for transfer situation can be shaped in such a way to produce desire and hide persistent lack in being. The discourse?s meaning than does not lie primarily in speech as in excess of saying, in pereformative effects of words. It should be kept in mind that the meaning of patients speech never unfolds fully for the analyst, that it slips through, fiddles away... When patient's speech resists interpretation, analyst?s desire for knowledge can interfere in analytical process thus leading to its impasse. Successful outcome of analysis should lead to de-idealization of analyst as subject who is supposed to know.",

      "title": "Do we have to redefine lameness in the era of quantitative gait analysis?",
      "abstract": "For ages, horses have been divided with respect to the functional status of their locomotor system in those classified as sound and those considered lame. This dichotomy has been and still is used by both the users of horses, irrespective of discipline, and veterinarians and there is a general perception common to both categories that lame horses should be considered unfit to perform, which implies that their continued use raises a welfare issue. Whereas seemingly very useful and reassuringly simple, the matter is more complicated than that, as this approach immediately raises some questions. The first of these is how lameness should be defined. There are several definitions of lameness, including: \"Lameness is an indication of a structural or functional disorder in one or more limbs or the back that is evident when the horse is standing or in movement\" 1; \"Lameness is simply a clinical sign – a manifestation of the signs of inflammation, including pain, or a mechanical defect – that results in a gait abnormality characterized by limping\" 2; and \"An alteration of the normal gait due to a functional or structural disorder in the locomotor system\" 3. There are more, but virtually all mention some disorder, defect or loss of function, hence a pathological condition, which makes lameness into a clinical problem. The second question is how lameness is detected, as this determines whether lameness (and thus a pathological condition) should be deemed present or not. The classical way to detect lameness has always been (and still is the mainstay in clinical practice) the visual evaluation of the gait of the horse under a number of different conditions whereby the presence or absence and degree of asymmetries is not the sole, but by far the most commonly used and most important criterion. Here, we enter a grey area, as it is well-known that interobserver agreement on subtle lameness, even if these observers are deemed experts, is meagre at best 4-7. Another issue is that the standard lameness work-up protocol may vary from a simple trot-up on a hard surface with or without additional circling 8 to meticulous protocols including extensive assessments on hard and soft surface at all gaits and ridden 9. As in the detection of osteochondrosis lesions, where horses may be declared 'free of osteochondrosis' after checking the hock, stifle and possibly the fetlock joints but may very well have lesions in other joints of the body 10, more subtle gait irregularities may be detected when horses are screened in more detail, making the qualification 'sound' much less absolute than generally perceived. The disagreement on existence, localisation and degree of subtle lameness is not only limited to within the veterinary profession when examining horses presented for some kind of presumed locomotion or general performance disorder. The gap between the horse-using public and the veterinary profession seems to be even wider. A recent study used a population of 57 riding horses of different levels that were classified as 'owner-sound', i.e. the horses were in regular use without any complaints regarding their locomotor system from their riders or trainers and without encountering problems in competition due to perceived lameness. After a meticulous clinical examination, 37 (65%) were deemed lame. Interestingly, of the remaining 20 sound horses, another 6 were found to be lame at a re-examination 14 days later, bringing the total number of lame horses in this supposedly sound population to 42 or 75% 9. Interest in the gait of horses has a long history 11, 12 and new developments such as the invention of photography or the introduction of cine film have always rapidly been used to further our understanding of equine gait 13, 14. The advent of computer technology in the modern era has enabled the detailed study and quantitation of the horse's gait 15 and in more recent times a variety of techniques has been developed, for the major part based on optic motion capture or the use of inertial measurement units (for a review, see 16). After lingering in the laboratory environment for long due to technical and practical constraints, more recently, some of these techniques have become available for routine clinical use and are currently being used in an increasing number of places. These systems overcome the issue of limited temporal and spatial resolution of the human eye and consequently the low intra- and above all interobserver agreement of the classical subjective lameness assessment. However, whereas human individuals are known to be excellent in pattern recognition 17, these systems rely on one or a number of gait parameters to decide about lameness or not. In the current systems, this is typically done by symmetry measurements and the application of certain thresholds to these values 18. Also, when these objective systems are used to quantify gait of 'owner-sound' horses, a large number of these fall outside the normal range and are hence deemed lame. In a study by Rhodin et al. 19 of 201 horses ridden regularly and functioning well in their work 107 (53%) showed asymmetries surpassing the thresholds set for either head or pelvis asymmetry. In another study, of a total of 222 'owner-sound' horses, an astonishing 72.5% showed movement asymmetries above previously reported asymmetries thresholds while trotting on the straight 20. It seems, therefore, that there is some agreement between the advanced, subjective clinical gait assessment based on expert opinion and the outcome of threshold-based objective asymmetry measurements by modern gait analysis techniques with respect to a high prevalence of subtle gait alterations. However, should we qualify these horses that do not comply with criteria for optimal gait during a comprehensive and critical clinical lameness examination or that fall outside the threshold values set for the automated gait analysis systems as lame? This question is very relevant because of the strong association in public perception between the term 'lameness' and impaired welfare. Thresholds are forcibly based on a limited reference population and do only to a certain extent reflect the millions of horses in the world. Further, depending on the bandwidth chosen, they will always contain only a limited percentage of any normally distributed population, which can have great consequences for individual cases. With respect to the clinical assessment: to what extent are we looking for horses with an optimal gait under all circumstances, rather than for those with a clinically acceptable gait? Not unimportantly, what do we really know about day-to-day variation in subtle gait characteristics in horses, or of variation over longer periods? What about the effects of the environment or even the mental condition of the horse on these measured or clinically observed asymmetries and irregularities, which are too small to impede daily use of the horse and/or participation in competitions? Can we state with certainty that these subtle gait alterations affect equine welfare to some significant extent? The issue is not that easy and we have far more than 50 shades of grey here. The most logical avenue to follow seems to establish whether or not those horses experience pain. That, however, is an art in itself and far from trivial. Apart from the fact that horses, like human individuals, have different pain thresholds, there are various forms of pain. Direct peripheral pain may be relatively easy to detect, but in chronic conditions (which are very frequent in equine musculoskeletal pathology) pain pathways may have been altered and pain sources may have become different and much less easy to detect 21. Even if the existence of pain can be proven, the next question arises, which is to what level the existence of pain can be deemed acceptable. There is no human athlete pursuing their career without experiencing pain. It would be more than naïve to suppose that the situation for the horse would, or even could, be different. But where should the line be drawn and based on what criteria? Here, also ethics come in beyond the biology. It can be concluded that the interpretation of the subtle asymmetries or gait irregularities that can be detected through either very comprehensive clinical examinations by highly experienced orthopaedists or are (with increasing frequency) detected by the various asymmetry-detection based gait analysis systems that are gradually spreading over the equine veterinary world, is far from straightforward. The use of the term 'lameness' in relation to these subtle gait alterations is questionable in a scientific sense and may be dangerous in the more societal context due to the negative connotation of the word lameness and its association with impairment of welfare and unfitness to compete. There is a strong need to better investigate the background and true meaning of these subtle gait alterations and to put them in the (largely unknown) context of normal variation, as well as to determine their true effect on equine welfare. As long as there is insufficient information to this respect, one should be very cautious with the use of the term 'lameness', and probably more cautious than in the older days when the human eye was the only available tool for the evaluation of equine gait. We advise strongly that researchers and clinicians should discriminate clearly between 'asymmetry' and 'lameness' and not to use these as interchangeable terms when interpreting gait analysis data, irrespective of whether these are generated by classical observation or by advanced and sophisticated quantitative motion capture systems. In this concept and following the definition by Ross 2, lameness is a clinical interpretation of abnormal (and in the vast majority of cases asymmetric) gait that implies some kind of pathological aberration, which is probably, but even not always, located in the musculoskeletal system and of which the severity and importance can vary. Asymmetries and pain are frequent, but by no means ever-present hallmarks of lameness. Horses with bilateral lameness may show a symmetrical gait and mechanical lameness may very well lead to large asymmetries, but can be pain free. The term asymmetry, by contrast, is just a technical term describing a larger or smaller deviation of perfectly symmetric motion. Symmetry is a relative notion as the classification as symmetrical or asymmetrical depends on the accuracy and precision with which gait is measured. As pointed out above, asymmetry may be, and very often is, a hallmark of lameness, but is in itself not a clinical term, whereas lameness is. This notion is important when discussing the use of thresholds. In a scientific sense, the concept of overlapping Gaussian distributions allows for dividing horses into more or less symmetric individuals and the group of horses below a certain level ('threshold') is likely to contain a higher proportion of sound horses than the group above that threshold, in which the proportion of lame horses will be higher. The knowledge of to which group a horse belongs may certainly help in clinical decision making. However, we should realise that this reasoning is based on population dynamics and does not justify the direct application of the thresholds as sole criteria for the use of the term 'lameness' to individual cases. We also should realise that we know too little at present about the biological meaning of (subtle) asymmetries captured by our quantitative gait analysis systems. What we are measuring is motion (kinematics) whereas changes in loading of limbs (kinetics) may be more directly related to biologically relevant processes, as these often reflect the presence of pain. Reliable and repeatable measurement of ground reaction forces is not yet feasible in a clinical setting, but it might become possible in the near future to measure changes in ground reaction forces in relation to total weight, which could be a most useful and possibly more direct parameter than the current asymmetries. It can be foreseen that the developments in the automated, objective quantification of equine gait (thus not 'of lameness detection') will continue, driven by the enormous progress in the IT industry. This will probably bring quantitative gait analysis in equine orthopaedics to the same level as currently taken by diagnostic imaging: a very well appreciated and indispensable additional tool for clinical decision-making. With this process currently starting, it is important, however, to define very sharply the use of terminology in order to avoid confusion and to prevent the formation of wrong perceptions, either amongst professionals or by the lay public. Using the term 'lame' for any horse falling beyond thresholds set for quantitative gait analysis or not showing the ideal motion pattern when assessed clinically does not seem a wise thing to do. We should reserve the use of that term for horses deemed unfit to compete based on a comprehensive assessment of the animal that includes, but does not rely entirely on, the appreciation of the degree of gait asymmetry.

      "title": "Criminality from Alcoholism",
      "abstract": "Within the last ten years, a revolution of theories and opinions concerning alcohol has taken place. Scientific researches in the laboratory and clinical experience confirmed by exact measurements with instruments of precision, have proven that the effects of alcohol on the body are anaesthetic and paralyzing. The so-called tonic and stimulant properties which have been claimed for centuries, and incorporated in text-books and literature as facts beyond question, are contradicted by modern research. Theories that alcohol in any form gives new power and force to the brain activities, bringing out latent qualities and new energies, and in some way giving the person greater efficiency and power, must be put aside. The display of excitement, activity and mental force, by persons under the influence of spirits is really the first stage of paralysis. Thus the five senses, and the ability to reason, the rapidity of thought, the capacity to memorize, the muscular output are all depressed, lowered and actually numbed by the use of alcohol in any form. These are facts that are verifiable by measurements and can be expressed by figures, showing the loss with absolute certainty. While some alcohols are more powerful than others (by alcohols I mean any drink containing alcohol), and some have a special action on the brain, on the heart, the muscular system and the senses; they are all evidences of one great pathological effect of paralysis. When this fact is recognized, the present jurisprudence and legal recognition of crime committed by persons under the influence of spirits must be changed. The law still continues to assume that the alcoholic is responsible and should be punished the same as others. Society regards the victim of alcohol as possessing free will and capacity to understand his relations to society, hence his failure is regarded as vicious. This condition has been accepted without question until very recently. Both the decision of the courts and modern teaching assume that the irresponsibility of persons who commit crime under the influence of spirits, is a subterfuge to diminish responsibility. Crimes committed by persons intoxicated, or under the influence of alcohol are constantly increasing. Questions are coming up concerning the mental integrity",

      "title": "Metaphysical Suffering, Metaphysics as Therapy",
      "abstract": "To suffer is to have something done to one or happen to one. It is particularly defined through its contrast: doing, being active; and so suffering is especially contrasted with being in control. Control, decision, activity, choice are the antithesis of suffering; suffering is to lack such control. Since action and choice are deliberative and rational, engaging in meaningful activity is the antithesis of suffering. Unfortunately, secure and systematic control is not available to us. Two ancient Greek responses to this fact are briefly outlined in order to contrast them with the Buddhist approach to the fact of suffering. In short, the Buddhist approach recommends relinquishing hopes for controlling our environment so that we get always what we want and never what we do not want. We thus reduce suffering by accepting suffering. They identify three forms of suffering: pain, impermanence, becoming. The first comes and goes, and its absence is preferable to its presence; this gives one reason to act. Compassion has some focal point. Some of these pains are unnecessary, however, and are created by the fact of impermanence, together with a mistaken attitude towards this fact. The latter two forms of suffering may be, by contrast, ineliminable; but they are not obviously bad. Rather they become so by virtue of our wish that reality be otherwise. Thus the way to alleviate suffering is through self-knowledge - that is, knowing ourselves and our situation as dependent and transient. Understanding is a method for minimizing suffering – we should improve the pathē through metaphysics, rather than by attempting to control.",

The effects of electrical light pollution resulting from ineffective or unnecessary use of artificial light. Specific categories of light pollution include light trespassing, over-illumination, glare, optical turbulence, and celestial flare. The offending light source often falls into more than one of these categories. For example, humans make use of artificial light to increase work and play hours, but this light causes an imbalance in the body's biological clock, leading to psychological stress that is harmful to health. The geometry of the environment of living organisms is affected by the different effects of light on individual species. For example, some types of spiders avoid lighted places, while others build their webs on a lamppost. These changes in the numbers of living organisms may result in unintended consequences because the interaction of living species with each other is affected, and thus changes in the food web occur. For example, changes in the activity of nocturnal insects can affect the survival rates of night-blooming plants, which themselves provide food and shelter for diurnal animals.",

      "abstract": "This theory regards intentions as mental states, e.g., attitudes, which, typically, have causal power. But we do not speak of our intentions as having such powers. Instead, we speak of a person's resolve, determination, or his anxiety, eagerness, and so forth, as the ‘powers’ that move us. Of course, one desires for various reasons to carry out his various intentions but that desire is not a component of the intentions. An intention is, roughly, the course of action that one has adopted, so it has no such components. There are other characteristics of intentions which the mental state idea of intentions does not share. Intentions do not have the temporal characteristics that mental states have, or share the curious context dependency that intentions have. And since, according to the theory, mental states operate causally, it would not be possible for a person to commit himself to a course of action as we ordinarily do when we make a promise or sign an agreement or contract.",

      "title": "Differentiation of Primary Emotions through Neuromodulators: Review of Literature",
      "abstract": "Emotional mental disorders are a leading cause of disabilities worldwide. Despite the obvious importance of emotion for human existence, controversy still abounds over the definition of emotion, the number of emotions that exit, whether different emotions have different physiological signatures. In this paper, we review papers about the emotional functions of neuromodulators: dopamine (DA), norepinephrine (NE), serotonin (5-HT) and acetyl choline (ACh), and propose that they act as the primary neural basis for 5 primary emotions (joy, anger/fear, sadness and missing). DA is a rewarding signal for salient stimuli such as food, sex and other needs. 5-HT has been related to depression for decades, it might be a marker for dislike/disgusting things. NE is the substrate for surprise, whose release induces \"fight or flight\" behaviors, or fear and anger emotions. Even though anger and fear are common emotions, there are no previous papers differentiating them or probing into their relationships. Here we found that fear and anger usually come hand in hand with fear followed by anger. And we give an equation to describe their relationships: The total amount of Surprise/stress = fear + anger. This equation fits in both duration and tension. Finally we introduced ACh emotions, which are opposite to NE induced stressful emotions. These emotions include \"missing and wanting\", \"calm/tame\", affectionate, submissive, et al. The significance of ACh emotions lies in the treatment for aggressive, impulsive behaviors, or phobia and manic disorders. In all, there might be 5 basic emotions (joy, anger/fear, sadness and missing).",

Philosophical perspectives on the character of humankind, such as those espoused by Hobbes (1651/1968) or Rousseau (1763/1974), as well as theories of personality and personality development, frequently begin with an assumption about an infant's affective character and abilities for self-regulation. From this foundation they then build a theory of character and its development, integrating issues of regulation and emotional expression. Rousseau was more optimistic in his view of infants as “pure” or basically moral and only subsequently corrupted by society, whereas most philosophers and theorists have held darker views of the clay from which personhood is molded. Thus, it has been more common to view infants as full of seething, vicious drives that are insensitive to others and potentially destructive (Freud, 1905/1953; 1935/1960; 1940/1964; Hobbes, 1651/1968), or at the very least untrammeled and in need of regulation, first from others but subsequently from the self.",

These states can be described behaviorally by observing the human or animal.

On the other hand, dualism has often led to a somewhat opposite view, namely, sexual libertinism. For, if the self is a spirit, or a consciousness, and the body is outside the self, then bodily sexual activities may be viewed as rather unimportant – useful perhaps to obtain pleasure (viewed as an effect in one's consciousness), to relieve tension, or so on. If one's body, or one's animality, is viewed as extrinsic to what one really is, then one might also conclude that what happens within the realm of the bodily or animal is of itself quite irrelevant to what occurs to one's real self. Perhaps the sexual may receive some important significance or meaning, but – if the self is a pure consciousness – it does not have within its nature, or inherently, any significance or value.",

      "abstract": "Conscience is a fact of common experience. It will be universally recognised that there is within the human consciousness some principle, some norm or measure, apparently unbiassed and involuntary, which seems to claim authority in regulating or attempting to regulate what is known as moral conduct. In other words, there is something of the Jekyll and Hyde in every man, and broadly speaking Jekyll is the personification of the voice of Conscience. But while there is universal recognition of the fact, there is less unanimity as to the precise significance of the fact of conscience. In a broad division there are two opposite views, in one of which conscience appears as rational, in the other as emotional. The latter is the view adopted by modern experimental psychologists in their attempt to analyse ‘moral consciousness.’ ‘Moral consciousness’ is the somewhat undefined name given nowadays to the complexity of emotions and instincts which precede, accompany and follow a moral act, producing feelings of ‘moral’ satisfaction or disquietude as the case may be. Upon examination, however, it is found that all these emotions and instincts are placed in the order of bodily reactions to stimuli. They are confined, in other words, almost entirely to the material order, and in effect the highest and especially human faculties, namely reason and rational will, are disregarded or eliminated. This position, it should be noted, is justified by the circumstances in the sense that it represents the findings of purely experimental psychology. No one should be so foolish as to deny the authority of any science within its own sphere. It is only when any science presumes to argue to conclusions outside its own sphere that it lays itself open to criticism from without.",

      "title": "What's in a name? Comments on the use of the terms 'accident' and 'injury'.",
      "abstract": "The prevailing opinion in the public health community is that the use of the wordaccident is detrimental to the efforts to describe, understand, analyze, and prevent the complex person-environmental interactions that lead to bodily injury. This is due to the connotations of faith, chance, and unpredictability associated with the word and even more so with the adjective, accidental. As a result, the public health, pediatric, and medical literature over the past decade has increasingly replaced the word accident with the terminjury, which is neutral with respect to causation, intentionality, and predictability. While this shift may have contributed to the increased scientific interest in the phenomenon, it is left substantial conceptual and linguist of problems in its wake. Put quite simply, an injury is not an accident. To paraphrase Haddon, an injury results from the transmission of from the environment to the human body when the quantity or nature of the is sufficient to cause damage to tissues. If the transmission of occurs over a relatively brief time, as in, for example, a fall from a height or a motor vehicle collision, it can be considered a discrete event that can be easily distinguished from the resulting injury or injuries. The major conceptual model used to assess etiology and identify targets for countermeasures, the Haddon Matrix, clearly distinguishes between the human-environmental event and resulting injury. Haddon dropped the term accident in his later work; however, he insisted on addressing the person environmental interchange in its full complexity, with the practical aim of identifying the phases of the process most amenable to intervention. Just as the single word, accident, did not adequately convey the complexity of the phenomenon, and in fact added a misleading etiologic assumption, the word injury only represents the outcome of a process in which an event, previously referred to as an accident, plays a central part. Banishment of the word accident from the injury researcher's lexicon has resulted in some practical difficulties, in addition to the conceptual problem of conflating the event and the outcome. When referring to multiple injuries that occur from a single human-environmental interaction, some term needs to be substituted for the old A word. When referring to events with injury producing potential that do not result in injury, some other term is needed. When referring to prevention of the events that lead to injury, we can list specific types of events(For example, a motor vehicle crashes, fires, poisonings, salts), but we have no time that encompasses them all. In seeking a solution to the loss of the a word we need to distinguish between scholarly usage and popular usage. The word accident is deeply ingrained in the public mind and its use has remained untouched by the academic substitution of the word injury. Much as injury researchers may emphasize the continuing between intentional and unintentional injuries, the media and the public clearly make a distinction between injuries for home no one is held directly responsible our accidents, and the intentionally inflicted injuries. And, While decades of research have made it clear that there are seasonal, geographic, academic, and demographic very nations in the occurrence of the events leading to injuries, these events are still perceived as largely random. The us, those who worked at the interface of academia and the public are likely to need to continue using the word accident, while hammering home the point that they are also put that a ball and predictable. For the academic community, it would be advantageous to adopt a common term for the events that resulting injury, or have the potential friend treat. Given caught occasions of the word accident, the animosity to it over the past 10 to 20 years, and the inclusion of clearly intentional injuries the public health field of injury control, it is inadvisable to resurrect the term. One solution would be to use one of the multi word phrases that describe the phenomenon energy exchange. Acronyms, such as IPE (injury producing event) and PIPE (potentially injury producing event) may serve the purpose. Although new terms are inherently unfamiliar and awkward, they have been successfully adopted in other fields (for example, CAT, MRI, EEG). Prevention of events leading to injury may be an integral component of injury prevention, but ultimately it is the adverse impact of these events on the human body that is of paramount importance.

Rather, a system far from equilibrium is the expression of the “arrow of time,” whose role is essential and constructive. In such a system, the future is uncertain and the conditions are irreversible. The laws that we can formulate therefore enumerate only possibilities, never certainties.” In a secular social system, the future is unpredictable and each moment may bring something new. Secularity is thus the experience of radical uncertainty: radical because the ultimate may be at stake—life and death—even incircumstances that seem quite ordinary; and uncertain because there are no laws that give one a reliable guide on how to think, feel, or act.",

As such, persons both approach and retreat from these relationships. While retreating from these relationships allows us to feel safe, we also numb ourselves to the full experience of our interpersonal world. “Symptoms” of “psychopathology” (including symptoms of panic) are ways in which we tell ourselves that we are not engaging in ROLE relationships as extensively as we could. By courageously exploring our ways of limiting intimacy, due mostly to horrendous disr confirmations, we can use our experience of “symptomatology” to grow in ways that allow us to experience self, other, and world more richly. This type of growth, toward reverence or awe, is the true end of therapy.",

      "title": "Able/Disabled",
      "abstract": "The able/disabled binary is a problematic logic for several reasons. First, this binary assumes that ability is an individual capacity residing in an individual human, rather than the intra-action between what a body can be and do and how this is enabled or constrained by material-discursive conditions. Second, there is the idea that ability is a category that you either have or don't – for example, you are either neurotypical or neuroatypical. The third assumption is that disability is a pathology associated with a flaw or lack in the individual, deviating from what is considered normal. Going beyond binary thinking in disability studies would mean underlining the logics of rehabilitation and inclusion because these are invested in making normative practices and experiences pre-eminent and desirable.",

      "abstract": "Profoundly important ethical issues turn on the question whether biological life is an essential and intrinsic aspect of a human person or is only an extrinsic instrument. Consider, for example, the controversy concerning abortion. A key issue, of course, is the status of the developing human embryo or fetus that is deliberately destroyed by induced abortion. If the human person is not a particular type of organism, then one could hold that a human organism begins to exist at one time while the human person begins to exist at a later time. If, however, a human person is (whatever else he or she may be) a particular type of organism, then whenever the human organism begins to exist that is the time that the human person begins to exist. Now, consider the issue at the other “edge of life,” namely, euthanasia. Here the issue is the status of the severely debilitated and, perhaps, permanently unconscious or minimally conscious individual. A supporter of euthanasia might look at such an individual and say, “that's the same living organism that used to be grandfather, but that is not grandfather anymore.” The assumption the euthanasia supporter is making is that the “person” is something distinct from the living human organism, albeit associated with it, namely, the consciousness or perhaps a spiritual entity. If we reject that assumption and regard the human person as a particular type of bodily being, a particular type of organism, then the living human individual remains grandfather – the person – and is entitled, from an ethical vantage point, to be treated as such, despite his debilitated condition.",

      "title": "Japanese Aesthetics and Philosophy of Art",
      "abstract": "Unlike most Western aesthetics, which recognize (aesthetic) pleasure, independent of other values (truth and falsity, good and evil), as the primary value of aesthetic experience, the various Japanese aesthetics recognize a range of objectives and effects that is more complex. First, there is a wider range of types of aesthetic pleasure. Those best known and most influential in the West include aware/mononoaware (an awareness of the poignance of things, connected to a Buddhist sense of transience and to passing beauty); yūgen (deep or mysterious and powerful beauty, especially in Noh theater); wabi (powerlessness, loneliness, shabbiness, wretchedness); sabi (the beauty accompanying loneliness, solitude, quiet); and shibui (an ascetic quality or astringency, literally the sensation afforded by a pomegranate, which also imparts a rich but sober color to wood stains, etc.). Second, Japanese aesthetic experiences and activities are employed in the service of a wider range of objectives. These include (aesthetic) pleasure and the revelation of truth; self-cultivation that is not only artistic but also physical, social, emotional, psychological, and spiritual; the construction of personal, group, and national identity; and the formulation of relationships. This article begins with an overview of the uniqueness of Japanese aesthetics. It then examines several of the unique objectives of Japanese aesthetics in further detail.",

      "title": "Hybrid Incentives: Carrots, Sticks, or Carrots Which Become Sticks?",
      "abstract": "Various incentives may be used in order to cause a person to desist from an activity that creates negative externalities. It is possible, naturally, to use a stick and to apply an economic sanction in order to incentivize them to desist from that activity. It is also possible to use a carrot, i.e., to grant them a financial prize if they desist from the activity. Each of these incentives has advantages and disadvantages. Literature and practice are familiar with various combinations of sticks and carrots. In most cases, the mechanism is “horizontal”, e.g. using carrots with respect to certain parts of the population, and sticks against other parts. The Article presents a novel, vertical, sequential mechanism, in the form of a “game” played in two consecutive stages that are connected to each other, that trap the person who perpetrated a negative action within the mechanism, with no possible way out. At the center of the first stage of the vertical mechanism stands a carrot – a reward or a positive incentive – which is combined with a certain social sanction (shaming). At the center of the second stage, which is activated only if the implementation of the first stage did not meet with success, stands a stick – a punishment or a negative incentive. The objective will be to incentivize a person to engage in fruitful negotiations to end the harmful activity at the pre-mechanism stage, for after the mechanism begins operating and as more time passes, he will only lose. For this purpose, an illustration will be offered of the negative social behavior of one-sided refusal to give or accept the Jewish divorce bill in the Jewish sector the world over, in a reality in which it is not possible under religious law to compel a refuser to give or accept that bill, namely, the intractable agunah problem. The mechanism will be built primarily on the basis of a few theories from the field of law and economics: reversible rewards, dual-chooser rules, and modular liability rules. The main argument will be that the use of a multi-part vertical incentives mechanism increases efficiency at minimal additional cost; it overcomes a moral problem of “rewarding the sinner” by giving him a carrot and combines in optimal fashion the advantages entailed by activating the sticks and the carrots, and at the same time – insofar as possible – nullifies most of the disadvantages of each of them.",

      "abstract": "That this contributes much more to a person's happiness than what he has, or what he represents, we have already recognized in general. All depends on what someone is and, accordingly, has in himself; for his individuality accompanies him at all times and in all places; it colours all that he experiences. In and through everything he initially enjoys only himself; this is true of the bodily, but much more of the intellectual pleasures. Hence the English ‘to enjoy one's self’ is a very fitting expression, with which, for example, we say ‘he enjoys himself at Paris’, thus not ‘he enjoys Paris’, but ‘he enjoys himself in Paris’. – However, if the individual character is badly constituted, all pleasures are like delicious wines in a mouth full of bile. Accordingly, in good times and bad times, leaving aside great calamities, it is less important what befalls us in life than how we feel about it, hence what is the nature and the degree of our receptivity in every respect. What someone is and has within himself, in short, personality and its worth, is the only thing that immediately counts for his happiness and well-being. Everything else is mediate; consequently, its effects can be frustrated, but those of personality never. For that reason, envy directed towards personal merits is the most unforgiving, as it is also the most carefully concealed. Moreover, the constitution of consciousness alone is persistent and enduring, and individuality acts constantly and incessantly, more or less at every moment; everything else only acts from time to time, occasionally, temporarily, and is also subject to reversal and transformation. Hence Aristotle says: ‘Nature is permanent, but wealth is not.’ 344 Because of this we bear a misfortune that has befallen us entirely from the outside with more composure than one that is self-inflicted; for fate can change, but one's own nature never.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Medicine medicalizes reality. It creates a world. It translates sets of problems into its own terms. Medicine molds the ways in which the world of experience takes shape; it conditions reality for us. The difficulties people have are then appreciated as illnesses, diseases, deformities, and medical abnormalities, rather than as innocent vexations, normal pains, or possession by the devil. Medical problems are clusters of phenomena seen as amenable to medical assessment, explanation, and up to a point, alleviation or cure. Here one finds clusters of difficulties often termed diseases, sicknesses, illnesses, deformities, disabilities, and disfigurements, which are beyond the immediate control of the individuals afflicted, and which are presumed to have a basis in physiological, anatomical, or psychological causal matrices. Their sense, significance, and reality are cast in terms of the social and intellectual institutions of medicine. In being seen as medical problems, they are usually characterized as circumstances that deviate from physiological or psychological ideals regarding proper levels of function, freedom from pain, and achievement of expected human form and grace. An ache or pain thus becomes a medical disorder. In addition, since medicine is a social institution, the pains, deformities, and dysfunctions are given a social valence.",

Beliefs, goals, intentions, collective intentionality, etc. play a key role in the explanation of individual and collective behaviour; these categories of intentionality are at the base of agents action plans. New properties emerge because in a context of ignorance and radical uncertainty agents form new combinations or conjectures about the future state of affairs. Thus, they discover or invent new actions and/or new goals; and/or rearrange previously existing actions and goals in a new way. A by-product of interactive deployment of intended action is the generation of new knowledge. When emergent properties - such as innovation - are generated by interactions in product markets cum interactions in knowledge production, the outcome is usually beyond agents intentionality. However, the fact that unexpected consequences arise from the interaction of plans does not eliminate the fact that its origin was intentional.",

Ethics is distinctively a product of the human genius, a phenomenon in our social behavior. From a biological perspective, such an emergence of ethics is as remarkable as any other event we know; in some form or other ethics is pervasively present in every human culture, whether honored in the observance or the breach. So we must evaluate origins to discover the nature in, the nature of, our duties.

      "title": "Is Pain Only Bad? On the Ambiguous Value of Being in Pain",
      "abstract": "Human pain is a complex phenomenon. On the one hand it is an essentially human experience. Every one has (to a certain extent) experienced pain once or several times in their life. It is hence a commonly shared experience, which we can transform into language forms and use the pain experience in communication. On the other hand, pain is also essentially subjective. Even though every one has already sensed pain in certain regards, the pain we can feel is always only our personal pain. Another one’s pain is only accessible through her communication of it. We can thus only have ‘second-hand information’ about another person’s painful experience. At the same time, the sensed intensity of pain is evaluated very differently. Whereas some people experience severe pain from an insect’s bite or a flu shot, others accept these experiences literally without batting an eye. Some people even seek physical pain in order to explore their own limits; try to go beyond or to ‘feel themselves’ (e.g. in sports). Yet, in most contexts, especially in the medical area, we agree on the basic assumption that no one should suffer from severe pain. Especially in the relatively new area of palliative care, it is the main task to provide terminally ill patients with sufficient pain reliefs. In my chapter, I want to explore this multidimensionality of pain from the ethical perspective. I would like to argue for pain being an essential, and hence valuable, human experience which, up to a certain degree of intensity, is not only not harmful to us, but rather crucial for grasping and constituting our own personal identity. Therefore, I claim that pain has a central value for our life as persons and that a purely painless life cannot meaningfully be aspired.",

Among others, it is at these moments, or when they return, and almost throughout the whole of life, that the uncanny finds the opportunity of manifesting itself more or less spectacularly.

Nevertheless, there is heuristic value in distinguishing between the two. It has been suggested that the word “disease” be reserved for a condition in which AN abnormality of function has been brought about by a change in anatomy, histology, biochemistry, physiology, or molecular biology — in other words, AN underlying pathology. Disease is a useful concept in all the biological sciences. Any organism may suffer from disease. Illness, on the other hand, is a social rather than a biological concept. It is appropriately applied only to human beings — one does not attribute illness to AN earthworm, although one may be tempted to do so to a favorite dog. Illness indicates that the person affected is not as they should be — not behaving, or not thinking, or not feeling as they or other members of their community think is appropriate. Illness is merely one way of explaining this dissonance — others might include a cold wind blowing or because there has been a recent serious loss or trauma. Illness has specific social implications in that it conveys certain privileges and responsibilities to the ill person, e.g. they may be excused from attending work or school.",

      "title": "Religio-spiritual strategies of self-help and empowerment in everyday life: selected cases of spirituality in Germany",
      "abstract": "Within the wider context of contemporary spiritual practice or esotericism, individuals can be observed (not only in Germany but also elsewhere), who combine different kinds of alternative healing practices in order to gain or maintain physical and mental health, well-being, success and autonomy. These practices were said to take place only within the very private sphere, partly because those beliefs do not change the everyday lifestyles of individ­uals significantly, at least in comparison with the much more formative traditional religions. These practices are often connected to discernibly spiritual or religious, often inconsistent combinations of beliefs that contain a ‘multiple­ salvation logic’ which is used by the actors themselves to explain why they act in certain ways. At the same time, key features of ‘secular rationality’ are a central aspect as well; for example, the level of semantics, which here is ‘the secular’, is a category actively and deliberately, though implicitly applied, positively defined (for example, as scientific) and constantly placed in relation to the categories of ‘spiritual’ and ‘religious’. These also are transformed, but always remain structurally recognisable within the differently reported world-views, especially if one considers instrumental rationality as something widely associated with the ‘secular’ in contrast with the ‘religious’ or ‘spiritual’. This paper shows, firstly, the different versions of salvation logic and reasoning of action within individual world-views, and secondly it focuses on examples of the semantics used in reports of individ­uals’ own world-views. Thirdly, against this backdrop, the term ‘post-secular’, understood in this way, as opposed to its original meaning, is discussed in order to point out former limits and some new possibilities when this term is used as a description of current forms of religion.",

      "title": "On the Localization of Bodily Disturbance accompanying Emotions",
      "abstract": "When any emotion reaches to a high degree of intensity there takes place a sense of graze in a certain locality over the external surface of our body. The sense of graze is in quality something like a feeling experienced when we, in a bath, receive on the abdominal region a surge caused by moving our hand. It is rough and devoids of compactness, it is felt near the surface of our skin, being never taken for visceral disturbance which usually appears deep in the visceral cavity. In looking down from height, we are aware of the sense at the calf of our legs the same instant when we experience danger. The author calls this a calf phenomenon.In the negative emotions, for instance of fear or dread, it is felt at the back, but in case of positive emotion of joy on the other hand it is localized on the ventral side, especially on the chest. While the sense is static in the calf phenomenon, it is dynamic in nature in intense fear or joy, that is it runs a certain distance with a certain speed; the speed seems to increase in accordance with the increase of their intensity. It closely resembles a sense of touch and is clearly distinguished from visceral or organic sensation by its superficial, at least somatic origin. The fact that it disappears as soon as the emotion concerned looses its intensity or comes to disappeare shows that it is essential bodily changes subjectively experienced in intense emotions.Though at present its physiological nature is not clear enough, we are prone to accept Cannon's thalamic theory in so far as it is of somatic kind, shallowly seated and has no direct connection of with excitations visceral organs. The James-Lange theory is not consistent with the existence of the sense of graze essential to emotions.The sense is differently localized in different qualities of emotions, in general the positive emotions on the ventral side and the negative on the dorsal one. This fact is biologically of significance because the positive emotions have to do with situations favorable and acceptable and the negative ones on the other hand with those unfavorable and rejected to an organism.(The author)",

      "title": "Proxemics [and Comments and Replies]",
      "abstract": "Virtually everything that man is and does is associated with space. Man's sense of space is a synthesis of many sensory inputs: visual, auditory, kinesthetic, olfactory, and thermal. Not only does each of these constitute a complex system (as for example, the dozen or more different ways of experiencing depth visually), but each is molded and patterned by culture. Hence people reared in different cultures live in different sensory worlds. What is more, they are generally unaware of the degree to which the worlds may differ. From the study of culture we learn that the patterning of perceptual worlds is a function not only of the specific culture but of the relationship, activity, and emotions present in a given situation. Therefore, when two people of different cultures interact, each uses different criteria to interpret the other's behavior, and each may easily misinterpret the relationship, the activity, or the emotions involved. The study of culture in the proxemic sense is the study of peoples' use of their perceptual apparatus in different emotional states during different activities, in different relationships, settings, and contexts. No single research technique is sufficient in scope to investigate this complex, multi-dimensional subject. The research technique is, therefore, a function of the particular facet under examination at the time and many call for the involvement of many disciplines. Like all basic studies of the communicative process, proxemics, as I think of it, is more concerned with how than why, and more concerned with structure than content. The work is admittedly detailed and is apt to be routine. It addresses itself to basic human situations in an area of culture that is ordinarily hidden from conscious awareness. For this reason, proxemics frequently leads to new insights about specific cultures, as well as to insights into the generalized concept of culture itself. In formulating my thinking concerning proxemics, I have maintained that culture is an extension of basic biological processes. While man's extensions as they evolve may mask the underlying relationships which maintain the equilibrium of biological systems, the relationships and systems are no less real by virtue of being hidden. In the words of Ian McHarg (1963): ...no species can exist without an environment, no species can exist in an environment of its exclusive creation, no species can survive, save as a nondisruptive member of an ecological community. Every member must adjust to other members of the community and to the environment in order to survive. Man is not excluded from this test.",

      "abstract": "A diferencia de otros tratamientos medicos, la alimentacion y la hidratacion tienen en nuestra cultura un significado simbolico. El ser humano se caracteriza por su capacidad de dar sentido a las cosas a traves de simbolos o de funciones simbolicas, entre ellas el lenguaje, que senalan cuales son las acciones humanas significativas. Dar de comer y beber es una accion humana significativa de respeto a la vida y de cuidado a nuestros semejantes. Al igual que cualquier simbolo, este conecta directamente con las emociones de las personas. Seria una actitud etica emotivista frente a otra mas racional, porque una cosa es tener en cuenta las simbologias de las culturas, y otra muy distinta afirmar que esto sea razon suficiente para que en ningun caso se pueda retirar o suprimir la nutricion artificial. Habra que determinar las circunstancias en que su uso ofrece un claro beneficio para el paciente, o si por el contrario estas medidas pueden ser desproporcionadas o futiles. Para abordar este problema, en primer lugar hemos de definir que es un paciente terminal. A continuacion pasaremos a describir la actitud social y la actitud medica ante la muerte, para finalmente pasar a considerar que es un tratamiento futil. Y todo esto en un contexto de respeto a la autonomia del enfermo. Suele admitirse que el paciente terminal es aquel en el que la muerte se va a producir en un periodo de tiempo de aproximadamente seis meses. Otras instituciones como el Hasting’s Center de Bioetica considera este periodo extensivo hasta un ano. La Sociedad Espanola de Cuidados Paliativos define como enfermo terminal el que tiene un pronostico de vida inferior a seis meses y en el que concurren ademas otros factores: – Existencia de una enfermedad avanzada, progresiva e incurable. – Falta razonable de respuesta al tratamiento especifico. – Aparicion de sintomas intensos, multiples, multifactoriales y cambiantes. – Gran impacto emocional en el paciente, la familia e incluso en el equipo terapeutico, muy relacionados, ya sea o no de forma explicita, con la presencia de la muerte.",

If the society's practices and rituals are subjected to criticism they will erode. This “anxiety” is not fully conscious but is manifested, Horton hypothesizes, in such social mechanisms as “taboos.”",

      "title": "The Significance of Names in Ghanaian Drama",
      "abstract": "The significance attached to names and naming in Ghanaian society is remarkable; it is strikingly different from what obtains in Euro-American cultures. Names of peoples, objects, spirits, and God tend to emanate from the interplay of religious, mythical, social, and historical realities (Abraham, 1962). Individuals are named on the basis of the culture's expectations and identification of the personality so named with particular clan or genealogical groups beliefs, birth order and circumstance, status, and attributes (Quartey-Papafio, 1913). For example, the Akan call a male child born on Saturday Kwame. A child doomed to cyclical birth and death is named Bejina (come and stay) and one whose paternity is not acknowledged or who is born to aging parents is called Nyame Kye (God's gift). Asante military tactics and Ga striking power are celebrated in the appellations Asante Kotoko (Asante the Porcupines) and Gagaa (Ga the Soldier Ants), respectively. This system of nomenclature seems to be the basic one subscribed to by many other African peoples including the Yoruba, Ewe, Igbo, Hausa, and African-Americans. Though the elaborate and formalized naming pattern may have been lost among the latter the African presence is maintained through the AfricanAmerican's widespread use of epithets, bynames, and nicknames (Asante, 1987, p. 73). Naming has colored the writing and artistic works of Africans, from earlier generations to contemporary times. What is lacking, though, is a systematic study of the nature and qualities of such nominal colorations as they arise from the various parts of the African world. The present article is a modest contribution in this",

G. Wells, Nietzsche, Max Sterner and others) or by attempting, through discarding the\" complications of civilization, a return to a child-like or Edenic state.This striving is in fact an important element in Christianity,-\"Except ye become as little children ye cannot enter into the kingdom of Heaven.\".Our heavens are always far beyond us or far behind us.Assuming, then, the presence of this 'flight from reality,' •which we know to be such a prominent feature (one might say an essential feature) in many psychoses and psychoneuroses, it is obvious that it may be a forward striving or a backward or a mixture of the two.If forward, the delusional formations tend to take on a grandiose character.Last year I reported a case in the Psychoanalytic Review (\"A Manic-depressive Episode Presenting a Frank Wish-Realization Construction,\" The Psychoanalytic Review, April 1915, Vol.II, No. 2) of an unmarried woman, aged fifty-five, who, after the death of her mother with",

Physical damage ordinarily occurs where there is some change in the state or structure of a person’s body, or where there is some change in the state or structure of tangible property. The author argues that courts have, in recent wrongful conception and contamination cases, widened the orthodox notion of what constitutes physical damage. The courts have employed an ordinary bystander test in order to determine whether particular failures of care, arising in circumstances of high or unnecessary risk of physical harm, should be treated as if they give rise to physical damage. These are cases of a new form of actionable damage, that is, damage of a socially constructed kind.",

There could be no specific model to describe the process, but as said it originates from the generation of new ideas that is eventually manifested in the extraordinary achievements we encounter in any field of human activity. The essence of individual innovation lies in its uniqueness of the intellectual power or capacity expressed. The developmental foundation of an individual innovation is associated with the childhood development of the innovators. It is the period in which he or she undergoes high levels of cognitive manifestations. This is the duration whereby it accelerates the propensity to contribute something 'new' of its kind.

      "title": "Understanding the Personal Meaning of the Metaphor, \"Body as Home\" for Application in Dance/Movement Therapy",
      "abstract": "Within the last three decades, environmental psychologists, sociologists and psychologists have described \"home\" as a safe haven or sanctuary, in which one experiences positive qualities such as security, privacy, belonging and comfort and develops a healthier sense of self. Problematically though, many individuals do not experience home as such, and as a result may instead feel despair, failure and terror. Yet, despite not experiencing home in the universal way, we all still have a sense of home as an archetypal image. Because a \"sense\" is mentally constructed, and somatically felt, the researcher began to consider the value of an individual accepting \"my body as my home, or my home as my body\". The researcher's intention is to explore how an individual can create a home within the body, specifically within clinical dance/movement therapy. Application potentially applies to several clinical populations such as survivors of body trauma (ie: sexual and physical abuse), those with chronic pain, former eating disorders patients, people who self-mutilate or enact self-harm, recovering drug addicts and alcoholics, the homeless, foster care children, soldiers, and those who have been displaced or are in transition due to job loss. Three adult participants, artists in their own rights, engaged in artistic inquiry through improvisational processes in movement, and in their own respective art modalities, to explore the research question, \"what is your subjective meaning of the metaphor 'body is home'?\". Three themes were crystallized as the final results, and are synthesized into this new definition of \"body as home\": a socio-culturally constructed concept of self, dynamically developed, in an intersubjective process, that supports a holistic and authentic habitation in the body. The significance of these final results, is summarized into four key implications. First, exploring \"body as home\" within a dance/movement therapy clinical context could be an opportunity to construct a healthy attachment relationship due to the inter-personal themes that emerged, and the theory that the mother is a child's initial home. Secondly, the results highlight a potential gap in the definition of \"embodiment\" with regards to inhabiting body with a range of presence and authenticity. Third, they demonstrate that exploration of the metaphor \"body as home\" can directly affect one's body-image. And lastly, the clinical application of \"body as home\" could encourage development of a healthier body-image and more authentic, comfortable embodiment of self in relationship to others and environment.",

Belief in religion which is a source of morality and spirituality which is considered as part of a tradition that has never been abandoned by Indonesian society with situations and conditions of high spiritual values makes Indonesian people's belief in God and spirits that live around humans or those that smell mystical or black magic not uncommon in every region with their respective cultural characteristics, for example human rights violations in Banyumas Regency, namely the massacre allegedly carried out by black magic perpetrators with 250 victims. With this belief, it is not uncommon for people in some areas to have or even have the ability to see supernatural things or study black magic, for their own interests. So the question arises as a problem identification, namely 1. How are efforts to prove the crime of black magic according to Law Number 1 of 2023 concerning the Criminal Code? 2. How can the elements of black magic be called a criminal act based on Law Number 1 of 2023 concerning the Criminal Code? The research method used by the author is the normative legal approach method. The normative legal approach is a legal research conducted by examining library materials or secondary data as a basis for research by tracing laws and regulations and literature related to the problems studied by the author.",

      "title": "Reality and Representation: The Problem",
      "abstract": "Reality is different, for each and every of us. Different is the manner in which we understand reality and also our personal representation of it. For some people reality is represented, simply, in everyday' s life, but for others the representation of reality is transformed into art or literature. Thinking somehow beyond Derrida' s own words, all of us can say is nothing outside reality. But also true is the fact that we live in the same world, and still we see different realities. Reality can be understood in way that links to views or parts of them. Reality represents the totality of all things, structures (actual and conceptual), events (past and present) and phenomena, whether observable or not.Reality is not (only) philosophical term. Certain ideas from physics, sociology, literary or art criticism, and other fields shape various theories of reality, but following philosophy we can attach importance to this term and we can also deconstruct it. One such belief is that there simply and literally is no reality beyond the perceptions or beliefs we each have about reality itself. More than that, owing to representation, people know and understand the and reality through the act of naming it. Signs are manipulated in order to make sense of the world. Thus, representation of reality has been associated with aesthetics (art) and semiotics (signs).By this special issue dedicated to Reality and Representation, International Journal on Humanistic Ideology tries to present different approaches of the same reality, philosophically speaking. The present issue brings together articles signed by reputed professors and researchers from Romania, United States, India and United Kingdom and covers different panels, from logic, cognitive science and semantics; recent history and its meaning or art interpretations to specific case analysis (Jewish Sapiential Literature or Indian Museums and their relevance for the representation of reality).The issue opens with Gardenforsy Conceptual Spaces and Affective Representations by Dana Sugu and Amita Chatterjee, from Jadavpur University, Calcutta, an article in which they try to examine an emotion episode from its elicitation to the differentiation into affective processes.It continues with Real World Semantics, very important article by Professor Ionel Narita, from University of Timicoara. The article speaks about the world as contradictory term, because, as we all know, is only world, the real one. In this case, as the author says, it follows that the possible semantics must be replaced with real semantics.The third article of this issue is written by Gregory Jones-Katz, from University of Wisconsin, and is entitled Rethinking Deconstruction in America. It is very well documented analysis of the centrality of the concept of history in Jacques Derrida' s and Paul de Man's works and also speaks about how reception of deconstruction was shaped in the United States.Petronia Petrar, from Babec-Bolyai University Cluj-Napoca, proposes us an analysis Towards Typology of Spatial Representations. The paper is concerned with a tentative categorisation of the various modes of representing space that have shaped and continue to shape modern identity. Both symbolic and allegorical space are described and so is the allegory of nostalgia, in order to show that one major difference between symbolic and allegorical spaces seems therefore to lie in their relationship with 'nature' . …",

We not only feel angry if we frown but also feel sad if we sit in a slumped posture or talk in a slow, low voice; loving if we exchange mutual gaze with another, touch, or exchange confidences; and afraid if we escape a potential threat. Many of these studies involved manipulations that are unlikely to have provided opportunities for experimenter bias. None have been directed at the “necessity” question, and indeed in most cases many other sorts of cues are normally available, so we would not expect postures, gaze, and so on to be necessary. Finally, none of this research looked at real-world situations, although it seems very plausible that in real life, gazing leads to loving; depressed postures lead to sadness; and expressions of anger lead to more, not less, anger.",

      "title": "What’s behind the curtain? Visual priming by draped objects",
      "abstract": "Perhaps the most foundational assumption in perception research is that our experience of the world goes beyond the light reaching our eyes. This principle is familiar from visual illusions, perceptual constancies, and amodal completion — as when we perceive the continuity of an object behind an occluding surface. What is the limit to such phenomena? In particular, could we ever experience objects that are occluded completely? In fact, we frequently do: When a cloth or other fabric is draped over an object, we can often appreciate which properties the draped object might have, even when no part of the object is directly visible (Yildirim et al., 2016) — e.g., when a car is placed under a weather-protective covering, or when a child wears a bedsheet to dress up as a ghost. What is the nature of this experience? Do we only infer such hidden properties through thought and reflection? Or might we see such properties as part of automatic visual processing? Here, we investigate this latter possibility using visual priming. On each trial, one of two volumetric shapes (e.g., a cube or sphere) appeared suddenly, and subjects indicated which shape was shown. Crucially, each shape was preceded by a brief ‘cue’: A rendering of one of the shapes with a cloth draped over it. There were thus two types of trials: congruent-cued and incongruent-cued. Even though this cue was completely invalid and task-irrelevant, it facilitated subjects’ responses: They were faster to report the identity of the displayed shape when its draped cue was congruent vs. when it was incongruent. We suggest that the mind automatically represents objects even when they reflect no light whatsoever onto our eyes, such that visual processing computes the properties of completely occluded objects.",

      "abstract": "The term trace evidence refers to a very broad category of physical evidence. The trace\nevidence category covers a larger variety of physical evidence types than any other division [1-3]. A discussion of the attributes of physical evidence that make it trace evidence\nwill follow in a later section of this chapter. Anything or any material can be physical evidence. This term has both a legal and a scientiﬁc meaning. In the legal context it refers to\ntangible objects that are brought into court and formally entered into evidence as exhibits\n(or productions). Obviously, such objects need not be entered into evidence in a legal proceeding to constitute physical evidence from the scientiﬁc point of view. Any objects and\nmaterials from a crime scene (or suspect, victim, etc.) that may shed light on an investigation are physical evidence from the scientiﬁc perspective. They become physical evidence\nas soon as they are recognised as having possible signiﬁcance. The process of evidence\nrecognition is more complex and challenging than is generally appreciated. It requires considerable scientiﬁc knowledge and skill as well as experience. Evidence recognition, both\nat the crime scene and in the laboratory, needs to receive more attention from scientists in\ncooperation with non-scientist investigators.",

      "title": "Making Meaning of Flashbacks: A Proposed Intervention",
      "abstract": "Flashbacks are a not-uncommon, disturbing sequela of trauma, and they often function as a deterrent to addressing and ameliorating other effects of the trauma itself, especially if those effects have been life-changing. Flashbacks are involuntary, sudden, and powerful memories of trauma that are experienced as “reliving” in current time. Following trauma, they usually begin as nightmares, often during hypnogogic or hypnopompic sleep intervals. They then begin to occur during ordinary wakefulness in the course of ordinary routines and activities of living. They contain vivid segments of memories of the trauma, and they can be so disruptive that they can seriously interfere with living in the here-and-now, present reality (van der Kolk and van der Hart 1995).As frightening as flashbacks often are, one could speculate that their persistence may be due to their “intent” to push the person toward dealing with “unfinished business,” and to understand more deeply the trauma involved so that it can be fully processed and integrated into the person's life narrative. When this occurs, flashbacks may be stored in the brain much like all other memories are stored, and they can be retrieved intentionally like all other memories for use when wanted or needed.There are now a number of approaches that are designed to ameliorate flashbacks, especially those involving energy techniques, such as thought field therapy, perturbation, Eye Movement Desensitization Reprocessing (EMDR), and so forth (Weinstock 2010). If energy techniques are used, I lean toward the recommendation that they not be used in isolation but as an integral part of therapy that is based on relational, mutually reflective attunement (Roos 2012). I am suggesting for consideration, however, a method that can be integrated into ongoing therapeutic processes. If it is found not to be helpful in beneficially modifying the “fall-out” of trauma as represented by flashbacks, it appears that there is little if any risk of harm. However, a caveat is appropriate. This proposal regarding flashbacks is based on only two cases; given my limited experience, the proposal is fundamentally in its infancy (and may even be premature). Nevertheless, I present it for consideration.Similar to the naturalistic manner in which Francine Shapiro (1989) discovered and developed EMDR, I “stumbled upon” meaning making of flashbacks in the course of grappling with trauma sequelae following the death of my three-year-old daughter, Karen, many years ago. Karen was profoundly impaired, and I had been told by her physicians when she was only six months old that she would “not make it” more than a year. Despite many complications, including grand mal seizures that were resistant to treatment, she had lived contentedly, and sometimes happily, longer than had been predicted; I had quite mistakenly assumed she could survive throughout a normal and customary life span. That she went into seizure activity and never stabilized was a severe shock of seismic proportions. Most circumstances surrounding her death were disturbing too. I made it through the immediate aftermath as if in a fog. My sleep was highly disturbed and soon included startling flashbacks that then began to appear during waking hours as well. Nevertheless, I was able to work and to function well in my everyday life. My colleagues at work knew nothing about Karen or my loss.My sleep patterns eventually normalized, and I no longer suffered from “nightmares.” I did, however, experience flashbacks that were severely problematic. These flashbacks were replays of two scenes: (a) the instant that Karen's eyes changed, obviously indicating she was dead; and (b) her placement in the big hearse. These flashbacks were overwhelming, and I was—then and now—unaware of triggers. The flashbacks were unavoidable and often seriously affected my coping abilities. Mundane activities (e.g., driving to work) became fraught with dread. Even several years following Karen's death, I continued to be assaulted by these flashbacks. Based on non-thought as much as anything else, I confronted the flashbacks from a position of determination to “be in charge” of my consciousness. My internal dialogue was consonant with this intent. I addressed each of the two flashbacks individually. Addressing the scene of Karen's eyes changing, I asked the flashback depicting the event, “What are you trying to tell me that I don't already know? What do you mean to me?” Explaining how I deduced the forthcoming response is maximally complex; I did, however, deduce rather quickly that I was being shown the “point of no return.” She was, in fact, dead, and I could well understand how I needed to know that. Further, I could know that she was irretrievably dead, and that I could continue to love her.The scene of Karen's placement in the hearse was more difficult for me than the “eyes” flashback. “What does seeing this scene over and over again indicate to me? What is the meaning of this scene?” I voluntarily recalled the scene at this point and saw a barely distinguishable lump in an adult burgundy body bag being placed in the hearse. The inside lighting of the hearse made the margins of everything soft. She looked so small, and I felt so very sad. I wanted her to be bigger, to have weight and presence. That's it! “She's insignificant.” I know, without wanting to know, that her life and her death are insignificant, that she matters only to me. The world cannot know her and cannot know she even existed. This idea is essentially untenable. But I have the meaning now of the flashback. Its “insignificance.”I did not expect actual, quantifiable change to occur and was in no way expecting to pair my meaning making of the flashbacks with actual results of any kind. Yet, I have not experienced a single flashback since that time of reckoning. I do have the impression that I confront existential issues with much more ease than in my past, and that I can evaluate almost anything that I know exists without undue anxiety. It is okay to know that what is, is.A few years ago a woman was referred to me for therapy by her physician who expressed concern about her anxiety, as well as worry that her lupus was worsening. I learned during her intake session that her 21-year-old daughter Heather, a newly graduated police academy officer in a small, local police department, had been severely injured while in the front passenger seat as her field training officer drove the patrol car. They were in pursuit. At an intersection a car appeared, and to avoid colliding with it the training officer had swerved. The car hit a utility pole on Heather's side, and she was thrown to the floor as the right side of the car was crushed where the cage had been installed. Heather was petite, and she had twisted completely out of the seat belt. Her training officer had very minor injuries. Heather had been crushed and had sustained multiple fractures and abrasions. She was taken directly to a hospital where only a few repairs could be done due to her critical condition. She was in a coma. It was determined that there were three possible outcomes, none acceptable: (1) awakening with profound brain damage, (2) slipping into a vegetative coma, and (3) dying. Her parents and younger brother were with her around the clock. Each understood that Heather could never be well. My client became increasingly anxious, knowing daily that there was no possible desirable outcome. She ruminated on Heather's outcome options most of the time. She described this time of waiting as “endless” and “feeling like years!”Heather died following three weeks of coma. Her family members were all in extreme distress. Useable body parts were donated. A police funeral was held, and Heather's mother described it as being “just what Heather would have wanted.” Heather's parents participated in ceremonies commemorating fallen police officers in Austin, Texas, and in Washington, DC. Her room was left as is, including two boxes that had been packed in anticipation of Heather's moving into her own apartment. My client slowly gave up her pattern of visiting Heather's grave site every day, and she reported feeling increasingly at peace with the loss of Heather. Heather's training officer attended one of her therapy sessions, in which he and my client were able to relinquish resentments and feelings of remorse. The training officer subsequently decided to leave police work entirely. There was slow, yet observable, progress in my client's grieving process. At some point shortly after the inclusion of the training officer, and following fifteen months of therapy, my client and I discussed termination. She decided that “it was time.”Six months following termination, Heather's mother made an appointment with me. When seen, she reported several positive events in the aftermath of Heather's death, including meeting some of the people who had received Heather's organs. Measurable gains had been made by all surviving family members. She was now asking for help in extinguishing (or somehow dealing with) her flashbacks of Heather's funeral ceremony. She was wanting to return to the church where the funeral was held in order to see old friends whom she missed and now needed. Each time she had intended to do this, she would be in a positive anticipatory mood as she drove to the church; at her first glimpse of the church, she would be accosted by a flashback of the long salute made by police officers at each end of Heather's coffin. She would begin to sob, realizing she could not go on, and then she would return home feeling greatly defeated and confused by her apparent dyscontrol.As we explored and discussed this impasse, she remembered “going blank” during the actual funeral service when the long salute took place. She had found it to be unbearable. “It was just so very long. I thought it would never end. It felt like years!” At the moment the salute ended, the coffin had been closed. I quietly stated: “The point of no return.” She nodded in agreement with this assessment and again described the long salute as “taking forever.” I asked if Heather's coma seemed in some ways like the long salute; that is, “Whatever the outcome, the result is all wrong and unacceptable.” She instantly stated: “That's it!” I stated I was wondering if somehow the long salute and Heather's coma were identical in marking the point of no return. She tearfully agreed.We decided that she would plan to attend the church the following Sunday. If there was a recurrence of the flashback, we would meet again and continue our work together. She would report in during the following week to let me know how things had gone for her. She did this, reporting that she had been able to make it to the church, that she had seen old friends who had missed her, and that she had been pleased in every way with the results of her efforts. The flashback did not occur. To my knowledge, she has had no recurrence of the flashback.Should psychotherapists be interested in including meaning making of flashbacks in their work with clients who have unresolved trauma that has interrupted the personal narrative, I recommend it for those clients who, in the aftermath of traumatic loss, are experiencing triggers and flashbacks, yet are generally functioning adaptively and productively. To be considered are factors such as timing of interventions following trauma, resilience, various kinds of support, and other attendant issues.",

No other animal passes so large a portion of its existence in a state of absolute helplessness, or falls in old age into such protracted and lamentable imbecility. To no other warm-blooded animal has nature denied that indispensable covering without which the vicissitudes of a temperate and the rigours of a cold climate are equally insupportable; and to scarcely any has she been so sparing in external weapons, whether for attack or defence. Destitute alike of speed to avoid and of arms to repel the aggressions of his voracious foes; tenderly susceptible of atmospheric influences; and unfitted for the coarse aliments which the earth affords spontaneously during at least two thirds of the year, even in temperate climates, — man, if abandoned to mere instinct, would be of all creatures the most destitute and miserable.",

      "abstract": "A T present, an issue of great interest is the correspondence between information reflected in and conveyed by the human face and the person's concurrent emotional experience.There are several recent studies reporting findings that facial signs and expressions can provide insights into the analysis and classification of emotional states [27], [28].Many research works have been developed which are related to recognizing the actions of human.Human actions can be recognized in the form of skeleton [31], silhouettes, bio-metric gait [26] and in the form of images [17].Visual surveillance technique is used for identifying packages of human actions [13].Researchers used different techniques to recognize human actions such as hierarchical probabilistic approach [1], multi-modality representation of joints [18], [15].Already long ago Darwin argued that facial expressions are universal, i.e. most emotions are expressed in the same way on the human face regardless of race or culture [5], [11].According to Darwin, facial expression can influence the course of communication with another person when we express our emotions, opinions, as well as our intentions in an efficient way.In addition, in his studies of human behavior he explicitly states that such expressions also provide information about the cognitive state of a person.This includes conditions such as boredom, stress, confusion and others.Darwin's work is remarkable because at the time when he lived he had already assumed that emotional expressions are multimodal patterns of behavior, and thus established his own detailed descriptions of the manifestations of more than 40 emotional states [14].Although face expressions doesn't necessarily express emotions (e.g. the physiological character of the face after stroke), when preforming face detection (if we are talking about the intelligent systems research area), most of the authors of professional publications refer to the classification of facial features that was introduced by Ekman.This is because unlike other emotions (in his period Darwin identified more than 40 expressions), they are easily and unambiguously identifiable.Classification model of 6 emotions by Ekman [6]:1. happiness,",

The concept of communication by itself starts from our existence as human beings, because if we sit back and analyse a little the idea of communication, we wouldn’t be able to interact with other people without it, in other words our existence on the earth would be useless. As I mentioned before, by any form of communication, verbal or non-verbal, we can share multiple emotions, feelings, desires, at the same time we can learn new things. Communication helps us, as human beings, evolve, develop our expertise in various areas, and it is&nbsp; an important factor when it comes to becoming successful and professional productivity. Leadership is the complex process through which a skilled person manages to convince more employees to accomplish certain goals, tasks or missions, with the common interest of developing the organization or firm.",

Euthanasia methods are classified as physical techniques, chemical agents or inhaled gases. Exsaguination is an acceptable method of euthanasia in most species only if done in an unconscious or anesthetized animal. In order to avoid artifacts caused by autolysis, a necropsy should be done immediately after the animal has died. If it is necessary to collect synovial fluid at the time of necropsy for examining cellular or biochemical components, it should be done first so as not to contaminate the skin with intestinal contents etc. Wherever possible, serologic monitoring should be combined with necropsy of sentinel animals and examination for ecto- and endoparasites. Ideally, one should try to get needed cultures before the necropsy begins to prevent contamination of the skin lesion or before opening any internal organs.",

Such disordered mental phenomena were explained as immoralities, as eccentricities, or as the result of defective-education and training. From the time of the great physician of Cos, instances have been cited reversing these opinions. Not, however, until school over-pressure became a burning question was the subject regarded as a topic of general medical interest. The psychological state of the normal child even is much misunderstood. Meynert, with exceeding fullness and subtlety, thus outlines the evolution of psychological processes in the child: Kussmaul has shrewdly indicated certain perceptions and movements common to the fetus in utero, which feeds itself, as it were, by swallowing amniotic fluid.

      "abstract": "Whether conceptually or experientially atmospheres are hazy. Atmospheric situations often emerge without us being able to control or fully apprehend the conditions of their emergence. Atmospheres affect us not at the cognitive level but through embodiment - through the sensory capacities of our bodies and subsequent registers of affect. We feel atmospheres. Dance improvisers also feel what emerges in an improvisation, whether as the adrenalizing effect of the audience’s presence or because the dancer is immersed in their own movement (as the affect of interest). But dance improvisation is a situation in which atmospheres (and their affective impacts) emerge in unpredictable ways. Becoming attuned to ‘what is going on’ is an aspect of improvisational skill but improvised performance is also an exposure to ‘not knowing’ – not knowing what will happen (or how it will change), not knowing what motivated the movement. This exposure to ‘forces of not knowing’ is similar to many atmospheric situations in everyday life which we negotiate according to personal habits and personal levels of discernment. This performative paper picks up on Gernot Bőhme’s concept of a “new aesthetics” such that hazy atmospheres, and the uncertainty of where they come from, can be claimed as part of an aesthetic encounter. It also reflects on the act of breathing as a potential interface between aesthetic and scientific definitions of ‘atmosphere’.",

      "title": "21st Century, Religius Century from Wasatiyah to Muwazanah",
      "abstract": "The 21st century is a religious century. Religion contains faith, resignation, oneness, and knowledge. Humans must believe, surrender, oneness of God, and be knowledgeable. The characteristics of faith include honesty (shidiq), amanah, tabligh, and intelligence (fathanah), while human characteristics include lust, the world, and shaitan. If the characteristics of humanity return to the characteristics of faith, it means that they have surrendered. If human beings worship God in a place to disperse Him, it means that he has been troubled, and that is unity. If humans have been in that place (where they are in a position), then they have known God, and that is knowledge. If everything has been done, it means that the human will be saved. So, why humans must be religious (faith, surrender, oneness, and knowledge) is due to saving themselves.\r\nHuman safety in the 21st century must be accompanied by the advancement of science and technology as a modern feature. Science and technology do not always move in a positive direction, sometimes leading to negative ones. Science and technology are often faced with basic questions about the path that must be taken and science and technology cannot answer it. The question is around the issue of science and technology control in order to continue to support human safety. The question of the human self must lead to the morality, meaning, and purpose of his life rooted in religion. Therefore, must present an ethical direction mechanism for the higher goals of human life\r\nReligion and modernity bring people to the future, and that future is salvation. Religion emphasizes the salvation of the world and the hereafter, while modesty promises the salvation of the world. If sees world life in preparation for entering the afterlife, modernity must not make people forget to build a better world. The fascination with the salvation of the world alone carries the risk of forgetting the purpose of life in the world and the hereafter. Thus, must be an effective guide to justify modernity.\r\nBack to religion in the 21st century which is supported by the advancement of science and technology (often called the digital era) requires a new paradigm in and knowledge. The paradigm appears in the form of revival of religions, both positive such as increasingly good and piety (al-bir and al-takwa), moral majority in the United States, and Terikyo in Japan and negative ones such as bad and hostility (al-itsm and al-'udwan). The rise of also means a change in ideas and actions (‘amal) from inwardlooking-wasatiyah outwarlooking-muwazanah. In essence, inwardlooking-wasatiyah is still considered important, but must be balanced positively with outwardlooking-muwazanah which is more promising and enhances the dignity of religious communities in the 21st century.",

      "abstract": "D Summerfield (March 2006 JRSM1) reports that the epidemiology of depression is difficult as emotion is understood differently in Eastern and Western cultures.\r\n\r\nEmotion is a word that presents difficulty for us all. The Concise Oxford Dictionary records the word emotion as originating in the 16th century replacing the older word passion and that it is from the French emouvoir, to excite.\r\n\r\nThe taxonomy of emotions presents many difficulties; in 1872 Darwin2 wrote only of emotional expression in man and animals. Shand in 18693 noted that sentiments were groups of emotions dependant on the environment. If one loved a person and something good happened to them, one was happy; if something adverse occurred, sadness resulted.\r\n\r\nA further refinement was suggested by McDougall,4 who in 1905 stated that moods were a tendency to primary emotion, e.g. rage or fear. Much was written in the 20th century about the lmbic system and emotion. Attempts were also made to divide emotions into primary, blended and derived—the latter are not shared with animals as they are constructed by cognitive functions.\r\n\r\nA current view has been expressed by Carpenter,5 who suggests that there are two basic emotions in man and animal—arousal and withdrawal. Arousal is associated with'fight or flight' and the sympathetic system: withdrawal is associated with a range of depressive states.\r\n\r\nIt seems that human behaviour, as with other sciences, needs its own specific—a subject discussed by C P Snow (The Two Cultures.

If wonder is the experience of God as the inexplicable and therefore mysterious power of things to exist, how does that happen? Obviously, we don’t “see,” “hear,” or “touch” God in the ordinary sense of those words. What then? How do we perceive him? What are we encountering in wonder? And when it does happen, are we experiencing a reality or a mere figment of human imagination, a construct of the human need and desire for meaning projected on a mute and meaningless nature? These questions presuppose several basic beliefs and attitudes toward life-in other words hermeneutical assumptions that we have inherited from the Enlightenment, for the most part unquestioned assumptions that deeply characterize our modern culture.",

In this article, we summarize RFH and then turn to its potential application to material culture. If RFH can partially explain which sorts of religious rituals will be religiously frequent, central, and high in sensory pageantry, then it may also probabilistically predict the sorts of materials used in these rituals.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Animacy is an important framework through which humans view and categorize the world, but many objects do not easily fit within this scale. Plants are unique because they are very familiar to humans, yet the features and traits relevant for placement within the animacy scale are generally poorly understood by the public. Animacy occurs at three levels, with the inherent attributes of the object (biology), how they are perceived (cognition), and how they are expressed in languages (linguistics). Animacy is dependent on qualification and perception as alive, mobile, and intentional. In the absence of visible movement, classification is dependent on featural attributes indicating mobility or placement in a group recognized as animate (animalness). Plants have complicated bodies whose forms and structures are frequently clear representations of their life history and function (plantness), more than many animals, yet these signs of movement and activity are rarely recognized. The animacy scale may be more closely based on human similarity (humanness) with humans as the peak of life, mobility, and intentionality. As humans, we can have an anthropocentric viewpoint, rendering plants as scenery or utility, or use anthropomorphic interaction to better understand and recognize the dynamic lives of plants. The goal of this review is to compare the current evidence on the placement of plants within animacy and adjacent scales with the biology and habit of land plants, to better understand human perception and behaviour, and work with this process to educate and inform people about the complex lives of plants.",

      "abstract": "There are ongoing philosophical, moral, and societal debates about experiments on live animals. Along with a consequentialist approach, it may be considered that an action – here an experiment on live animals – is morally acceptable if the knowledge it aims to produce can result in an overall benefit. In other words, it is acceptable if the constraints imposed on the animals involved are outweighed by the larger benefits expected for others (humans or animals). Alternatively, it can be argued that, because animals are sentient beings, they have a right not to be used by others. There may also be points of view in between, considering that animal experimentation is acceptable on the condition that no alternative ways to gain the relevant knowledge are possible and animal suffering is limited as much as possible. What is considered as an important knowledge that justifies experimentation may differ as it refers to individual values. It is not the intention of this chapter to hold a moral debate about animal experimentation (for reviews, see for instance [1], [2]). Rather, we take a pragmatic approach that we hope will guide experimenters in their decision to undertake an experiment (or not), after having made explicit all arguments for or against that experiment.",

Whereas traits tend to be stable, long term, and somewhat predictable in their manifestations, states tend to be unstable, often short term, and frequently unpredictable in the ways they manifest themselves. This article introduces the concept of state-giftedness. Because state-giftedness is not easily identifiable, everyone needs to be taught how to respond to the unexpected and unpredictable situations that will be consequential for their and others’ lives.
