      "abstract": "Malingering, also called shamming illness or goldbricking, is the false and fraudulent simulation or exaggeration of physical or mental disease or defect, performed in order to obtain money or drugs or to evade duty or criminal responsibility, or for other reasons that may be readily understood by an objective observer from the individual's circumstances, rather than from learning the individual's psychology. Malingering is seen in apparently normal children, students, test subjects, spouses, and adults. It is not a mental disorder. Malingering may coexist with the antisocial personality disorder, with various factitious disorders, such as the Ganser Syndrome and the Munchausen Syndrome, with the hysterias and with traumatic neuroses and other mental disorders. A review of definitions and a medicolegal discussion are presented. Malingering is an act, which is distinguished from a legal or mental status. Failure to distinguish act from status accounts for the wide disparities in definitions of malingering.",

Emotional abuse is being threatened, terrorized, severely rejected, isolated, ignored, or verbally attacked. Physical abuse is any form of violence against one’s body, such as being hit, kicked, restrained, or deprived of food or water. Sexual abuse is being forced, threatened, or deceived into sexual activities ranging from looking or touching to intercourse or rape.",

Psychological factors are decisive, and they usually include a major anxiety generated by intrapsychic conflicts, which are converted by unconscious defense mechanism into symptoms. The symptoms are not intentionally provoked or simulated nor are explained by organic suffering or substance consumption. They affect the quality of life of the person who presents significant deficits such as motor, sensory, convulsive or mixed. It may also occur a lack of coordination, ataxia, paralysis, tremor, aphonia, difficulties at swallowing, loss of sensitivity, anesthesia that does not follow anatomical nervous trajectories, blindness or mental deafness. Consciousness is not altered, but a condition of \"la belle indifference\" appears which is rather associated with histrionic personality disorders and what the patients imagine about their own illness or suffering. This condition is unstable and changing. The primary gain is the expression of an unconscious psychological conflict through a somatic symptom by reducing anxiety and keeping conflict out of consciousness. The secondary gain is external and includes attention and care from caregivers or others.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Illness behavior refers to the ways in which symptoms are perceived, understood, acted upon, and communicated and include facial grimacing, holding or supporting the affected body part, limping, using a cane, and stooping while walking. Illness behavior can be unconscious or conscious: In the former, the person is unaware of the mental processes and content that are significant in determining behavior; conscious illness behavior may be voluntary and conscious (the two are not necessarily associated). The first broad category of inappropriate illness behavior is defensiveness, which is characterized by denial or minimization of symptoms. The second category includes somatoform disorders, factitious disorders, and malingering and is characterized by exaggerating, fabricating, or denying symptoms; minimizing capabilities or positive traits; or misattributing actual deficits to a false cause. Evaluators can detect the presence of inappropriate illness behaviors based on evidence of consistency in the history or examination; the likelihood that the reported symptoms make medical sense and fit a reasonable disease pattern; understanding of the patient's current situation, personal and social history, and emotional predispositions; emotional reactions to symptoms; evaluation of nonphysiological findings; results obtained using standardized test instruments; and tests of dissimulation, such as symptom validity testing. Unsupported and insupportable conclusions regarding inappropriate illness behavior represent substandard practice in view of the importance of these conclusions for the assessment of impairment or disability.",

      "abstract": "The sense of personal identity is an element of the Jasperian definition of self-conscience. Each of us is convinced of being a unique and stable individual, different from other individuals. These properties - stability ad coherence - belong to an image of ourselves that was proposed to us by the Other's look during the mirror phase. Brain focal lesions may threaten this certitude in two ways: 1) brain lesions result in deficiency, disability or handicap, which are experienced as a narcissistic injury. The patient questions himself about the image he offers to the Other's look, and, as a result, his sense of personal identity is unsettled; 2) a variety of focal brain lesions or dysfunctions may alter the activity of areas which are necessary for maintaining a stable image of the patients' body or self. This may lead patients to experience depersonalisation, autoscopy, somatoparaphrenic \"delusions\" or disturbed agency. The sense of personal identity may be disturbed during brief paroxystic or psychologically traumatic phenomena. However, this is not observed in chronic sequelae of brain lesions (e.g. right hemisphere syndrome or amnesic syndrome), even though the patients may present a broken up image of themselves.",

      "abstract": "SUMMARY A stigma is a mark of infamy or disgrace. People who are stigmatised are subject to abuse and social exclusion. Negative attitudes towards people with mental illness are attributed to stigma. In the literature, stigma is regarded as something that is attached to a person ‐ like a badge or label. This is undermined by two facts. Firstly, it is the person who is regarded as disgraceful, not the illness or diagnosis, and secondly, the diagnosis of mental illness is itself evaluative. Mental illness is by definition bad, so to be diagnosed as mentally ill is to be defined as bad (or somehow wrong). The stigmatisation of the mentally ill will not stop until this negative evaluation is removed from diagnosis.",

      "title": "Elementary concepts of medicine: VII. Course of illness: manifestations, complications, outcome",
      "abstract": "Once the illness-defining somatic anomaly has come into being, the course of illness begins. The course is characterized, in its patient-relevant respects, by sickness manifestations (if any) and consequences of the illness (if any), of the illness-defining somatic anomaly. The course of the illness-defining anomaly per se, divorced from its manifestations and consequences, is not relevant to the affected person. A manifestation of an illness is something that, to one extent or another, reflects the presence of the illness-defining anomaly and, on this basis, is indicative of the anomaly's presence. It thus is an available fact simultaneous with the illness at issue – a positive finding of this kind, possibly a report (objective) of a symptom (subjective) or an inherently objective sign gleaned from physical examination or a laboratory test. Any such fact may be at variance with the corresponding truth, which may be difficult to define even. A manifestational fact, however accurate, is not inherently an effect of the somatic anomaly involved in the illness concept; different from effect, it may not be even of the form of a change but merely of a state of being. Even more notably, a patient-relevant manifestation, already present or potentially developing in the future, is integral to the very concept of illness, and it therefore is not really a consequence of illness, causally or otherwise. A consequence of an illness we take to be something wholly extrinsic to the illness. Consequences of illness in this meaning obviously fall into the principal categories of medical (i.e. somatic) and extramedical. Medical consequences we take to be of three generic types: complication, sequela and fatality. Under complication in our medical dictionaries, we find the following definitions: '(1) a disease or diseases concurrent with another disease; (2) the occurrence of two or more diseases in the same patient' (Dorland 1994); and 'morbid process or event occurring during a disease that is not an essential part of the disease, although it may result from it or from independent causes' (Stedman 1995). Although these definitions are surprising to us, they do accord with our idea (above) that a complication of an illness, different from its manifestations, is extrinsic to this illness, and more specifically also another illness, they do not identify complication as inherently a consequence of the illness. As for our proposition that a complication of an illness is a consequence of this illness, a couple of paradigmatic examples may serve to substantiate it. Peptic ulcer and peritonitis are two mutually distinct illnesses. When, and only when, the latter occurs as a consequence of the former, it is referred to as a complication of the former. Similarly, when, and only when, pulmonary embolism results from (occurs as a consequence of) deep-vein thrombosis, it is seen as a complication of the latter. In the meaning of consequence of an illness, thus, complication actually, and more specifically, is another illness caused by the illness at issue. It thus is another illness for which the original illness was aetiogenetic (aetiologic). As for the first example, it should be understood that perforated ulcer is but a stage in the course of ulcer and not another illness, and that it thus is not a complication of ulcer. Similarly, detachment of a segment of deep-vein thrombus is but an event in the course of that thrombosis and not a complication of it. Our medical dictionaries define the essence of sequela as: 'any lesion or affection following or caused by an attack of disease' (Dorland 1994); 'a condition following as a consequence of a disease' (Stedman 1995). Immunity resulting from an infectious disease satisfies the latter definition, but it is not thought of as a sequela of the disease. From the medical vantage, a sequela is not something desirable, nor even an innocent lesion; it is a somatic anomaly other than that which is definitional to the original illness, and it is one that already is, or in the future potentially will be, manifest in sickness. Thus, the medically relevant concept of sequela, like that of complication, has illness as its proximate genus. And further, while a distinction indeed is to be made between sequela and complication, a sequela of an illness is not caused by the illness at issue; it is a non-causal consequence of it. Thus, it is another illness for which the first illness was pathogenetic (rather than aetiogenetic; cf. complication above). This concept of sequela gains clarity when the nature of its non-causal connection to its parent illness is understood to represent a type of outcome of the original illness – just as any illness other than injury is the outcome of its pathogenesis. Stroke is an acute (i.e. non-chronic) disease, and a common outcome of it (of its completed course) is survival with a residual anomaly (chronic defect) in the tissues where the disease process took place. If this residual, post-stroke anomaly is manifest in sickness (say, paralysis), the anomaly represents patent sequela; if sickness is but a potential manifestation in the future, it represents latent sequela; and otherwise the outcome is survival with mere non-illness, non-sequela, innocent anomaly as a residue of it, the outcome now being complete recovery (to effective normalcy, with no material consequences as for outcome). It needs to be understood that just as perforated ulcer is not a causal consequence but merely a stage in the course of peptic ulcer, a sequela of stroke is not a causal consequence but, again, merely the anomaly stage that follows the completion of the course of the somatic process of stroke. Status post mortem is a sequela of life without being caused by life, nor is the transitional event death caused by life. For a sequela, the antecedent, original illness indeed represents pathogenesis (which is a merely descriptive concept) rather than aetiogenesis (which is a causal concept). Beyond sequela and complete recovery, the remaining principal type of outcome of illness, and equally a genuine potential consequence of illness, is of course fatality, death resulting from that illness. (When death results from some other, unrelated cause during the illness at issue, the course of this illness is thereby interrupted and its outcome does not materialize at all.) Different from sequela but akin to complication, the illness is causal to its fatal outcome, although only in the sense that it made death occur earlier than it otherwise would have occurred; but as it is not another illness, it therefore is not a complication. And because the fatal outcome is only the transitional event between living with the illness and being dead from it, and thus not a residual anomaly in vivo, at issue is a type of outcome different in form from that of sequela also. It deserves note that an illness commonly is not the direct, immediate cause of its fatal outcome. Instead, the immediate cause commonly is a complication of the illness to which the death is ascribed – or it is a complication of a complication, possibly many causal steps removed from the illness. Moreover, causation of death from a given illness can be mediated by its sequelae just the same. The illness that is designated as the cause thus commonly is merely a mediate, an underlying cause of the death. As we think of the course of illness in terms of its potential sickness manifestations and the potential medical consequences (complications, sequelae and fatality), we thereby exclude quality-of-life implications of sickness. A meteorologist is concerned with meteorological manifestations and consequences of whatever meteorological situation, but not with its agricultural (or farmers' happiness) implications, for example. A farmer's expert horizon on implications of weather is confined to those in the domain of farming, and the same applies to the implications of farming activities: issues of food production are within the farmer's expertise, effects of food consumption on people's health and happiness are not. Medically, the consequences of illness are medical (i.e. somatic). Health-related quality of life thus is a concern beyond the scope of medicine (Miettinen 2001).",

It is common for denial to appear first, attributing what has happened to external factors. There is also a tendency for the patient to deny the chronic nature of the disorder, refusing the possibility that another episode may occur. The onset of the disease can often be accompanied by a marked sense of loss, experienced both by the person receiving the diagnosis and by his or her relatives: the loss of the healthy self together with an increase in the feeling of vulnerability, real losses as a consequence of the episodes (work is impaired, social difficulties arise, ruptures occur, family are affected, financial problems ensue, etc.) or perceived loss, sometimes erroneously, of expectations about the person him- or herself or about the future.",

Rather, a myriad of possible medical disorders and/or physical factors, alone or in combination, are capable of producing delirium. The three cardinal signs and symptoms of delirium are: clouding of consciousness, impaired attention, and altered states of arousal (hyperarousal or hypo-arousal). Secondary features of delirium include: global impairment of cognition; disturbances of speech articulation (not of language); hallucinations and illusions; fluctuating affect; psychotic symptoms, such as delusions, illusions, hallucinations, and paranoid ideation; and disturbances in the sleep/wake cycle.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Malingering, also called shamming illness or goldbricking, is the false and fraudulent simulation or exaggeration of physical or mental disease or defect, performed in order to obtain money or drugs or to evade duty or criminal responsibility, or for other reasons that may be readily understood by an objective observer from the individual's circumstances, rather than from learning the individual's psychology. Malingering is seen in apparently normal children, students, test subjects, spouses, and adults. It is not a mental disorder. Malingering may coexist with the antisocial personality disorder, with various factitious disorders, such as the Ganser Syndrome and the Munchausen Syndrome, with the hysterias and with traumatic neuroses and other mental disorders. A review of definitions and a medicolegal discussion are presented. Malingering is an act, which is distinguished from a legal or mental status. Failure to distinguish act from status accounts for the wide disparities in definitions of malingering.",

In spite of the implicitly wrong conception of reality, the significance of these delusions as an attempt to express, interpret and cope with mental illness should not be neglected if an approach to the patient's own experience is sought. On the one hand, hypochondriacal delusions are based on altered body perceptions in mental illness, characterized by primary local or general dysaesthesias to the point of depersonalisation, or caused secondarily by the patient's increased attention to his own body. This alienated bodily experience is named in (lay) medical terms by the delusional hypochondriac. On the other hand, \"illness\" with its manifold cultural and psychological meanings stands as a polyvalent metaphor for the incomprehensible alteration of the patient's self-experience in general: thus, the feeling of exposure to external attacks, of guilt, sinfulness, shame, loss of self-esteem or even the experience of a disruption of personality may find their expression in the hypochondriacal delusion.",

      "title": "MALINGERING OF ORGANIC ILLNESS OR MENTAL DISORDER",
      "abstract": "of “simulation” covers dissimulation or deception, as well as faking, but the type of simulation we are concerned with here is normally defined as malingering, which refers to the conscious and deliberate invention of a physical or mental disorder, or the attribution of an existing incapacity to an accident or illness which was not actually its cause, in order to derive some personal benefit. The DSM-IV defines malingering as “the intentional feigning or exaggeration of physical or psychological symptoms, motivated by external incentives such as avoidance of work or military service, receipt of financial compensation, evasion of criminal prosecution, or procurement of prescription drugs. Under certain circumstances, malingering may constitute adaptive behaviour: for example, feigning illness while in captivity as a prisoner of war” (American Psychiatric Association, 1995, p. 698). The concept is considered more closely by Resnick (1997), who distinguishes between pure malingering, simulation of a non-existent disorder; partial malingering, the conscious exaggeration of present symptoms or of a now-cured disorder; and false imputation, the erroneous attribution of real symptoms to a particular cause, due to non-deliberate self-deceit or a wrong interpretation of the situation. Gorman (1982) also distinguished between the act and the state of malingering, insofar as the act implies wilfulness, an assertive attitude of desire and purpose, while the state, from a legal point of view, would be inherent to the person, due to their social condition or possible limitations. On the other hand, the question arises as to whether malingering can, in itself, be the reflection of some mental disorder. This is fairly clearly the case in the so-called factitious disorder (American Psychiatric Association, 1994), in which the person intentionally feigns physical or psychological symptoms, with the aim of taking on the sick role, or in histrionic personality disorder, due to lack of control over one’s manipulative behaviour; however, the conscious exaggeration of physical or mental complaints in order to achieve a financial, professional or similar objective may also be a neurotic behaviour, since nobody “in their right mind” would normally go to such extremes, nor choose such tortuous and painful routes, in the pursuit of potential benefits. Nevertheless, the law does not make such distinctions, and considers certain behaviours to involve clear intention on the part of the person carrying them out (Gorman, 1982). The incidence of malingering after an accident is not well known, being estimated at between 1% and 50% of cases (Henderson, 1986; Miller & Catlidge, 1972), depending on whether the source of information is the claimant’s lawyer or the insurance company. An influential factor here concerns the financial and employment conditions, since it has been observed that such malingering increases when redundancies are immiMALINGERING OF ORGANIC ILLNESS OR MENTAL DISORDER",

In our work we have come to view feelings as indicators of general intrapsychic adaptation. On this basis, \"giving-up\" indicates not only an unpleasant feeling but includes a loss of self-esteem, a disruption in object relationships, a decrease in motivation, and an expectation that such a state may be enduring.

      "title": "Pseudobulbar affect masquerading as psychosis: Managing a case of diagnostic dilemma",
      "abstract": "Dear Editor, Pseudo-bulbar affect (PBA) is a clinical condition characterized by uncontrollable emotional outbursts, incongruent with the person's emotional state and often out of keeping with the situational context. It manifests mostly as uncontrollable laughter or crying in inappropriate situations.[1] PBA is also referred to as Emotional incontinence, Pathological Laughter and Crying (PLC), and Involuntary Emotional Expression Disorder (IEED).[2] PBA is most commonly seen occurring in the background of neurological disorders like in post-stroke period, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease or traumatic brain injury.[3-5] However, it can also be seen without any apparent neurological disorders.[5] Historically PBA has been an under-recognized and under-treated condition, which brings in significant distress, stigma and shame for the person suffering from the condition.[6] Along with the social stigma of inappropriate laughing or crying, it often carries with it the burden of being tagged with mental illness.[7] The newer and probably less stigmatizing term IEED can provide some respite to those with the condition as an acknowledgement of their suffering. This case report presents a patient with PBA without any neurological comorbidities who improved significantly with fluoxetine and dextromethorphan. A 59-year-old, widowed female, coming from an urban background, presented with episodes of uncontrollable laughter spells in inappropriate situations for the past 1.5 years. She also reported occasional mild slurring and difficulty deglutition for the same duration. These laughter spells would occur every 2-3 days, occurring for 5-15 minutes. These would be typically incongruent to the context. For example, occurring while in inappropriate social situations like in a funeral house. These incidents would make her extremely embarrassed and she had to leave the situation altogether as she could not control her laughing. Her family members too would scold her for doing so, apparently a willful act as per them, and would ask her if she has gone mad. She would feel sad over these incidents and tell her family members that she was not doing this willfully and it was not under her control. These episodes were accompanied by on-and-off difficulty in deglutition, mild slurring of speech and a subjective sense of hypersalivation. These symptoms would aggravate prolonged speaking or chewing. All these incidents would occur with intact awareness and responsiveness. Sleep onset insomnia was present. There was no history of associated low or elevated mood, anhedonia, disproportionate physical fatigue, somatic preoccupation or dissociative episodes. Past psychiatric history revealed nothing significant. She was not known to be diabetic, hypertensive, hypothyroid or obese. There was no history of head injury, seizures or stroke either. She had never taken any substance of abuse. She was taken to psychiatrists as her family members thought she might be having some psychiatric illness. She was suspected to have psychosis, unspecified and was given trials of quetiapine up to 100 mg and later olanzapine up to 25 mg. Both these treatments improved her sleep only but no improvement was observed in the uncontrollable laughter episodes. On presentation, she was neither sad nor overtly cheerful, though expressed her worry and guilt about the inappropriate laughter episodes and social disgrace. No other thought or perceptual abnormality was noted. She had good insight into her symptoms. On neurological examination, speech was normal, jaw jerk and palmomental reflex were absent. Blood sugar, thyroid panel, lipids and electrolytes came out to be normal. We admitted her for diagnostic evaluation. Neurology and otorhinolaryngology consultation-liaison were sought. MRI Brain was suggested by neurology which came out to be normal. Based on the clinical presentation, examination and investigation findings we considered a diagnosis of Pseudo-bulbar affect of unknown etiology. Due to the unavailability of a Dextromethorphan/quinidine combination, we started her on Dextromethorphan 20 mg and Fluoxetine 40 mg. She tolerated the treatment without any side-effects. Over the next couple of days, she did not report much improvement and was discharged on the same treatment. She adhered to treatment and on follow-up visit one month later, she reported significant improvement in laughter spells, which occurred only once during that period. She had started attending social gatherings again without any issues. From the second follow up Dextromethorphan was gradually tapered and stopped; Fluoxetine has been continued. She is maintaining well on current treatment. We are regularly following her up in liaison with the Neurology team as over due course of time some underlying neurological cause may become evident. PBA is a disorder which is poorly recognized, variably characterized, and causes significant distress and dysfunction for patients and their families. Patients are often ascribed mental illnesses like schizophrenia or mania in many of these cases of PBA leading to unnecessary treatment.[8] Further, the drug side effect burden adds to the misery of the patients. Our patient had consulted several psychiatrists, who treated her with antipsychotics without much improvement in her symptoms. We could not find any underlying neurological condition despite a neurological workup but she responded well with treatment with SSRI and Dextromethorphan. The neurobiology of PBA is still unclear; most likely to be of multifactorial causation. Disruption of the cortico-limbic-subcortico-thalamic-pontocerebellar network, which is involved in the regulation and expression of emotion, has been hypothesized.[9] In many cases, no neurological association is found even after a thorough workup. A patient-rated instrument, Center for Neurologic Study-Lability Scale (CNS-LS) is used commonly to rate the severity of PBA.[10] It is validated for use in patients suffering from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and multiple sclerosis (MS).[11] The Pathological Laughing and Crying Scale (PLACS) is another patient-rated instrument validated to rate the severity of PBA in post-stroke patients.[12] PBA is a clinical diagnosis. While these scales are not used to diagnose PBA, these are used to rate the severity and improvement with treatment. Treatment with SSRI and Dextromethorphan/quinidine has shown promising results in cases of PBA.[13,14] Our case emphasizes the need to have clinical suspicion in such cases presenting with unexplained mood outbursts before categorizing them as specific psychiatric illnesses. Detailed neurological evaluation needs to be undertaken in such cases. Timely recognition of PBA is essential for an effective treatment.

This emotional disease is determined by the psychological stress caused in the persons suffering a disease and in his/her relatives. To that disease, often a social disease is added. This last disease is driven by one becoming stigmatized, and at times a self-stigmatic process in the patient himself/herself, which tends to isolate a patient in his/her closest surroundings and to make him/her a recluse inside his/her house which leads to a suspension of social relationships.",

      "abstract": "Similar to the adult patient, a child or adolescent may actively feign or produce artificial symptoms (synonymous: Munchausen syndrome). The more frequent case is that the child suffers from being an object of symptom fabrication induced by a close person caring for the child, regularly the mother (Munchausen syndrome by proxy). This review focuses on psychopathological aspects of the clinically more relevant factitious disorder by proxy. Typical behaviour and personality characteristics are presented that can be taken as clinical warning signs. Doctor-mother-interaction is affectively challenging due to conflicting tasks imposed on the physician. Complementary to pediatric exclusion of genuine disease, psychopathological assessment is required to exclude other sources of deviant illness behaviour. Factious disorder shares particular features (active violation of the child, false report of history, aggravated symptom presentation and increased doctor-hopping, difficulties in conforming maternal report in biomedical data) with other psychopathological entities (child abuse, simulation, dissociative disorders, somatoform disorders including hypochondria, variants of maternal overprotection and infantilization, psychosis or delusion in the mother). Criteria for differentiation are presented. Three concepts on the psychopathological etiology of factitious disorder by proxy are relevant: In some cases, it may be conceived as secondary manifestation of a primary psychopathological entity or personality disorder. Learning theory emphasises operant rewards received from vicarious sick role. Attachment theory provides possible explanations concerning the traumatic impact on the child, early sources of psychopathology in the fabricating mother and risks for intergenerational transmission of factitious disorders.",

The primary disorders listed in DSM-5 include disruptive mood dysregulation disorder, major depressive disorder, persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia), premenstrual dysphoric disorder, substance/medication-induced depressive disorder, depressive disorder due to another medical condition, other specified depressive disorder, and unspecified depressive disorder. The various aspects of the disorder are presented, with a case application that highlights diagnostic assessment, treatment planning, and evidence-based treatment strategy. When the mental health practitioner is completing the diagnostic assessment of an individual who suffers from a mood disorder, depression is a common symptom that overlaps symptomatology with many other disorders.",

This ‘extra’ which complements the infantilism of hysteria, are determined by the following constellation of factors: (1) an immature, underdeveloped, emotional personality with a feeble identity; (2) due to the relatively great need for warding off emotional influences, the personality is more vulnerable to emotional stress; (3) a predisposition to deficient repression, leading to insufficient mental defence; (4) an auxiliary auto-regulation in the form of states of lowered consciousness and convulsions or fits, to keep the overwhelming emotional influences outside his awareness. Freud elucidated the dynamic relationships in an impressive way; he described all that can be called neurotic in hysteria. But we know that hysteria encompasses more than various types of neurosis, and can also manifest itself in psychotic and psychopathic-like patterns of behaviour.",

The classical characteristics of psychosis are impaired reality testing, hallucinations, delusions, and illusions. While factitious disorder and malingering are usually acknowledged as contrived psychiatric conditions for acquisition of interior or exterior profits, respectively, another alternative, also, exists that though is not manufactured individually, is enforced peripherally. Such cases, which are usually referred by the judge’s ruling, for evaluation and treatment, are more important than comparable simulated or genuine mental conditions, because incorrect diagnosis, or careless, cagily, and guarded validation of preliminary diagnosis that has been issued in the authorized or emergency department, can seriously endanger the individual’s civil rights, while it should not be overlooked that incorrect diagnosis is a kind of malpractice that may harm an individual awfully. In the present article the clinical picture of the said situation, in addition to some case histories, and recommendable hints for differential diagnosis between different types of psychoses, has been discussed.",

The decline cannot only affect emotional abilities, but must also interfere with work or social activities. The deficits should not be accompanied by an impairment of arousal (delirium) or be accounted for by another psychiatric condition, such as depression or schizophrenia.

      "abstract": "The disorders under consideration are the result of identifiable conditions. Historically, an arbitrary distinction has been made between \"organic\" conditions, associated with a presumably clear pathological basis, and \"functional\" conditions, or psychiatric disorders that lacked obvious disease processes. Delirium, however, is a disorder of cognitive dysfunction that lacks a well-understood pathophysiology despite unequivocal association with multiple and various medical conditions. More generally, delirium and dementia are frequently complicated by psychopathology (for example, delusions or changes in mood) traditionally associated with so-called functional disorders (schizophrenia and affective disorders, respectively). The organic/functional distinction obscured the propensity of medical conditions (e.g., thyroid dysfunction) to present with psychiatric symptoms that resolved after effective treatment of the nonpsychiatric condition. The nosological conventions of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR) (1) allow recognition of syndromes of disseminated cognitive dysfunction, such as delirium and dementia, as well as the psychopathology that is the product of various and multiple medical conditions without obscuring the need to consider these entities in the differential diagnosis of \"functional\" symptomatology. Regardless of the evolution of diagnostic convention, the illnesses described in this chapter can present to the psychiatrist as a \"mental\" condition or present to other medical specialists as \"medical\" conditions.",

      "abstract": "The author, largely from a clinical standpoint, discusses the various ideas of negation. He points out that ideas of negation, systematic or asystematic, are very slow in appearing, and represent generally a phase of evolution of the psychoses or a secondary mental process. Their appearance coincides with the mental decadence due to chronicity or associated with senility. Certain congenital cases do not come under this class, and there is also a group in which there seems to be a “negative disposition” of the individual. From a clinical study one of the following factors is necessary to the production of these ideas: (1) a state of mental weakness produced either by an intoxication or by some other cause acting acutely, or (2) a state of acute, subacute, or chronic pathological pain, or (3) an originally degenerative condition.",

      "title": "What is the place for placebo in the management of psychogenic disease?",
      "abstract": "‘Placebo’ was used to describe fake substances or rituals used by medieval physicians to ‘please’, or assuage discomfort, in patients for whom no cure was available. This placatory perception of placebos led many to regard them as obsolete, permissible only as a comparator agent in clinical trials. Yet, placebo use by healthcare workers is relatively common,1 mainly to distinguish between organic and functional disease, identify malingerers, establish the psychological origin of a condition (to both physician and patient alike) and placate patients who insist on potentially harmful measures when the physician believes that no treatment is indicated.2\r\n\r\nPsychogenic disorders are somatic complaints for which there is no apparent physiologic cause.3 Features consistent with psychogenic conditions include: (1) presence of associated psychiatric disorders; (2) lack of concern (la belle indifference) or an exaggerated emotional response; (3) disease manifesting only when observed, and not when alone or thought to be unobserved; (4) bizarre or inconsistent signs; (5) presence of emotional or situational triggers; (6) multiple inexplicable physical symptoms; (7) failure to respond to therapy; (8) presence of a medical background; and (9) disease is triggered or ameliorated by placebo.4,5\r\n\r\nManagement of psychogenic disorders is difficult, as these patients often have an underlying organic disease.4 Prognosis for functional recovery is generally poor, and successful management requires a multi-disciplinary approach featuring the psychiatrist in a pivotal role. Empathy and a nonjudgemental manner should be used, and it is often helpful to invoke a neurobiological explanation of the symptoms in order to foster trust, acceptance, understanding and recovery.6\r\n\r\nShould placebos be used in managing psychogenic disease? In its favour are the potential salutary effects and absence of side effects, coupled with the low success rate of psychotherapy and potential adverse effects of psychopharmacotherapy. On the other hand, many are uncomfortable with the ethics of administering an inert substance purporting to be ‘active’, on the basis that it smacks of deception.\r\n\r\nPlacebos have opposing roles in clinical and research settings. A meta-analysis concluded that giving placebo equals ‘no treatment’;7 but there is physiologic evidence demonstrating the power of the placebo effect, which refers to perceived health benefits from prescription of medically inert substances.7 Studies in depressed patients have demonstrated similar metabolic responses to placebo and fluoxetine,7 just as positron emission tomographic (PET) studies in parkinsonian patients have shown robust dopamine release in response to placebo.7 It can be seen how the placebo effect can confound in clinical trials. In fact, the perceived benefits from sham surgery in surgical trials in osteoarthritis8 and surgery for Parkinson's disease,9 have resulted in the move to include a sham surgery control arm in surgical trials.9\r\n\r\nThus, in clinical practice, the physician prescribes a placebo in the hope that it will produce a therapeutic effect: such an effect is anathema to research. Ethicists have coined the term, ‘knowledge framing’, to describe desirable treatment effects arising from proper presentation of information to patients during the clinical encounter, distinct from the placebo (unwanted) effect in clinical trials.10\r\n\r\nWhilst debate rages about whether it is permissible to harness the placebo effect to treat psychogenic disease, few would condone placebo use to treat organic diseases for which appropriate therapy is available. Purists maintain that any practice involving deceit of patients is inappropriate, and that they must be informed of the inert nature of the placebo when it is administered.7 Unfortunately, complete disclosure is liable to decrease the utility of the placebo as treatment or diagnostic test (in which placebo is administered to trigger or halt psychogenic disease). Disallowing use of placebo because it is considered to be unethical would remove from the physician's armamentarium an important tool to diagnose and potentially treat psychogenic disease. As a result, such patients would be susceptible to the adverse effects of medications which would otherwise prove unnecessary.\r\n\r\nOne of the criticisms levied against placebo therapy is that it reflects a paternalistic attitude—that of an omniscient doctor who is the best judge of what is right for the patient, making decisions for the patient without need for patient consultation or agreement. It is feared that an erroneous judgement on the part of the physician would lead to his withholding appropriate treatment for the patient who is adjudged psychogenic or less serious.7 This scenario is, unfortunately, not as far fetched as one would hope. Disorders such as cervical dystonia and writer's cramp, now accepted as organic diseases, were once thought to be hysterical in origin.4\r\n\r\nWith the development of the field of medical ethics, we have evolved from the principles of paternalism and beneficence to embracing respect for patient autonomy, i.e. the right or freedom of individuals to make decisions on their own behalf.11 As doctors, we must be mindful of the dictum, primum non nocere, and strive to do right for our patients. Several questions remain: is the patient afflicted with psychogenic disease compos mentis? If not, can a relative or guardian make the decision to proceed with the placebo test or placebo therapy? It is likely that, however beneficent the intent, it can be argued that knowingly deceiving a patient by declaring placebo to be an active drug is an unethical act. It would be far better, perhaps, to practise knowledge framing and provide a neurobiological explanation, describing the placebo as a harmless agent, whose administration is meant to bring about improvement in the disorder.\r\n\r\nTo summarize, there is a place for placebo therapy, as long as: its use is transparent and the patient's autonomy and right-to-know is respected; it builds on and respects the patient-doctor relationship; it tolerates and even encourages the patient's right-to-choice, whilst developing an appropriate therapeutic concept for the patient; and it is engendered by care and concern for the patient.7 Thus, we would submit that the placebo is useful as a diagnostic test to distinguish between psychogenic and organic disease. Upon exclusion of organic pathology and confirmation of diagnosis, a trial of placebo therapy may avoid the need for harmful psychopharmacotherapy, though it may instead be used as an adjunct to psychiatric counselling and drug treatment. Of course, we would not recommend the placebo as standard therapy for all psychogenic disease, but would argue for acceptance of its place in the physician's pharmacopoeia.",

      "title": "Dissociative Disorders",
      "abstract": "Commonly encountered in people with a variety of psychiatric diagnoses (and in many people without a diagnosis), dissociative symptoms can affect consciousness, memory, identity, emotion, perception, body representation, and behavior. Dissociative experiences are common, affecting perhaps half the population at some point. Although they are common, symptoms can be vaguely experienced and poorly recalled, so they are often overlooked by clinicians. Many or most dissociative episodes are fleeting or do not cause significant distress or dysfunction, and therefore do not warrant a specific DSM-5 diagnosis. Nevertheless, identification of dissociative experiences can help make sense of sometimes-confusing symptoms. DSM-5 describes three specific dissociative disorders—dissociative identity disorder, dissociative amnesia, and depersonalization/derealization disorder—as well as two more general categories of dissociative disorder—other specified and unspecified. All are frequently associated with physical, emotional, and/or sexual trauma and abuse, and it is not at random that the DSM-5 chapter on dissociative disorders is located immediately after the chapter that focuses on trauma- and stressor-related disorders. Dissociative identity disorder (DID) refers to the presence of two or more distinct personality states. Formerly known as \"multiple personality disorder,\" DID involves a discontinuity in the sense of self and the sense of agency, perception, cognition, and/or sensory-motor functioning. DID also involves memory gaps that transcend ordinary forgetting. Some cultural groups may view DID as \"possession\" by spiritual beings external to the person, but the disturbance should not be diagnosed as pathological if it conforms to broadly accepted cultural or religious practices. Furthermore, DID is generally not applicable to children who have imaginary playmates or who are otherwise engaging in normal imaginative play. As is often the case with all dissociative disorders, people with DID tend to present with other psychiatric issues, including depression, anxiety, substance abuse, self-injury, posttraumatic stress disorder, and non-epileptic seizures. Patients may conceal or not be aware of memory gaps and other discontinuities, which further complicates the psychiatric evaluation. In contrast to DID, which involves organization of different personalities via dissociative processes, other dissociative diagnoses are perhaps more common and less controversial. Dissociative amnesia involves an inability to recall important autobiographical information that is generally related to a specific stressor or trauma. It can be associated with nonepileptic seizures or other functional neurological symptoms (e.g., DSM-5-TR functional neurological symptom disorder [conversion disorder]). DSM-5 removed dissociative fugue as a separate disorder and included it as a specifier for dissociative amnesia. Fugue states are notable for the inability to recall important autobiographical memories (e.g., personal identity) and can include wandering away from home while maintaining an ability to function adequately. A detached and unreal sense of oneself (depersonalization) or the outside world (derealization) is relatively common, with a reported lifetime population prevalence of 50%. To meet criteria for depersonalization/derealization disorder, however, the symptoms must be persistent (generally lasting at least 1 month) and/or recurrent. Reality testing should be spared. As with other DSM-5 diagnoses, impairment and/or distress is also required, so occasional \"spacing out\" is not necessarily a disorder. DSM-5 provides a diagnostic option—\"other specified dissociative disorder\"—for presentations that do not meet full criteria for DID, dissociative amnesia, or depersonalization/derealization disorder. For example, the diagnosis \"other specified dissociative disorder (identity disturbance due to prolonged and intense coercive persuasion)\" can be given when an individual has dissociative effects following an intense experience such as brainwashing, long-term political imprisonment, or indoctrination into a cult. Acute dissociative reactions to stressful events can have a variety of dissociative manifestations when viewed cross-sectionally but are notable for their brevity; they can clear within days. If they persist for more than 1 month, the individual likely warrants a different diagnosis (e.g., depersonalization/derealization disorder).",

      "title": "Neglect and Related Disorders",
      "abstract": "Abstract Neglect is the failure to report, respond, or orient to novel or meaningful stimuli presented to the side opposite a brain lesion, when this failure cannot be attributed to either sensory or motor defects (Heilman, 1979). Neglect may be spatial or personal. Spatial neglect may occur in three reference frames: body centered, environmentally centered, and object centered. One may be inattentive to stimuli in space or on the person (attentional or sensory neglect) and one may fail to act in a portion of space, in a spatial direction, or to use a portion of one’s body (intentional or motor neglect). Many specific disorders have been described, distinguished by their presumed underlying mechanisms, the distribution of the abnormal behavior, and the means of eliciting the behavior. Different behavioral manifestations may occur at different times, and in some patients certain manifestations are never seen. The major behavioral manifestations that we will discuss in this chapter include (1) inattention or sensory neglect, (2) extinction to simultaneous stimuli, (3) motor neglect, (4) spatial neglect, (5) personal neglect, (6) allesthesia and allokinesia, and (7) anosognosia (unawareness of illness). The first section of this chapter will define specific disorders and describe clinical tests that may be used to assess them.",

The causes of amputation include trauma, infection, diabetes, vascular disease, cancer and other diseases. The impact of amputation on psychological situation and social and family relationships is undeniable, because physical disability also affects one’s social and mental health, in addition to his/her psychological adaptation and compared to the ordinary people, these people are suffering more from social isolation. Therefore, any limb amputation not only is considered as a physical injury but is also followed by psychological- emotional damages.",

There are two broadly different mechanisms. The most obvious has a psychological or cognitive mechanism. Thus, the illness may provide the life event or chronic difficulty that triggers a depressive episode in a vulnerable Individual. Secondly more specific associations appear to exist between depression and particular physical disorders. These may turn out to be of particular etiological interest. The best examples are probably stroke and cardiovascular disease. Finally major depression, but especially minor depression, dysthymia, and depressive symptoms merge with other manifestations of human distress with which patients present to their doctors, Such somatic presentations test the conventional distinction between physical and mental disorder, and are a perennial source of controversy.",

      "abstract": "The intensity of pain perceived following physiological insult is unique to that individual. Pain, by IASP definition, is a subjective and psychological symptom. Circumstances, personality and psychiatric illness may amplify (and less commonly mute) volunteered pain scores. Most pain is organically initiated and then psychologically contaminated. The psychological and psychiatric factors influencing pain scores will be considered. Patients with a propensity to somatise may elaborate and/or maintain ‘organic’ pain. This occurs ‘unconsciously’ (without awareness). This process deceives the patient (and often also the doctor). Intentional amplification of pain and the construction of pain behaviours for care‐eliciting purpose (factitious disorder) or personal gain (malingering) deceives others. Though there are clinical clues to feigned pains able to be obtained from the history and signs such as those proposed by Waddell, it is notoriously difficult to differentiate partial malingering, conversion or somatoform pain and the pain signature of the particular patient. If the intent of symptom formation and its continuance is psychological, medicine has a diagnostic role. If the intent is for personal greed or is criminal, the diagnosis rests upon legal issues.",

It includes: parts of the body being hurt, not having the usual abilities, medical problems or organ malfunction, microbial infections, health issues, having pain or bad symptoms, unusual body shapes. The study of disease is called pathology. Disease can be described as a medical condition associated with particular symptoms and signs. It can be caused by external factors like pathogens, or caused by internal malfunctions mainly the immune system such as an immunodeficiency, or a hypersensitivity such as allergies and autoimmunity. Diseases are broadly classified to any abnormal condition that causes pain, dysfunction, distress, or death to the person affected with similar problems. It includes injuries, disabilities, disorders, syndromes, infections, isolated symptoms, deviant behaviours, and atypical variations of structure and its function and for others these may be considered as distinguishable categories. Diseases can affect people not only physically and mentally, as living with a disease will alter the affected person's thinking ability. Death caused by disease are often natural. Diseases are categorised into four main types: infectious diseases, deficiency diseases, genetic diseases and physiological diseases. Diseases can be classified as contagious and non-contagious. The fatal diseases in humans are HIV, Coronary Artery Disease, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease and cancer.",

      "abstract": "There is often difficulty differentiating between psychosomatic, somatopsychic, multisystem illness, and different degrees of medical uncertainty. Uncommon, complex, and multisystem diseases are commonly misdiagnosed. Two case histories are described, and relevant terms differentiating psychosomatic, somatopsychic, and multisystem illnesses are identified, reviewed, and discussed. Adequate differentiation requires an understanding of the mind/body connection, which includes knowledge of general medicine, psychiatry, and the systems linking the body and the brain. A psychiatric diagnosis cannot be given solely based upon the absence of physical, laboratory, or pathological findings. Medically unexplained symptoms, somatoform disorder, and compensation neurosis are outdated and/or inaccurate terms. The terms subjective, nonspecific, and vague can be used inaccurately. Conversion disorders, functional disorders, psychogenic illness, factitious disorder imposed upon another (Munchausen’s syndrome by proxy), somatic symptom disorder, psychogenic seizures, psychogenic pain, psychogenic fatigue, and delusional parasitosis can be over-diagnosed. Bodily distress disorder and bodily distress syndrome are scientifically unsupported and inaccurate. Many “all in your head” conditions may be related to the microbiome and the immune system. Better education concerning the interface between medicine and psychiatry and the associated diagnostic nomenclature as well as utilizing clinical judgment and thorough assessment, exercising humility, and maintaining our roots in traditional medicine will help to improve diagnostic accuracy and patient trust.",

These cases suggest that person misidentification in dementia begins with an altered sense of familiarity for a familiar person from a mismatch of new perceptions with past memories.

      "abstract": "The incidence of psychiatric disorders in multiple sclerosis is higher than is generally recognized. The majority of multiple sclerosis patients show emotional instability, denial, personality disintegration and, in the late stages, deterioration. The emotional instability is manifested by irritability, anxiety and depression, as well as euphoria, even to the extent of a manic or depressive psychosis. Denial is manifested by querulousness and projection of frustration and hostility onto other people, or by unrealistic optimism. Personality disintegration is manifested by subjectivity, lability, inappropriateness and poor coordination of emotional reactions with the rest of the personality and the reality of the situation. The organic interruption of subcortical pathways by demyelinization produces variable loss of emotional control and disorganization of the total personality. This threat to personality functioning produces the compensatory psychological defense mechanisms of denial and projection. Emotional instability may precede the onset of neurologic findings, and the final diagnosis may be obscure for months or years. Although emotional stress does not cause multiple sclerosis, it can precipitate exacerbations and have a deleterious effect on the course of the disease. Because there is no definitive treatment, psychotherapy is an important, if not the most important, part of the treatment of multiple sclerosis. Psychiatrists are, therefore, especially qualified to treat patients with multiple sclerosis.",

These same methods may also afford cognitive enhancement in people of otherwise normal cognitive abilities. 'Cosmetic', or supranormal, cognitive enhancement offers opportunities to enrich our social or financial status, our interactions with others, and the common wealth of our community. It is common to focus on the potential benefits of cognitive enhancement, while being less than clear about the possible drawbacks. Here I examine the harms or side-effects associated with a range of cognitive enhancement interventions. I propose a taxonomy of harms in cognitive enhancement, with harms classified as (neuro)biological, ethical, or societal. Biological harms are those that directly affect the person's biological functioning, such as when a drug affects a person's mood or autonomic function. Ethical harms are those that touch on issues such as fairness and cheating, or on erosion of autonomy and coercion. Societal harms are harms that affect whole populations, and which are normally the province of governments, such as the use of enhancement in military contexts. This taxonomy of harms will help to focus the debate around the use and regulation of cognitive enhancement. In particular it will help to clarify the appropriate network of stakeholders who should take an interest in each potential harm, and in minimising the impact of these harms.",

Hypothesized barriers to clinical identification of emotional injury OCD include the atypically pleasant presentation of characteristic affirming compulsions. Patient self-identification is hypothesized to be diminished by the nature of overt and mental compulsions; for instance, agreeing with others and self-criticism. Recommendations are provided for differential diagnoses with social anxiety and codependency, as well as specific contraindications for common psychotherapeutic approaches. Hypothesized comorbid pathology are presented as opportunities for initial identification of cases.

      "abstract": "#### The bottom line\n\nDelusional infestation (previously also known as delusional parasitosis or Ekbom’s syndrome) is a rare disorder, but it commonly poses disproportionate practical problems to healthcare systems.1 It is characterised by a patient’s fixed belief that his or her skin, body, or immediate environment is infested by small, living (or less often inanimate) pathogens despite the lack of any medical evidence for this.1 Delusional infestation is neither a single disease nor a single diagnostic entity. The classic form, primary delusional infestation, develops without any known cause or underling illness and meets criteria for a persistent delusional disorder (ICD-10 (international classification of diseases, 10th revision)) or delusional disorder somatic type (DSM-5 ( Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders , fifth edition)). Approximately 60% of patients, however, have secondary forms of delusional infestation2 that occur in the context of substance misuse (such as cocaine, amphetamines, cannabis), dopaminergic medications, antibiotics, or during physical or psychiatric illnesses (such as delirium, dementia, depression, schizophrenia, stroke, and other medical conditions that affect the brain or cause pruritus).1 2\n\nThe neurobiology of delusional infestation is not fully understood.

      "title": "Fatigue in Healthy and Diseased Individuals",
      "abstract": "Objectives: Although fatigue is experienced by everyone, its definition and classification remains under debate. Methods: A review of the previously published data on fatigue. Results: Fatigue is influenced by age, gender, physical condition, type of food, latency to last meal, mental status, psychological conditions, personality type, life experience, and the health status of an individual. Fatigue may not only be a symptom but also a measurable and quantifiable dimension, also known as fatigability. Additionally, it may be classified as a condition occurring at rest or under exercise or stress, as physiologic reaction or pathologic condition, as spontaneous phenomenon or triggerable state, as resistant or irresistant to preconditioning, training, or attitude, as prominent or collateral experience, and as accessible or inaccessible to any type of treatment or intervention. Fatigue may be the sole symptom of a disease or one among others. It may be also classified as acute or chronic. Quantification of fatigability is achievable by fatigue scores, force measurement, electromyography, or other means. Fatigue and fatigability need to be delineated from conditions such as sleepiness, apathy, exhaustion, exercise intolerance, lack of vigor, weakness, inertia, or tiredness. Among neurological disorders, the prevalence of fatigue is particularly increased in multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Parkinson disease, traumatic brain injury, stroke, and bleeding and also in neuromuscular disorders. Fatigue may be influenced by training, mental preconditioning, or drugs. Conclusions: Fatigue needs to be recognized as an important condition that is not only a symptom but may also be quantified and can be modified by various measures depending on the underlying cause.",

      "abstract": "Psychological traumas may occur during childhood in the form of physical abuse, sexual abuse, emotional abuse, physical neglect, and/or emotional neglect. Trauma may be experienced when a person experiences serious loss or his/her life is under grave threat. If such traumatic event is neither dealt effectively nor resolved completely, it may predispose such a person to development of mental health issues such as drug dependence including alcohol dependence syndrome (ADS). Persons who experience or suffer from childhood psychological trauma tend to consume alcohol in order to cope with their trauma related experiences. Hence, generally, onset of alcohol dependence is preceded by the occurrence of childhood psychological trauma(s). Childhood psychological trauma especially emotional abuse acts as a risk factor for the development of alexithymia in later life among persons with alcohol dependence. Alexithymia is a state of emotional dysregulation, which is characterized by the triad of difficulty in identifying one's own feelings, difficulty in distinguishing between the physical sensation and emotional arousal, and difficulty in explaining one's own feelings to others, which is known as externally oriented style of thinking. Alexithymia is itself a risk factor for the development of ADS. Thus, both childhood psychological trauma(s) and alexithymia play a significant role in the development of ADS. Findings of the present study showed that childhood psychological trauma(s), alexithymia, and ADS are interconnected. The present study findings conclude that significant relationship exists between childhood psychological traumas, alexithymia, and ADS.",

      "abstract": "Aggressiveness is a threatening behavior that results in mental, physical or material harm. It can be directed towards oneself, towards other persons or towards objects / things. Aggression can be expressed physically, verbally or even by neglect. Aggression in individuals depends on various risk factors and factors that influence the dose of aggression and therefore aggressive escalation. As in society and in the population, so do aggressive individuals find themselves in psychiatric wards. There are various psychic conditions that lead to an aggressive act. Schizophrenic patients can act aggressively as well as people who are in an alcohol overdose or people who have been overdosed on opioid substances. Any patient who tries to injure himself, another person, or who tries to cause great material damage shall endeavor to be taken care of by non-punitive or coercive methods. Deescalation procedures based on communication with the patient and using communication skills through which the patient seeks to calm down with words and the atmosphere during communication are cited as non-striking methods. Coercive methods are only used when non-coercive methods have failed. Forcing methods include pharmacological therapy, isolation and physical restraint. Pharmacological therapy involves the appeasement of the patient by administering therapy or medication. Isolation is the process of separating an aggressive patient from other patients from the ward into a specially arranged room where he or she resides until the physician estimates that the patient can return to the room where he or she resides with other patients. Physical restraint is the last phase of coercive methods, it involves the humane physical restraint of the patient with the aim of calming the patient and ceasing to be aggressive. The extremities, head and chest are fixed. The patient is unbound only when the physician determines by psychophysical assessment that the patient no longer needs to be fixed. Education is a very important process in such cases. Educating staff eliminates their possible fear or insecurity and increases the security of all people in the department where aggressive escalation can occur.",

      "title": "Failure to Comply: Madness and/as Testimony",
      "abstract": "Self-harm, suicide attempts, disordered eating, addiction, and other forms of “acting out” are associated with the trauma of surviving violence. While these behaviours are pathologized as symptoms of mental illness, they can be understood, instead, as strategies of resistance against violence. When violence is ignored or normalized, the “acting out” associated with trauma can be a means of sounding an alarm that something is very wrong. This “acting out” can be understood as an embodied form of testimony. When direct resistance to violence, such as fighting back or escaping, is thwarted or impossible, traumatic “acting out” can be a way to draw attention to and resist violence. Psychiatry, instead of answering the call of trauma by addressing the underlying violence, works to silence that call. Through incarceration, sexual violence, enforced isolation, restricted motion, threats, coercive drugging, gaslighting, and other abusive tactics, psychiatry works to undermine the embodied testimony of trauma by producing compliance. The source of the problem is shifted from the original violence and located instead in the body of the traumatized person. Successful treatment is understood as the reduction or elimination of the very “symptoms” which are in reality acts of resistance to violence. Therefore, successful treatment essentially means submission. The carceral space of psychiatry continues the work of producing compliance even after the patient has left its enclosures, extending the space of the psych ward into the everyday lives of psychiatric survivors.",

      "title": "Clinical practice guidelines for the management of dissociative disorders in children and adolescents",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION Dissociative or conversion disorders (International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision [ICD-10]; hereafter referred to as dissociative disorders) are characterized by disruption in the usually integrated functions of consciousness, memory, identity, sensations, and control of body movements. The symptoms of this disorder are not due to substance use and are not limited to pain or sexual symptoms, and the gain is primarily psychological and not monetary or legal. In these disorders, it is presumed that the ability to exercise a conscious and selective control over the symptoms is impaired, to a degree that can vary from day to day or even from hour to hour. However, it must be added that it is usually very difficult to assess the extent to which some of the loss of function might be under voluntary control. The diagnosis is made by the presence of specific clinical features, no evidence of a physical disorder that might explain the symptoms, and evidence for psychological causation in the form of clear association in time with stressful life events and problems or disturbed interpersonal relationships. Dissociative disorder can be of different types, as shown in Table 1.Table 1: International Classification of Disease-10 category of dissociative 10 categories of dissociative (conversion) disordersThese guidelines are an update to previous IPS guidelines on dissociative disorders (2008) in child or adolescent (hereafter child unless specified). These are broad guidelines which will help in systematic assessment and management of a child with dissociative disorder. ASSESSMENT AND DIAGNOSIS The assessment of dissociative disorders involves a detailed psychiatric and developmental history. An assessment should be made of the child's temperament, schooling, and peer relationships. The family functioning should be explored. A comprehensive medical, neurological, and mental status examination should be done. An assessment of psychosocial circumstances and problems should be done, especially to find which ones are temporally associated with the onset of dissociative symptoms. One should obtain psychiatric history from all the possible sources including the teachers, if possible. Furthermore, assessment should be made of the perception of the child and parents about the dissociative symptoms. An attempt should be made regarding the presence of physical and psychological symptoms in the other family members or the neighbors which may act as a model. The key points in the assessment of pediatric dissociative disorders are shown in Table 2.Table 2: Key points in the assessmentRULING-OUT PHYSICAL AND OTHER PSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS As mentioned above, an initial comprehensive medical and neurological assessment is crucial in any child where a possibility of a dissociative disorder is being kept. In this regard, the treating psychiatrist should always consider seeking appropriate consultations. Relevant physical and psychological investigations must be done [Table 3]. An assessment of educational achievement of the child with regard to the child's potential and the level of education provided should be done, which is often indicated. The possibility of dissociative symptoms superimposed on neurological or medical disorders or other psychiatric disorders should always be carefully considered.Table 3: Investigations for ruling out physical or psychiatric disordersIf dissociative symptoms appear for the first time in a preschool child, a strong suspicion of an underlying physical or psychiatric disorder should be kept in mind because dissociative disorders are very rare in this age group. DIAGNOSIS OF DISSOCIATIVE DISORDER SHOULD NOT BE MERELY BASED ON THE ABSENCE OF OBJECTIVE SIGNS OF PHYSICAL DISORDER Although it is very important to exclude an underlying or associated physical disorder, as well as other primary psychiatric disorders that may explain the dissociative symptoms, the diagnosis of dissociative disorder should not be based merely on the absence of objective signs of a physical or psychiatric disorder. It is imperative to remember that the absence of physical findings applies universally to an earliest stage in the development of all diseases. Moreover, physical findings that appear nonrelevant at first may assume significance later. The diagnosis of dissociative disorder is not just of exclusion. The clinician should always keep in mind the overall biopsychosocial context of the child and the symptoms. When the diagnosis of a dissociative disorder is made with too much certainty without proper assessment, other physical or psychiatric disorders are often missed. When the diagnosis is too tentative, multiple and irrational medical evaluations may be conducted, and iatrogenic reinforcement of the symptoms and harm is possible. Pseudoseizures or nonepileptic seizures are a common presentation of dissociative disorders in children which must be differentiated from true epileptic seizures [Table 4].Table 4: Differences between dissociative convulsion and epileptic seizurePSYCHOSOCIAL PROBLEMS OR STRESSORS Psychological distress overt or covert is an essential causative factor for dissociative disorders. A list of common stressors in pediatric dissociation is shown in Table 5. Stressors are not mutually exclusive.Table 5: Psychosocial factorsAttempts should be made to systematically identify the child's psychosocial environment, stressors, and coping abilities to handle stressful life situations. An attempt should also be made to find the secondary gains due to dissociative disorder. A view that stressors are \"unconscious\" creates a barrier in the physician's mind about looking for stressors. Studies in children with dissociative disorders have shown that stressors are generally present in day-to-day life of the patients and are known both to the patient and the family members. However, they may not reveal them for certain reasons. It is important for the clinician to evaluate the child for the stressors from a developmental perspective. It may not be possible to find stressor in the initial interviews. By repeated, careful and sensitive interviewing stressors can be elicited. Stressors in children and adolescents may include day-to-day problems such as difficulty in school or in family relationships, fights with other children, scolding and punishment by the teachers or family members, some frightening experiences, and educational difficulties. The child may find oneself in some kind of unwanted or disliked situation such as marriage, job or studies, bullying, and sometimes abuse and neglect. The stressor could also be an unaddressed physical illness or deformity. Assessing in detail about the onset of symptoms may give clue to the possible stressor, for example, becoming unconscious at school in English period. At times, stressors may not be severe enough to be noticed by the family members of the patient. Moreover, the family members may not be able to correlate the stressor with the onset of dissociative symptoms. In such cases, stressors should be assessed systematically, and the severity and temporal correlation of stressors with the onset of symptoms should be clearly delineated. One may use multiaxial ICD-10 Axis V for systematic assessment of stressors in children. The ICD-10 specifies that there should be convincing associations in time between the onset of symptoms of the disorder and \"stressful (life) events, problems, or needs.\" However, Indian studies point out that stressors are found in only 62%–82% of cases of dissociative disorder. Unless all the diagnostic criteria for the diagnosis of dissociative disorder including temporally related psychosocial stressors are met, a confident diagnosis should not be made. DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS AND COMORBIDITIES Dissociative symptoms could be the presenting symptoms of underlying undetected psychiatric disorders such as separation anxiety disorders, generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, school phobia, depression, and at times, impending psychosis. Then, dissociative disorder may also have comorbid oppositional defiant disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and intellectual disability, especially in boys. Therefore, it is important to screen for all age-appropriate psychiatric disorders in the child to avoid missing an underlying primary or a comorbid diagnosis. Dissociative disorders should be differentiated from factitious disorder and malingering. In latter two situations, the symptoms are intentionally produced to a assume sick role. The gain is psychological in factitious disorder. In factitious disorder by proxy, the parent (s) induce illness in the child for their own psychological gains. In malingering, the symptoms are feigned to obtain an incentive like money or some other material gain or to avoid a disliked responsibility or punishment. Apparent fabrication of symptoms or gross inconsistencies in history should raise possibility of malingering or factitious disorder. FALSE-POSITIVE DIAGNOSIS Rates of misdiagnosis are around 4%. False-positive diagnosis is likely if importance is given only to the symptoms and not to the underlying physical or psychiatric morbidity and psychosocial circumstances. One must assess the case with open mind. One should review the past medical records carefully, and if required, further assessments should be done. Some of the diagnostic difficulties are mentioned in Table 6.Table 6: Physical differential diagnosisIt is also likely that these false-positive diagnoses are made more often in females, psychiatrically disordered children, patients presenting plausible psychogenic explanations for their illnesses, and patients with unusual movement disorders or epilepsy. POSITIVE SIGNS Various \"positive signs\" of dissociative disorders have been described in the literature such as tunnel vision, discrete anesthetic patches, astasia-abasia, positive Hoover's test, preserved cough in hysterical aphonia, and hemianesthesia sharply separated at the midline. These signs indicate normally preserved physiological functions underlying the superficial appearance of incapacity. In addition to the above \"positive signs,\" hysterofrenic areas (areas on body, which when pressed, abort the hysterical episode, usually convulsive in nature) and hysterogenic areas (areas on body, e.g., a hyperesthetic spot, which when pressed can induce a hysterical episode) have also been mentioned. It must be kept in mind that dissociative disorders can be easily misdiagnosed or overdiagnosed if these \"positive signs\" are taken to be pathognomonic of the disorder. Studies indicate that these positive signs can also be seen in neurological patients. Gould et al. looked for the positive signs of hysteria in 30 consecutive neurological admissions (25 of which had acute strokes in adults). These \"signs\" were la belle indifference, nonanatomic sensory loss, midline split of pain or vibratory sensations, changing boundaries for hypoalgesia, giveaway weakness, and history of hypochondriasis. All 30 patients showed at least one out of seven \"signs,\" most exhibited more than one \"signs,\" and one patient had all seven \"signs.\" TREATMENT It is imperative to treat dissociative disorders promptly to prevent habituation and future disability. The longer the symptoms remain, the more aggressive the treatment should be. The treatment usually consists of two parts: (a) early treatment directed toward symptom removal and (b) long-term treatment directed toward the resolution of stressors and prevention of further episodes. Dissociative disorders are seen very less internationally. Therefore, there are no practice guidelines for the management of dissociative disorders. The proposed treatment guidelines are based mainly on Indian work in this area. Table 7 gives the key points of treatment.Table 7: TreatmentPRINCIPLES OF ACUTE MANAGEMENT Rapport and therapeutic alliance The cornerstone of successful therapy is establishment of therapeutic rapport and alliance with the child. It is also very important to have good doctor–parent relationship because the parents have to become an ally in treatment of the child. Parental influences on the child are significant even in the hospital setup. Unless the parents understand the clinician's point of view, it may not be possible to alter their overprotective and overindulgent attitude and behavior toward the child. One should listen to the concerns of the family carefully and try to understand their perception of the child's symptoms. PSYCHOSOCIAL EXPLANATION OF DISSOCIATIVE SYMPTOMS First of all, the diagnostic assessment must be done in an impressive manner, and the parents should be involved in the assessment process. It would be useful to explain to them why a particular assessment is being done and what the results are expected to show. When the results of this diagnostic assessment are obtained, their significance should also be explained to the parents. After reliably ruling out physical or other psychiatric illness as the cause of dissociative symptoms, the child and the family should be strongly assured that there is nothing physically seriously wrong with the child and the symptoms are psychogenic and that the child will make a complete recovery [Table 8]. When physical or psychiatric disorders are ruled out and the possibility of the dissociative symptoms being psychogenic is put forward, it is usually very vehemently rejected by the parents. That there could be anything psychologically wrong with their \"severely ill\" child, their parenting or with their family functioning, is totally unacceptable to the parents. Any suggestion of this possibility is met with resentment, anger, and sometimes open hostility. Therefore, any confrontation about the nature of the symptoms should be avoided at all costs, and all the members of the treating team should adopt the same nonconfrontational, calm approach toward the disorder the child and family. When the treatment team's point of view is understood and accepted by the family, only then it would be possible for them to cooperate in psychosocial assessments.Table 8: Key points in psychoeducationADDRESSING THE PSYCHOSOCIAL PROBLEMS Once the causes are known, then attempts should be made to solve the \"problem.\" The problem should be discussed with the child and the family. In case of adolescents, if the problem has been revealed to doctor or the ward staff in confidence, then consent of the adolescent should be taken to discuss it with the family. The physician should not force his opinion on the child or the family. Problems of family relationships should be discussed, and family should be told that the child is being adversely affected by the family problems and their resolution will improve the child. At times, family therapy may be required. It is also important to open up the channels of communication between the child and his family. Throughout the treatment, attention should be focused on the child and his functioning rather than on the symptoms. This helps in speedy recovery. In most of the patients, reassurance and suggestions of recovery coupled with attention to the patient's psychosocial needs lead to a rapid recovery [Table 9].Table 9: Behavioral management of childrenSYMPTOM SUBSTITUTION As the dissociative symptoms begin to subside, the child may sometimes manifest other new dissociative symptoms in their place. Occasionally, distress may be expressed by deliberate self-harm, demanding, and histrionic behavior or the child may develop depressive symptoms. In such a situation, consistent limit setting may be essential for continuation of psychological treatment. Regularity of follow-up visits is important so that the patient does not need to \"produce\" a symptom to visit the therapist. Finally, the physician should not feel pressurized to cure the child very quickly. He should retain his calm and be prepared to face the hostility and aggression of the family and coercion for not using medication and quickly improving the child. SECONDARY GAINS Reduction in secondary gains is not advisable very early in the treatment and without adequate explanations to the family because of three reasons.First, the physician himself may not be certain about the origin of the symptoms. Second, the family may perceive reduction in secondary gain as neglect of the child. Furthermore, initially, the family may not have full confidence in the physician and the hospital's ability to take total care of their child. Later on, the family should be offered adequate explanations regarding secondary gains. Reduction in secondary gains in a child should be coupled with an alternative, healthy, socially acceptable, and age-appropriate role or activities for the child in which he or she can be trained and rewarded for doing something positive. ABREACTION AND AVERSION THERAPY Aversion therapy for unwanted behavior has often been employed in resistant cases, for example, using liquor ammonia, aversive faradic stimulation, pressure over trochlear notch, tragus of ear or over the sternum, and closing the nose and mouth. Aversion therapy for unwanted behavior is not advised as it may harm the patient and has a pejorative connotation equivalent to punishment. It may provide only temporary benefits, if any. Abreaction is bringing to conscious awareness, thoughts, affects, and memories for the first time, with or without the use of drugs. This may be achieved by hypnosis, free association, or drugs. Abreaction may further foster dissociative states. Moreover, some patients treated with this technique may perceive the therapist as sanctioning the dissociative states; hence, it is not recommended. MEDICATION Medication may be used only for concomitant anxiety, depression, or behavioral problems and not for the dissociative symptoms. The family should be tactfully made to understand that medications are neither required nor approved for dissociative symptoms. Otherwise, the family may perceive that doctor is unable to diagnose the child's problem and treat it. The use of medication will unnecessary expose the child to the side effects. In addition, the family may not give enough attention to psychological treatment thinking that medication will cure the dissociative symptoms. However, at times, there are families who persistently demand medication despite repeated explanations. In such situations, one may consider using a placebo to retain the child in treatment and overcome resentment or hostility of the family. NEED FOR HOSPITALIZATION Hospitalization is required when there is doubt in the diagnosis, severe symptoms are present, the family is very distressed, or the symptoms are recalcitrant and resistant to outpatient treatment. DUAL DIAGNOSIS If the dissociative symptoms are present with the physical disorder, then the physical disorder should be treated first. When the physical disorder is stabilized, then the dissociative symptoms if still present should be managed as per the guidelines. TREATMENT OF CHRONIC DISSOCIATIVE DISORDER Chronic cases are more difficult to treat, and the management should always begin with a rational comprehensive evaluation and clear explanation to the child and the family about the findings. Psychoeducation of the family about the nature of the disorder and its course and outcome is necessary. Similar things should also be explained to the child taking into account his ability to understand and accept the information. The family should be explained that although the symptoms are real and impairing, a serious physical disorder is not causing them and there is hope of full recovery. Psychotherapy may be useful but contraindicated in a patient who is resistant to it or gets worse when it is initiated. COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY Family-focused cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) helps the affected child to become aware of, examine, and if appropriate revise the way they think, respond, and behave rationally to their symptoms. The aim of CBT is to maximize functioning and reduce the dissociative symptoms. Gradually, onus of treatment should be shifted from the physician to the child and the family. The following are the principles of CBT in chronic dissociative states: Give positive explanations for symptoms Persuade the child that change is possible, he or she is not \"damaged,\" and they do have the potential to recover Discuss the treatment rationale with the patient and the key family members Encourage engagement in daily routine activities Teach relaxation and distraction away from unpleasant thoughts and the symptoms Encourage the patient to rationally reconsider unhelpful and negative thoughts Negotiate a phased return to work and studies Joint activities with family in symptom-free periods. Evidence exists at systematic review level that CBT is effective for a wide range of functional somatic symptoms. Its use has also been described (although not properly tested) in patients with nonepileptic attacks, dissociative motor symptoms, and severe and multiple functional symptoms.

      "abstract": "Abstract The issue of what constitutes a child or adolescent mental health problem is difficult to determine. Concepts of health and illness are influenced by, among other things, physical, psychological, and social processes, and are dynamic and subject to change. Mental health problems arise from diverse sets of circumstances and from widely varying contexts. Often a problem can be detected through changes in a child’s emotional state (increasing anxiety or distress) or through changes in behaviour towards other people or property. Features of a problem that facilitate the assessment and understanding of what is happening include the intensity and seriousness of the problem, its frequency of occurrence, its duration over time, and its effects on the child and those close to the child. When mental health problems become severe, persistent, or associated with other problems, they may be referred to as a ‘disorder’. A mental disorder is, therefore, a mental health problem that has become severe or persistent, and seriously disrupts normal functioning.",

      "abstract": "Catatonia is a syndrome of primarily psychomotor disturbances associated with typical abnormalities of muscle tone. It is characterized by the co-occurrence of several symptoms of decreased, increased, or abnormal psychomotor activity. Catatonia is a neuropsychiatric syndrome, not an independent nosological entity. Historically associated mainly with schizophrenia (e.g., catatonic subtype), ICD-11, similarly to DSM-5, now recognizes catatonia under a separate classification category, apart from psychotic disorders. In addition to schizophrenia and other primary psychotic disorders, it can occur in the context of other mental disorders, such as mood disorders, or neurodevelopmental disorders, especially autism spectrum disorder. Catatonia can also develop during or immediately after intoxication or withdrawal from psychoactive substances, including phencyclidine, cannabis, hallucinogens such as mescaline or LSD, cocaine and MDMA or related drugs, or during the use of some psychoactive and non-psychoactive medications (e.g. antipsychotic medications, benzodiazepines, steroids, disulfiram, ciprofloxacin). Moreover, catatonia can occur as a direct pathophysiological consequence of various nonpsychiatric medical conditions, e.g., diabetic ketoacidosis, hypercalcemia, hepatic encephalopathy, homocystinuria, neoplasms head trauma, cerebrovascular disease, or encephalitis. Due to the fact that catatonia was mostly associated witch schizophrenia, many cases were not diagnosed and thus did not receive indicated treatment. There are no specific “anti-catatonic” drugs, first-line treatment are benzodiazepines and ECT, in addition to the symptomatic and supportive therapy. The recognition of catatonia as an independent category in ICD-11 can improve medical care for catatonic patients in clinical practice. Disclosure No significant relationships.",

In its human dimension, illness represents a double existential breakdown, severing links with environment and body that typify a healthy man's existence. This breakdown gives rise to a certain number of painful feelings, mainly of anxiety in acute illness, mainly depressive in chronic illnes, in which the collapse of self-esteem and the compromised self-image appear to be definitive.

      "title": "Emotional deficiency and psychopathy",
      "abstract": "Aside from an antisocial life-style, the concept of psychopathy is based on character features which can be described in terms of specific patterns of interpersonal, behavioral, and, in particular, affective characteristics. Concluding from studies which have dealt with the affective domain in psychopaths, emotional deficiency may predispose to violence in several ways. (1) Poor conditioning implicates a failure to review the harmful consequences of one's actions leading to a deficit of avoidance behavior. (2) Emotional detachment prevents experiencing feelings, which naturally inhibit the acting out of violent impulses. (3) Emotional deficiency is closely associated with a general underarousal, leading to sensation seeking. Current data suggest that there may be a close association between difficulties in emotional processing and poor prefrontal functioning. From a psychosocial perspective, psychopaths were shown to have been exposed to severe familial and societal difficulties. Whether biological or environmental factors dominate in the etiology of this personality disorder, psychopathy does not per se justify the assumption of decreased legal responsibility.

L'apparition des symptomes ulcereux, les rechutes dans la maladie, a un moment precis de l'histoire du malade ne sont pas aleatoires. Elles correspondent souvent a la survenue d'evenements nouveaux, vecus comme traumatisants. Le deuil, les separations. . . , autant de situations stressantes induisant un malaise que le malade ne peut surmonter. Notons aussi cette problematique relationnelle, avec tout ce qu'elle connote comme ambivalence et tiraillement chez le malade qui n'arrive pas a trouver un compromis, lui permettant de surmonter ses conflits sans crainte de la perte ou de la rupture. La decharge emotionnelle etant barree, l'agressivite si elle existe, demeure retournee sur le malade lui-meme. Le malaise familial que vivent les patients se laisse voir a travers leurs difficultes relationnelles avec l'entourage et la situation embarassante dans laquelle ils se trouvent, sans aucune mediation possible par le langage concernant leurs problemes. Le discours parental culpabilisant fait vivre au patient un sentiment de rejet mal tolere. Il s'ajoute a cela la menace et la malediction qui suscitent l'angoisse. L'angoisse est aussi particulierement aigue devant la mort ou l'atteinte de la personne. Elle s'exprime dans la somatisation, faute de pouvoir etre symbolisee, elaboree dans la relation a l'autre. Le patient semble se retrancher a l'interieur de son propre corps ou moi, sans contact possible avec l'autre trop menacant et il est comme coupe de l'interieur. Il joue sa vie a travers la maladie, faute de pouvoir assumer la marque de l'autre en lui (le manque en lui-meme).",

      "title": "What Is Personality Disorder?",
      "abstract": "What Is Personality Disorder? Hanna Pickard (bio) The DSM-IV-TR (American Psychiatric Association 1994, 689) defines personality disorder (PD) as: A. An enduring pattern of experience and behavior that deviates markedly from the expectations of an individual’s culture. This pattern is manifested in two (or more) of the following areas: 1. Cognition (i.e., ways of perceiving and interpreting self, other people, and events); 2. Affectivity (i.e., the range, intensity, lability, and appropriateness of emotional response); 3. Interpersonal functioning; and 4. Impulse control. B. The enduring pattern is inflexible and pervasive across a broad range of personal and social situations. C. The enduring pattern leads to clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. D. The pattern is stable and of long duration, and its onset can be traced back at least to adolescence or early adulthood. E. The enduring pattern is not better accounted for as a manifestation or consequence of another mental disorder. F. The enduring pattern is not due to the direct physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication) or a general medical condition (e.g., head trauma). Unlike schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and other Axis I conditions, PD is not conventionally understood as an illness or disease. Rather, as the name implies, it is a disorder of the personality: an ‘enduring pattern of experience and behavior.’ Metaphorically speaking, it is a condition that is internal to the kind of person someone is, a part of who they are. It is not an external condition that befalls them. Very roughly, personality is the set of characteristics or traits that make us the kind of person we are: the ways we are inclined to think, feel, and act in response to particular circumstances, as well as more generally. All of us have one. PD occurs when the set of characteristics or traits that make a person the kind of person they are causes severe psychological distress and impairment in social, occupational, or other important contexts: the ways a person is inclined to think, feel, and act do them harm, directly or via the effects they have on relationships, work, and life more generally conceived. Diagnosis of a PD requires that these characteristics or traits be long-standing, pervasive, difficult to control or change, and markedly different from cultural expectations. Equally, the distress and impairment caused must be sufficiently extreme to warrant clinical attention: the person needs clinical care and help. Nonetheless, all of us possess characteristics or traits that sometimes incline us to think, feel, and act in ways that cause us distress and adversely affect our social, occupational, or other functioning. PD lies on a continuum with normal human personality. The broad category of PD is currently divided into three subcategories or ‘clusters.’ Cluster A comprises paranoid, schizoid, and schizotypal PD. These are more colloquially known as the odd [End Page 181] and eccentric or ‘mad’ PDs. Cluster B comprises narcissistic, borderline, histrionic, and antisocial PD. These are more colloquially known as the dramatic, emotional, and erratic or ‘bad’ PDs. Cluster C comprises obsessive-compulsive, avoidant, and dependent PD. These are more colloquially known as the anxious and fearful or ‘sad’ PDs. A person cannot be diagnosed with any particular PD unless there is clinically significant distress and impairment. But, given that this condition is met, which kind of PD they have depends on what kind of personality they have–on the nature of the problematic pattern of experience and behavior. Stepping back and considering the wider context, the picture painted of PD is bleak. PD is associated with genetic factors (Jang and Vernon 2001) and also environmental conditions (Paris 2001). These include dysfunctional families, where there is breakdown, death, institutional care, and parental psychopathology; traumatic childhood experiences, with high levels of sexual, emotional, and physical abuse or neglect; and social stressors, such as war, poverty, and migration. There are high levels of comorbidity among PDs, and between PDs and psychotic disorders, eating disorders, anxiety, depression, and substance abuse (Moran 2002). Finally, there is also a strong association between PD and violence and crime, self-harm, and suicide (Moran 2002). As this picture...",

      "abstract": "One of the challenges in acute stroke management is accurately differentiating between actual ischemic events and other conditions that mimic stroke. In a cohort of 821 consecutive patients admitted to an acute stroke unit, 13% were incorrectly diagnosed as stroke [1]. In another cohort of 411 patients, it was estimated that 19% of patients presenting to the emergency department with stroke-like symptoms ultimately have other diagnoses such as a postictal state, metabolic disturbances, and systemic infections [2]. Regardless of the actual percentage, it is clear that not all cases of acute stroke-like symptoms are true strokes and other mimics should be considered. One such mimic is factitious disorder. \r\nFactitious disorder is a psychiatric condition in which afflicted individuals exaggerate symptoms and even endorse medical illness, or psychological trauma in order to draw attention or sympathy to themselves. The DSM-IV criteria for this disorder are: 1) Intentional production or feigning of physical or psychological signs or symptoms; 2) The motivation for the behavior is to assume the sick role; and 3)\r\nExternal incentives for the behavior such as economic gain or avoiding legal responsibility as seen in malingering, are absent [3].\r\nHere, we present a case of a patient who was diagnosed with factitious disorder after he presented to two different institutions with acute stroke-like symptoms and received tissue plasminogen activator\r\n(t-PA) twice within the span of 3 weeks.",

      "abstract": "As a symptom state, nearly all humans have personal experience with the feeling of social anxiety. For most individuals, the feeling state is transitory, or limited to relatively circumscribed developmental periods. For others, social anxiety is a chronic condition resulting in significant functional impairment. Social anxiety disorder is defined in the fourth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV) as a \"marked and persistent fear of one or more social or performance situations in which the person is exposed to unfamiliar people or to possible scrutiny by others\" (1). In order to qualify for a diagnosis of social anxiety disorder, children must demonstrate capacity for age-appropriate social relationships. Pervasive developmental disorder must be considered as an alternative diagnosis for children who demonstrate deficits in social relatedness even with family members and others with whom they have extended contact. Further, diagnosis of social anxiety disorder requires that the child experience anxietyrelated symptoms in the presence of other children, not merely in interaction with adult authority figures. Reticence only in the presence of adults, while potentially disconcerting, falls within the normative scope of shyness and is not necessarily grounds for intervention.",

      "title": "[Emergence of early childhood trauma in adult psychiatric symptomatology].",
      "abstract": "Trauma comes as a result of the subject's exposure to extremely negative and stressful events, such as natural or human-provoked catastrophes, wars, serious injuries, violent deaths, tortures, terrorist attacks, rapes and other sexual crimes. A child's exposure to traumatic circumstances of this level during the crucial period of self-structuring creates rather difficult conditions for its development. Moreover, if the child does not have the opportunity to elaborate and analyze all these stressful conditions and put them into words, serious consequences, both psychological and somatic, may occur in adult life. Specific factors and child characteristics, namely, the age, the developmental stage within which the trauma occurs, its type (physical or sexual abuse, neglect or traumatic social events), frequency, duration and intensity, have been proved to seriously affect the trauma's consequences. The immediate emotional impact of trauma may include isolation, fear, feeling of weakness or loss of the sense of confidence. Moreover, mood disorders such as depression and withdrawal, negative effects on cognitive ability, language development and academic performance, difficulties in creating a secure link and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are also observed. The long-term consequences for the individual's mental health can be expressed through the following: post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) combined or not with depression and anxiety disorder, mood disorders, personality disorders, poor control of impulsions, dissociation disorder, psychotic disorder. Finally, apart from the dramatic impact of trauma on the person itself, there is also a high social cost to be paid as a result of the individual's poor adjustment and dysfunction in the community. Early support and intervention in the child's environment may significantly minimize the negative effects of trauma. Beyond the expression of genes, good maternal care as well as psychological support, lead to normal DNA methylation and brain development. Supporting the family and break the silence that frequently covers the traumatic events and feelings, will give the opportunity for the elaboration of all these aspects which could capture and imprison the subject in a dramatic circle of psychopathology. Moreover, the effectiveness of early interventions and child psychotherapy is now a common ground, so we have to use all our clinical instruments (dialogue, symbolic play, drawing, storytelling) in order to help the child and have the best possible result. Finally, concerning clinical practice, the emergence of early childhood trauma in adult psychiatric symptomatology is so frequent that mental health experts should take it into serious account while developing an appropriate clinical treatment for such patients.",

Hallucinations of taste (gustatory) or hallucinations of smell (olfactory) are most often of unpleasant sensations. Gustatory and olfactory hallucinations often correspond to disease in the temporal lobes of the brain. Tactile or kinesthetic hallucinations can take many forms.",

      "title": "Moral Injury, Trance and Possession State or a Schizophrenic Illness. a Case report",
      "abstract": "Aims Moral Injury is a strong cognitive and emotional response occurring upon witnessing, participating in, or failing to prevent an act that goes against one's ethical code. This has been linked with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, Depression, Suicidality, and Anxiety, amongst others. Data on its association with Schizophrenia are however lacking. Trance and Possession Disorders defined by the ICD-10 refers to a group of disorders involving temporary loss of both the sense of personal identity and full awareness of the surrounding with individuals acting in some cases as if taken over by another personality, spirit, deity, or force with reports of such states occurring in primary psychotic disorder. This case presentation describes a 22-year-old male whose first episode of schizophrenia was preceded by moral injury Methods A 22-year-old male Nigerian with a strong conservative Christian religious upbringing and a history of receiving a prophecy against having intercourse with women. He started showing symptoms of a mental illness a month after attaining coitarche with a lady. This presentation was characterized by irrelevant speech, intrusive flashbacks and unusual beliefs (excessive guilt, ill health). 7 months after, he was presented to the hospital with above symptoms and disorganized behavior characterized by beliefs of being possessed by four different people, shouting in different voice textures, throwing himself on the floor. We kept in view a diagnosis of schizophrenia and placed him on oral Olanzapine 5mg nocte following which he made significant improvement within 2 weeks with no memory of the event. Results Different factors can be considered in the aetiopathogenesis and presentation of symptoms in this patient. According to Williamson V. et. al; An Individual's experience of moral injury may lead to feelings of shame or guilt which was present in this patient (delusion of guilt). The pathogenic effect of culture and religion(e.g through prophecy against intercourse with women) may account for this illness. Moreso, pathoplastic and pathoreactive effects of culture could be said to have contributed significantly to the presentation of a psychotic disorder with trance and possession state as a reaction to moral injury. Conclusion Moral Injury, not previously considered to be associated with primary psychotic disorder may not only possibly precipitate a primary psychotic disorder but also show cultural/religious differences in phenomenology. Further studies are therefore required to explore these associations.",

      "abstract": "Dissociative disorders involve a division of an organism-environment or ecological system into subsystems. Each subsystem or dissociative agent brings forth his or her own, however rudimentary, experience and idea of self, world, and self as a part of this world. The disorders manifest in dissociative symptoms. Some are psychoform (e.g., one dissociative agent hearing another dissociative agent speak), others are somatoform, or sensory and motor (e.g., being analgesic while another dissociative agent is in pain). Somatoform and psychoform dissociative symptoms often occur together. Somatoform dissociative symptoms are characteristic of dissociative disorders and proportional to their complexity. The disorders include ICD-10's Dissociative Disorders of Movement and Sensation, inadequately renamed in ICD-11 Dissociative Neurological Symptom Disorder. Sensory and motor dissociative disorders are categorized in DSM-5 as Conversion Disorder. This is confusing, because the symptoms involve dissociation, not conversion of something mental into something physical. PTSD, which can be seen as a simple dissociative disorder, is associated with marked somatoform dissociation. Adverse events, particularly chronic interpersonal abuse and neglect, and the motivational conflicts this adversity typically implies, constitute an important causal factor of somatoform dissociation.",

      "abstract": "Folie à Deux, also known as shared psychosis, is a is a psychotic disorder uncommon characterized by the shared manifestation of delusional beliefs between two individuals or more. The individual who initially experiences these delusional thoughts is referred to as the primary case, while the subsequent transmission of these beliefs to another person designates them as the secondary case. Typically, this phenomenon arises within close interpersonal relationships, such as familial or intimate partnerships. The primary case is typically diagnosed with a psychotic disorder, while the secondary case, lacking any previous psychiatric history, develops similar delusions as a consequence of close contact with the primary case. It is important to note that the specific shared delusional beliefs can exhibit considerable variability, contingent upon the nature of the primary case's delusions and their influence on the secondary case. Common types of shared delusions encompass persecutory, grandiose, erotomanic, somatic, jealous, and religious misbeliefs. Moreover, it is imperative to recognize that the particular delusional content observed in cases of Folie à Deux can be subject to significant variation, potentially influenced by cultural, interpersonal, and environmental factors.",

      "title": "Let's Focus on Frailty",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION Frailty may be a clinical condition during which a person's vulnerability to acquiring dependency and/or mortality increases after they are subjected to a stressor.[1] Frailty is most regularly characterized as an aging-related disorder of physiological decline, characterized by marked vulnerability to unfavorable health outcomes, such as comorbidities, polypharmacy, the loss of independence, increasing hospitalizations, and mortality, improving the care for the most vulnerable subset of patients by frailty awareness and associated risks for adverse health outcomes. The physical frailty is \"A medical syndrome with multiple causes and contributors that are characterized by diminished strength, endurance, and reduced physiologic function that increases an individual's vulnerability for developing increased dependency and/or death.\"[2] Frail people usually have three or more than five symptoms such as unintentional weight loss (10 or more pounds within the past year), muscle loss and weakness, fatigue, reduced walking speed, and reduced levels of physical activity. WHAT ARE CONSEQUENCES OF FRAILTY? Frailty is viewed as a geriatric disorder with various causes and contributors portrayed by reduced strength, perseverance and diminished physiologic capacity, and increasing a person's weakness for developing disability.[1] As one of the fundamental causes of functional decrease in the elderly, sarcopenia has a high clinical effect, influencing the status and recuperation of an individual's mobility, independence, and quality of life conveys an increased danger for chronic frailty which results in falls, disability, hospitalization, and mortality.[3] WHAT ARE the RISK FACTORS FOR FRAILTY? The elements related with frailty, especially sociodemographic factors such as age, gender, and educational level, just as actual factors, for example, body weight and activities of daily living.[4] Malnutrition, inactivity, and comorbidities have a high antagonistic effect in older people and are risk factors for sarcopenia and physical frailty. The loss of muscle mass, strength, and function, called sarcopenia, is a key factor in the development of physical frailty. WHAT IS ORAL FRAILTY? Oral frailty is characterized as a progression of phenomena and cycles that lead to changes in different oral conditions (number of teeth, oral cleanliness, oral capacities, and so forth) related with aging, and accompanied by diminished interest in oral health, decreased physical and mental reserve capacity, and an expansion in oral frailty prompting to eating dysfunction; the general impact is of deteriorating physical and mental capacity.[5] HOW TO ASSESS THE ORAL FRAILTY? Oral assessments comprised of 16 measures including five dental status, eight oral functions, and three subjective difficulties. The 16 measures were as follows: dental status – number of natural teeth and functioning teeth, community periodontal index, tongue thickness as a marker of oral nutrient status, and turbidity of mouth-rinsed water as a marker of oral hygiene. Oral functions – maximum occlusal force, chewing ability as a marker of general masticatory performance, maximum tongue pressure, repetitive saliva-swallowing test (RSST), articulatory oral motor skill for \"pa, ta, ka\" and experience of dry mouth measured-oral wettability. Subjective assessments – difficulties in eating and swallowing, and using the questionnaire chewing ability, RSST, xerostomia. Oral frailty – the accumulation of a slightly poor status of oral conditions and function, strongly predicts physical frailty, dysphagia, malnutrition, need for long-term care, and mortality. IS ORAL FRAILTY LINKED TO PHYSICAL FRAILTY? A hypothesis for the connection between poor oral health and frailty is that poor diet intervenes the impact of poor oral health (like loss of teeth, dental agony, or potentially biting issues), prompting to frailty.[6] Poor eating routine and nutritional risk have for some time been involved in the etiology and progression of frailty by affecting useful functional reserves and strength and leading to loss of energy, functional decline, morbidity, and subsequent frailty. Oral frailty was essentially connected with physical frailty by 66.6% and sarcopenia by 72.7%. Poor oral condition in hospitalized patients can be attributed to factors such as age, physical dependency, psychological decline, malnutrition, low skeletal muscle mass and strength, and multimorbidity.[7] WHAT ARE the POLICY IMPLICATIONS? The proof from frailty studies has not yet been completely converted into clinical practice and medical care strategy making. As of now, in any case, there is no viable treatment for frailty and the best intervention is not yet known. In view of presently available proof, the multicomponent exercise, which incorporates resistance training, appears to be promising.[8] The current challenges in frailty research incorporate the absence of a worldwide standard meaning of frailty, further comprehension of interventions to reverse frailty, the best planning for intervention, and education/training of health-care professionals. Population-based evaluation for frailty could be costly and resource intensive, and as of now, there is no obvious proof for expected advantage, cost-adequacy, or improved results. Research and development efforts aimed toward building up and spreading best practice in frailty should not lack strategic consideration regarding older people with early (pre-) frailty that passes up on a chance to address a few requests on health and social care services. Another significant space of delicacy research is schooling and preparing The medical services experts including doctors, attendants, and other medical workers need to comprehend essential standards of care for frail older adults and to have the option to distinguish frailty and give therapy/interventions. There is an increasing interest in frailty in other medical fields than the geriatrics One model is that frailty has recently been pursued as a potential risk assessment measure for older surgical patients and has demonstrated to be promising in anticipating postoperative intricacies, for example, mortality or length of emergency clinic stay. Finally, frailty research may have evolved without considering the patient perspective Frailty can be considered as a profoundly adverse term and being marked as frail may influence contrarily the weakest people differently. The individuals who were marked as \"old and fragile\" by others were bound to be related with a loss of interest in friendly and proactive tasks, poor physical health, and increased disparagement. The future innovative work endeavors need to recognize the risks of naming older individuals in defaming ways and stay away from turning into the new cloak of ageism and an instrument for segregation.[8] Financial support and sponsorship Nil.

Pain is a common and diagnostically puzzling presenting symptom of depression and other psychiatric disorders (Walters, 1961). It may take the form of generalized or poorly localized aches and pains, often associated with a feeling of tension, or it may be sharply delimited (Critchley, 1935). This form of localized pain may so dominate the symptomatology that the patient is referred by his general practitioner to a variety of specialists, who may perform a series of special investigations or even exploratory operations. Clearly, every effort must be made to exclude organic disease, even if positive signs of psychiatric illness are recognized, as an organic disease can obviously co-exist with a psychiatric one.

All human beings experience illness, failure, conflicts with others, problems with children or spouse, financial troubles, or legal disputes. It would be a mental disturbance to feel happy under these circumstances. Is euthymia limited to positive affects or happy hours, or should it include all forms of \"normal\" mood? That not all hardship and negative feelings automatically qualify as disorder is confirmed by the ICD-10, which provides separate codes (Z codes) for negative life situations such as loss of work, social exclusion, or burnout. If people feel unhappy when burdened by negative life events, this is no mental disorder, but \"healthy suffering\" . It is of great importance not to medicalize such everyday problems2. In clinical practice, there are many people who contact medical experts because of healthy suffering. They need a professional evaluation together with some advice. We need diagnostic criteria for healthy bad mood. Such criteria include situational adequacy of the type and intensity of the emotional reaction, self-appraisal, controllability, compliance with individual and social norms, lack of specific psychopathological signs and symptoms3. Healthy persons with normal bad mood display consistency in their behavior and values, show environmental mastery, self-acceptance, positive relations with others, flexibility, and resilience to go on with daily duties4. So, healthy suffering and bad mood should be included in the concept of euthymia. How can interventions deal with such a broadened concept of euthymia? There are basically four different approaches to foster euthymia. The first one is to get rid of bad mood by improving well-being through the increase of pleasant activities and experiences5. \"Regeneration therapy\"6 engages people in positive and self-care exercises, from board games to cultural and social activities, relaxation and make oneself up. Positive effects of these interventions were shown in regard to depressed mood or distress intolerance and the ability to work. The bottom line is that, if you are under stress, you should do something positive for yourself or coddle yourself. The second approach also aims to counteract bad mood, this time by teaching how to generate positive emotions directly. \"Euthymia therapy\"7 teaches the art of enjoyment and experiencing of pleasures. \"Well-being therapy\"1 teaches people to focus on constituents of positive mood by self-observation, change of dysfunctional cognitions, and promotion of activities. Studies on these interventions showed positive effects in depressed or psychosomatic patients transdiagnostically. The bottom line is to improve the capacity of the individual to generate positive emotions. A different type of approach is represented by \"mindfulness and acceptance\" based therapies8. Their primary goal is not to get rid of negative emotions and cognitions, but instead to change the individuals' relationship to their emotional state, their experiences, and the living context. This is done by encouraging awareness and acceptance of unpleasant feelings through mindfulness practice and cognitive defusion. Commitment and behavior change processes are based on contact with the present moment. Bad mood is accepted and may still be present after treatment. This approach implicitly has a broader concept of euthymia, including bad and positive mood alike. The bottom line is to accept and arrange oneself with something that cannot be changed. Another approach, which goes in the same direction, is \"wisdom therapy\"9. Life span psychology describes wisdom as a psychological capacity, given to all persons, which is essential in coping with severe, irreversible or unsolvable problems, but also in dealing with daily dilemmas, such as the decision whether to stay at home with a sick child or to go to work. Similar to other psychological capacities, there are about a dozen sub-dimensions, such as recognition of reality (factual and procedural knowledge, contextualism, relativization of problems and aspirations), mastery of emotions (perception and acceptance of emotions, serenity), acceptance of personal limitations (self-relativization, self-distance), clarification and self-assurance of goals and values (value relativism, forgiveness and acceptance of the past, uncertainty tolerance, long-term perspective), and interactional competencies (change of perspective, empathy). \"Wisdom therapy\" provides strategies to translate these sub-dimensions into treatment. There is evidence that it works in patients with severe adjustment disorders9. The goal of the intervention is to learn how to deal with bad and good times alike. Euthymia can be defined as a state of wisdom, in which persons feel at ease with themselves and the world, their past, the present and the future, in good and bad times, and do not lose heart and courage in the face of adversities and hardship. The concept of euthymia should reflect the daily existence of human beings. Happiness is limited to very few moments in life. Demands, hardship, burdens fill the rest of time. Back pain, heavy work or driving a car in combusted streets do not produce happiness. But there is nevertheless euthymia. The problem of mental illness is that people are overburdened and impaired by daily hassles, while healthy persons have resilience and can deal with bad times. We should not create the misunderstanding that happiness is the goal to be pursued by our interventions. This can lead to disappointment. Instead, mastery of exceptional and daily burdens and demands, and how nevertheless to \"feel OK\" (not happy but euthymic), should be the aim.",

Cluster A reflects odd or eccentric character structure; Cluster B reflects dramatic, emotional, or erratic character structure; and Cluster C reflects anxious or fearful character structure. Further details on diagnosis, etiology, and treatment issues follow. Accurate identification and optimal treatment of PDs can help improve outcomes of other psychiatric and medical illness.",

      "abstract": "Whiplash is a contentious issue in the medico-legal field; opposing views are held about persisting symptoms. The exact pathology is not known; but it is generally accepted to be ‘soft tissue injury’. The same clinical syndrome can occur without a road accident. No one doubts the reality of the condition in the early stages when the symptoms and signs (of a ‘mechanical derangement’) are clear cut. As with other soft tissue injuries, most ‘heal’ within a usual time span; some take longer to heal; and some have persisting problems giving rise to chronic pain, restricted movements &/or a feeling of ‘instability’. In this latter group the physical signs are less obvious but are still present, if sought. Imaging is rarely relevant. The psychological reaction to any injury or illness will vary from individual to individual (the previous personality); or from time to time in the same individual. People with chronic pain may become depressed and may develop ‘excessive’ psychological reactions – often referred to as ‘chronic pain syndrome’ and, by some, as ‘abnormal illness behaviour’; this is exacerbated when litigation is involved with its attendant adversarial, confrontational approach which questions the ‘genuineness’ of both the patient and their symptoms and disability. Where symptom persist beyond the ‘usual’ time for healing, and are consistent with the (albeit subtle) physical signs found, there can be no grounds for arguing that they are nor related to the accident.",

For example, trauma is known to precipitate seizures, headache, or focal neurological deficits in previously asymptomatic individuals. Similarly, psychological stress seems to be a factor in the development of some peptic ulcers, anxiety disorders, and other psychiatric states. In addition, trauma and/or stress have been suspected to have links to many other medical disorders. It is perhaps not surprising, therefore, that both physical trauma and psychological stress have been posited to be causal factors in either the onset or exacerbation of multiple sclerosis (MS).

      "title": "Understanding depression beyond the “mind‐body” dichotomy",
      "abstract": "In both the ICD-11 and the DSM-5, the core symptoms of depression are reported to be depressed mood (e.g., feeling sad, down or hopeless) and markedly diminished interest or pleasure in activities. However, in the ICD-10 diagnostic guidelines, a third core symptom was also identified: \"fatigue or low energy\". In two regions of the world (Latin America and East Asia), \"fatigue\" is the most commonly experienced depressive symptom1. In a third region (Southeast Asia), \"issues with the heart\" are the most commonly reported depressive symptoms, along with depressed mood1. Do people in these regions just \"somatize\" what is primarily a \"psychological\" experience? Do \"somatic\" symptoms just represent a \"mask\", as implied some decades ago by the concept of \"masked depression\"2? An alternative view may be that the core of the depressive syndrome, at least in part of the cases of this heterogeneous condition, is neither only \"psychic\" nor only \"somatic\", but consists of an actual \"depression\" of the individual's psychic/physical tone, energy, drive and/or response to rewarding stimuli (partially captured by the constructs of depressed mood, fatigue, and diminished interest or pleasure), along with an overwhelming feeling of psychic/physical pain (which has a complex and probably variable relationship to the cognitive component of the syndrome). The way these core phenomena are perceived, elaborated and verbalized by the affected person likely depends upon how that person generally functions and appraises her functioning (e.g., how rich and articulated her cognitive life is, or how much she is focused on her body and its functioning), upon the influence of the cultural environment in which she is immersed, and upon the pattern of predisposing and precipitating factors at work in that individual case. Feelings involving the heart (\"heavy heart\", \"heart pain\"; chest tightness, weakness or excessive tension; palpitations) do not appear in textbook descriptions of depression, but are more frequently experienced by depressed individuals than we use to believe1. Ordinary people sometimes refer to depression as \"broken heart\", and we tend to regard this as a metaphor. But, the acute \"broken heart syndrome\" – which has the same precipitating factors as depression and, similarly to the heart involvement in depression, is ascribed to a sympathetic overactivation – is now a recognized clinical entity3. An intrinsic cardiac nervous system (\"a brain in the heart\") has been recently described4, including a multitude of nervous ganglions consisting not only of neurons receiving sympathetic and parasympathetic input, but also of intracardiac interneurons which act as processors of information. Indeed, the heart conveys to the brain more information than the brain sends to the heart, and ascending fibres in the vagus nerve are more numerous than descending ones. Could the above dynamics be an under-recognized factor contributing to the frequent coexistence (\"comorbidity\") and complex interaction between depression and heart disease? That many patients with a diagnosis of depression do not respond adequately to two subsequent antidepressant medications (\"treatment resistance\") is not surprising. Clinical trials of both medications and psychotherapies for depression have aimed during the past few decades to document the \"equivalence\" of any new experimental intervention to an already consolidated one, while \"differences\" in the profiles of action of those interventions have usually not been a focus of attention. Consequently, antidepressants and evidence-based psychotherapies for depression are regarded by treatment guidelines as essentially all \"equivalent\" to each other. It is only recently that secondary analyses of large trial databases, conducted using innovative methodologies, have started to focus again on the \"differences\" between the various antidepressants, and between antidepressants and evidence-based psychotherapies, with respect to their profiles of action5, 6. On the other hand, it is not common in ordinary practice that a patient with a diagnosis of depression receives a detailed clinical characterization beyond that diagnosis, guiding the choice of treatment. It is therefore understandable that a person may receive two or more antidepressants that, although validated for depression tout court, are not among the most appropriate for her specific case, and consequently may not elicit an adequate response. Furthermore, medications do not work in a vacuum: a variety of \"aspecific\" factors (e.g., the therapeutic relationship, family dynamics, the socio-cultural context) may affect the outcome of an intrinsically efficacious intervention. The concept of \"pseudo-resistance\" does not adequately consider at the moment these factors (not to mention problems with the definition of what is an \"adequate response\" to an antidepressant, difficulties in ascertaining the adherence to the antidepressant regimens that have been used, and the basic incongruence of defining a case as \"treatment-resistant\" when one group of therapies currently regarded as first-line in the treatment of depression, i.e. psychotherapies, have not been tried). In this issue of the journal, two papers and a Forum deal, respectively, with the lived experience of depression7, with its multiple \"physical comorbidities\"8, and (in a critical vein) with \"treatment-resistant depression\" and its management9. I think these contributions should be welcome by the scientific community, by people with depression and their families, and by the public at large. A \"depression\" of the individual's psychic/physical tone, energy, drive and/or response to rewarding stimuli may be the outcome of repeated and inescapable adverse events, but also of a disruption of circadian rhythms, a non-psychiatric disease, or the use of certain medications. Or it may occur in the absence of any such evidence as far as the person is aware of, as often happens in bipolar disorder. Perhaps research should more actively focus on those core phenomena, building on the reports of experts by experience and exploring their biological correlates, without any prejudice about whether they are primarily or essentially psychic or physical in nature. The effects of the various antidepressant medications could perhaps be explored – beyond current stereotypes – in the same light (are they psychophysical \"tonics\"?; do they have energizing or disinhibiting properties?; do they affect reward responsiveness?; do they impact psychic/physical pain?), through a more in-depth and nuanced reconstruction of patients' experiences of \"response\" to those agents, and a more targeted investigation of their biological correlates. The same may apply to the effects of other interventions, from physical exercise and behavioural activation to neurostimulation techniques. Neuroscientific explorations of depression should probably look at the autonomic as well as the central nervous system (and at their interactions with the cardiovascular and gastrointestinal systems in addition to the immune and endocrine ones). Finally (or first of all), some more psychopathological sophistication should perhaps be added to the current conceptualization and description of \"depression\".",

      "title": "Fibromyalgia or pseudo fibromyalgia? - We have to get it right",
      "abstract": "Chronic pain disorders like fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome, repetitive strain injury and myofascial pain syndromes are no more considered as ‘waste basket diagnosis’, especially because of better biological understanding of these disorders including their immunological and genetic links.1-3 Patients truly suffering from these illnesses, therefore, need to be recognised correctly. Missing these peculiar illnesses and thereby messing them up by misdiagnosing as more serious ailments like Rheumatoid arthritis, other arthritic conditions, connective tissue diseases, psychiatric illnesses or malingering are expensive errors. An equally expensive error is labelling these close mimics and other pseudo fibromyalgia states as fibromyalgia. In both the scenarios, implications can be clinical (progression of an undiagnosed illness), pharmacological (toxicity of an unwarranted drug therapy) economic, emotional, social or even legal. Unfortunately, these errors are made by General practitioners, Physicians, orthopedicians, Psychiatrists and by Rheumatologists alike.4 Syndromic approach to diagnosis of illnesses relies upon physical signs and investigations to a large extent. In pain disorders like fibromyalgia, however, the vague, ‘out of proportion’ tenderness on minor pressure or even a gentle touch may be the only other notable feature apart from the widespread aches complained by the patient. There is no ‘tell-tale’ sign elicitable by inspection, palpation, percussion or auscultation for this spectrum of illnesses. Laboratory investigations always draw a blank. Chronic pain disorders, therefore, cannot be diagnosed by this conventional approach.5 Although chronic wide spread pain, fatigue, sleep disturbance and mental fogging are some of the hallmarks of these illnesses, familiarity with classification criteria is a prerequisite to identify a good number of them. There are patients, however, with these illnesses that do not fulfill any criteria. Neurochemical misbalances, rather than anatomical lesions are more likely to cause these disorders; nor are they straightforward psychiatric illnesses, in spite of many reports of mind-body link in these conditions.6, 7 While rheumatology clinics in the western and developed world are flooded with such patients and rheumatologists in those parts of the world are more familiar with these illnesses, developing world is less familiar with these maladies. Now that the epidemic seems to be reaching the less developed world, many unanswered questions need to be addressed on this subject. Is it globalization that is bringing it to the developing world, where people earlier could tolerate small aches and pains better? Is it much less common amongst the underprivileged section of the society? Do lifestyle, dietary factors and other socioeconomic factors have some influence on pain threshold, if not on causation of these new world diseases? Painful disorders with anatomical lesions like inflammatory arthropathies, connective tissue diseases and osteoarthritis may also cause vicious cycle of ‘pain begetting more pain’, which may be termed as secondary fibromyalgia.8 On the contrary and paradoxically enough, there is a paradigm shift in the understanding of pain disorders; it is now believed widely that pain itself can cause localised inflammation in a significant proportion of cases and thereby induces this novel mechanism to perpetuate the vicious cycle of pain.9 Whether this has a therapeutic implication is arguable, but breaking this cycle is important in arresting the pain process. Mimics of fibromyalgia comprise a wide spectrum. On the one end, there are highly treatable low grade metabolic disorders like hypothyroidism and vitamin D deficiency causing chronic widespread pain. These relatively common disorders need to be excluded or diagnosed and treated, as the case may be, in a chronic pain scenario.10 On the other end of this spectrum, there are more serious organic pathologies like enthesopathic pain of spondyloarthropathies and at times, out of proportion pain and tenderness of leukemic arthropathies, especially in children presenting as vague aches and pains. Attending physician need to be sensitized to avoid misdiagnosing these conditions as fibromyalgia. Last, but not the least, undiagnosed cases of psychiatric illnesses including depression and malin-gering for social, emotional or economic gains can also present as ‘pseudofibromyalgia’.11, 12 The Chinese study in this issue by Rong MU et al. has revealed poor awareness and deficiency in diagnostic skills amongst doctors including rheumatologists and is a must- read article for all. Some of the points discussed in the preceding paragraphs are realised in this paper. Many rheumatologists who considered themselves non-believers of this vague entity in the recent past, have now turned into believers in view of emerging evidences cited above. No rheumatologist can afford to make a mistake today in diagnosing or excluding these modern day illnesses.",

Крім того, травматичні стреси можуть сприяти розвитку інших невротичних і психічних розладів, таких як тривожність, депресія, різноманітні фобії тощо. Ці розлади можуть значно ускладнити життя дитини й вимагати комплексного підходу до їх корекції та підтримки. Однією з важливих характеристик особистості дитини з порушенням інтелектуального розвитку є незрілість її емоційної сфери. Тому важливо вчасно виявляти та вирішувати проблеми, пов’язані з травматичним стресом, у дітей з порушеннями психофізичного розвитку. Саморегуляція вважається ключовою якістю особистості й важливим фактором гармонійних міжособистісних відносин у дітей із такими порушеннями як самих із собою, так і з оточуючим світом. Саморегуляція сприяє подоланню різноманітних перешкод, що заважають повноцінному включенню дитини в реальне життя, а також дозволяє розкрити її психологічний потенціал.",

Self-injurious behavior or compulsion refers to any voluntary action resulting in self-damage. Compulsive disorders are characterized by repetitive, persistent, or sustained behaviors in excess of what is required for normal function, especially if severe enough to interfere with normal function. Cutaneous compulsions (psychodermatoses) often have an underlying organic disease or trigger. Diagnosis and treatment include identifying the underlying trigger, treating secondary dermatoses, and modifying behavior to prevent recurrence; medications are a helpful adjunct if anxiety interferes with normal activities or learning. Dermatoses may be initiated by a pathology, with subsequent self-injury causing persistence or worsening of lesions. Basic work-up to rule out medical causes of self-injurious behavior include evaluation for pain or pruritus, including musculoskeletal disease, neurologic disease, and/or primary dermatologic disease.",

      "title": "Agenda for specialty section in addiction medicine",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION Addictive behavior is any activity or behavior that has become the major focus of a person's life to the exclusion of other activities, or that has begun to harm the individual or others physically, mentally, or socially. Addictive behavior increases the risk of disease and/or associated personal and social problems. They are often experienced subjectively as \"loss of control\", that is, the behavior continues to occur despite volitional attempts to abstain or moderate use. Addiction implies psychological dependence, physical dependence, and a set of withdrawal symptoms if the substance is unavailable.[1] There are many common characteristics among the various addictive behaviors. First, the individual becomes obsessed (constantly thinks) of the object, activity, or substance and will seek it out, often to the detriment of work or interpersonal relationships. The person will compulsively engage in the activity even if he does not want to. Upon cessation of the activity, withdrawal symptoms of irritability, craving, and restlessness will often occur. The person does not appear to have control as to when, how long, or how much he will continue the behavior. He often denies problems resulting from his engagement in the behavior even though others can see the negative effects of it. Further, individuals with addictive behaviors will usually have low self esteem.[2] BURDEN OF PROBLEM Substance-related disorders have become matters of global concern because of impact on individual health, familial and social consequences, criminal and legal problems, and the effects on national productivity and economy. All the problems from use to dependence and from the most innocuous substance like tea/coffee to the most hard substances, contribute to the cost that the human society or a particular nation has to bear. In India, although alcohol use in ancient times and cannabis/affim (opium) in more recent times have been known and reported for some time, substance use problems have been recognized to have a significant importance as a public health problem only very recently. They are of particular concern among slum dwellers, transport workers, and youth.[3] Tobacco is the substance most easily accessible worldwide as well as in India. About one-fifth of the Indian population abuse tobacco, about 70% of this in the smoking form.[4] Passive smoking is a significant health hazard. There are 700,000 deaths per year due to smoking and 800,000–900,000 deaths per year due to all forms of tobacco use in India. Many of the deaths (>50%) are occurring below 70 years.[5] An estimated 34–42% of adult Indian population reports having used alcohol in their lifetime; 5–7% has been estimated to be abuser of alcohol; and 10–20 million persons have been estimated to be in need of treatment for dependence. A survey in India revealed that medical professionals had a higher rate of use and heavy use than general population.[5] Nearly 20–30% of admissions and consultations are due to alcohol-related problems in different healthcare settings but are under-recognized by primary care physicians.[6] With respect to heroin, India has now changed from being a transit country to a user country. General population surveys in India show opioid abuse rate as high as 24.8%. Another great concern especially with injectable opioids is spread of AIDS. Further, cannabis abuse in general population in India is 33% and abuse of tranquilizers is as high as 54%.[3] Remediation at central level: 'The Drug Deaddiction Program' was started in 1987–88 with the establishment of five deaddiction centers in central institutions, viz. AIIMS, New Delhi; Dr. RML Hospital, New Delhi; Lady Harding Medical College and Hospital; New Delhi; JIPMER, Pondicherry; and PGI, Chandigarh. The center at NIMHANS, Bangalore was established later as the sixth center. More recently, in 1999, a separate deaddiction center with inpatient setup was started in Central Institute of Psychiatry, Ranchi. The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare is mainly involved in providing treatment services to the addicts, whereas the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment deals with other aspects of the problem like awareness creation, counseling, and rehabilitation. From 1992–93, the scope of the scheme was enlarged to include assistance to State Governments/Union Territories for developing deaddiction centers in identified medical colleges/district-level hospitals. WHAT WORKS IN SUBSTANCE-USE DISORDERS? Treatment of substance-use disorders typically involves a combination of pharmacotherapy and psychosocial interventions. Techniques for medically assisted detoxification are widespread and effective. The following are the different strategies that are found useful in management of substance dependence.[7] i) Home versus inpatient detoxification Published reports have consistently failed to find any difference in outcome between long and short inpatient detoxification programs. Clients can usually complete home detoxification in 5–9 days. In ideal circumstances they are visited twice daily for the first three days and medication is supervised by a relative. Clients are breathalyzed and medication withheld if they have consumed significant amounts of alcohol. ii) Brief interventions Brief interventions are short, focused discussions (often of less than 15 minutes) that can reduce alcohol consumption in some individuals with hazardous drinking. They are designed to promote awareness of the negative effects of drinking and to motivate change. Brief interventions were shown to be moderately effective in the nontreatment-seeking groups, especially for those with less-severe alcohol problems. iii) Abstinence versus controlled use This is a great debate. The goal of controlled (moderate or nonproblem) drinking usually includes some limit on alcohol consumption (e.g., 4 units/day) provided that drinking does not lead to signs of dependence, intoxication, or social, legal and health problems. This runs contrary to the abstinence-based philosophy of Alcoholics Anonymous. Controlled drinking may be an option for young, socially stable drinkers with short, less-severe drinking histories. An individual's belief that controlled drinking is an achievable goal is also a good prognostic factor. Most authors agree that controlled drinking should not be recommended for people with heavy dependence. Controlled drinking is an attractive option for public health strategies aimed at nondependent problem drinking. This principle can also be tried for other substances. iv) Alcoholic Anonymous Based on Minnesota model, they involve the recognition that alcoholism is a relapsing illness that requires complete abstinence. Clients acknowledge the problems due to their alcoholism and are encouraged to attend 90 meetings in 90 days. Participants may engage the support of a sponsor who is an AA member who has been sober for at least one year. Similarly, there is narcotic anonymous for opioid addicts and nicotine anonymous for nicotine dependents. The evidence suggests that this twelve-step approach is at least as effective as most structured psychotherapies but not superior to any alternative treatments. v) Psychological therapies Motivational enhancement therapy Cognitive behavioral therapy Social skills training Community reinforcement approach Social behavior and network therapy Contingency management Cue exposure vi) Therapeutic community It requires prolonged residence (often 12–18 months) and it is extremely expensive. Most studies of therapeutic communities are conducted without control groups and the lack of randomization probably leads to selection bias in favor of more motivated patients. vii) Drug treatments Disulfiram, naltrexone, and acamprosate are currently the only treatments approved for the management of alcohol dependence. Other drugs which have been used for the same are topiramate, citrated calcium carbimide, SSRIs, tiapiride, nalmefene, metronidazole, and ondansetron. The oldest among these is disulfiram, being used from 1950s. Naltrexone was launched in India in 1998 and acamprosate in 2002. However, none has been proved to be significantly better than the other agents. In other words, all are equally effective.[5] Bupropion has been said to be the first line drug for nicotine craving. Another first line agent is nicotine itself, in the form of gum, inhaler, lozenge, patch, and nasal spray. Clonidine and nortriptyline are said to be the second line drugs. But the success rate with each of these drugs is marginal.[8] Sustained release bupropion is also considered to be effective as anticraving agent in cannabis dependence. Nefazodone also significantly reduces cannabis withdrawal related anxiety and muscle pain, while having no effect on dysphoria. The embryonic work on CB1 selective cannabinoid receptor antagonists such as SR141716 (rimonabant) has demonstrated that it successfully blocks the acute psychological and physiological effects of smoked cannabis in experienced human consumers and is well tolerated. There has been even less work on the use of cannabis agonists. However, this is a promising area for future research as a number of oral and inhaled THC preparations are being developed for medical cannabis trials.[9] Maintenance treatment is increasingly emphasized as the main therapy of opioid dependency. Abstinence-oriented therapy is nevertheless an important alternative, mainly psychological, and has considerable advantages for those benefitting from this strategy. Methadone or buprenorphine in tapering doses are used for detoxification along with α2 adrenergic agonists like clonidine or lofexidine. Time-limited agonist therapy is a specific approach using agonist stabilization as the basis for therapeutic interventions preceding tapering off of the maintenance therapy. The preventive effect of naltrexone and other antagonists is well known but the attrition rate is very high. It is also feasible for addicts to be introduced to naltrexone by detoxification under anesthesia or sedation.[10] ADDICTION MEDICINE AS A SPECIALTY As elaborated above, substance use is affecting a disproportionately large section of people of India. The prevalence is more than that of all severe mental disorders combined. When it comes to health problems, it should not be gauged merely by its prevalence, but by the health burden and social cost that it wreaks on the society. Psychiatric comorbidities like mood, anxiety, and psychotic disorders are also very commonly associated with substance dependence. Thus drug addiction is a titanic problem that needs special clinical attention. Today we are equipped with an arena of treatment strategies, both pharmacological and nonpharmacological. What we need is just an improvisation in its implementation. Treatment can be better systematized when addiction medicine is upgraded as a specialty. The specialty section on addiction medicine needs to fulfill the following aims and objectives.[6] Promote and advance the bio-psycho-social contributions to the science and practice of addiction medicine in all its different manifestations. Promote the improvement of the health of persons directly or indirectly impacted by substance-related problems. Promote prevention, control, treatment, and relief of all substance-related problems, as well as conditions which constitute high risk for potential drug-related problems. This involves encouraging and enabling the members of the society to explore and pursue 'evidence based' treatment strategies and prevention methods. This includes liaison with other stake holders, including but not limited to government agencies overseeing health, social justice and welfare, and finance and human development; nongovernmental agencies involved in direct care of persons with substance abuse. Promote other medical specialties and primary healthcare providers. This also requires sharing the expertise of members of the society and other professionals involved in diverse fields such as school mental health, community based rehabilitation, epidemiology, drug trials, maintaining disease registries, to mention a few. Actively engage in advocacy in order to influence policy making and legislation, keeping in mind that substance-use disorders and their consequences constitute a grave public health disorder which imposes an unacceptably severe burden on the health and well being of the people of India. Formulate and recommend standards of treatment and rehabilitation of persons or populations affected directly or indirectly by substance-use disorders. In addition, it will be necessary to obtain recommendations for syllabi and commission resources for the education and training of medical and nonmedical personnel involved in the field. Safeguard the interest of psychiatrists and fellow professionals engaged in the practice of addiction medicine in India. Promote research in the field of addiction science with a focus on translating the benefits of research to the bedside and propagate the use of evidence-based interventions in the daily delivery of mental healthcare. FUNCTIONING OF ADDICTION MEDICINE AS A SPECIALTY SECTION The following are some of the activities that are being suggested as functions of specialty section of addiction medicine:[6] A web portal, linked to the web page of the Indian Psychiatric Society, which will initially host information of relevance to the practice of addiction medicine in India, with direct and indirect links to published or unpublished scientific papers, databases, treatment protocols, available treatment agencies, online resources, etc; and later e-learning sites for online education and training. Coordinating Continuing Medical Education (CME) pertaining to the aspect of the science and practice of addiction medicine, with special emphasis on underserved areas like the northeastern states, Andaman and Nicobar Islands, etc. Enabling and commissioning position papers on the impact of substance abuse in India, with a view to influence public policy. Engaging with relevant organizations to promote demand-reduction strategies, such as the police to prevent drinking and driving, primary health providers, and emergency rooms for early detection and brief intervention Pursuing the aim of working to safeguard vulnerable populations, for example, inoculating children and adolescents through skills training and sensitizing physicians and pharmacists to prevent over the counter drug abuse. Examining the possibility of creating a national registry, using standardized data-entry protocols. CONCLUSION Substance-use disorders form more than 20% of the case load of psychiatric practitioners. However, practitioners have an attitude of therapeutic nihilism toward the addicted patient. This may be due to various reasons like lack of education about alcohol and substance abuse, attitude of hostility or aversion toward alcoholics, inability or discomfort to deal with the associated psychosocial issues, and learned pessimism about treatment – especially based on experience treating late stage alcoholics. However for effective outcome, early identification and treatment should be the goal. This is possible with more sophistication in the science of addiction medicine. Thus, evolving of a specialty section of addiction medicine is the need of the day.",

      "abstract": "Somatisation is a phenomenon consisting in signalling complaints originating “from the body” (pain, discomfort, disturbances of physiological functions), whose cause is not explained on the basis of physical examination and additional examinations, and whose basis is usually an unconscious emotional factor. The most common somatic manifestations of negative emotions include abdominal pain, headache, palpitations or stabbing sensation in the chest, dizziness, shortness of breath, cough, squeezing sensation in the throat, numbness of limbs, as well as diarrhoea, vomiting or fainting. Although the described type of disorder occurs particularly often in people burdened with other mental problems, such as anxiety, depression or personality disorders, nowadays it is observed more and more often in children not showing any psychogenic abnormalities so far. A significant influence on the development of such symptoms has the environment of upbringing, from which the developing person draws behavioural patterns. In addition, the entire general social context with all its conditions, both positive and negative, is important. In the case of children, due to the lack of possibility of regular and constructive self-observation, developed abstract thinking and conscious, consistent verbalisation of inner experiences by the patient, the process of diagnosis and therapy of such disorders often requires diagnostic hospitalisation, multi-specialist consultations, long-term treatment in the outpatient mode, as well as at least partial modification of environmental relations, including the educational process. The fundamental issue remains the protection of mental health in the form of preventive measures aimed at creating existential conditions that have a positive impact on the mental development of children, which is particularly true of relations between generations.",

      "title": "Poor insight and psychosis",
      "abstract": "A variety of phenomena might be considered as reflecting impaired insight in psychosis, like failure to recognize signs, symptoms or disease, failure to derive appropriate cognitive representations, despite recognition of the disease, and misattribution of the source or cause of the disease. The unawareness of tardive dyskinesia symptoms in schizophrenic patients points that self-awareness deficits in schizophrenia may be domain specific. Poor insight is an independent phenomenological and a prevalent feature in psychotic disorders in general, and in schizophrenia in particular, but we don't know yet if delusions in schizophrenia are the result of an entirely normal attempt to account for abnormal perceptual experiences or a product of abnormal experience but of normal reasoning. The theoretical approaches regarding impaired insight include the disturbed perceptual input, the impaired linkage between thought and emotion and the breakdown of the process of self-monitoring and error checking. The inability to distinguish between internally and externally generated mental events has been described by the metarepresentation theory. This theory includes the awareness of ones' goals, which leads to disorders of willed action, the awareness of intention, which leads to movement disorders, and the awareness of intentions of others, which leads to paranoid delusions. The theory of metarepresentation implies mainly output mechanisms, like the frontal cortex, while the input mechanism implies posterior brain systems, including the parietal lobe. There are many similarities between the disturbances of awareness seen in schizophrenia and those seen as a result of known neurological impairment. Neuropsychological models of impaired insight typically attribute the disturbance to any of a variety of core deficits in the processing of information. In this respect, lack of insight is on conceptual par with alogia, apraxia or aphasia in reflecting disturbed cognitive processing. In this direction, research have implicated the role of self-monitoring in disorders of awareness and many of the core symptoms of schizophrenia, and has been suggested that these symptoms are the result of a disturbance of a medial frontal system involving anterior hippocampus, cingulated gyrus, supplementary motor area, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Poor insight seems to be something more than a symptom or an epi-phenomenon and its mechanism may constitute a core factor into the psychosis process. Also, poor insight would be involves a common mechanism for many other mental disorders or even it would be an independent and trans-diagnostic factor into the human personality, probably like the dimension of psychotism.",

      "abstract": "Psychische Schaeden als Unfallfolgen fuehren oft zum Rechtsstreit. Die Ursachen liegen darin, dass psychiatrische Diagnosen auf Verhaltensbeobachtung und Beschwerdeschilderung gruenden, sie sind deswegen mitunter kaum zu objektivieren. Wegen den Schwierigkeiten in der Diagnosestellung ist fuer die Beurteilung von Schaedigungsfolgen weniger die Diagnose, als vielmehr der gesicherte Nachweis konkreter Funktionsstoerungen geeignet. Bei der Untersuchung ist der Gutachter weitgehend auf die Mitwirkung des Untersuchten angewiesen. Eingeschraenkte Kooperativitaet ist daher ein Problem erstrangiger Bedeutung. Aus einer Diagnose folgt nicht, dass ein bestimmtes Ausmass an Beeintraechtigung vorliegt. Deshalb ist es unumgaenglich, die Beeintraechtigungen als Befund konkret nachzuweisen, zu bezeichnen und ihre Auswirkungen auf den Einzelfall darzulegen. Psychische Folgeschaeden von Unfaellen setzen einen psychischen Erstschadensbefund voraus. Deren Vorliegen kann aus den Berichten der Erstbehandler, aus den Polizeiberichten oder aus Augenzeugenaussagen hervorgehen. Probleme liegen hier in der Abgrenzung der normalen psychischen Betroffenheit nach einem Schadensereignis. Unerlaesslich ist eine Pruefung der zeitlichen Abfolge (Folge nach der Ursache), also ob aehnliche Befunde bereits vor dem Unfall bestanden haben. Bei den Stoerungsbildern dissoziative Bewegungsstoerungen und somative Stoerungen koennen durch den Untersucher keine krankhaften Befunde, bei der traumatischen Belastungsstoerung nur spaerliche Befunde erhoben werden.

Delusional theme includes life-like experiences, including: persecution – persecutory type –, suffering from a disease – somatic type –, to be loved by someone famous – erotomaniac type –, the partner is unfaithful – jealous type – or having a special quality or gift – megalomaniac type –. Usually, patients lack awareness of mental illness and often prior to contact with mental health, made a pilgrimage by different specialists looking for an organic explanation. The description of a case report of a 47-year-old male who has a delusional belief body deformity secondary to manipulation by a physiotherapist suffering a muscular pain in the lumbar region is performed. Prior to psychiatric diagnosis, begins a long journey by different specialists. As a consequence, somatic-type delusional disorder is a challenge in the diagnosis and treatment in the medical field because it is required a multidisciplinary approach for these patients.

      "abstract": "Posttraumatic stress disorder or PTSD is an extreme psycho-physiological response disorder that may occur in individuals who are exposed to a potentially traumatic event that can involve the subjectively profound threat of loss... of life or limb. To receive a PTSD diagnosis, reactions to the catastrophic or traumatic stressor must involve profound fear, helplessness, or horror. Furthermore, such individuals have to experience symptoms from three separate yet co-occurring symptom clusters. These clusters or domains include: 1) intrusive recollections or the re-experiencing of the event with accompanied intense psychological distress or physiologic reactivity; 2) persistent avoidance of activities, thoughts as well as feelings associated with the traumatic event; and, 3) increased or extreme arousal that may include an exaggerated startle response, hypervigilance, or insomnia (American Psychiatric Association, 1994; Uddin et al., 2010) To justify a PTSD diagnosis, symptoms must be present for at least one month, and impair an individual’s interpersonal, occupational, or social functioning (American Psychiatric Association, 1994). PTSD has been described as a specific phenotype that develops as the result of a failure to contain the normal stress response (Yehuda & LeDoux, 2007), resulting in dysregulation of the hypothalamic– pituitary–adrenal or HPA axis, a major stress response system of the body that interacts with the immune system to maintain homeostasis (Wong, 2002). PTSD-affected and unaffected individuals have distinct expression patterns in genes involved in immune activation (Segman et al., 2005; Zieke et al., 2007), and in genes that encode neural and endocrine proteins (Segman et al., 2005; Yehuda et al., 2009). Above all, PTSD is both an external and internal experience; that is, PTSD is an external catastrophic or traumatic event and an internal psycho-physiological experience.",

Estrictamente hablando, la simulación no es un trastorno mental sino un problema que puede ser objeto de atención clínica. Sin embargo, se presume erróneamente que la simulación podría darse solamente en contextos forenses, lo que dificulta su identificación en ámbitos clínicos. La “psicosis instrumental” es una variante de simulación consistente en el fingimiento de síntomas por parte de un individuo con diagnóstico subyacente de una psicosis primaria y que simula sus síntomas en momentos de estabilidad clínica. Se presentan dos casos de personas con diagnóstico primario de esquizofrenia que pueden ser considerados también como aparentes casos de psicosis instrumental.

      "abstract": "Abstract Dementia is characterized by an insidious and progressive loss of memory, disorientation, cognitive decline in other domains, and affective flattening. It is often accompanied by neuropsychological deficits such as aphasia, apraxia, agnosia, or disturbances in executive functioning including planning, organizing, and sequencing of events in a logical fashion. Behavioural symptoms such as withdrawal, depression, delusions, motor restlessness, wander-ing, or aggression may complicate dementia, particularly in advanced stages of the disorder. These behavioural symptoms may occur, in part, secondary to loss of orientation and memory, with loss of autobiographic memory perhaps being most devastating. A patient, for example, who is impaired in retrieving past social interactions from autobiographical memory or recalling other relevant personal information may be more likely to respond with increasing irritability or anxiety in situations that are actually or perceived unfamiliar. Such a patient may perhaps choose a ‘safety first’ strategy or remain captured in indecisiveness, which could manifest in ruminating thinking and stereotyped behaviour, or displacement activities expressing motivational conflict and ambivalence. In any event, the combination of memory loss with other cognitive disturbances certainly leads to a profound deterioration of social competence. It is also noteworthy that, in addition to the problems the patients have themselves, which they generally deny except in the earliest stages of the disorder (anosognosia), dementia creates a substantial burden on patients’ spouses, children and other carers.",

Negative attitudes towards people with mental illness are attributed to stigma. In the literature, stigma is regarded as something that is attached to a person--like a badge or label. This is undermined by two facts. Firstly, it is the person who is regarded as disgraceful, not the illness or diagnosis, and secondly, the diagnosis of mental illness is itself evaluative. Mental illness is by definition bad, so to be diagnosed as mentally ill is to be defined as bad (or somehow wrong). The stigmatization of the mentally ill will not stop until this negative evaluation is removed from diagnosis.",

It has become a paradigmatic psychiatric disorder while remaining something of an enigma. Defined by a syndrome of psychotic phenomena (positive phenomena such as delusions, hallucinations or disordered thought structure) and negative features resulting from motivation and emotional dysfunction, schizophrenia is defined by symptoms lasting at least 4 weeks and impairment for 6 months or more [1, 2]. Where the illness is short-lived, the clinical syndrome is defined as a schizophrenia-related diagnosis [1]. The clinical presentation usually encompasses features prominent in other psychiatric conditions such as cognitive dysfunction, motor abnormalities, obsessional phenomena or depression. These additional features not included in the definition of schizophrenia underscore its pervasive neural dysfunction; they influence management and often shape the clinical outcome. The seeds of schizophrenia may be sown in early life with aberrant childhood development in multiple domains [2], but the clinical syndrome typically presents in early adulthood (Figure 9.10.1); abnormal neural connectivity may underly these seemingly remote phenomena.",

      "title": "Medically unexplained symptoms",
      "abstract": "The term medically unexplained symptoms refers to physical symptoms for which there is either no or insufficient evidence of any underlying conventional disease/disorder process. There is a wide spectrum of severity ranging from essentially normal experience (e.g. an occasional headache) to symptoms which result in severe and long-standing disability. Where symptoms group together in clusters suggestive of a link to a particular bodily system, they have been termed functional somatic syndromes. The term somatoform disorders refers to a specific set of formal psychiatric diagnoses involving conditions which predominantly present with physical symptoms or a worry about physical disease. Only people at the more severe end of the medically unexplained symptoms spectrum meet criteria for one of the somatoform disorders and there is considerable dissatisfaction with the current psychiatric classification system for these conditions, which is discussed later in this chapter. Functional somatic syndromes By the time most people with medically unexplained symptoms are referred to a liaison psychiatrist, they are likely to have picked up a label of one or more of the functional somatic syndromes (e.g. irritable bowel syndrome, functional dyspepsia, fibromyalgia). Many different functional syndromes have been described over the past 30 years according to different symptom clusters (Table 6.1). There is considerable overlap in symptoms between different functional conditions and somatoform disorders, yet most of these syndromes are studied as if they are discrete conditions within particular medical specialties, with a focus on the specific set of somatic symptoms, which are specialty specific. There is still uncertainty as to the degree of overlap of these conditions and the relative common factors they may share. In one study, Fink et al (2007) studied 978 patients admitted to hospital from primary care and a medical and neurological department who scored highly on somatic screening measures. They found that patients complained of a median of five functional somatic symptoms (women six and men four). Principal component analysis identified three symptom groups explaining 37% of the variance: cardiopulmonary, musculoskeletal and gastrointestinal. Further analysis showed that the symptom groups were not discrete and patients were likely to report symptoms from different groups, suggesting that the groups were different manifestations of a common latent phenomenon: bodily distress.",

      "abstract": "Psychic activity relies on the physiological processes occurring in the brain. When disruptive factors, such as alcohol consumption or hallucinogenic substances intervene, the product of nervous activity, known as the psyche, becomes disturbed, resulting in perception, thought, and behavioral disorders. The psyche can be considered a fascinating mechanism oscillating between extremes: it can be both objective and subjective; both material and ideal. Additionally, the psyche manifests itself both normally and pathologically. Regarding the ways the psyche manifests, distinct categories can be identified. Appropriate behavior exhibited by individuals defines the normal psyche, while the pathological psyche exhibits unusual behavioral disorders often deemed immoral. The term \"normality\" is ambiguous and encompasses several meanings:It can refer to a person's discernment in psychiatric expert evaluations for judicial purposes; It can be associated broadly with individual health; It represents physical, mental, and social well-being; Psychiatrically, it is defined by the absence of mental illness. Medico-legal psychiatric examinations play a crucial role in justice, providing data to assess the responsibility of individuals who have committed criminal acts. To promote ethical principles and lawful conduct, preventive and intervention measures must be devised for cases involving antisocial defiance and social maladaptation. The pathological psyche is characterized by biological and/or psycho-behavioral changes that cause distress, disability, or a high risk of such outcomes (according to the American Psychiatric Association, 1994).",

Other aspects of personality are best understood as traits, rather than “disorders,” or as symptomatic changes that are acute and occur lower in the hierarchy of diagnosis than mood or psychotic states, and are caused by the latter. The common report of purported comorbidity is seen as an overestimation, with personality changes often being part of other conditions.

Psychiatric illness offers a special challenge in that few psychiatric diagnoses have associated physical pathology but are diagnosed purely on subjective report. This leaves those with psychiatric illness potentially open to the accusation their illnesses are merely feigned. Theoretically, malingering is distinguished from psychiatric illness by the absence of psychopathology, the identification of ‘secondary gain’, and a conscious intent to deceive in order to obtain the gain. However, psychopathology is hypothetical, secondary gain is non-specific, and the determination of the extent that intent is conscious probably impossible.",

Most often, psychoses develop in the framework of so-called endogenous disorder. The concepts of psychosis and schizophrenia are often equated, which is incorrect as psychotic disorders can occur in a number of mental illnesses: Alzheimer's disease and other types of dementia, chronic alcoholism, drug addiction, epilepsy, intellectual disabilities, etc. Other types of psychosis, such as infectious, somatic and intoxication psychoses are quite often find among patients in non-psychiatric practices.

Diagnosing TBI currently depends on a thorough history and the patient's status at the time of injury, and there is currently no single objective test or diagnostic biomarker for concussion/mild TBI (mTBI). Advancing diagnostic efforts, the U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command is funding biomarker studies to identify the unique biological effects of TBI and leverage knowledge to develop more objective diagnostic tools to determine the severity of brain injury. TBI severity within the DoD are currently classified as mild/moderate/severe (1). Concussion/mTBI involves normal structural imaging, LOC for up to 30 min, alteration of consciousness up to 24 h, and post-traumatic amnesia up to 24 h. If a patient meets criteria in more than one category of severity, the provider assigns the higher severity level. Definition standardization remains a problem as concussion grading systems and definitions published by various organizations make comparing findings from various research studies extremely difficult. A collaborative effort among the DoD, Veterans Health Administration, Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, the Brain Trauma Foundation, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is developing a medically useful definition and staging criteria for mTBI/concussion. We live in a sport-crazed society, and although injury is usually an accepted consequence of “playing the game,” there is a heightened awareness about sport concussions. Pick up a newspaper, or watch the evening news or “Sports Center,” and you're bound to read or hear something about sport concussions. The media are obsessed with this topic, particularly with the negative news that makes headlines and ultimately sells newspapers. Even so, there is good news to report, and progress is being made. Forty-nine states have passed concussion laws in the past 4 years, aimed at educating athletes, parents, and coaches about the symptoms of concussion and the dangers of continuing to play while still symptomatic. According to the CDC, Emergency Department diagnosis of youth sport concussions has increased by an estimated 60% over the past decade (2). Surprisingly, this is good news, as it speaks to the increased public awareness and better recognition of concussion, as opposed to an increase in actual concussions. Concussion remains a major military concern given the short- and long-term impacts to our service members; recent conflicts have sparked an increase in TBI research funding designed to accelerate medical innovation. There were 266,810 service members in the DoD from 2000 to 2012 who were diagnosed with TBI—81.7% of these injuries concussions (3). Although the risk for TBI is certainly higher in the combat environment, the majority of these injuries (83.4%) is actually nondeployment-associated (3). In parallel to sport-concussion awareness, military medicine has also taken significant policy steps to promote early identification and concussion treatment (4). In 2010, the DoD published a policy mandating that any deployed service member involved in a potentially concussive event (such as 50 m from a blast, vehicle collision or rollover, blow to the head, etc.) receive a medical evaluation using the Military Acute Concussion Evaluation; receive a minimum 24 h of downtime, even if he was not diagnosed with a concussion; and must be re-evaluated prior to returning to duty (5). Since then, the DoD has screened over 14,950 deployed service members for concussion and has staffed 11 Concussion Care Centers in Afghanistan that promote concussion recovery and medical oversight (internal DoD data; personal communication). The U.S. Army is implementing this concept worldwide to ensure one standard of concussion care, whether the injury occurs on the battlefield or in garrison. The Veterans Administration-DoD Clinical Practice Guidelines (6) were rated as the highest concussion-management guideline in a 2011 edition of Brain Injury (7). Beginning in 2009, the DoD has published numerous TBI clinical recommendations in collaboration with civilian experts in the areas of cognitive rehabilitation, driving assessment, postinjury neurocognitive testing in the deployed environment, management of neuroendocrine dysfunction, assessment and treatment of dizziness, and management of visual dysfunction (8), and an additional three clinical recommendations will be published this year to include graded return to activity, sleep disturbances, and use of neuroimaging. The tests for detecting concussion and tracking recovery are becoming more sensitive, especially when used in combination with other tools to create a multimodal approach to concussion assessment. Despite all that has been accomplished, caring for service members and athletes at risk for sustaining cerebral concussion has always been a challenging task and never more so than in today's litigious society. Concussion is different from other injuries, in that we still rely heavily on an athlete's or a service member's subjective reporting of symptoms for decisionmaking, and we lack the neuroimaging protocols that might allow us to identify the damage and understand its severity. The cause-and-effect relationships, or lack of same, between repetitive head trauma and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer and chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) are the subject of significant debate. Several published case reports have described tau deposits in the brains of deceased contact-sport athletes, but most of the neuroscience community does not believe that controlled experimental research has yet identified a causal relationship linking repetitive head trauma in sports and CTE(9–12). Innovative neuroimaging techniques are on the horizon and will eventually permit tau and other proteins to be traced in vivo. This should allow for prospective investigations comparing head-impact exposure with tau accumulation, leading to earlier detection and interventions for these chronic neurodegenerative diseases. In the meantime, our responsibility is to safely care for our service members and athletes, to educate them about what is known and unknown regarding the long-term effects of repetitive head trauma, and to ensure that family members, coaches, and military unit leaders implement supportive recovery practices. Unfortunately, the large amount of misinformation on this topic sometimes results in hysteria rather than rational thinking. Concussions are like snowflakes: no two are alike, and no cookbook or calendar can specify exactly how they should be treated. Therefore, we need to go the extra mile. In many cases, it's a matter of counseling our service members and our athletes about the short- and long-term risks of not reporting symptoms, returning to play or duty while still experiencing symptoms, or not modifying risky behaviors that can predispose them to future concussions. We need individualized and sport-specific return-to-play progressions that ensure that service members and athletes are physically and cognitively prepared to return to activity. No checkbox system can be applied to every concussion, and as concussions are diverse and unique injuries that affect each athlete differently, we must learn how to treat them individually. Likewise, concussed service members and athletes are unique, and we must work to understand what makes them different. Sports medicine clinicians must play the important role of counselor to our athletes. Getting to know each athlete's mindset and reaction to injuries allows us to build trust and forge honest lines of communications, thus enabling us to develop an appropriate and individualized plan for managing concussion, which is just as vital as knowing how to interpret the results of a cognitive or balance test. Within a 6-month period, four major consensus or evidence-based documents focused on concussion management will have been released, including the new “Zurich International Guidelines” or the Consensus Statement on Concussion in Sport: the 4th International Conference on Concussion in Sport (13–16). This, along with other manuscripts published or soon to be published by the American Medical Society for Sports Medicine, the American Academy of Neurology, and the National Athletic Trainers' Association, should all be mandatory reading for sports medicine clinicians, as they will define the standard of care for sports medicine clinicians for at least the next 4–5 years. These documents are well-prepared and will make significant contributions to the sports medicine community. The landscape is changing, and these evidence-based guidelines are leading us in a better direction. Although the neuroscience community has learned much about concussion in the last two decades, we admittedly have much more to investigate and to understand.",

      "title": "Functional gastrointestinal disorders",
      "abstract": "When clinicians label a child as having a functional disorder there is often a pejorative connotation that the symptoms are psychological, imagined, or faked. These symptoms range from chronic abdominal pain to recurrent headaches to fatigue. We say the complaints are functional because we are unable to demonstrate any structural or biochemical abnormality causing them. The degree to which we go searching for these abnormalities varies from case to case and often depends oh our own clinical experience, insecurities, and demands of the patient's family. Labeling a child as having a functional complaint can put a tremendous burden on the child and family, because if this concept is presented improperly (as implied above), it can suggest that it is their fault there are symptoms arid that if they “got their act together” the symptoms would melt away. Functional gastrointestinal disorders are defined as conditions in which a variable combination of chronic or recurrent gastrointestinal symptoms are present in the absence of demonstrable disease. There may indeed be physiologic abnormalities underlying the symptoms, but at the present time we are unable to detect them. We make a diagnosis based on symptoms, not on demonstrable abnormalities in physical examination or laboratory tests. A number of common pediatric diagnoses fall into this category, including infant regurgitation, chronic nonspecific diarrhea, irritable bowel syndrome, non-ulcer dyspepsia, infant dyschezia, and functional constipation. This paper presents a brief review of our current understanding of each diagnosis and gives suggestions for management. Curr Open Pediatr 1999, 11375–378 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.",

      "abstract": "Cognitive symptoms such as poor memory and concentration represent a common cause of morbidity among patients presenting to general practitioners and may result in referral for a neurological opinion. In many cases, these symptoms do not relate to an underlying neurological disease or dementia. In this article we present a personal perspective on the differential diagnosis of cognitive symptoms in the neurology clinic, especially as this applies to patients who seek advice about memory problems but have no neurological disease process. These overlapping categories include the following 'functional' categories: 1) cognitive symptoms as part of anxiety or depression; 2) \"normal\" cognitive symptoms that become the focus of attention; 3) isolated functional cognitive disorder in which symptoms are outwith 'normal' but not explained by anxiety; 4) health anxiety about dementia; 5) cognitive symptoms as part of another functional disorder; and 6) retrograde dissociative (psychogenic) amnesia. Other 'non-dementia' diagnoses to consider in addition are 1) cognitive symptoms secondary to prescribed medication or substance misuse; 2) diseases other than dementia causing cognitive disorders; 3) patients who appear to have functional cognitive symptoms but then go on to develop dementia/another neurological disease; and finally 4) exaggeration/malingering. We discuss previous attempts to classify the problem of functional cognitive symptoms, the importance of making a positive diagnosis for the patient, and the need for large cohort studies to better define and manage this large group of patients.",

One or the other is not enough. You need both. You do not need a scan or lab test to make the diagnosis. No scan or test can “rule in” or “rule out” concussion. You do not need to perform a detailed neurological exam to make the diagnosis. The neurological exam is usually unremarkable except for immediately after the concussion. No exam findings “rule in” or “rule out” concussion. A collateral source is key to obtaining a reliable history. The impairment in brain function occurs immediately after the event. The impairment is worst immediately after the event, then gradually improves. There is no other obvious explanation for the impairment.",

In this paper, we present the first reported case of factitious pedophilia. Although it seems counterintuitive, this middle-aged man has falsely claimed or exaggerated sexual desire for minors ostensibly to remain in a state hospital; indeed, he has remained in the same inpatient facility for more than 20 years as a result of his deceptions. At times, his reports have included disconfirmed claims of bizarre accidents and other physical travails. This case enlarges the literature on factitious psychological disorders and shows that some individuals may falsify paraphilic behaviors, although clearly minimization of these behaviors remains more common.",

      "abstract": "Drowsiness is one of the cardinal symptoms of motion sickness; therefore, a symptom-complex centering around \"drowsiness\" has been identified which, for convenience, has been termed the sopite syndrome. Generally, the symptoms characterizing this syndrome are interwoven with other symptoms but under two circumstances the sopite syndrome comprises the main or sole overt manifestation of motion sickness. One circumstance is that in which the intensity of the eliciting stimuli is closely matched to a person's susceptibility, and the sopite syndrome is evoked either before other symptoms of motion sickness appear or in their absence. The second circumstance occurs during prolonged exposure in a motion environment when adaptation results in the disappearance of motion sickness symptoms, except for responses characterizing the sopite syndrome. Typical symptoms of the syndrome are: 1) yawning, 2) drowsiness, 3) disinclination for work, either physical or mental, and 4) lack of participation in group activities. Phenomena derived from an analysis of the symptomatology of the sopite syndrome are qualitatively similar but may differ quantitatively from abstractions derived in other motion sickness responses. One example is the sometimes unique time course of the sopite syndrome. This implies that the immediate eliciting mechanisms not only differ from those involved in evoking other symptoms, but, also, that they must represent first order responses. Diagnosis is difficult unless the syndrome under discussion is kept in mind. Prevention poses a greater problem than treatment.",

      "title": "Alterations in the Immune Response, Apoptosis and Synaptic Plasticity in Posttraumatic Stress Disorder: Molecular Indicators and Relation to Clinical Symptoms",
      "abstract": "Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (ICD-10 codes: F43.1, F62.0; DSM-IV-TR code: 309.81) [1, 2] is a complex severe and chronic psychiatric illness influenced by environmental and genetic factors [3-10]. PTSD is an anxiety disorder developed in a person experiencing, wit‐ nessing, or learning about an extreme physically or psychologically distressing event, asso‐ ciated with unprecedented violence [11, 12]. Traumatic events that can trigger PTSD include massacres, mass murder scenes, international, civil, political, ethnic and religious wars, gen‐ ocides, natural and man-made disasters, criminal assaults, serious accidents, terrorist at‐ tacks, incarceration, trafficking, rape and other types of sexual assaults [12-17], life threatening illness and the sudden death of a loved one, serious medical illness, injury, sur‐ gery, hostage, kidnapping, difficult labors, etc [18-20]. Individuals who experience a trauma of this nature may develop symptoms that fall into three distinct clusters: re-experiencing phenomenon; avoidance and numbing; and autonomic hyperarousal. Symptoms usually be‐ gin within the first 3 months after the traumatic event and last for many years, although there may be a delay of months, or even years, before symptoms appear. PTSD patients are characterized by severe emotional state, sharp reduction in adaptive and information receiv‐ ing abilities. They usually remain out of society, become drug addicted, alcoholic and often commit suicide [21-24]. Degrees of risk to develop PTSD from different traumatic events are presented in table 1.",

      "title": "Disability and mental illness are different entities and should be assessed separately",
      "abstract": "The acceptance of the conceptual position presented by Üstün and Kennedy is of great importance for psychiatry and for medicine as a whole. Disability — whether defined as a functional impairment in terms of the DSM-IV or as a limitation of an individual's activities as is done in the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) 1 — must be assessed separately and not as a part of the individual's mental illness. It would be wrong to make the diagnosis dependent on the presence or absence of disability. Disability is produced by mental disorder, but it also depends on simultaneously present comorbid diseases or impairments. The latter is becoming a consideration of growing importance. A significant proportion of people with mental illness also suffer from physical illnesses and it is therefore difficult if not impossible to assess to what an extent the disability is caused by the mental disorder and to what extent it is produced by the comorbid conditions. Disability must refer to the person who suffers from a disease (or diseases), lives in a particular setting, receives a particular treatment and has personality traits that define the way in which he or she will live with a disease. Assets that a person with a disease might have — be it an artistic gift or access to wealth — will also affect the occurrence and severity of disability. The realization that the disability is linked to the person and not to the disease is of significance in developing rehabilitation services, in assessing the levels of support that society will offer to the disabled person and in determining what treatment can be offered if a disease occurs. Psychopathological findings define diagnosis but must be complemented by other assessments if they are to help in the estimation of \"caseness\" relevant to the provision of services or the estimation of needs for them. \"Caseness\" will be defined taking into account the psycho-pathological findings, the disability and the distress that the individual presents and relates to his or her medical/psychiatric condition. Persons with a particular psychiatric diagnosis can become \"cases\" for the mental health services when their disability is more pronounced (e.g., because of changes of the environment) or when their distress is enhanced (e.g., by learning about the prognosis of their condition). In clinical work and for research purposes, the assessment of the presence of a disorder, of disability and of distress must be accompanied by an estimate of their severity. The severity of the disease is usually assessed with reference to the numbers and the frequency of occurrence of symptoms, the severity of disability by the type and number of activities in which the individual cannot take part, and the severity of distress on the basis of analogy with states that the distressed individual and the diagnostician both know and have experienced. Severity can be measured as a dimension or as a feature that divides into several operationally defined categories. The same is true for disability and for distress, but not for the psychopathological symptoms, which must have features that make them recognizable as being qualitatively different from normal functioning. Severity of distress and severity of disability are usually correlated with the severity of the clinical syndrome, but this is not always the case. Distress might be linked to the vision of the future rather than to the level of disability or the severity of the clinical condition. The possibility that a black wart might be a melanoma will cause great distress although there are no limitations of activity and no certainty that the wart contains cells that are malignant or that it will be growing rapidly. The severity of disability might be linked to the severity of the clinical picture, but this is also not so for most of the time a person has a disease — with the exception of the most severe states of the disorder, for example in profound dementia or in a coma. People with a variety of psychopathological symptoms are often living in their community, with little or no limitation of their activity. The usefulness of the framework presented above for research purposes depends on the possibility of measuring syndromes, disability, distress and their severity in reliable and valid ways. The development of instruments that will help researchers to do this is clearly a major challenge for the ICD and the DSM committees. The usefulness of the same framework for clinical practice will depend on making the need for these measurements explicit and on training practitioners in making the necessary assessments. Practitioners have used the four dimensions mentioned above in dealing with people who came to ask for their help ever since medicine has been invented. A study of the way in which clinicians are operating may give precious information about their methods of assessment, which, when combined with results of research using valid and reliable assessment instruments, might allow the creation of training programmes that will make the classification of diseases accepted and used as a basis for research and for practice.",

      "title": "Impairment Tutorial: Personality Disorders in Disability Arena",
      "abstract": "Personality disorders are conditions that can complicate impairment and disability assessment. It is important that the evaluating physician recognize these disorders. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition (DSM-IV)1 defines ten specific personality disorders in addition to an eleventh condition, Personality Disorder NOS, which allows for combined features of the various personality disorders as well as personality conditions which are not specifically listed. The ten listed personality disorders are divided into three clusters.Personality disorders represent enduring patterns of inner experience and behavior that deviate markedly from those expected by the individual—s culture. These inflexible and pervasive patterns reflect problems with cognition, affectivity, interpersonal functioning and impulse control, and lead to clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational or other important areas of functioning. By their very nature, personality disorders are often unrecognized by those who suffer from them, who tend to blame others for their problems. There may be comorbidity with various conditions, such as pain disorder, depression, anxiety disorders, posttraumatic stress disorder and substance abuse. Personality disorders may be undiagnosed by healthcare providers, which can be particularly troublesome when disability benefits are involved.These personality disorders are occasionally present in people involved in litigation. Of this group, Paranoid Personality Disorder, in which a person suspects, without sufficient basis, that others are exploitative, harmful, or deceitful, is probably the most common in the legal arena. Such people tend to bear grudges, read hidden meaning into benign remarks, and to believe that their reputations are under attack. The other Cluster A personality disorders result in significant social detachment or isolation and are less likely to be present in plaintiffs or workers—compensation claimants.These personality disorders are more prevalent in the legal arena, perhaps because people suffering from these conditions feel comfortable with and may seek to be the focus of attention. Of this group, probably the most prevalent disorder in the legal disability arena is borderline personality. Such people may suffer from frantic efforts to avoid perceived abandonment, patterns of unstable and intense interpersonal relationships, an identity disturbance, and impulsivity. They may exhibit suicidal behavior, gestures, and threats, affective instability, chronic feelings of emptiness, intense displays of anger, transient dissociative symptoms, and stress-related paranoid ideation. Histrionic individuals have a pattern of excessive emotionality and attention seeking behavior. Narcissistic individuals have a pattern of grandiosity, a need for admiration, and a lack of empathy for others. Antisocial individuals have long-term disregard for the rights of others. In my experience, legal issues involving individuals with cluster B personality disorders often involve determination of causation of the person—s problems, an assessment of claims of harassment, and an assessment of the person—s fitness for employment.These disorders also are encountered in legal situations. Obsessive-compulsive personality disordered individuals who may have functioned at a high professional level, such as in the legal and medical professions, may be seeking disability benefits through private or group disability insurance plans. Dependent personality disordered patients encounter difficulty making everyday decisions; they tend to let others assume responsibility, have trouble with self-assertion, and have excessive need for nurturance and support. Such individuals—psychological need to be cared for perpetuates a disabled posture with respect to family and medical caregivers. These underlying issues tend to reinforce chronic pain syndromes and perpetuate claims for disability benefits, leading to potential diagnostic dilemmas concerning the cause of ongoing problems.The following case vignettes, which are composites of various case histories, help to illustrate these points.A thirty-five year old sawmill worker suffered a partial index and ring finger amputation in his non-dominant hand. He had suffered two prior significant accidents while working elsewhere in his twenties. In one of those accidents, he sustained a lumbar compression fracture when he fell from a platform; in the other, a mild traumatic brain injury when he was struck by falling pieces of lumber. After all of the injuries, there was a pattern of prolonged disability, chronic pain behavior, narcotics dependence, and increased explosive and threatening behavior.The injured worker gave a history of conflict with others since early adolescence. He had a history of mistrust, believing that others were cheating him and that his wife was unfaithful. Although greatly perturbed by his wife—s unsubstantiated infidelity, he was not at all concerned about the impact on his wife and children of his own infidelity. His accusations caused considerable turmoil at home. He had a long history of believing that he was being persecuted by his employers, family, police, neighbors, and acquaintances, lacking insight into the provocative nature of his own behavior. He thought that others tampered with his equipment at work and deliberately miscalculated his work output in order to cheat him, even though there was no supporting evidence. He had a history of recurrent fights, exacerbated by alcoholism and narcotics use, and of friction with the police.The evaluee suffered from Personality Disorder NOS with marked paranoid features, and this significantly colored his reaction to his traumatic amputation. His tendency to blame others for an accident that was due to his own misjudgment, his turbulent relationships at work, and his belief that he was being persecuted by the employer and coworkers severely impacted his ability to return to work and to be rehabilitated. His psychological problems were due to his underlying personality disorder, exacerbated by both substance abuse and the work injury. In the particular jurisdiction in which he was evaluated, the worsening of his psychological condition due to his work injury was deemed compensable by the workers—compensation hearing officer.A thirty-one year old woman was sexually harassed by a male supervisor in a factory where she was employed for seven months. The harassment began with occasional sexual comments, which at first seemed casual. When the remarks were not met with firm rejection, the supervisor escalated his behavior and made the employee feel very uncomfortable.At the time of the harassment, the employee was going through a divorce and a custody battle. Her husband, a cocaine dealer, had been released from prison one year previously. The evaluee had two prior failed marriages, both to jealous, abusive, controlling individuals. Her current husband seemed more interested in retribution for an affair that she had had when he was imprisoned than in working or providing for their two children.The employee had a long history of unstable and intense interpersonal relationships. She had a history since adolescence of mood swings with recurrent periods of anxiety, depression, and stress-related paranoid thinking. She had a pattern of self-abusive behavior, recurrently burning herself with matches and superficially cutting her forearms, abdomen, and legs with razor blades. The repetitive burning caused keloid formation on her forearms, which served to exacerbate her negative self-perception. She was perceived as flirtatious and often wore halter-tops and low-cut blouses to work, even in winter.The employee had a history of ongoing cocaine abuse and a past history of amphetamine addiction. She had a history of multiple failed relationships and impulsive behavior, but was socially engaging. She was perceived by others as a fun person when things were going well, but was quick to react with rage and feel abandoned. At such times, she contemplated suicide, and had a history of two brief psychiatric hospitalizations for overdoses. She had been in outpatient psychotherapy off and on since her teens, with four different therapists, and had been prescribed various benzodiazepines (which she abused) and antidepressants.In this case, the person—s psychological difficulties were due to a borderline personality disorder and substance abuse. The job-related sexual harassment was inappropriate and uncomfortable, but was not determined to be the cause of her psychological difficulties.",

In Japan, a number of psychopathological and psychotherapeutic studies have been performed since the 1930s on a pathological condition similar to SAD, known as Taijin-kyofu (TK). TK, especially the convinced subtype of TK (c-TK; also known as the offensive subtype of TK), is described as a culture-bound syndrome similar to SAD. In proposed DSM-5 draft, it is suggested to add \"offending others\" to fear of being humiliating or embarrassing which were indicated in DSM-IV. It is interesting that fearing of making another person uncomfortable or \"offending others\" is consistent with symptom which has been investigated through c-TK in particular.

      "title": "CS03-04 - Concept of somatoform disorder",
      "abstract": "Patients presenting with bodily symptoms and complaints that are not sufficiently explained by organic pathology or well known pathophysiological mechanisms present a major challenge to any health delivery system. From a perspective of psychiatric classification these medically unexplained somatic symptoms may be diagnosed as primary psychiatric disorders such as depressive and anxiety disorders on the one hand, as somatoform disorders on the other. Among medical specialties a separate diagnostic approach is taken to conceptualize functional somatic syndromes. Unfortunately, both diagnostic systems do not conform to each other very well. The concept of somatoform disorders as outlined in DSM-III to DSM-IV-TR and in ICD-10 refers to a group of heterogeneous disorders with prominent somatic symptoms or special body-focussed anxieties, or convictions of illness. These disorders seem to indicate medical conditions that cannot, however, fully be explained either in terms of medical diagnostics or of other primary psychiatric disorders. There is one major conceptual assumption that postulates a decisive impact of psychosocial stress on the origin, onset and/or course of these somatic symptoms and complaints. And there is one major path of diagnostic steps to be taken, i.e. just to count the number of medically unexplained somatic symptoms, to determine their reference to any main organ system, to prove that they are not self-induced, to put special stress on prevailing pain symptoms and to separately assess dominant health anxieties or illness convictions. Since introduction of the diagnostic concept of somatoform disorders there have been arising many critical issues regarding the soundness of this diagnostic category. These issues, among other things, refer to a problematic mind-body dichotomy overemphasizing psychosocial and psychological factors and neglecting major neurobiological processes, to the impracticable criterion of “medically unexplained”, to the demand of conceptual clarity and coherence of this diagnostic category, to the rather trivial diagnostic procedure of just counting the number of medically unexplained somatic symptoms whereas not assessing typical dimensions of illness behaviour in a corresponding way, to the major overlap between subgroups of somatoform disorders on the one hand and factitious disorders, anxiety disorders and depressive disorders on the other, to a principal focus on the epidemiologically rare condition of somatisation disorder as core disorder thereby undervaluing much more prevalent subthreshold conditions, to the difficult communication of the whole diagnostic group to medical colleagues dealing with the same problems by using a different conceptual approach, however. These critical issues surrounding the concept of somatoform disorder will be reflected in respect of some major revisions projected in future diagnostic classification systems of DSM-V and ICD-11.",

The divergence, but above all the analogies between hysterical symptoms and such limits are underlined, showing the frequency of succession with time, associations and transitional forms (\"somatisation disorder\" of the DSM III, psychogenic pain, and psychosomatic disorders termed \"psychofunctional\").",

The early psychoanalytic formulations of Abraham<sup>1</sup>and Freud<sup>2</sup>of the depressive reaction long ago became identified with the notions of self-accusation, guilt, and selfdestruction, so that nearly every depressive reaction was viewed either as resulting from or including the turning of the original object-directed aggression against the self, or from the internalized aggression against the incorporated loved and hated object. In such depressed patients, the tendency to express aggression against others has been seen as either denied, suppressed, or repressed, and hostile feelings toward the significant other not admitted into awareness where they would arouse painful guilt feelings. One more recent psychoanalytic position<sup>3</sup>is that depression is associated with denial, or repression of aggression, aimed at preserving the original love object",

According to the DSM‐IV‐TR (American Psychiatric Association, 2000), the diagnosis applies to individuals who develop a requisite number of symptoms after experiencing, witnessing, or being confronted with an event that involved perceived or threatened loss of life, serious injury, or loss of physical integrity and that evoked fear, helplessness, or horror (e.g., military combat, sexual or physical assault, serious accidents, and major disasters). DSM‐IV‐TR organizes the symptoms of PTSD under three clusters: (1) reexperiencing (e.g., intrusive thoughts, nightmares, flashbacks, and psychophysiological reactivity to reminders of the trauma), (2) avoidance and emotional numbing (e.g., avoiding stimuli associated with the trauma and inability to experience a full range of emotions), and (3) hyperarousal (e.g., hypervigilance, exaggerated startle response, and sleep disruption). By definition, these symptoms must persist for more than 1 month after the trauma and produce clinically significant distress and/or impairment.",

      "abstract": "In this chapter, we cover aggression associated with psychiatric, neurological, and general medical conditions. The focus is on hostile behaviors that threaten or inflict harm. Definitions of aggression, violence, and related terms used in this chapter are in Table 6–1 . Although most aggression involves intent to harm, the definition we use does not require it because clinically important aggressive behavior can occur in the absence of demonstrable intent—such as in patients with cognitive disorders. We set aside behaviors that may be characterized as agitation, such as yelling, screaming, and other nonthreatening outbursts; oppositional and resisting behaviors; intrusiveness; and fidgeting, pacing, and other hyperkinetic actions. We also do not address community violence or criminality. Terms used in this chapter Aggression Hostile, threatening, and violent actions directed at person(s) or object(s), sometimes with no (or trivial) provocation Violence Overtly aggressive actions directed at person(s) or object(s) Domestic violence Behaviors directed against an intimate partner, ranging from verbal abuse to threats and intimidation to sexual assault and violence Agitation A state of pathologically intense emotional arousal and motor restlessness Disinhibition A state in which the individual's capacity for preemptive evaluation and restraint of behavioral responses is decreased or lost Impulsivity A state characterized by a proneness to act without thought or self-restraint; a habitual tendency toward \"hair-trigger\" actions Irritability A state of abnormally low tolerance in which the individual is easily provoked to anger and hostility Psychiatrists mainly encounter aggression and violence when patients present for treatment in acutely ill states. Aggression may present as a complication of delusional psychoses, dementia, delirium, intoxication, personality disorders, and even adjustment disorder. It may complicate nonpsychiatric illnesses because it can develop when patients feel disregarded, dissatisfied, frustrated, confused, frightened, disenfranchised, thwarted, or angered by perceived mistreatment. Aggression can be perpetrated by men or women and by individuals of any age (except early infancy). It is seen in all patient care settings—outpatient clinics, inpatient units, rehabilitation programs, residential and custodial care facilities, nursing homes, and emergency departments (EDs). Aggressive behavior can result in involuntary confinement (in hospitals and jails), disruption of clinical and custodial care environments, longer hospital stays, and physical injury to patients, their caregivers, and their health care providers. Family members, home health aides, and health professionals who are repeatedly exposed to aggression generally experience demoralization, which adversely affects the quality of care the patient receives. In this chapter, we focus on aggression and violence in the medically ill, beginning with the frequency, correlates, risk factors, and causes of aggressive and violent behaviors in diverse clinical settings, with reference to the host, agent, and environment causal model. We also discuss elder abuse and intimate partner violence, which are not necessarily manifestations of illness but are important causes and correlates of psychiatric and medical morbidity (we do not address child abuse). We review the evaluation, case formulation, and differential diagnosis of aggression and the management of aggressive behavior in the general hospital, including the ED.",

The term ‘atypical pain’ is most unsatisfactory, as it really means nothing to any observer except to the person who originally coined the phrase for pain which seemed to be an atypical variant of some other recognized condition.

      "title": "Pain Is An Uncomfortable Sensation",
      "abstract": "Pain is an uncomfortable sensation that indicates that the body is damaged or threatened with injury. Pain starts at special pain receptors that are found all over the body. These pain receptors transmit messages as electrical impulses along nerves to the spinal cord and then upward to the brain. Sometimes the signal when it reaches the spinal cord elicits a reflex response. When this happens, the signal is immediately sent back by the motor nerve to the site of pain, encouraging the muscles to tighten. An example of a reflex reaction is an immediate withdrawal reaction after something very hot is inadvertently touched. The pain signal is also transmitted to the brain. Only when the brain processes the signal and perceives it as pain does the person become aware of it. Pain felt in some areas of the body does not have to indicate exactly where the problem is, because the pain can be transferred to another area. Transmitted pain occurs because signals from several areas of the body often go to the spinal cord and brain through the same nerve pathways. The ability to endure pain varies with mood, personality, and conditions. Pain can change greatly with age. As people get older, they complain less about pain, perhaps because changes in the body reduce the sensation of pain. On the other hand, older people may simply be more stoic than younger people.",

      "title": "Consanguinity and Mental Disorder",
      "abstract": "One difficulty which hinders the advance of psychiatry is that the facts of a mental disorder are not easy to describe and to record accurately. Many of the descriptive words used, such as “depression”, “confusion”, are taken from common speech and carry with them vague meanings. Out of sympathy with the sufferer, we tend to read our own emotions into the clinical picture. Moreover, because a disorder of thought and behaviour is a disorder of adaptation to living, the description of a mental disease involves not only the recording of the symptoms, but also a description of the circumstances and life-setting in which they occur. Another difficulty lies in the great variation in the clinical pictures of mental disorder. These vary so much that a diagnostic label such as affective psychosis or schizophrenia does not convey, and indeed is not intended to convey, an idea of a specific disease. These difficulties are somewhat more marked in the investigation of mental disorder in contrast to the investigation of mental defect. The statement that a patient is a Mongol or a cerebral diplegic conveys the idea of a fairly definite clinical syndrome, whereas a statement that a person suffers from schizophrenia calls up a much less clear mental picture. It seems that the only way out of this difficulty is to give a short statement of the clinical facts about each psychotic whom one discusses.",

      "title": "Insight across mental disorders: A multifaceted metacognitive phenomenon",
      "abstract": "There is now general agreement that lack of insight is not merely a fundamental aspect of delusions and hallucinations, or just a symptom of psychotic disorders but rather a multi-dimensional construct. Several different components of insight have been proposed and empirically examined during the last three decades, such as the ability to recognize that one has a mental illness, the capacity to relabel unusual mental events as pathological, the specific attribution of one's symptoms to having a mental illness, awareness of illness' consequences, and compliance with treatment.1 Insight impairment is an important prognostic factor in schizophrenia, impacting negatively on medication adherence, treatment outcome, and social functioning.2 Although largely investigated in schizophrenia and other psychoses, insight impairments are observed in many, if not all, mental disorders. Varying levels of awareness of mental illness and/or of specific symptoms are expected in patients with bipolar disorders, Alzheimer disease and other neurocognitive disorders, obsessive-compulsive (OCD) and related disorders.1,3 While in DSM-5 an \"insight\" specifier was incorporated for OCD, body dysmorphic and hoarding disorder, patients' insight has been found ranging from good to absent in other disorders, such as depressive disorders,4 eating disorders,5 and even specific6 and social7 phobias. Moreover, impaired insight is a common reason that many people with clinical depression or anxiety disorders never seek appropriate treatment and most of the people with addictions and personality disorders fail to recognize and address their problems even when the consequences are devastating: personal suffering, broken relationships, and physical health problems. Depending on the disorder and reflecting different conceptual approaches, many different terms are used to describe lack of insight, such as poor self-awareness, denial, anosognosia (mainly in neurological deficits, e.g. hemiplegia), ego-syntonic symptoms, or even self-deception. At any rate, as an aspect of self-knowledge, insight has psychological (defense mechanisms, coping strategies), social and cultural facets. On the other hand, the attitudes and behaviours towards one's illness are products of inference processes and therefore can be influenced by cognitive dysfunctions. Previous research in schizophrenia showed correlations between neurocognitive functions and insight measures but the strength of this association is rather weak.8 Social cognition may be a crucial cognitive determinant of impaired insight in schizophrenia. The correct attitude toward morbid change in oneself relies on the capacity to reflect upon self from the perspective of the other (i.e., \"to see ourselves as others see us\"). This capacity is clearly linked to the ability to understand mental states (e.g., beliefs, knowledge, and intentions) of others, that is, theory of mind or mentalizing. Recent research has shown that mentalizing deficits may substantially contribute to insight impairment in schizophrenia.9 This effect could be further examined in the broader context of patient's failures in metacognition, i.e. the general ability to think about thinking, and their relationships with insight impairment in schizophrenia. Mentalizing and introspection are closely related developmentally and it is yet unclear which one is the primary ability: we are able to understand others and then apply this understanding to ourselves or we are able to reflect on ourselves and then apply this reflection to others. A recent line of research in schizophrenia is based on the distinction introduced by Beck et al10 between clinical insight (i.e., awareness of illness) and cognitive insight, which describes a metacognitive ability, specifically patients' flexibility towards their beliefs, judgements and experiences. The self-report Beck Cognitive Insight Scale (BCIS) examines two subcomponents: self-certainty, assessing overconfidence about being right (e.g. \"I know better than anyone else what mycomponents: self-certainty, assessing overconfidence about being right (e.g. \"I know better than anyone else what my problems are\"), and self-reflectiveness, assessing willingness to accept external feedback and recognition of dysfunctionalreasoning style (e.g. \"Some of the ideas I was certain were true turned out to be false\"). Cognitive insight in thisform describes two related but distinct aspects of metacognition in patients with psychosis, differentially associated withclinical insight, symptoms, treatment outcomes, and functioning.11 Another method for assessment of similar metacognitiveskills also used in schizophrenia is a scale (Metacognition Assessment Scale - Abbreviated, MAS-A) that is administeredthrough a specific interview and examines the capacities of self-reflectivity, understanding of the other individuals'mental states, and using metacognitive knowledge to respond to psychosocial challenges. Lysaker and colleaguesfound recently that metacognitive deficits assessed with MAS-A predict impaired insight in schizophrenia independentof symptoms.12 It is questionable whether BCIS and other methods used so far to assess self-reflection in psychoses arevalid and useful for patients with non-psychotic disorders.11 However, the metacognitive conceptualization of insightmight contribute to a new research framework for insight impairments across mental disorders. According to this approach, poor insight is in part a failure of self-reflection, i.e. the process by which we synthesizeand comprehend ideas about ourselves. This may be due to general deficits in metacognitive abilities (self-reflectivity,mentalizing) or may represent limited, domain-specific, or transient dysfunctions in metacognitive processes. Insight hasto be thought of as a relational concept, that is insight into something: insight into illness, current syndrome, specificsymptoms, pathological personality traits, social difficulties etc.1,3 In an integrated model of insight across mental disorders,aspects of metacognition interacting with multiple other (clinical, neurocognitive, emotional, and social) factorsdetermine patient's ability to correctly process information into self-awareness. The identification of these factors andtheir interactions may be a fruitful field in the research of insight.",

      "abstract": "Summary Depression is still underestimated, despite its high incidence, and its impact on subjective quality of life. To accurately diagnose and to adequately treat depression are still the key points to obtain a good response during acute phases and to reduce the risk of relapses/recurrences. Somatic symptoms (namely, headache, stomachache, on the back pain, etc.) may be precursors or prodromals of a depressive episode, preceding for years the onset of mood disorders. Nonetheless, their detection is complicated, because somatic symptoms are often underestimated or misinterpreted. Physical symptoms are part of typical depressive symptomatology. Changes in energy, sleep, neurovegetative functions and sexual activity are common during a major depressive episode. Nonetheless, special populations of patients may show only this aspect of depression. Cognitive symptoms of depression in the elderly or during childhood or adolescence are often “covered” by the presence of physical symptoms; depressed mood or low energy levels are considered by the patient (and sometimes by physicians) as the “obvious consequence” of enduring physical symptoms, that are disturbing, interfering with social adaptation and thereof producing significant levels of impairment. The accurate detection of all the aspects of a mood disorder is the first step, especially in special populations of patients (elderly, childhood, pregnant women, etc.). Early detection of mood liability, mood instability, low energy levels, diurnal variations, loss of interest and pleasure is fundamental for a correct diagnosis. Sometimes, patients are closely focused on physical symptoms and tend to explain every other psychological manifestation as a consequence of the loss of subjective wellbeing.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The symptoms of depression include persistent low mood, feelings of helplessness, hopelessness, or worthlessness, and anhedonia, or the inability to experience pleasure. Mood is influenced by a complex interaction of genetic, social, environmental, and other factors, such as substance abuse. Depression is further characterized by dysfunctional attitudes and negative automatic thoughts or ruminations. Psychiatric diagnostic criteria distinguish patients who experience only depressive episodes (unipolar depression or major depressive disorder, MDD) from patients who experience depressive episodes but also manic ones (bipolar disorder, BD). The symptoms of mania, on the other hand, include euphoria, over-activity, distractibility, socially inappropriate behaviour, increased appetite, and impaired insight. Thus, the emotional states of patients with depression and mania can be considered to represent two polar extremes on a mood spectrum. The states manifested in depression and mania are pathological in that they are extreme, disrupt quality of life, and are persistent and often recurrent. This chapter examines not only depression in MDD, but contrasts it with the, at times similar but at times diametrically opposed, symptoms of other disorders, such as BD, to achieve better insight. It also examines resilience in healthy individuals, i.e., how can mood remain normal despite factors such as adverse life events. Research on resilience has focused on determining the protective factors that allow some individuals to have more positive outcomes, despite being exposed to a variety of stressors.",

      "title": "Schizotypy, schizotypic psychopathology and schizophrenia",
      "abstract": "The term schizotypy refers to a latent personality organization that putatively harbors the liability for schizophrenia and can give rise to a variety of schizophrenia-related phenotypic outcomes1, 2. This personality organization, which is determined by any number of as-yet-unknown schizophrenia-related genetic influences acting against a background of polygenic assets and liabilities as well as impacts from the environment (e.g., stressors, epigenetic inputs), can manifest itself variously at the phenotypic level, ranging from clinically diagnosable schizophrenia through pathological personality manifestations (e.g., schizotypal, paranoid, avoidant and schizoid personality disorders) to subtle, sub-clinical psychotic-like phenomenology (e.g., perceptual aberrations, magical ideation, referential thinking, interpersonal aversiveness). Schizotypy may also manifest itself in an imperceptible manner, undetectable by the unaided naked eye, through deviance on endophenotypes that have established valid relations with schizophrenia. Moreover, schizotypy as a latent construct (personality organization) is centrally embedded in a diathesis-stressor theoretical model that has considerable utility as an organizing framework for the study of schizophrenia, schizophrenia-related psychopathology (e.g., delusional disorder, psychosis not otherwise specified, schizotypal, paranoid and other related personality disorders) as well as putative schizophrenia endophenotypes, a view I have advocated for several decades3-6. Note, the term schizotypy is not restricted to describe only those clinical manifestations that are associated with schizotypal personality disorder2, 5, 6. Nor is the term reserved to indicate a methodological preference, e.g. for self-report psychometric assessments. Rather, schizotypy can be assessed using a variety of approaches such as interviews, psychometric inventories, familial risk and/or laboratory measures. Schizotypic persons may indeed display some of the phenomenology associated with schizotypal personality disorder, but they may also show other features6-8. There is a long history of describing clinical states bearing the imprint of schizotypy and an implicit connection to schizophrenia liability, including observations by Kraepelin, Bleuler, Rado, Meehl, Gottesman and myself. It has been argued that a clear demarcation in an underlying schizophrenia liability continuum (e.g., a pronounced threshold effect or discontinuity) is required to explain the emergence of schizotypic indicators in psychological functioning. An alternative position regarding schizotypy holds that it is a dimension of normal personality, not necessarily connected to schizophrenia liability, and representing something of a \"healthy\" personality factor. However, observers of schizophrenia and schizotypic psychopathology, in the main, do not view schizotypy as benign or reflective of healthy psychological adjustment. Non-psychotic schizotypic states (defined using clinical, laboratory and/or familial risk) have been associated with a wide range of findings, including sustained attention deficits, working memory deficits, smooth pursuit eye movement dysfunction, schizophrenia-related psychometric deviance on the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI), executive functioning deficits, dysfunctional anti-saccade performance, subtle formal thought disorder, clinical schizotypal and paranoid personality features, schizophrenia-related social cognition deficits, exteroceptive and proprioceptive somatosensory deficits, psychomotor abnormalities, and candidate polymorphisms (e.g., ZNF804A, Val158Met-COMT, neuregulin-1). That schizotypic persons manifest such a panorama of deficits, similar in nature albeit less in degree to those seen in schizophrenia, argues for a connection or common underlying construct for conditions defined phenotypically (i.e., schizotypic subjects vs. schizophrenia-affected subjects). An area of continued speculation concerns the underlying structure of schizotypy and the precise nature of the variation expressed in that latent construct. Considerable statistical evidence, using a variety of latent structure methods, points to the existence of possible underlying discontinuities or severe threshold effects in schizotypy, and work in this area continues. Such evidence stimulates the caveat, to wit, that the use of continuous measures to assess phenotypic manifestations of schizotypy does not ipso facto mean that the underlying (or latent) schizotypy construct is fully quantitative or uniformly graded by degree. The course and clinical outcome for those designated as harboring schizotypy remains an area of active inquiry. It is entirely conceivable that many individuals possessing schizotypy may traverse the life course escaping psychotic illness as well as other diagnosable schizotypic manifestations. The expectation that some people validly at risk for schizophrenia may never manifest the illness is well established in the reality of discordant monozygotic twins, in which one twin is affected by schizophrenia and the co-twin is not psychotic (perhaps not even diagnosable as having a non-psychotic, but detectable, clinical schizotypic condition like schizotypal or paranoid personality disorder). Individuals that achieve elevated scores on psychometric measures of schizotypy have been shown to be at increased risk for schizophrenia and schizophrenia-related psychoses later in life, as well as a variety of other related outcomes. Such individuals also display poorer psychosocial functioning, lower rates of marriage, increased use of psychiatric medications, and increased utilization of psychiatric services2. It is entirely conceivable that many individuals designated as \"prodromal\" for schizophrenia, but who do not convert to schizophrenia (which is 60-70% of such subjects), are in fact harboring schizotypy and will, even if not psychotic, show impairments across the life span, perhaps adopting an eccentric or odd manner of personality functioning. The schizotypy model has helped to adjust the boundaries of schizophrenia phenotype in the DSM-5 (e.g., schizotypal pathology is now included with schizophrenia). Furthermore, illuminating the nature of schizotypy may aid in unraveling the current puzzle of the very low conversion to schizophrenia rates seen in \"prodromal\" schizophrenia research9. Finally, I have argued that the schizotypy framework may be useful in understanding configurations (rather than simple additive summation) of genes relevant to schizophrenia variants2, an idea that is beginning to gain traction. There is no doubt that incorporation of schizotypy indicators into genomic studies of schizophrenia increase their statistical power. The advantages of a cleaner unit of analysis (the schizotype), free from the effects of medication, institutionalization and neurocognitive decline, are axiomatic. However, the understanding (and misunderstanding) of the schizotypy model as well as alternative approaches to the construct require vigilance, in order to ensure that the approach continues to yield the fruit that it can.

      "title": "Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder and Older Men: If Only Time Healed All Wounds",
      "abstract": "Trauma has been noted as hidden variable in lives of older adults that affects psychological, social, physiological, and behavioral functioning. Understandings of trauma have evolved considerably in more than two decades of research since initial entry of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in 1980 publication of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-III). Originally a diagnostic category for war trauma primarily studied in Vietnam veterans, PTSD has been applied to individuals of all ages who have suffered a wide variety of both combat- and noncombat-related traumas. Thus effects of trauma in older populations have been acknowledged, but thorough research remains to be done. Currently FTSD is defined in Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV TR, 2000) as occurring after one experiences, witnesses, or confronts a traumatic event including actual or threatened death, serious injury, or a threat to bodily integrity of self or others that evokes fear, helplessness, or horror. Traumatic events include physical assault, natural or man-made disasters, combat, and captivity (Cook and O'Donnell, 2005). Symptoms of PTSD include re-experiencing (flashbacks or visceral responses), avoidance activities (such as drinking or drug use), and arousal or hypervigilance. FTSD is considered acute if symptoms last less than three months, and chronic if symptoms continue for more than three months. A BRIEF HISTORY OF PTSD The definition of PTSD has broadened since 1980, though diagnostic category is direct result of efforts of veterans of Vietnam War and psychologists to label and treat their experience (Scott, 1993). Combat-related FTSD was thought to be contemporary version of fatigue or shock, a psychological disintegration found to occur under stresses of combat. As carry as Civil War, some combatants reported to have had difficulty adjusting to stress of battle (Scott, 1993). The Surgeon General of Union Army described condition as nostalgia and recommended that such individuals should be retained in combat zone but reassigned to less stressful duties. However, nostalgia was not treated by psychiatric specialists until Russo-Japanese War (1904-1905), and it was not until World War I that military began planning for psychiatric casualties as an integral part of their support operations (Bourne, 1970). During World War I, soldiers' breakdowns thought to be related to proximity of exploding shells and thus labeled shell shock. Mental impairment was linked to an organic cause-shell explosions causing a concussion of brain. This organic model was called into question, though, by cases of among who had not been near explosions (Showalter, 1985). Such cases summarily written offas outright cowardice or lack of moral fiber and considered (Bourne, 1970, p. II). During this war, treatments for shell shock and emotional shock differed dramatically. Those deemed emotionally shocked were kept near forward medical units and treated with painful electric shocks, threats of imprisonment and even execution while shell-shocked soldiers were evacuated to medical facilities further to rear (Bourne, 1970, p. 12). Treatment for emotional shock was perceived to be highly effective, with a majority of patients returning to combat, while shell-shocked patients had a lower rate of recovery, which was thought to be result of organic nature of their problems. Later systematic clinical tests concluded that there was not an organic component to shell shock (Showalter, 1985). Gradually, psychiatric community came to conclusion that the emotional stress of prolonged exposure to violent death was sufficient to produce a neurotic syndrome resembling hysteria in men (Herman, 1992, p. …",

Verlauf des Pruritus sowie Hinweise zu ihrer jeweiligen Diagnostik Material und Methode Es handelt sich um eine Überblicksarbeit. Ergebnisse Psychische Beeinträchtigungen/Störungen können als Reaktion auf chronischen Pruritus auftreten, z. B. als Anpassungsstörungen, depressive Störungen, Angststörungen. Psychische Faktoren können auch in Entstehung und Verlauf eines chronischen Pruritus eine Rolle spielen, entweder im Zusammenspiel mit organischen Ursachen oder bei deren Fehlen als somatoformer Pruritus oder Pruritus bei coenästhetischer Schizophrenie. Ferner können selbstinduzierte Kratzartefakte mit oder ohne Pruritus im Rahmen von Störungen der Impulskontrolle, Zwangsstörungen oder Artefaktstörungen auftreten. Auch eine primär unabhängige Komorbidität mit einer sonstigen psychischen oder psychosomatischen Störung kann das Management des Pruritus erschweren und den Krankheitsverlauf beeinflussen. Es werden Hinweise zur Diagnostik der genannten Faktoren gegeben. Diskussion Die Diagnostik psychischer Einflussfaktoren und psychischer Aspekte des chronischen Pruritus ist komplex. Das wichtigste diagnostische Werkzeug ist die gründliche Anamneseerhebung auch bezüglich psychischer Aspekte. Zusätzlich können psychometrische Instrumente zum Einsatz kommen, die das ärztliche Gespräch jedoch nicht ersetzen.",

      "abstract": "Hallucinations and delusions in Parkinson’s disease (PD) have attracted attention because they are common, have important clinical consequences both for patients, their families, and the health care system, and they are treatable. According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition (DSM IV) (1), a delusion is a false belief based on incorrect inference about external reality that is firmly sustained despite what almost everyone else believes. Hallucination is a sensory perception that has the compelling sense of reality of a true perception, but that occurs without external stimulation of the relevant sensory organ. The person may or may not have insight in that he or she is having a hallucination. Psychotic symptoms such as hallucinations and delusions are the cardinal features of psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, schizo-affective disorder, delusional disorder, and brief psychotic disorder. Psychotic symptoms may also occur during the course of delirium or dementias and may be due to a range of other general medical and neurological conditions, including PD.",

Affects, moods or emotions are psycho-physiological states which tend to augment or decrease pathophysiological states. 2. The interaction of pharmacological agents with certain affects or emotions may be synergistic or antagonistic. 3. A patient reacts to his disease, to his treatment, and to his physician with manifest psychological, cultural, and—for want of a better term—physiological regression. Where the regression is not manifest there are obvious pathological efforts of the patient to obscure it. 4. By means of iatrogenically induced regression it is possible to bring about new affects or mood states. 5. The bodily functions which are psycho-physiologically excited or inhibited by the regression or the defenses against it either increase or oppose the pathophysiology of the disease.",

      "abstract": "A drug can be defined as a substance other than food which may affect the constitution or function of a living thing through its chemical properties. In this sense, it may be possible to place organic solvents like bond, gas or thinner and narcotics like marijuana, methamphetamine, cocaine or heroine under the category of drugs. These drugs are characteristic of having positive medicinal as well as side effects upon human being including but not limited to excitement, hallucinatory image, auditory hallucination, relaxation, sleeping, anorexia, nerve stability, schizophrenia, anaesthesia, brain damage, narcissism, etc. Abuse of drugs, however, would result in direct and indirect impact upon the society, family and industry as a whole by ruining of families, unemployment, loss of manpower, and catastrophic damage of physical and mental health of all people. Strong cling to drugs could also cause devastation of personality by abandoning relationship with family members and friends and even jobs, hobbies and culture and would eventually make addicts unsociable. Furthermore, abuse of drugs could be a cause for more serious phenomenon of social pathology such as drastic increase of inhuman violent crimes, crimes without specific motives, frequent burglary and theft to raise the money to buy drugs with. In contrast with the global trend to enforce the regulations for drug-related crimes, the Korean judiciary authorities keep on dealing leniently with offenders, especially when they are first timers, by only charging the fine not exceeding 50 million Won. To put use of drugs under control, it seems more effective to install and operate facilities which are dedicated to providing supports for drug addicts to get free from the cycle of crimes and return to the society. In sum, it would be extremely important to study the measures needed to prevent occurrence of drug-related crimes because the issue of addiction can not　rely on legal punishments alone. The legal system that imposes heavy penalty upon drug-related crimes may be effective to a certain extent in terms of crime prevention but has limit in itself. It is therefore most imperative to respond in a more active way to prevention of drug-related crimes by introducing the educational programs for drug addiction, by training experts who can treat drug addicts, not to speak of working out preventive measures from the perspective of criminal legislation and socio-cultural aspects as well.",

In mild cases, the impairment may intrude on a person's ability to gain satisfaction from meeting the challenges of everyday life.

As the experts 7 certified specialists (psychiatrists, psychologists and others) were involved. In the research the academically definitions and the clinical case descriptions of the following clinical phenomena were estimated: Conversion, obsession, neurasthenia, phobia, derealisation/depersonalization, anxiety (partly specific for neurotic, stress-related and somatoform disorders); True hallucinations, confusion, amnesia, fixation hypomnesia, anecphoria (partly specific for organic mental disorders); Pseudo hallucinations, delusion of control, automatism, paralogia, emotional withdrawal, autism, ambivalence (common symptoms of schizophrenia); Inability to feel, sadness, lassitude, euphoria, excitement as the signs of endogenous affective disorders. Mainly non-specific phenomenon - persecutory delusions. Thus were obtained 14 estimates for each item on a 100-point scale. Dispersion of majority ranges was too high to get significant differences. But 6 from 7 experts significantly (p<0.05) and 1 tendentionally (p<0.01) rated 3 symptoms (autism, conversion and paralogia) as relatively more complex as compared with 7 more simplex phenomena (anxiety, confusion, euphoria, excitement, neurasthenia, phobia and sadness) by U-Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney criteria. established ranges of psychopathological phenomena's complexity reveal non-linear relations to etiology but in some cases they can be useful instrument of differential diagnostics of mental disorders.",

      "abstract": "Dissociative identity disorder (multiple personality) is increasingly diagnosed, often follows childhood trauma, and is characterized by rigidification of phenomena that resemble hypnosis. To interpret dissociated aspects of selfhood as autonomous entities is a useful heuristic; but when taken too literally, it leads to three kinds of anomaly: (1) legal: dissociators remain culpable for misdeeds carried out beyond apparent awareness or control; (2) clinical: legitimization sometimes leads not to relief, but to escalating cycles of regressive dependency; and (3) scientific: the form of dissociated entities varies with how they are defined, in ways that are intrinsically motivated and clinically manipulable. These anomalies yield to an evolutionary perspective that views dissociative identity disorder as an evolved strategy of adaptive deception of self and others; e.g., a beaten subordinate avoids further retribution by \"pleading illness.\" Such a deceit best avoids detection when fully experienced; through its intensity and persistence, it becomes real at a new level. One's basic competencies remain intact, however, and are the source of the anomalies described. They can be clinically accessed and empowered, providing the key to therapeutic change when dissociative processes are problematic. Overall, despite clear impairment in subjective awareness and volition, dissociative-disordered individuals are best held fully accountable for the consequences of their actions.",

It would be absurd to contend that such harm is somehow intrinsically less serious than physical injury; indeed, over many years, medical research has pointed to the artificiality of characterising it as lacking physical manifestations. Its destructive potential is brought into sharper focus as mental attributes become ever more integral to everyday functioning. Yet, to this day, neither popular nor judicial opinion is noticeably receptive to a cause of action based on proof of a “recognised psychiatric disorder”, which is still often trivialised by the label “nervous shock”. This negative attitude is most apparent when claimants are not, or are not regarded as, the direct victims of someone else's conduct. The very notion of compensating people whose suffering derives from their reaction to the injuring of others often evokes surprise, indignation and disdain.",

      "abstract": "Neglect of a person at any age is a global complex social problem which can lead to grave medical consequences. It has been present throughout human evolution and manifests variably in different culture and countries. Neglect is not a simple outcome of the breach of caregiver or care provider and care receiver equation. There is overlap in definitions of neglect, abuse and maltreatment. The terms are often used interchangeably. The practitioner should be aware of local definitions and the context in which they are used. The clinical or pathologic assessment of neglect in any setting may be considered incomplete unless it also makes some reference and identifies the causes perceived to contribute to it. Neglect is frequently associated with vulnerabilities such as poor physical and mental health or intellectual (learning) disability. It may also be associated with social status and related to criminal activity, such as trafficking and modern-day slavery. Where pre-existing disease or illness are present, neglect may contribute to a fatal outcome by exacerbating those conditions. The victims of neglect commonly encountered in healthcare settings generally represent extremes of age. They may present with acute traumatic condition or exacerbation of a long-standing illness or complications of trauma. A thorough clinical or pathologic assessment of such patients must be supplemented by a careful analysis of circumstances. As \"neglect\" can apply to all sectors of modern society, solutions for it require the concern and cooperation of communities and professions such as policy making, education, health, law, economics and social work, all of which have the primary responsibility for reporting, assessing and making decisions to maintain appropriate standards of life.",

B. ausdünnendes Haar, Falten, Größe oder Form der Nase), was zu signifikanten Beeinträchtigungen in sozialen oder beruflichen Lebensbereichen führt. Besteht eine leichte körperliche Anomalie, ist die Beschäftigung mit dem Defekt deutlich übertrieben und für andere Personen nicht nachvollziehbar. Assoziierte Merkmale der KDS sind unter anderem eine starke Angst vor negativer Bewertung aufgrund der äußeren Erscheinung sowie Vorstellungen, dass andere Personen negativ über den wahrgenommen Defekt sprechen. Ritualisierte Verhaltensweisen wie das Überprüfen des Aussehens in Spiegeln oder das Vergleichen mit anderen sind ebenso häufig vorzufinden. Studien zur Prävalenz in der Allgemeinbevölkerungen ergeben Schätzwerte von ca. 2 % mit einem ausgewogenen Geschlechterverhältnis. Für die Erklärung der KDS wurden bisher eine Reihe kognitiv-behavioraler Modelle entwickelt, die davon ausgehen, dass sowohl psychologische, biologische, soziokulturelle sowie Konditionierungsprozesse eine Rolle bei der Entstehung und Aufrechterhaltung der KDS spielen. In der Behandlung haben sich vor allem kognitiv-behaviorale Psychotherapieansätze und Psychopharmaka wie selektive Serotonin-Wiederaufnahmehemmer bewährt.",

      "title": "What attitude towards a patient with somatoform disorder?",
      "abstract": "The diagnosis of a somatic symptom disorder must be based on both a negative approach - eliminating another psychiatric or non-psychiatric disorder that would better explain the symptoms - and a positive one, which is, based on the search for characteristic thoughts, emotions or behaviours as well as biological or psychological factors that may promote, trigger or sustain the disorder. Additional tests and specialized medical consultations should not be prescribed solely to reassure the patient; they may actually worsen the condition. The management will move away from the outdated notion of \"medically unexplained symptoms\" to rely on: the acknowledgment of the painful, debilitating and involuntary nature of the symptoms; the proposal of a positive diagnosis acceptable by the patient and an explanatory model compatible with his or her representations, aimed at putting an end to dysfunctional health care utilization; the proposal of therapeutic objectives aimed at functional rather than symptomatic recovery; the negotiation of pharmacological (selective or mixed serotonin reuptake inhibitor if necessary) and non-pharmacological interventions, especially when it comes to limiting the factors that sustain the disorder; the coordination of the various healthcare professionals.Le diagnostic de trouble somatoforme doit reposer sur une démarche tout autant négative – éliminer un autre trouble psychiatrique ou non psychiatrique qui expliquerait mieux les symptômes – que positive, c’est-à-dire fondée sur la recherche de pensées, d’émotions ou de comportements caractéristiques et de facteurs biologiques ou psychologiques pouvant favoriser, déclencher ou pérenniser le trouble. Examens complémentaires et avis médicaux spécialisés ne doivent pas avoir pour seul but de rassurer le patient ; ils peuvent en effet s’avérer iatrogènes. La prise en charge doit se détourner de la notion désuète de « symptômes médicalement inexpliqués » pour s’appuyer sur : la reconnaissance du caractère pénible, invalidant et non volontaire des symptômes ; la proposition d’un diagnostic positif acceptable et d’un modèle explicatif compatible avec les représentations du patient, visant à mettre un terme à l’errance diagnostique ; la proposition d’objectifs thérapeutiques visant un rétablissement fonctionnel plus que symptomatique ; la négociation des moyens pharmacologiques (inhibiteur sélectif ou mixte de recapture de la sérotonine si nécessaire) et non pharmacologiques, en particulier la lutte contre les facteurs d’entretien du trouble ; la coordination des soins entre les divers intervenants",

When sufficiently intense and prolonged, the extreme physiological arousal pattern to stimulation that comprises emotional behavior produces pathological changes in physiological functioning and anatomic structure, which are psychophysiological and psychosomatic disorders. New stimuli may become associated with established autonomic reaction patterns that are emotional behavior; also particular autonomic reactions may be strengthened through differential reinforcement. Thus, emotional stimuli and emotional response patterns may be learned. When the emotional reaction patterns are sufficiently frequent or prolonged and sufficiently intense in the person socially prepared to react and physically predisposed (i.e., vulnerable via genetically determined or later acquired biological weakness), changes of such magnitude may occur in physiological functioning or anatomical structure as to be incompatible with continued life. Voodoo death corresponds to that formulation of psychosomatic death.",

      "abstract": "Exposure to overwhelming stress often determines how people subsequently organize their perceptions of themselves and of others. Traumatic experiences at different developmental levels have different effects on cognitive, affective and biological self-organization. Acute or chronic exposure to trauma may be expressed as Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), dissociative disorders, somatic disturbances and alterations in perception of self and others. These disorders involve (a) the involuntary repetitive re-living of the trauma in thoughts, images, somatic states or behaviors, (b) attempts to avoid dealing with reminders of the past, (c) problems with the modulation of physiological responses to subsequent stress, and (d) a loss of capacity to engage in love and work with pleasure and satisfaction. The display of extremes of emotional distress, or of bizarre or disorganized behaviors, easily obscures the fact that current problems may have their origins in past trauma. The recognition that many psychiatric patients organize much of their lives around repetitive patterns of re-living and warding off traumatic memories, reminders and affective states, may help clinicians understand their symptoms as misguided attempts to regain a sense of control and safety, rather than as bizarre behaviors that need to be merely controlled. Since safe attachments appear to be the primary way in which children learn to regulate internal state changes, the negotiation of interpersonal safety needs to be the first focus of treatment. Since the labeling and categorization of emotional states is one of the principal areas of functioning that is disrupted by developmental trauma, treatment needs to include learning how to use words to understand and interpret feelings in general and stressful events, in particular. Since distrust and lack of social safety are critical parts of developmental trauma, structure and predictability are essential. Identifying specific trauma-based perceptions and expectations and learning how to negotiate the fulfillment of one's emotional needs are critical aspects of effective treatment.",

It occurs when there is persistent psychological maltreatment, leading to an adverse effect on the child. Abuse can happen in many environments, but frequently within the home. It can be active, for example rejection or exploitation, or passive, including emotional unavailability or negative interactions. Signs of emotional abuse can be subtle and age-dependent. Children may present with physical manifestations of stress, such as secondary enuresis or self-harm, or strange behaviours including aggression or submissiveness. They may be referred because of developmental delay or anxiety. Recognition and management of emotional abuse is vital to prevent long-term sequelae. This may include removal of the child from the harmful environment, or structured interventions, including parent or family behavioural schemes or social care input, or psychotherapy sessions.",

This is one area in which expensive investigations are difficult to perform and frequently unhelpful. The challenges are:\n\n\n\nAlthough “confused” or confusional state are convenient descriptions to apply to a patient, they do not have a precise medical meaning and are best avoided as diagnostic terms. The term delirium is much better defined and accepted in the classification of mental disorders. It has been defined as: “an aetiologically non-specific organic cerebral syndrome, characterised by concurrent disturbances of consciousness and attention, perception, thinking, memory, psychomotor behaviour, emotion and the sleep-wake cycle”.\n\nAn apparently “confused” patient may have an alternative diagnosis such as dysphasia, dementia or psychiatric disorder.\n\nDelirium, as defined above, includes a range of different behaviours and may be subdivided into hyperactive or agitated delirium, and hypoactive or quiet delirium. The same patient can have both or neither subtype.\n\nDelirium tremens is a specific term for the confusional state caused by withdrawal of alcohol.\n\nThe prevalence and incidence of delirium depend on the population studied. Prevalence in hospital ranges from 10–20% in medical wards and could become higher as the elderly population in hospital increases.

The colonmetrographic findings are instructive in this respect. Direct functional disturbance of various districts is also suggested, and the pathology of such forms in psychosomatically oriented patients is described. Such orientation takes the form of a ready translation of ideas into rather diffuse somatic changes that are partly aspecific, due to the predominance of response mechanisms that are more physiological than psychological. The picture is one of a primordial reaction to difficulties and problems, coupled with increased stress, sometimes to the points of vegetative or motor storms, in the expectation of help from outside, such help being represented in the past by intervention on the part of the mother.",

In the case of pseudoseizures, that believer’s concern is innocent.

      "title": "Impaired Mental Proprioception in Schizophrenia",
      "abstract": "Psychiatrists recognize that schizophrenia is a disorder in which the highest mental functions, such as thought, language, emotions, conation, and cognition, are drastically disrupted. However, the most serious impairment in schizophrenia is a global malfunction in self-integration and personal identity that includes a deficit in self-recognition. [ILLUSTRATION OMITTED] This distorted sense of leads persons with schizophrenia to fail to recognize what is or is not part of their own mind, which can produce clinical symptoms of schizophrenia, including bizarre delusions, hallucinations, thought disorder, social deficits, and information processing. (1) Just as intact physical proprioception enables a healthy person to be continuously aware of where his body and its parts are located in space, allowing sensory-motor integration, mental proprioception enables one to be fully aware of his identity and self-boundaries, and that his thoughts and actions are generated from within his own sphere of consciousness, not from an external source. In schizophrenia, the coherent sense of is shattered and fragmented, a frightening experience patients describe after emerging from psychosis. (2) A person affected by schizophrenia feels lost, as if his no longer belong[s] to him. He feels alienated from his real self and refers to himself in the third person. He feels disconnected, disintegrated, and diminished, with a sense of emptiness, a painful void of existence, of being disembodied with no clear demarcation between and others. (2) Not surprisingly, false beliefs (delusions) and perceptual aberrations (hallucinations) emerge from a fragmented sense of self. Patients fail to recognize that their actions, thoughts, or feelings are initiated from within the self, leading to delusions of passivity and being controlled by an outside force. One's impulses are misperceived as being imposed by an alien. One's thoughts, fantasies, and memories become external hallucinations instead of internal recollections. It is not surprising that depersonalization and derealization are common in schizophrenia and in the prodrome stage. Phencyclidine and ketamine, which can produce schizophrenia-like psychoses, are known to trigger dissociative phenomena and a loss of a coherent sense of self. What causes the disintegration of the mind (self) in schizophrenia? The leading neurobiologic explanation is well-documented white matter pathology. (3) Numerous studies have demonstrated that the myelinated axons and fibers that connect various brain regions are abnormal in patients with schizophrenia. The evidence for the breakdown of white matter--and, consequently, brain connectedness and integration--includes several lines of evidence, such as: a) in vivo neuroimaging studies using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) that show abnormal water mobility in the myelin; b) genetic aberrations in myelin genes; c) postmortem evidence of reduced oligodendrocytes, the glial cells that manufacture myelin; and d) biochemical markers such as the calcium-binding protein S100B, which is released by compromised glial cells. (3) Therefore, it is reasonable to think that the disruption of the sense of and its proprioception may be due to the extensive disconnectivity of brain regions caused by myelin pathology. (4) However, grey matter abnormality also may play a role in loss of mental proprioceptive functions, which causes a failure to properly recognize one's self. The inferior parietal cortex, which controls body image, concept of self, sensory integration, and executive function, has been reported to be structurally impaired in patients with schizophrenia. …",

Disturbing patient condition, aggressive behavior, hallucination cause that a patient can become dangerous for yourself or others.

Three interrelated components of vital depersonalization were distinguished. The main depersonalization component proper was manifested by the experience of estrangement and unreality of the feeling of existence (\"self\"). The second, affective one, was marked by vital fear and anxiety. The third one involved common sense disorders and was characterized by vital bodily sensations. Vital depersonalization had all the principal signs of depersonalization. However, it differed from the allo-, somato- and autotypes of depersonalization in disorders of the vital level: similarity to physical sensations, pain and vagueness. Vital depersonalization may be viewed as pathology of the first level of selfawareness--selfsence of awareness of vital ego or of body perception.",

In serious situations, it might show as a dissociative disorder, which extremely impairs psychological functioning. Dissociative trance, a type of other specified dissociative disorder (OSDD), is characterized by an abrupt loss of awareness, leading to unresponsiveness and involuntary actions. Despite being conscious, the individual may feel separated from their body, as if it were under the control of an external force. This case report represents a 22-year-old patient with no prior criminal history who experienced episodes of decreased consciousness, altered identity, and involuntary movements. These episodes were perceived as being controlled by an external force and culminated in a tragic event leading the patient to kill her children. After ruling out other potential causes like psychotic disorders, organic factors, and substance abuse, a diagnosis of dissociative trance disorder was considered. Treatment with cognitive behavioral therapy, antidepressants, antipsychotics, and benzodiazepines resulted in improvement of the patient's symptoms.",

The psychological need to have a physical complaint is the psychiatric disorder for this group of patients. At the other end of this physical–psychiatric continuum are patients, without obvious physical discomfort to suggest a medical condition, who may be misdiagnosed as having a psychiatric disorder because their presentation is atypical, or their complaints are primarily in the domain of how they feel or how they think. Physicians' understanding of the role of culture and cultural biases toward mental illness and of the physical components of mood and anxiety disorders results in a consideration of a psychiatric diagnosis. This process occurs even in the absence of the patient's complaint of psychological symptoms. Instances in which patients' physical complaints are parts of mood and anxiety disorders may cause diagnostic confusion for physicians who consider only medical diagnoses. When it comes to the diagnostic consideration of a psychiatric versus a medical condition we know that it is not either/or but it often is both.",

These various levels of functioning cannot be separated from the environment. Socioenvironmental stressors, defined by Mechanic [4] as a discrepancy between demands presented to a person and his or her capacity to deal with them, influence the appearance of impairments, disabilities, and handicaps. Wing [5] lists three factors that can cause and exacerbate social disablement in cases of frequent relapse or chronic impairment: environmental overstimulation or understimulation, social disadvantage, and adverse personal reactions (secondary disablement) caused by acceptance by the handicapped person of limitations that are not actually necessary. It is clear that assessment and evaluation of impairments are important in avoiding understimulation and overstimulation and preventing or correcting adverse personal reactions. Although premorbid and environmental factors play an important role, we can expect the more severely impaired also to be the more severely disabled.

      "title": "Clinical and Pathogenetical Characterization of 238 Patients of a Chronic Fatigue Syndrome Italian Center",
      "abstract": "SummaryProlonged fatigue is a common complaint in the community and is usually transitory. If fatigue continues for more than six months, is disabling, and is accompanied by other constitutional and neuropsychiatric symptoms, then a diagnosis of chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) should be considered.CFS probably is an heterogeneous disease, maybe multifactorial, or it includes different pathologies which manifest with the same symptoms. In some cases, the mode of presentation of the illness implicate the exposure to chemical and/or food toxins as precipitating factors (e.g., ciguatera poisoning, Gulf War Syndrome, etc.). In other CFS cases, the etiology is still unknown: there are various hypotheses on pathogenetic events which, alone or in association with each other, may precipitate the illness. In fact, it is probable an involvement of multiple events in CFS onset where different precipitating factors can interact each other, even if not always all present in the single patient: latent and/or chronic viral infections, immunologic and neuroendocrine dysfunctions, psychological, environmental and mood factors.In accordance to this theory, we consider various subgroups of CFS patients on the basis of the pathway and the mode of presentation of the disease. The Clinic of Infectious Diseases of \"G. D'Annunzio\" University of Chieti is one of the main National Reference Centers for the CFS Study in Italy. From January 1992 to January 1998, 238 patients came to our observation: 89 of them met CDC criteria for CFS (1994), 127 did not; the other 22 patients are still under evaluation. Our patients underwent physical examination (including tests for searching for the possible coexistence of a fibromyalgia syndrome), psychiatric interview with several neuropsychological tests, laboratory tests (including magnesium determination on serum), neuroendocrine evaluation (circadian rhythm of several hormones, buspirone challenge test), SPECT scans to evaluate cerebral perfusion, and other examinations where necessary in according to the symptomatology of each patient (e.g., orthopedic, ORL, EMG, muscle biopsy, etc.).According to our preliminary results, we subdivided our patients in different subgroups and we studied them comparatively.We report the more significant data collected from this evaluation that might lead to a better understanding of the syndrome and in particular of its pathways course, a knowledge that will help in choosing appropriate therapies for each subgroups.",

      "abstract": "If an hysterical patient went to a physician in the late nineteenth century, chances were the diagnostic focus would be on the somatic symptomatology.The patient exhibiting hysterical blindness or paralysis was treated by an ophthalmologist or neurologist, who looked for pathological evidence of disease, deterioration, or damage.These procedures signaled a triumph over an earlier view that perceived hysteria as a largely female complaint in which a woman's uterus detached itself and floated about throughout her body.l With the work of Charcot, Janet, and especially Freud, hysteria came to be appreciated as an anxiety reaction whose pathological locus was emotional, not physiological, and was therefore not restricted to women.Today popular wisdom recognizes that certain cardiopulmonary, gastrointestinal, and neurological symptoms originate with severe psychological stress.Nevertheless, the attraction persists for accepting the manifest sign or symptom as the most accurate measure of mental and physical health.There is an obvious need to grapple with manifest behavior.But in some instances the more accurate interpretation of behavior is to be found in latent material.The word \"hysteria\" in ordinary usage denotes the loss of self-control and a diminished if not total incapacity for rational and logical thinking.Hysterical individuals therefore represent chaos, disorder, and a loss of reality testing.Yet the hysterical individual may also represent a complicated organization in which the overt symptoms of emotional collapse serve to conceal personality deficits and conflicts.Where the outward impression presented by the hysterical individual may seem disorderly, it may also signify a series of psychologically defensive maneuvers designed to maintain a distorted but nevertheless cohesive internal sense of order.In history the crowd has often been likened to the hysterical individual.In his celebrated nineteenth-century study, Gustave Le Bon included the following in his convictions about crowd behavior: \"It will be remarked that among the special characteristics of crowds there Mazon_3241.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The terms subjective and objective often appear in health care records, and one commonly hears about “subjective symptoms” and “objective complaints”—yet the former is redundant and the latter an oxymoron. Objectively verifiable pathology may explain a patient's symptoms, but complaints themselves are never objective but rather, by definition, subjective. The AMA Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment ( AMA Guides ), Sixth Edition, defines the terminology: Subjective information is more open to interpretation, but objective data are factual, reproducible, and often measurable or quantifiable. Objective findings generally have much higher inter-examiner reliability than subjective findings. Symptoms and most findings on physical (particularly neuromusculoskeletal) examination are subjective. Diagnostic study results and a minority of physical findings are objective. Some physical findings, such as strength and range of motion measurements, are both subjective and objective. Repeat testing, assessment of plausibility, and use of confirmatory physical findings can be used to validate or “objectify” subjective findings (eg, by determining if a weakness is corroborated by other neurologic or physical findings, imaging study results, and/or electrodiagnostic testing). The use of objective, or at least less subjective, findings in impairment rating should improve interrater reliability. Thus, evaluating physicians should not regard subjective complaints and findings, and they should lend greater weight to objective findings.",

It is characterized by behavior and other mental process which involve coercion for occasional or regular use of addiction resources with intention to experience it's effect on mental process or to avoid discomfort due to absence of such a resource (medium). Psychic (mental) addiction is characterized by feeling of satisfaction and will for drug re-consummation to cause comfort and avoid discomfort. Physical addiction is defined as a condition of adjustment on drugs followed by need for increase of dose to achieve its effect as it was in the beginning with smaller quantity and with occurrence of abstinence crisis in absence of drugs. Addiction may be and combination of these two types. Psychic (mental) addiction is close to physical in manifestations (something what human misses) but cause is not (or does not have to be) real, therefore it does not have to be about intoxicated substances (only). Human can be addicted to food, lottery games, television, internet, work, some other human or about anything but common characteristic is that activities connected to addiction may become central content and factor of his/her living.

      "abstract": "Abstract As we have already discussed, in much of the assessment of psychopathology the focus is on internal, unobservable processes of which there is only indirect evidence. In chapter 2, we described the signs and symptoms that comprise the main types of psychopathology. We mentioned that in addition to complaints of subjective distress (symptoms), evidence for the presence of psychopathology may also be shown in the form of abnormal behaviour, which may be self-reported by the subject or observed by a clinician/researcher or other informant (observational measures or signs). One such example of this type of evidence can be noted in the examination of children with suspected attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Evidence regarding a subject’s ADHD could consist of both the individual’s own description of their perceptions, cognitions and emotions and of observations by a clinician or, for that matter, by a parent or a teacher. Probably, the simplest way of measuring psychopathology is by the means of questionnaires. The subject or an informant/observer (such as a spouse, a close friend, parent or teacher) answers a series of questions about the subject’s behaviour and experiences, either in a written pencil and paper or computerized form. Some examples of the use of questionnaires are given in more detail elsewhere, particularly in chapters 7,8 and 9.",

The disturbance of purposive movements cannot be termed apraxia, however, if the patient suffers from any elementary motor or sensory deficit (i.e., paresis, dystonia, ataxia), which could fully explain the abnormal motor behavior, or if it results from a language comprehension disorder or from dementia (1,2). Nevertheless, praxic errors are well defined clinically and kinematically and can be superimposed on elementary motor disorders (3,4). Praxic disturbances may affect specific parts of the body (i.e., limb apraxia, buccofacial apraxia, gait apraxia) and may involve both sides of the body (i.e., ideational and ideomotor apraxias), preferentially one side (i.e., limb-kinetic apraxia) or, alternatively, interlimb coordination, as in the case of gait apraxia.",

      "title": "Gambling Dual Disorder: A Dual Disorder and Clinical Neuroscience Perspective",
      "abstract": "Several behaviors, including compulsive gambling, have been considered non-substance-related addictive disorders. Categorical mental disorders (e.g., DSM-5) are usually accompanied by very different symptomatic expressions (affective, behavioral, cognitive, substance abuse, personality traits). When these mental disorders occur with addictive disorders, either concomitantly or sequentially over the life span, this clinical condition is called a dual disorder. Gambling disorder (GD) has been associated with other categorical psychiatric diagnoses: attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, depression, bipolar disorder, social anxiety, schizophrenia, substance use disorder, antisocial personality disorder; and dimensional symptoms including higher impulsivity, poorer emotional wellbeing, cognitive distortion, psychosis, deficient self-regulation, suicide, poorer family environment, and greater mental distress. We are calling this clinical condition Gambling Dual Disorder. From a clinical perspective, it is clear that Gambling Dual Disorder is not the exception but rather the expectation, and this holds true not just for GD, but also for other mental disorders including other addictions. Mental disorders are viewed as biological disorders that involve brain circuits that implicate specific domains of cognition, emotion, and behavior. This narrative review presents the state of the art with respect to GD in order to address current matters from a dual disorder, precision psychiatry, and clinical neuroscience perspective, rather than the more subjective approach of symptomatology and clinical presentation. This review also presents Gambling Dual Disorder as a brain and neurodevelopmental disorder, including from the perspectives of evolutionary psychiatry, genetics, impulsivity as an endophenotype, the self-medication hypothesis, and sexual biological differences. The wide vision of the disease advances a paradigm shift, highlighting how GD and dual disorders should be conceptualized, diagnosed, and treated. Rethinking GD as part of a dual disorder is crucial for its appropriate conceptualization from the perspective of clinical neuroscience and precision psychiatry.",

      "title": "The Explanation of Impulsive Action",
      "abstract": "ABSTRACT. Impulsive action, such as binge eating or drinking, wrist‐slashing, compulsive promiscuity or chronically explosive marital conflict, presents serious problems for psychoanalysis. Such action evokes explanations both from the analyst and from the patient. The analyst may be held captive by explanatory notions that emphasise one aspect of impulsive action rather than the whole process. These explanations are based on our notions of drive pressure, adaptation, control and attack of intimate persons, ‘acting out,’ and the ‘compulsion to repeat’. The patient's explanations may be either consciously stated or inferred by the analyst as unconscious‘explanations’from associative material. If the patient's explanations dovetail with or adapt to those of the analyst, the analyst may take them as confirmatory, and the whole process of breakdown and restitution may escape analytic scrutiny. This process includes: (1) a precipitant that is narcissistically wounding; (2) a prodrome consisting of an experience of lack or absence which the patient feels as persecution, and a restitutive phantasy of the lack as fillable by a consummatory act; (3) the act itself; (4) character defences that ward off mortification on awareness of personal disintegration (shame) or the consequences of the act (guilt); explanations emphasising guilt often screen those giving rise to shame; (5) an attempt to regulate distance to protect against narcissistic injury by keeping intimates from getting too close or too far away. The therapist's tendencies to overemphasise the precipitant, the meaning of the act, or its distance regulating may convey an attitude of blame rather than understanding. Therapeutic emphasis on the subjective experience in an unintegrated way is sympathy, not empathy; sympathy is collusive and fosters splitting and impedes working with the negative transference. Blame or sympathy may be buttressed by the type of explanation accepted by analyst and patient. Explanatory preconceptions must be transcended to do effective interpretive work. Interpretation should convey understanding of a preoccupied ego that manifests its disorganising and restitutive propensities in the process of impulsive action.",

According to stress theory, when events and strains accumulate in people's lives, they can overwhelm people's psychosocial resources and abilities to cope and then generate symptoms of psychological disorder. Labeling theory picks up at this point and suggests that frequent, severe, or highly visible symptoms or symptoms exhibited by those with little social prestige or power, can launch a victimizing process. Societal reactions to symptoms may result in the person's receiving a formal psychiatric diagnosis, becoming hospitalized, and, ultimately, accepting a mental patient identity.",

Psychosocial and environmental problems may affect diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of mental disorders; the problems or stressors can contribute to the development of a mental disorder or can be the result of a mental disorder. The multiaxial assessment process should result in the following; documentation of the primary and any secondary mental and behavioral disorders; definition of physical disorders that may be present and indication if they are related to or influence the mental and behavioral disorders; identification of environmental stressors that may affect, contribute to, complicate, or exacerbate the mental and behavioral disorder; and a rating of the person's psychological, social, and occupational functioning.

By preventing suicide we may be able to forestall the development of other types of ill-health and thus improve the quality of the life that has been saved.",

While posttraumatic stress disorder in the elderly has been studied, less is known about other common trauma- and stressor-related disorders including adjustment disorder, acute stress disorder, and traumatic grief. The <italic>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</italic> (fifth edition) defines trauma as “exposure or actual or threatened death, serious injury, or sexual violence.” It must be directly experienced, witnessed, or occur to a family member or friend, or it could be a repeated or extreme exposure to aversive details of a traumatic event. No event is always traumatic, and, conversely, even a seemingly mild negative event can be traumatic to some individuals. Two presumed variables are (a) appraisal of the situation (whether a person feels in control) and (b) individual biological differences in responsiveness.",

Die Ursachen liegen darin, dass psychiatrische Diagnosen auf Verhaltensbeobachtung und Beschwerdeschilderung gruenden, sie sind deswegen mitunter kaum zu objektivieren. Wegen den Schwierigkeiten in der Diagnosestellung ist fuer die Beurteilung von Schaedigungsfolgen weniger die Diagnose, als vielmehr der gesicherte Nachweis konkreter Funktionsstoerungen geeignet. Bei der Untersuchung ist der Gutachter weitgehend auf die Mitwirkung des Untersuchten angewiesen. Eingeschraenkte Kooperativitaet ist daher ein Problem erstrangiger Bedeutung. Aus einer Diagnose folgt nicht, dass ein bestimmtes Ausmass an Beeintraechtigung vorliegt. Deshalb ist es unumgaenglich, die Beeintraechtigungen als Befund konkret nachzuweisen, zu bezeichnen und ihre Auswirkungen auf den Einzelfall darzulegen. Psychische Folgeschaeden von Unfaellen setzen einen psychischen Erstschadensbefund voraus. Deren Vorliegen kann aus den Berichten der Erstbehandler, aus den Polizeiberichten oder aus Augenzeugenaussagen hervorgehen. Probleme liegen hier in der Abgrenzung der normalen psychischen Betroffenheit nach einem Schadensereignis. Unerlaesslich ist eine Pruefung der zeitlichen Abfolge (Folge nach der Ursache), also ob aehnliche Befunde bereits vor dem Unfall bestanden haben. Bei den Stoerungsbildern dissoziative Bewegungsstoerungen und somative Stoerungen koennen durch den Untersucher keine krankhaften Befunde, bei der traumatischen Belastungsstoerung nur spaerliche Befunde erhoben werden.

PCS is controversial insofar as it has been attributed to emotional reactions, physiological responses, symptom exaggeration, secondary gain, attentional disorder, dysfunction of informational processing and mental speed, diffuse axonal injury, cranial nerve injury, emotional reaction to being injured, and so forth. The site of noncerebral trauma has been described by the Abbreviated Injury Scale as head or neck, face, chest, abdomen or pelvic contents, extremities or pelvic girdle, external. Neurobehavioral and adaptive dysfunctions after an accident are diverse and complex. There are characteristic sensorimotor and cognitive symptoms, for example, dizziness, visual and balance symptoms. The spectrum of injuries caused by a concussive event creates adaptive difficulties in coping with the social and physical environments.",

Recognizing these phenomena may be helpful in accurate diagnosis, in considering such conditions as psychosis of whatever type, multiple personality disorder, and other amnesia and fugue states, and in understanding the person's psychopathology. Two cases are presented to illustrate a process that the authors have named the Riel Phenomenon, after the person who was a party to what is often recognized as the most famous case in Canadian history.",

Early in the twentieth century, schizophrenia was known as dementia praecox (premature dementia), because of the disintegration or fragmenting of mental functions typically observed in people with the disorder. The term schizophrenia itself means “fragmented mind,” referring to the schisms between thought, emotion, and behavior that characterize the disease. It is not the same as “split personality,” which is an altogether different illness now known as dissociative identity disorder. People with schizophrenia do not alternate between “good” and “bad” personalities.",

      "abstract": "The presence of physical symptoms that do not correlate with a disease process are often frustrating to healthcare professionals, are difficult to diagnose and may consume an inordinate proportion of healthcare resources. However, proper and complete physical and psychological assessment and treatment is becoming increasingly possible and essential. Physical illness may occur concomitantly and sometimes as a result of psychological distress, which has displayed itself in a diagnosed mental illness. In other cases physical symptoms may be caused by unconscious dynamics, and the process becomes the primary presenting mental concern. In other cases the physical illness is part of a conscious process and motivated by the hope of gain. Differentiation between physical symptoms of unconscious and conscious origin is important in selecting the correct response. A manager must first of all be alert for physical symptoms that appear to be consciously motivated, as in a disorder called \"malingering.\" The essential feature of malingering is the intentional production of false or grossly exaggerated physical or psychological symptoms, motivated by external incentives such as avoiding work or obtaining financial compensation. Managers may inadvertently encourage malingering in the workplace by inappropriate responses to employees who present a physical complaint that is consciously motivated for gain. When the manager can recognize this phenomenon as malingering, appropriate managerial intervention can cause this behavior to be controlled and even eliminated and thus enhance productivity.",

Symptoms may be ascribed to malingering, exaggeration or poor effort on cognitive testing.

Further, consciousness of actions (voluntariness) and consciousness of motives (intentionality) are not necessarily associated. Illness behavior can be learned and reinforced and is a potential confounder in the association between illness or injury and impairment or disability. Illness behavior is not an impairing condition according to the AMA Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment ( AMA Guides ), and a table in the article describes the characteristics of the symptom magnification syndrome and other related conditions. Three diagnoses—somatic symptom disorders, illness anxiety disorder, and conversion disorder—possibly are ratable using the AMA Guides . Unsupported and insupportable conclusions regarding symptom exaggeration represent substandard practice because of the importance of such conclusions to the disposition of patients who present for assessment of impairment or disability. Similarly, failure to note and account for illness behavior and symptom exaggeration also represent substandard practice because the goal in impairment ratings is to note and account for all evidence related to the impairment, including the extent of illness behaviors.",

      "abstract": "The word depression is being used to describe both a symptom and an illness.The symptom is the experience of gloom, despondency, sadness, grief; the feeling of being run down, dispirited, miserable, melancholic, in the dumps, or of being low.The richness of our language in synonyms for depression may be taken as an indication of its frequency.It is an emotional experience, though sometimes it is described as an empti- ness or flatness, seemingly a loss rather than a lowering of affect.Depression, like anxiety, is a universal experience, and we regard it as abnormal only if it appears without reason or if it seems excessive in its degree or duration in relation to the pro- vocation.Not surprisingly such a common feeling may be associated with any psychiatric syndrome; the depressive dis- orders are those in which the depressed affect appears to be the primary phenomenon or at any rate one of the more prominent of the clinical features.Broadly there are two depressive entities-endogenous depres- sion, which is a variant of manic-depressive illness, and neurotic depression.In practice the differentiation of these two condi- tions is often difficult, but this is not surprising when we recall that any primary psychiatric disturbance may be associated with secondary or reactive features, and of these depression is one of the more common.A convenient though over-simplified view that attempts to quantify this relationship suggests that in any individual case we can regard the patient a. showing say-to give an example-40% endogenous and 60% reactive or neurotic depression.If so, one should not forget that irre- spective of the magnitude of the figures it is the endogenous component that is important, for the remainder is a reaction to it.Successful treatment of the endogenous component is likely to lead to total recovery, whereas treatment directed only at the reactive component can hardly be more than partly successful.The term \" atypical depression \" has been applied to some of these cases.It is only in the last 10 or 15 years we have come to appre- ciate how common is depressive illness.Watts' estimated that in general practice one could expect that of every 1,000 patients 12 would present as revw cases each year.Older figures, largely hospital derived and therefore making little allowance for milder cases, suggest that the incidence of endogenous depression alone is 1% in males and 2% in females.It would be unwise to suggest that depressive illness has become more common in the last 10 years ; the much larger number of cases seen reflects the fact that we have learned to recognize its milder forms. Endogenous DepressionLet us take endogenous depression first.Though less common and less likely to be overlooked, the more severe cases will be described first.The onset is usually gradual, the patient often looks ill, his skin may be sallow and dry, the hair lustreless, and",

One of the main roots of Anniversary Disease is an unsolved emotional conflict situation in the aggressive sphere. One has to atone through the illness for the aggressive, mostly unconscious drives towards a key figure. The illness can relieve the conflict by pathocure, without awareness of existing feelings of grief and mourning, connected with separation and loss. Anniversary Disease is a non-specific reaction, which in the described material lasted no more than a week or ten days.",

      "title": "Djinnati Syndrome in Baluchistan: The Role of Traumatic and Abuse Experiences on Individual Vulnerability",
      "abstract": "is a culture-bound syndrome in Baluchestan, Iran. Experts believe that dissociation theory is more suitable for providing a psychopathological description of this syndrome in this region. In addition, they highlight need for investigating its pathology, particularly role of factors such as traumatic and abuse experiences during childhood.\r\n\r\nAccording to 4th edition of diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders (DSM-IV-TR) (1), the essential feature of dissociative disorders is a disruption in usually integrated functions of consciousness, memory, identity, or perception of environment. The disturbance may be sudden or gradual, transient or chronic. According to DSM-IV-TR, dissociative disorders include: dissociative identity disorder, depersonalization disorder, dissociative amnesia, dissociative fugue and unspecified dissociative disorder. A dissociate disorder not otherwise specified (NOS) is a disorder that includes a dissociative symptom (i.e. disturbance in usually integrated functions of consciousness, memory, identity or perception of environment), that does not meet criteria for any specific dissociative disorder.\r\n\r\nIn addition, according to DSM a dissociative state may be defined as a dissociative trance disorder that includes a possession or trance state. Dissociative trance disorder is a single or episodic disturbance in state of consciousness, identity, or memory that are indigenous to particular locations and cultures. Dissociative trance involves narrowing of awareness of immediate surroundings or stereotyped behaviors or movements that are experienced as being beyond one’s control. Possession trance involves replacement of customary sense of personal identity or a new identity, attributed to influence of a spirit, power, deity, or other person, and is associated with stereotyped “involuntary” movements or amnesia. It is probably most prevalent dissociative disorder in Asia. The dissociative or trance disorder is not a normal part of a broadly accepted collective cultural or religious practice.\r\n\r\nMany culture-related syndromes, such as amok, bebainan, latah, pibloktoq, ataque de nervios and possession, shin-byung, enchantment, lack of spirit, Zar and djinnati (2, 3), are considered as dissociative disorders. Culture-bound syndromes include a set of psychological phenomena that are of interest to psychologists and psychiatrists. The eclectic nature of this syndrome has made it difficult to have a precise definition. Thus, deciding on a specific definition has been controversial. According to DSM, term culture-bound syndrome denotes a locality-specific pattern and repetition of an aberrant behavior and troubling experience that may or may not be linked to a particular DSM-IV diagnostic category. Many of these patterns are indigenously considered to be illnesses, or at least afflictions that mostly have local names. Culture-bound syndromes do not one-by-one match routine diagnostic system diseases. Most of these syndromes were initially reported as an issue specific to a certain culture or a relevant set, or geographically-related to original culture (4).\r\n\r\nThe term Djinnati is a culture-bound syndrome, widely known by that name in Iranian and Pakistani Baluchestan (3, 5). Based on clinical observations, this syndrome was introduced by Bakhshani and Kianpoor in Baluchestan, Iran (6). A new study by Bakhshani et al. (3) on a rural population in Baluchestan showed total prevalence of 0.5% and 1.03% among rural population and women of that population, respectively. Common symptoms of this disorder include disruption in consciousness, memory and stereotyped behaviors such as laughing, crying, speaking incomprehensibly, which are attributed to a new identity known as Djinn. Attacks usually begin with pain, irritation and sometimes limb paralysis. In some groups, loss of speech and in some other cases, speaking in different languages and change in speaking rhythm and tone of voice have been reported. In addition, there was a partial and rarely complete amnesia during attack. Some patients were far beyond their physical strength. In addition, lack of control and harming themselves and others, during attack, have been reported; although, injuries were not serious. Sometimes during attack, The patients express some demands and possessor (Djinn) requests for satisfying these demands. Attacks usually last from 30 minutes to two hours (3). \r\n\r\nIt seems that traumatic and abuse experiences have an essential role in initiation and maintenance of dissociative disorders (7, 8). Results from Bakhshani et al. (3) study showed that 43% of patients experienced their first attack after a traumatic accident (5). After civil war of Mozambique, based on results of a study reported by Igreja et al. (9) on 941 subjects (255 males and 686 females), trauma and civil war resulted damages, which explain high prevalence of this disorder.\r\n\r\nCastillo (10), believes that biological and psychoanalytic perspectives are not capable of explaining spirit possession. Etiologically, he suggested that spirit possession, similar to multiple personality disorder (MPD), is a spontaneous trance reaction to severe and negative events in environment (particularly child abuse). On other hand, Naring and Nijenhuis observed a significant correlation between traumatic events and possession experiences (11). In addition, Naring and Nijenhuis (11) considered dissociative identity disorder to be a consequence of childhood abuse or other traumatic events, thus support post-trauma model. In this regard, a study by Pasquini et al. (12), showed a relationship between traumatic experience in childhood and development of dissociative disorders. Kaplan et al. (13) found that those with higher score in dissociative experience scale had been more sexually abused during their childhood. They have been reported to commit further suicide and aggressive behaviors (13).\r\n\r\nIn general, it can be concluded that traumatic experiences, specifically childhood maltreatment and abuse, are related to possession and dissociative experiences. Therefore, in future studies, it is required to investigate type of cultural beliefs abuse and other environmental factors with onset of clinical signs of Djinatti, and then develop and practice preventive and therapeutic approaches, based on findings.",

Of note, two key changes in DSM-5 pertinent to older adults are elimination of minor depression from the appendix and elimination of the bereavement exclusion criterion for major depression. In a helpful addition, the DSM-5 major depression criteria now include a \"note\" on the relationship between depressive symptoms and response to significant loss. Depressive symptoms are likewise present in other DSM-5 disorders, such as adjustment disorder with depressed mood and mood disorder due to a general medical condition (see Table 5–1 ).

A manic episode is defined as an alteration in mood that is euphoric, expansive, or irritable; lasts for at least 1 week; and occurs with three other associated symptoms (e.g., decreased need for sleep, increased energy, racing thoughts, pressured speech, increased behaviors that may have high likelihood for bad outcome). Manic episodes in later life also may present with a mixture of manic, dysphoric, and cognitive symptoms, with euphoria being less common (Post 1978). When mania is associated with significant changes in cognitive function—so-called manic delirium—it may be difficult to distinguish from organic conditions or schizophrenia (Shulman 1986). A diagnosis of bipolar II disorder can be made when a patient has experienced one or more depressive episodes accompanied by at least one hypomanic episode. A hypomanic episode is defined as at least 4 days of altered mood (expansive, euphoric, irritable) occurring with at least three other associated symptoms (see above). Bipolar disorder not otherwise specified is defined as disorders with bipolar features that do not meet the criteria for specific bipolar disorders.",

This chapter also discusses how to differentiate BDD from normal appearance concerns and from problematic preoccupation with obvious physical defects. BDD is commonly misdiagnosed as another mental disorder. Sometimes misdiagnosis occurs because patients are too embarrassed and ashamed to reveal their appearance concerns; in such cases, BDD symptoms that are more readily observable (such as social anxiety) may be assigned an incorrect diagnosis while BDD goes undetected. In other cases, BDD symptoms are recognized but are misdiagnosed as another disorder. BDD must be differentiated from other conditions so appropriate treatment can be instituted.",

Patients are resistant and difficult to reason with to alter their thinking about their belief in the delusion. The initial literature to describe the disease appeared in 1948. There are two forms of delusions of parasitosis: primary and secondary.

The grief reactions can be divided into stress-specific reactions (typical, chronic, inhibited, and delayed grief) and non-specific and mixed reactions (distorted grief). It is especially in the latter group the diagnostical difficulties show up. The reason is, that the symptomatology in these cases is very diffuse and the clinical picture may look like many other psychiatric diseases. A case with the clinical picture of depression caused by pathological grief is discussed in relationship to other kinds of depression. Regarding psychiatric patients it is often difficult to unveil the trauma/loss. In some patients there will be more than one loss, and the problem is to find out which one has caused the symptoms. Besides, sometimes the traumatic loss is unconscious. In order to unveil the trauma we have used a combined physio-psychotherapy, which in the uncovering phase is characterized by a therapeutic non-directive attitude, where the patient is grounded, relaxed, concentrated, and as close to himself as possible in order to facilitate thoughts, emotions, body sensations etc. to emerge. When you have identified the type of loss, the therapy follows the basic principles: The inhibited emotions must be expressed and painful situations must be repeated until the emotions are extinguished. During the therapy the psychiatric patient will be in danger of becoming psychotic or committing suicide, and often it has been necessary to apply psychopharmaca to accomplish the therapy, even if many authors warn against it. The difficulties of treating hospitalized patients with pathological grief are to my opinion counterbalanced by the advantages of the in-patient psychiatric department, where you have the possibility of using various kinds of professionals, whose combined methods of treatment may ensure a successful therapy.Key Words: Pathological griefpsychotherapy",

      "title": "Sensory and Perceptual Alterations",
      "abstract": "Sensory-perceptual alteration can be defined as when there is a change in the pattern of sensory stimuli followed by an abnormal response to such stimuli. Such perceptions could be increased, decreased, or distorted with the patient's hearing, vision, touch sensation, smell, or kinesthetic responses to stimuli. Such changes in the pattern of responses to stimuli lead to changes in a patient’s behavior, sensory acuity, decision-making process, and problem-solving abilities. This can lead to irritability, restlessness, poor concentration, fluctuating mental status, changes in communication due to inattention, and lack of focus. Furthermore, sensory deprivation in isolated patients can lead to anxiety, depression, aggression, hallucinations, and psychotic reactions. Any alteration in a patient's normal environment can result in stress especially if such alteration is involuntary. Sensory overload occurs when an individual experiences a stimulus that they are unable to manage and process. Usually, the second stimulus is filtered out by selective perception or coping behavior. However, in certain environmental conditions such as the emergency department, or due to specific underlying illnesses such as dementia, sensory overload can occur due to inadequate filtering of stimuli.Sensory deprivation occurs when an individual receives a stimulus that is reduced or below the threshold of normal. Risk factors to such alterations can be broadly due to acute illnesses, patient factors related to chronic medical conditions, aging, or due to environmental or iatrogenic causes. This typically occurs when the patient is placed in isolation, such as changes in the environment due to hospital admission or admission to isolated wards. While in isolation, there can be a reduction in the quantity and quality of stimuli and restriction of social interaction. Other risk factors that can lead to increased or decreased alteration in the processing of stimuli can be due to hearing impairment, loss of vision, loss of smell or taste, aging, trauma, electrolyte imbalance, seizure disorder, mental health problems, and genetic causes.",

The forms of delusion range from mis-attribution of identity related to self, other, as well as parts of the body. Although rare, these syndromes are encountered in a number of different forms by medical and psychiatric personnel, as well as other types of mental health workers. This is especially true since many of the syndromes have organic etiology and are treated via medical rather than psychological intervention. Nevertheless, delusional mis-identification syndromes often co-exist with psychiatric issues which can be helped by concurrent psychological treatment. Given that identity is central to human beings and their cultures, it is not surprising that delusional mis-identification is represented in a number of cultural beliefs. Some cultural expressions of delusional mis-identification may function as coping mechanisms for anxiety over loss of identity or the trauma of infant mortality.",

Fatigue may also develop without any antecedent condition other than a viral infection, leading to what is known as “chronic fatigue syndrome” (Holmes et al., 1988). Some medical and pharmacological treatments (cytokines, interferon, radiotherapy, chemotherapy), physical or mental exertions, or particular environmental or psychological conditions (extreme temperature, stress, inactivity) can also induce fatigue.",

      "title": "Neuropsychiatric Update of the Crime “Profile” and “Signature” in Single or Serial Homicides: Rule out Limbic Psychotic Trigger Reaction<sup>1</sup>",
      "abstract": "A neuropsychiatric and -psychological update of the crime “profile” and “signature” is a necessary addition to the traditional sociopsychological model likely to miss limbic system dysfunctioning. Thus, occurrence of a brief (c. 20 minutes) limbic seizure has been proposed based on behaviors of 12 white male homicidal loners, who showed a dozen symptoms and signs: Limbic Psychotic Trigger Reaction. Readily overlooked can be (a) a transient psychosis (hallucinations and/or delusions), (b) autonomic hyperactivation (e.g., loss of bladder control, nausea, ejaculation), (c) motiveless, out-of-character, unplanned, and well-remembered homicidal acts, (d) committed with a flat affect (not emotionally or impulsively provoked), (e) typically involving a stranger who happened to provide an objectively harmless and only subjectively important stimulus. (f) Such an individualized stimulus triggered the memory revival of mild to moderate but repeatedly experienced hurts. Such a specific sequence of events implicates the specific mechanism of limbic seizure, “kindling,” which does not necessarily involve motor convulsions. Repetition of such limbic episodes with “criminal acts” is conceivable under specific circumstances including cases in which the triggering stimulus is associated with pleasurable delusions (e.g., of grandiose power or wealth) or constitutes a specific aspect of a basic drive motive. For example, eating or sexual activities might be planned but degenerate into a limbic episode with a specific core symptomatology.",

      "abstract": "• Summary: Somatoform disorders and functional somatic syndromes are defined as the presence of physical symptoms in the absence of sufficient tissue or organ damage to account for the degree of pain or dysfunction. Many people who suffer from these disorders have a history of childhood abuse. Because these individuals may also have a number of other difficulties in living, social workers encounter such clients in diverse fields of practice. Clients who fall into the category of adult survivors of abuse with a somatoform disorder may experience certain interventions by doctors, therapists, and other helping professionals (including social workers) as repeating interactions they had with their abusers. • Findings: Adult survivors of abuse who have a somatoform disorder often have parallel experiences in terms of their abuse and their somatic symptoms: important others communicate that the abuse and the symptoms are not real, are the client’s fault, and/or that the client is over-reacting to the abuse and symptoms. Furthermore, adult survivors of abuse may experience helping professionals as distinctly non-nurturing and as engaging in distancing behaviours. These interactions may stand in the way of helping members of this population, or even add to the client’s distress. There are specific practices in which the social worker may engage to help avoid these kinds of relations. • Applications: Social workers in a number of fields of practice may be alerted to dynamics common among adult survivors of abuse with a somatoform disorder. In the event that a client falls into this category, the informed social worker can avoid recapitulating abuse dynamics as well as help clients understand their diagnosis and why interactions with helping professionals may have been upsetting.",

      "title": "Animal well-being. II. Stress and distress.",
      "abstract": "The concepts of stress and distress are integral parts of consideration of animal well-being. Generally, stress refers to a state of threatened homeostasis, but precise clinical definitions, causes, and biological measurements have been controversial and confusing. Numerous factors associated with needs, life in captivity, threatening events, or aversive stimuli may threaten homeostasis. An animal's well-being or quality of life is an individual's internal somatic and mental state that is affected by what it knows or perceives; its feelings and motivational state; the responses to internal or external stimuli or environments; interacting variables; and phylogeny and ontogeny. Threats to homeostasis activate a complex pattern of behavioral changes and responses in the central and autonomic nervous and endocrine systems. Some responses can be considered normal adaptive and coping activities, satisfactorily handling the threats and therefore contributing to well-being. Other responses may be considered abnormal, maladaptive, and affective disorders. A persistent threat may lead to prolonged hyperactivity of the neuroendocrine system, which impairs rather than contributes to well-being. Except for extremes, differentiation between normal and abnormal internal states is frequently unclear. Individual adapting and coping styles may be more important than the stimuli in determining the varied responses. In animals, perception of a stimulus or life event is as important as the actual situation or environment. As caregivers, humans may know that an event or situation is no threat, but the animal usually does not function with the same information base as humans. A principal component in controlling an animal's response to an external event is determining how the animal perceives a situation. Mental and biological well-being is more likely to exist in animals if they are familiar with their environment, including social groups, and if they can predict or anticipate changes in the environment.",

      "title": "MENTAL DEFICIENCY AND THE IMPORTANCE OF ITS RECOGNITION FROM A MEDICO- LEGAL STANDPOIN T",
      "abstract": "The problem of the determination of the degree of culpability of an individual who has committed an anti-social act is sometimes associated with great difficulties. A variety of factors may enter into the solution of this problem. An illegal act may be committed accidentally or unexpectedly and independently of the individual's will. It may be committed under an unavoidable necessity, such as in cases of protection of ones self or ones family. It may be committed under the influence of extreme passion or anger, when consciousness becomes blurred and cerebral inhibition is obliterated. It may be committed by insane individuals whose delusional ideas, accompanied or not by hallucinatory images, develop morbid impulses or deliberate and well planned criminal tendencies. Finally, illegal acts may be committed by individuals who, though not insane in the strict sense of the word, are nevertheless different from normal individuals by their power of reasoning, by their sentiments, tastes, sympathies, etc. To this class belongs the large category of psychopathic individuals, and also the mental defectives. The discussion of the underlying psychological moments of each of these groups of individuals is comprised in an extensive literature. We will be concerned exclusively with the medico-legal relation of the latter group alone. In order to ascertain the degree of legal responsibility of mental defectives, it is necessary first to emphasize the characteristic clinical features of mental deficiency. In considering all varieties of deviation from normal in the psychic sphere we find a long scale beginning with mental monstrosities and ending with slight mental feebleness. When the intellectual powers are involved in their entirety we deal with idiocy. When the arrest of mental development is only incomplete and is, therefore, compatible with the existence of some intellectual manifestations, we deal with imbecility. There are also individuals in whom only certain powers are likely to reach a degree of development; in whom there is no general, but only partial defect of intellectual powers. For example, one will show a meager power of intellectual acquisition, in another the power of judgment is defective; another is incapable of acquiring ele-",

Both phenomenon can be due to medication or drug, or to an altered mental status. Visual hallucinations can be formed (objects, people) or unformed (light, geometric figures). They can be generated either by a lesion on the antechiasmatic pathway, by a seizure phenomenon, by a migrainous phenomenon, or by a release phenomenon secondary to visual differentiation. Investigations will be directed towards a retinopathy, an optic neuropathy, a chiasmal or retrochiasmal lesion, or a bilateral antechiasmal lesion (Charles Bonnet syndrome). Visual illusions include meta-morphopsias, micro- macropsias, polyopia, palinopsia (visual perseveration), achromatopsia, Pulfrich phenomenon, or subjective vertical deviation. Illusions can be due to lesions of the retina, the optic nerve, the visual cortex (primary or associative), or the graviceptive pathways.As most patients do not spontaneously mention their symptoms, history taking is essential. The first step is to rule out medication or an altered mental status as the possible cause of these symptoms.

      "abstract": "Psychische aandoeningen, zoals depressie en angststoornissen, zorgen vaak voor functionele beperkingen zoals verminderd vermogen om voor jezelf te zorgen, problemen met het onderhouden van vriendschappen, ziekteverzuim en nog veel meer. Er is echter nog veel onduidelijkheid over de sterkte van het verband tussen psychische aandoeningen en de soort en ernst van deze functionele beperkingen. In dit proefschrift wordt dit verband nader onderzocht in de bevolking. De belangrijkste bevindingen kunnen als volgt worden omschreven: (1) Psychische aandoeningen gaan gepaard met andere functionele beperkingen dan lichamelijke aandoeningen, maar ze beperken het functioneren minstens even ernstig. (2) Lichamelijke en psychische aandoeningen komen vaak samen voor bij dezelfde persoon en dit leidt tot veel ziekteverzuim. (3) Het ziekteverzuim dat samenhangt met depressie wordt vooral veroorzaakt door concentratieproblemen en gevoelens van schaamte. (4) Na herstel van een depressie herstelt het functioneren ook in de meerderheid van gevallen. Bij mensen die na hun depressieve episode niet volledig herstellen in hun functioneren komen vaker ook een angststoornis, verslaving, of lichamelijke aandoening voor en deze mensen ervaren minder steun uit hun sociale netwerk dan mensen die wel volledig herstellen. Hoewel er nog onduidelijkheid blijft bestaan over welke factoren een positieve en negatieve invloed hebben op functioneren, blijkt uit dit proefschrift duidelijk dat niet iedere aandoening bij iedereen tot evenveel functionele beperkingen leidt. Behandelingen die niet direct leiden tot een afname in de ernst en het aantal psychische symptomen, maar wel zorgen voor verbeteringen in het functioneren, zouden dan ook niet als zonder succes moeten worden beschouwd.",

      "abstract": "Abstract In hysteria, a physical symptom or sign is said to be produced by a psychological mechanism, triggered by a conflict within the patient. Crucially, there is no explanatory physical cause that can be demonstrated. The man or woman so afflicted reports that they cannot raise their arm, or cannot see; yet physical investigations prove negative and, when sedated or observed unobtrusively over time, symptomatic inconsistencies arise. However, despite these, the diagnostic systems applied are quite specific that the patient experiencing and exhibiting such symptoms and signs is not responsible for their production, i.e. they are not ‘feigning’. Hence, the physician is called upon to judge what the patient is thinking and not doing, i.e. to perceive that they are really trying to move or see and are not pretending to be impaired. This is a complex task and the use of language in this area suggests considerable uncertainty among physicians as to what it is they are diagnosing.",

DSM-5에서는 DSM-IV와 동일한 10가지 성격장애의 범주적 접근을 유지하고 있다. 한편DSM-5의 Section III에는 차원-범주 혼합모형(hybrid dimensional-categorical model)이 제안되었다. 이로써 임상가는 개인의 성격기능에서의 어려움과 성격의 병리적 특질패턴에 근거하여 성격장애의 진단과 성격을 평가할 수 있다.",

      "title": "Causal Thinking for Objective Psychiatric Diagnostic Criteria: A Programmatic Approach in Therapeutic Context",
      "abstract": "Terms such as disorder, illness, disease, dysfunction, and deviance embody the preconceptions of historical development (Klein, 1999). That individuals become ill for no apparent reason, suffering from pain, dizziness, malaise, rash, wasting, etc., has been known since prehistoric days. The recognition of illness led to the social definition of the patient and the development of various treatment institutions (e.g., nursing, medicine, surgery, quacks, and faith healers). Illness is an involuntary affliction that justifies the sick, dependent role (Parsons, 1951). That is, because the sick have involuntarily impaired functioning, it is a reasonable social investment to exempt them (at least temporarily) from normal responsibilities. Illness implies that something has gone wrong. However, gaining exemption from civil or criminal responsibilities is often desired. Therefore, if no objective criteria are available, an illness claim can be viewed skeptically. By affirming involuntary affliction, diagnosis immunizes the patient against charges of exploitative parasitism. Therefore, illness may be considered a hybrid concept, with two components: (1) the necessary inference that something has actually, involuntarily, gone wrong (disease) and (2) the qualification that the result (illness) must be sufficiently major, according to current social values, to ratify the sickness exemption role. The latter component is related to the particular historical stage, cultural traditions, and values. This concept has been exemplified by the phrase ‘‘harmful dysfunction’’ (Wakefield, 1992). However, this does not mean that the illness concept is arbitrary since the inference that something has gone wrong is necessary. Beliefs as to just what has gone wrong (e.g., demon possession, bad air, bacterial infection) as well as the degree of manifested dysfunction that warrants the sick role reflect the somewhat independent levels of scientific and social development (for further reference, see Lewis, 1967). How can we affirm that something has gone wrong if there is no objective evidence? The common statistical definition of abnormality simply is ‘‘unusual.’’ Something is abnormal if it is rare. Although biological variability ensures that someone is at an extreme, there is a strong presumption that something has gone wrong if sufficiently extreme.",

The necessity to act, and the urgency of the act in adolescence has been observed as well in adolescents that have health problems as in adolescents in good health. It is not possible to separate the acts that are symptoms of a pathological organization from the acts that are an expression of a normal psychology, but there is a tendency to conceive as psychopathological that which comes into conflict with, and that which is a transgression to, the laws of the social environment, and the biological laws. It is important for the clinical physician to know the social projections on the adolescent. In certain cases, the act is a play out of the fantasy organization of the adolescent and is a reflection of the personality of the subject: in other cases the symptom-acts are a summary of a past relationship, towards which it expresses an ending or a split; the act in an adolescent is all the more a symptom that it is isolated from a relationship.",

      "title": "Body Dysmorphic Disorder",
      "abstract": "Body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) is a common (lifetime prevalence of about 2%; Buhlmann et al. 2010) and often severe disorder whose core feature is preoccupation with one or more nonexistent or slight defects in one's physical appearance. The preoccupation causes clinically significant distress or impairment in psychosocial functioning, and it is not better explained by concerns with body fat or weight in an individual who meets diagnostic criteria for an eating disorder (American Psychiatric Association 2013) (see Box 22- ). Insight regarding the perceived flaws (e.g., \"I look ugly\") is usually absent or poor; most individuals are completely or mostly convinced that their view of their perceived deformities is accurate (Phillips et al. 2012). All persons with BDD, at some point during the illness, perform compulsive behaviors aimed at checking, fixing, hiding, or obtaining reassurance about the perceived appearance defects (Phillips et al. 2005a). BDD is characterized by poor psychosocial functioning and high rates of suicidality (Buhlmann et al. 2010; Phillips et al. 2005b, 2008; Veale et al. 1996a), yet BDD usually goes undiagnosed in clinical settings (Conroy et al. 2008; Grant et al. 2001). DSM-5 Diagnostic Criteria for Body Dysmorphic Disorder 300.7 F45.22 Preoccupation with one or more perceived defects or flaws in physical appearance that are not observable or appear slight to others. At some point during the course of the disorder, the individual has performed repetitive behaviors (e.g., mirror checking, excessive grooming, skin picking, reassurance seeking) or mental acts (e.g., comparing his or her appearance with that of others) in response to the appearance concerns. The preoccupation causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. The appearance preoccupation is not better explained by concerns with body fat or weight in an individual whose symptoms meet diagnostic criteria for an eating disorder. Specify if: With muscle dysmorphia: The individual is preoccupied with the idea that his or her body build is too small or insufficiently muscular. This specifier is used even if the individual is preoccupied with other body areas, which is often the case. Specify if: Indicate degree of insight regarding body dysmorphic disorder beliefs (e.g., \"I look ugly\" or \"I look deformed\"). With good or fair insight: The individual recognizes that the body dysmorphic disorder beliefs are definitely or probably not true or that they may or may not be true. With poor insight: The individual thinks that the body dysmorphic disorder beliefs are probably true. With absent insight/delusional beliefs: The individual is completely convinced that the body dysmorphic disorder beliefs are true. Believing that they look ugly or abnormal, many patients seek and receive cosmetic treatment. Studies from psychiatry settings have found that about two-thirds of patients with BDD receive surgery or dermatological, dental, or other cosmetic treatment for their perceived flaws (Crerand et al. 2005; Phillips et al. 2001a). In one study ( N = 250), only 7% of such treatments led to overall improvement in BDD (Phillips et al. 2001a), and in another study ( N = 200), only 4% of procedures improved overall BDD symptoms (Crerand et al. 2005). These outcome data are retrospective but concur with data from a small prospective study (Tignol et al. 2007). In a survey of cosmetic surgeons, 40% reported that a patient with BDD had threatened them legally or physically (Sarwer 2002). Such reports underscore the critical importance of diagnosing BDD and implementing psychiatric treatment. Before beginning treatment, it is important to lay essential groundwork, with the goal of engaging patients, establishing a therapeutic alliance, and instilling hope. Because most patients have poor or absent insight, they may doubt that they have BDD and that psychiatric treatment can help. Psychoeducation about BDD should be provided, including the fact that it is a common and treatable disorder. Patients may benefit from reading about BDD (e.g., Phillips 2009). Trying to convince or reassure patients with poor or absent insight that they look normal is usually ineffective (one cannot impose insight), and patients typically misinterpret comments about their appearance, even if positive or reassuring, in a negative way. On the other hand, it is important not to agree with patients' negative view of their appearance because this may be devastating to them. It is helpful to empathize with patients' feelings and to focus on the likelihood that psychiatric treatment will improve their distress, preoccupation, and functioning.",

Prevalence of this condition is unavailable in developing countries of the world. It is classified as \"L98.1 Excoriation (skin-picking) Disorder\" in ICD-10 and referred in some literature as \"dermatillomania\". ED is characterized by, but not invariably, the compulsive urge to pick, squeeze or scratch skin surfaces experienced by patients. Commonly picked parts of the body include the face (most picked), arms, legs, back, gums, neck, shoulders, scalp, abdomen, chest, the knuckles (via mouth leading to temporary disfiguration of distal and proximal joints of the middle and little fingers) and other extremities e.g. the fingernails, cuticles, and toe nails;5 skin picking may be accompanied by anxiety with depression following picking. It is often triggered by factors that include feeling or examining irregularities on the skin, feeling anxious etc. Complications include infections, tissue damage and sepsis. Rarely, severe cases cause lifethreatening injuries. Risk of self-harm is increased by feelings of intense helplessness, guilt, shame and embarrassment.8 Studies further describe significant associations between ED and suicidal ideation, suicidal attempts and psychiatric hospitalizations.",

      "title": "A Life Setting Conducive to Illness",
      "abstract": "Study of the life settings in which patients fall ill reveals that illness is commonly preceded by a period of psychological disturbance, during which the individual feels unable to cope. This has been designated the giving-up—given-up complex and has the following five psychologic characteristics: a feeling of giving up, experienced as helplessness or hopelessness; a depreciated image of the self; a sense of loss of gratification from relationships or roles in life; a feeling of disruption of the sense of continuity between past, present, and future; and a reactivation of memories of earlier periods of giving-up. It is proposed that this state reflects the temporary failure of mental coping mechanisms with a consequent activation of neurally regulated biological emergency patterns. Changes in body economy so evoked may alter the organism's capability to deal with concurrent pathogenic processes, permitting disease to develop. As such, the giving-up—given-up complex is neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition for disease development, merely a contributing factor.",

      "title": "Persistent Delusional Disorder Presenting as Munchausen by Proxy - A Case Report",
      "abstract": "Delusion is a false, unshakable belief that is out of keeping with the patient’s social and cultural background (Patricia Casey et al, 2019). Persistent delusional disorder (PDD) is characterized by the development either of a single delusion or of a set of related delusions which are usually persistent and sometimes lifelong. Often they are persecutory, hypochondriacal, or grandiose, but they may be concerned with litigation or jealously, or express a conviction that the individual’s body is misshapen, or that others think that he or she smells or is homosexual (ICD-10 classification of Mental and Behavioural Disorders). Delusional disorder with delusions of infidelity has been called conjugal paranoia or Othello syndrome (Sadock &amp; Sadock, 2015). Munchausen syndrome was first termed by Asher in 1951. Munchausen syndrome by proxy, essentially, is a form of child abuse in which a parent, usually the mother, or a caregiver repeatedly fabricates or actually inflicts injury or illness in a child for whom medical intervention is then sought, often in an emergency setting (Sadock &amp; Sadock, 2015). This case report presents one such beautiful case, where a father with persistent delusional disorder repeatedly fabricates an illness in his daughter, and make multiple requests to medicate his daughter. The core component of the delusional belief was infidelity. Initially, it was difficult to find any psychopathology in the daughter, except for some maladaptive reaction formation to frequent altercations with the father. Subsequently, it was realized that the father had persistent delusional belief related to his daughter’s fidelity (which was not corroborated by the daughter or other relatives). Personality can play a role in the genesis of delusional states; abnormally suspicious personalities can react to difficulties with deepening ideas of persecution, or may slowly develop delusions of marital infidelity or bodily ill health. One basic difference between Schizophrenia and PDD, is that delusions in PDD are well systematized, with one basic delusion and remainder of the system being logically built on this error (Patricia Casey et al, 2019). Persistent delusional disorders lack other psychopathology like hallucinations seen in Schizophrenia. Keywords: Persistent Delusional Disorder, Munchausen by Proxy, Infidelity, Paranoia",

      "title": "PSYCHOLOGICAL FEATURES OF AUTO-AGGRESSIVE BEHAVIOR OF ADOLSCENTS",
      "abstract": "There are various external factors that cause feelings, favorable for the formation of suicidal behavior: misunderstanding, meaningful rejection by others, experienced abuse, loneliness, alienation; loss of parental love, love – the key negative emotions are jea-lousy, death, divorce, escape from the family of some of the parents – despair, insult, jealousy; contempt, amazed selfishness – insult, anger, hatred, aggression as a desire to revenge, etc. It has been established that approximately half of examples of suicidal youth behavior are associated with destructive family problems, with a negative attitude towards them.Interpersonal or intrapersonal conflict in the conditions of social, psychological, existential crisis on the background of mental disadaptation can acquire a suicidogenic character. In all cases, the crucial moment in the formation of manifestation of suicidal behavior is precisely a suicidogenic conflict. Adoption of a suicidal decision (regardless of the causes, conditions, forms of maladaptation) occurs only after the phase of personal re-development of suicidogenic conflict.In our study, the group of suicide risk is totally 27.2 %. Researchers from this risk group are less readers of books, play computer games, attend interest groups, but are more on the streets and do their home affairs. They have significantly more problems with their father, mother, brothers and sisters, and their peers. They are mostly dissatisfied with the degree of realization of material and spiritual needs in their family. In the vast majority of high school students of the risk group, there are high levels of anxiety and mental and physical exhaustion, the experience of loneliness, hopelessness, irrationality of existence.In a greater number of senior pupils-licetists a factor of high anxiety was the fear of not meeting the expectations of others. Analysis of the data of the questionnaires of high school students of the risk group allowed to highlight and describe the main variants of individual images of states that can lead to auto-aggressive behavior of young people. The most striking feature is the sense of guilt, which arises as a result of inadequate assessment of one’s own actions or intentions, numerous, often groundless, self-excuse, hyperbolization of their mistakes, impairment of achievements, reproach of conscientiousness, and the desire to get out of life.",

      "abstract": "Psychosis is a severe and a complicated mental disorder that affects the overall well-being of an individual through alterations in thought and perceptions wherein the person losses touch with reality. The symptomatology of the disorder is demarcated as positive and the negative symptoms. The positive symptoms including delusions, illusions, auditory hallucinations, and thought disorders are the additional behaviors that develop after an individual develops the illness whereas the negative symptoms include introverted behavior, poor sociability, emotional blunting, amotivation, and cognitive deficits that reflect a decline in the normal functioning capacity of the person. People with psychotic disorders exhibit a significant reduction in the overall quality of life particularly in the domains of physical and mental health, social intercourses, self-esteem, and interpersonal relationships. Psychotic disorders are also one of the leading causes of disability and disability adjusted life years (DALYs) globally, causing a dent in the economy of a country through the inherent direct healthcare costs and the indirect costs (productivity and income losses) causing a depletion in capital and labor resource pool and subsequently causing a decrease in the overall productive capacity of the country. The existing literature highlights the importance of early interventions in psychosis, community-based multidisciplinary approaches including cognitive behavior therapy, somatic interventions, and pharmacotherapy in curtailing the impact and ameliorating the overall quality of life in people with psychosis.",

The youth does not need to endorse any physiologic or mental distress to meet criteria for CD, although these youth often have poor self-esteem, are often irritable, and have rates of suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, and completed suicides that are higher than the general population. Conduct disorder differs from personality disorders, in that for most individuals, the pattern of defiant behaviors remits prior to adulthood, although for a subgroup of these youth, CD is a precursor to antisocial personality disorder and=or substance-related disorders. A second diagnosis that is defined by behavior, oppositional defiant disorder (ODD), occasionally develops into CD. Conduct disorder is distinguished from ODD because the behaviors in CD are more confrontational and destructive, and because CD has a poorer prognosis.",

In the case of psychosis, the subject suffers from delusion (false beliefs) and hallucination (false perception); the impression for non-specialists is schizophrenia. In this presentation the patient has both delusion (false belief) and hallucination (false perception), but the diagnosis was not psychosis or schizophrenia. The false belief represents the Capgras syndrome, whereas the false perception is represents autoscopic phenomenon (AP), i.e. out of body experience (OBE). Capgras syndrome is a 'falsely believes' that a close relative or friend has been replaced by doubles or imposters. Whereas the out of body experience -false perception- the subject feels that his/her “self”, or is located outside the physical body and somewhat elevated, from this elevated extra personal location that subject experiences seeing his body and the world. In addition, something's happening to the patient; he experiences an inability to recognize his face in mirror (autoprosopagnosia). All this occurred to an 18-year-old patient who left the hospital one week later post head injury, brought to my office with his father six weeks ago after complete recovering from subdural hematoma in the right frontoparietal lobes, post motorcycle accident.",

      "title": "A Case of Depersonalization-Derealization Disorder",
      "abstract": "Aims: Background: Depersonalization-derealization disorder (DPDR), classified under ICD–11 code 6B66, involves persistent or recurrent experiences of depersonalization, derealization, or both. Depersonalization refers to a sense of detachment from one’s thoughts, emotions, or body, whereas derealization involves perceiving the external world as unreal or distorted. These symptoms cause significant distress or impairment, are not attributable to other mental disorders, substance use, or medical conditions, and occur while reality testing remains intact. Methods: Case Report. An 18-year-old female A-level student presented with a two-year history of frequent episodes in which her surroundings, including people and familiar environments, felt unreal. These episodes varied in duration and were highly distressing, particularly during emotional extremes such as heightened happiness or stress. Symptoms were most pronounced in the evenings or when she was unoccupied, leading to emotional breakdowns. Despite these experiences, she remained aware of her own reality, with disturbances centred on external perceptions. Her symptoms began following a nine-month psychiatric hospitalization. Prior to admission, she experienced unexplained gastrointestinal symptoms, and in the absence of an identifiable physical cause, she was diagnosed with conversion disorder. The hospitalization was distressing due to frequent invasive procedures, a perceived sense of blame for her condition, and feelings of entrapment. She subsequently developed post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), characterized by flashbacks, nightmares, and avoidance of medical settings. However, DPDR symptoms persisted outside of PTSD-related re-experiencing episodes, causing ongoing distress and impairment. Results: Discussion: This case highlights the complex interplay between DPDR and PTSD, particularly following medical trauma. While dissociative symptoms frequently occur in PTSD, ICD–11 differentiates DPDR as a distinct disorder when symptoms persist beyond re-experiencing episodes. In this case, the patient’s prolonged hospitalization, combined with perceived invalidation and invasive interventions, likely contributed to the development of DPDR as a maladaptive dissociative response. The exacerbation of symptoms during emotional extremes aligns with research indicating that dissociation may function as an affect regulation mechanism. Trauma-related dissociation has been linked to disruptions in emotional processing, potentially interfering with adaptive coping strategies. This underscores the importance of targeted psychological interventions to reduce distress and improve functional outcomes. Conclusion: A trauma-informed, multidisciplinary approach is essential in managing this patient’s complex presentation. Psychological interventions such as EMDR or trauma-focused CBT should be integrated with ongoing medical care to address both dissociative symptoms and physical health concerns. Collaborative management between psychiatric and medical teams will be crucial in promoting long-term recovery, enhancing her psychological resilience, and improving overall quality of life.",

It is a heterogeneous disorder, in that the extent and severity of the symptoms, cognitive deficits, and social dysfunction vary among individuals.

There is no laboratory or medical test that can be used to diagnosis this disorder.

      "abstract": "Delicate diagnosis':avoiding harms in difficult, disputed, and desired diagnoses Life & TimesMedical diagnoses can be subject to ambiguity, flux, subjectivity, and inherent uncertainty.This is particularly true in primary care, where many reported symptoms do not conform to a clear diagnosis.Thresholds around normality are often unclear.Symptoms are commonly experienced and described as an 'iceberg'.Over a third of otherwise well people without a chronic condition have felt tired or run down, or had a headache in the previous 2 weeks, and over a quarter have had back or joint pain.Distinguishing conditions that would benefit from diagnosis and earlier intervention from those that are temporary, self-limiting, and prone to harmful medicalisation, remains challenging.While overdiagnosis is a diagnosis of a condition that, if unrecognised, would not cause symptoms or harm, contested diagnoses are symptoms given a diagnosis, but where the diagnosis, as an explanation for them, is controversial.Opponents consider contested diagnoses 'wrong' not because of an error in history taking, clinical examination, or interpretation of a test result (which would risk misdiagnosis), but because the diagnosis itself, for example, chronic Lyme disease or multiple chemical sensitivity, is invalid.Contested diagnosis is bordered by 'pseudoscience', for example, adrenal fatigue, leaky gut syndrome, and chronic candidiasis, which attempt to explain symptoms with 'science' that is demonstrably incorrect.Many contested diagnoses relate to symptoms that are not clear-cut, meaning that some people are given a diagnosis that does not confer benefit.Others are primarily unexplained 'yet'.For example, Gulf War syndrome was treated as a contested illness but is now recognised as caused by exposure to sarin gas.Other recognised conditions are prone to a variety of influences such that diagnosis risks causing harm, through a variable mixture of misdiagnosis, overdiagnosis, pseudoscience, or overtreatment.A framework for considering some conditions as 'delicate diagnoses' may help to recognise and reduce the harms of medicine in these circumstances.",

      "abstract": "__Abstract__\r\n\r\nThe term parkinsonism refers to a neurological syndrome defined by the combination of\r\nbradykinesia (slowness of movement) in combination with any of the following motor signs: tremor\r\nat rest, muscular rigidity, and loss of postural reflexes (1). This is an etiologically heterogeneous\r\nentity, which might be due to dysfunctions at various levels in the basal ganglia, and especially\r\nin the substantia nigra (SN) and striatum. The parkinsonism can be classified into four broad\r\ncategories: (i) Parkinson's disease (PD, MIM#168600), also called primary parkinsonism, or typical\r\nparkinsonism, which includes the common, idiopathic form, and the rare forms with a recently\r\ndefined genetic etiology; (ii) parkinsonism-plus syndromes, which include different idiopathic,\r\nbut atypical neurodegenerative forms of parkinsonism (additional motor neurologic features are\r\npresent); (iii) secondary parkinsonism, which is caused by known, non-genetic etiologies, such as\r\nenvironmental insults (drugs, toxins, viruses), inflammation, tissue infiltration/compression or\r\nischemia; (iv) parkinsonism in the context of other degenerative disorders, with or without a known\r\ngenetic cause, in which parkinsonism represents a minor, or occasional component of the clinical\r\npicture (table 1 ).\r\nIn the primary forms of parkinsonism (PD) the initial symptoms occur typically in one side of\r\nthe body, spreading in a few years to the contralateral side. However, a certain degree of clinical\r\nasymmetry persists during the more advanced phases of the disease (the body side where\r\nthe symptoms started remains the more severely affected). Moreover, these motor symptoms\r\ndisplay typically a substantial beneficial response to the therapy with levodopa. While the motor\r\nsymptoms dominate the clinical picture, many PD patients have also other, non-motor problems,\r\nsuch as fatigue, depression, anxiety, sleep disturbances, constipation, bladder and other autonomic\r\ndisturbances, and sensory complaints (2).\r\nThe diagnosis of primary parkinsonism (PD) remains based on the presence of the clinical\r\nsyndrome, and the exclusion of other (secondary) causes.",

Anxiety-like symptoms are a frequent response to trauma (physical or psychological) and can be features of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), acute stress disorder, or adjustment disorder.Validated tools are available to screen for mental health symptoms generally, anxiety symptoms specifically, posttraumatic stress specifically, and impaired functioning, and to assess the effect of the child’s problem on caregivers; results lead to further discussions with the child and family.A child who feels anxious often has a parent who feels anxious or depressed; care of the parent is integral to helping the child.Pediatric clinicians can provide meaningful intervention, even in the absence of a diagnosis, through expressions of hope, empathy, and support to the child and family; encouragement of healthy habits and reducing overall stress; emphasis on coping with or gradual exposure to feared activities, rather than avoiding them; and brief interventions derived from cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT).Refer for full diagnostic evaluation and evidence-based care (CBT, plus medication for certain disorders) or comanage care with a mental health specialist ifThe child has severe functional impairments at school, at home, or with peers.Multiple symptoms of anxiety occur in many domains of life.The child or parent is very distressed by the symptom or symptoms.There are co-occurring behavioral problems (especially if combined with shyness).Anxiety was preceded by serious trauma or symptoms suggesting PTSD, acute stress disorder, or adjustment disorder.The child seems to have panic disorder or obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), both of which require specialized treatment.Anxiety occurs in a child with autism spectrum disorder (ASD).",

This is due, in part, to the fact that the patient’s complaint is a symptom, not a clinical sign or diagnosis, and the anatomical substrates for causing the problem are myriad (Fig. 16.1). The etiologies are diverse, if not legion, and there is poor correlation with symptoms, laboratory study findings, and pathological findings. This accounts for the fact that in 85% of patients with acute low-back pain and in 50% of patients with chronic low-back pain, no diagnosis is ever established.64,156,209 Further the problem may be complicated by other factors, resulting in an exaggeration of symptoms by nonphysiological processes (psychological, remunerative, occupational, etc.).",

      "abstract": "Disorders of the skin affect the psyche of a person significantly. The interplay between internal and external world can be depicted through the various skin reactions in regard to psychological or physiological stimuli. Psychocutaneous illness could be exclusively psychological or stress related or due to strong psychogenic factors. As per biopsychosocial model, it could be primary, multifactorial, or secondary to disfigurement. Whichever is the condition, invariably stress is a major contributing factor in prognosis and onset of disorders of the skin. Self-explanation, myth, stigma, and diminished self-confidence often lead to depression and suicidality followed by active avoidance of the workplace, in turn, causing significant disability in the individual. The conflict between self-image and perceived image frequently causes fear of rejection leading to social anxiety, reduced self-confidence, interpersonal communication, and impaired sexual intimacy with a partner. Maladaptive sets of coping strategies such as alexithymia, shame proneness, avoidance, concealment, and escape are very common among the sufferers which impair the attachment with family and friends. Children are the extreme sufferers as they develop inferiority, low self-esteem, loss of body image, and social withdrawal leading to rejection from parents and faulty development of attachment pattern. Hence, disorders of the skin can lead to impaired coping, impaired compliance, limitations in quality of life, negative body image, and stigmatization which invariably cause psychological comorbidities such as depression, anxiety, phobia, and somatoform and adjustment disorders. Hence, there is a direct relationship between skin, mind, and society which we are going to explore in a detailed fashion to understand its impact on the psyche and the society.",

Dissociation is often defined as partial or total disconnection between memories of the past, awareness of identity and of immediate sensations, and control of bodily movements, often resulting from traumatic experiences, intolerable problems, or disturbed relationships. Etiopatogenezis of dissociative disorders have not exactly known yet. The process of dissociation is independently associated with several distressing conditions such as psychiatric diagnoses, somatization, current psychological distress, and past sexual and physical victimization. The disturbance may have a sudden or gradual onset and may be temporary or chronic in its course. Dissociation has a negative impact on treatment oucome. Additionaly, dissociative patients may have an insecure attachment pattern negatively affecting the therapeutic relationship. Conceptually, the course of treatment is to improve coping, maintain reality, and establish normal integrative functions. Goals: 1. improve thought processes; 2. maintain a sense of reality; 3. improve coping skills; 4. develop stress management abilities; 5. increase identity integration. The treatment is possible with psychotherapy or pharmacotherapy or both. We will introduce the CBT approach. Participants will learn: • pharmacological possibilities in the treatment of dissociative disorders; • CBT model of dissociative disorders; • motivational interviewing with dissociative patient; • how to develope therapeutic relationship with dissociative patient; • conceptualization of dissociative disorder with the patient; • Socratic questioning; • working with cognitive, emotional and behavioral avoidance; • exposure technique with dissociative problems; • problem solving.

Though the underlying mechanism still remains unclear, there are two assumptions explaining the associations between somatic symptoms and depression. One is that depression itself causes several somatic symptoms. That is, people with depression may express their mental conflicts in various somatic symptoms. This hypothesis could apply especially to those who have a vague feeling of stigma or prejudice against mental disorders, and who are reluctant to frankly express their mental symptoms. From another point of view, this might mean that some chronic somatic symptoms are magnified due to the person’s depressive state. Another possible hypothesis is that those who have had chronic somatic symptoms of unknown origin, in other words, functional somatic symptoms, are likely to be depressed since they cannot always receive effective medical treatment for such symptoms.",

      "abstract": "Medical clinic patients with \"functional\" bodily complaints were commonly found to have a depressive reaction. This reaction consists of bodily symptoms and disturbances in relations, both interpersonal (withdrawl, irritability, and resentment) and intrapersonal (depressed mood, loss of pleasure in usual activities, helplessness, and injured self-esteem). The diagnosis is made on the history of a traumatic event which the patient perceives as a loss, rather than on symptoms alone. Diagnosis is important because the bodily symptoms are commonly used as a reason for coming to the doctor, because care of the patient demands recognition of all aspects of his illness, and because rational treatment depends on it. Treatment involves several roles of the doctor and his explicit or implicit use of some psychotherapeutic techniques in his medical practice. Four case histories illustrate these principles.",

Because of this, they are brought to the clinician many years after the onset of their symptoms, only when their delusional behavior becomes overt.

Clinical/neurological examination does not confirm any organic basis for the symptoms. Conversion disorders are more frequent in girls than in boys. They are rarely seen below the age of seven. A correspondence is often found between the personality of the child, (a conscientious attitude) and family relations. The families seem quite normal, but often have high expectations of their children, are sensitive to social stigmatization and have an underlying anxiety for health problems. A model is often found for the child's symptoms. Symptoms may be precipitated by an infection or a physical trauma. Sexual abuse is sometimes discovered. Multiprofessional assessment and treatment by a neuropediatrician, physiotherapist, child psychiatrist/psychologist and educational therapist may reduce \"doctor shopping\" and contribute to a favourable outcome.",

By reviewing various epidemiological studies, relationships among some chronic diseases and depression have been noted. The depression-disease order of appearance can de bi-directional. It seems that stress, depression and inflammation have the capacity to affect the balance of cykotines produced by the immunological system. Modulation of the immunological system by the central nervous system is controIled/mediada by a complex bi-directional network composed of signals among the central nervous system, the endocrine system and the immunological system. The most frequent diseases related to depression are chronic but some are acute: of the central nervous system, endocrines, infections. Chronic pain also seems related to this problem. Pain, fatigue or tiredness are considered symptoms of a hidden depression and others, physical as well as psychiatric, could be algias, parestesias, headaches, vertigo, or gastrointestinal, cardio-respiratory neurodegenerative disorders.",

Not infrequently such patients are totally incapacitated, a burden to their families, addicted to drugs, at times mentally unbalanced, unpredictable and always self concerned. In the majority of instances, if not in all, there is originally a discernible anatomic or physiologic reason for the pain experienced. In certain instances, however, a fixed pain pattern is set up prior to the removal of the existing cause. This pain pattern may be interrupted",

When episodes of depersonalization are recurrent or persistent and lead to distress or dysfunction, the diagnosis of depersonalization disorder is made. Certain similarities in phenomenology, comorbidity, neurochemistry, and treatment response suggest a relationship to the obsessive-compulsive spectrum. However, depersonalization is a very poorly studied condition, and any conclusions must be viewed tentatively. Self-injurious behaviors are defined as intentionally self-inflicted bodily injuries without lethal intent. Basic categories are briefly described. Subsequently, the phenomenology and biology of both impulsive and compulsive self-injurious behaviors, and their relationship to the obsessive-compulsive spectrum, are discussed.",

It includes delusional beliefs about bodily sensations or functions; such as feeling malodorous, being infected by parasites, having dysmorphic features, or that a certain organ is no longer functioning. MHP has been divided into 4 main categories: Delusions of infestation (including parasitosis); delusions of dysmorphophobia, such as of misshapenness, personal ugliness, or exaggerated size of body parts (this seems closest to that of body dysmorphic disorder); delusions of foul body odours or halitosis or delusional bromosis (also known as olfactory reference syndrome); and a miscellaneous group.",

Most affected persons respond with at least some distressing symptoms of trauma-related memory intrusions, autonomic hyperarousal, dissociation, and depression in the acute aftermath. Fortunately, the majority of traumatized individuals succeed in coping with this major stress quite well during the following weeks and months unless the process of recovery is hampered by additional adverse psychosocial circumstances, psychological disposition or biological vulnerability. In a subgroup of persons a transition to acute and posttraumatic stress disorder or other major psychiatric disorders, e.g. depressive, anxiety, substance-related disorders may be observed. Posttraumatic stress disorders very often run a chronic course of illness enduring for many years or even life-long. The typical course of illness in PTSD is characterized not only by major psychiatric comorbidities contributing to a dramatically reduced health-related quality of life, to many deficits of psychosocial adaptation and a heightened suicide risk. It is also associated with a lot of major somatic health problems both in acute and long-term stages. The main focus here is on this special dimension of physical comorbidities in posttraumatic disorders. Empirical evidence underscores that trauma exposure, and in particular PTSD is significantly associated with major physical health problems in addition to well-known PTSD-related psychological, behavioural, and psychosocial impairments. Both self-report-based and objective assessments emphasized significantly increased rates of somatoform/functional syndromes and physical comorbidities, premature all-cause and specific mortality rates, heightened medical utilization behaviours, major socioeconomic costs, and reduced health-related quality of life in the aftermath of trauma exposure and posttraumatic stress disorders, thus defining a major challenge to any medical care system. Complex psycho-behavioural-somatic and somato-psycho-behavioural models are needed to better understand both acute and long-term effects of a perpetuating stress system on physical health.",

      "abstract": "Jeongji(情志) in Chinese medicine refers to a series of psychological activity which is expressed as hui(喜), no(怒), wu(優), sa(思), bi(悲), gong(恐), gyeong(驚), together with emotion, sentiment, and cognition, which are manifested as responses of the human body to environmental changes both inside and outside. Sa(思) is a major cognitive activity, and the other six emotions are main emotional activities. The emphasis on the interrelationship between cognition, sentiment, and emotional activity is a unique characteristic of the Jeongji(情志) concept in China. Jeongji[Mental] disorder refers to a series of diseases that has a close link between the attack, clinical presentation and emotional stimulation. The attack is deeply affected by emotional stimulation, with which physical symptoms are either present or absent. However, emotional changes are clear most of the time, their effect on disease development noticeable as well. To sum up, Jeongji[Mental] disorder is related to a wide range of medical problems in fields such as internal, surgical, gynecology, pediatrics, and various psychiatric disorders, not to mention contemporary psychological disorders, neurosis, and all kinds of mental illnesses of today. Moreover, the mental and physical disorders of today all share a common pathogenesis, clinical manifestation and treatment discipline. All the more reason for deeper professional research.",

The False Memory Syndrome Foundation (FMSF) first coined the term in the 1990s in reaction to an abundance of cases during the previous two decades in which patients claimed to be victims of childhood sexual abuse (CSA) or satanic ritual. These recovered memory cases led to criminal prosecutions of alleged abusers, lawsuits against therapists by former clients and parents, and even legislative reform. The 2008 website of the FMSF supplies the following definition for the syndrome. [A] condition in which a person's identity and interpersonal relationships are centered around a memory of traumatic experience which is objectively false but in which the person strongly believes … [T]he syndrome may be diagnosed when the memory is so deeply ingrained that it orients the individual's entire personality and lifestyle, in turn disrupting all sorts of other adaptive behavior.",

      "title": "Sensing metabolomics landscape unfold molecular connectivity between mental illness and drug abuse",
      "abstract": "Environmental threats to mental equity have recently gained much attention in the sphere of public and curative health due to their toll on the individual, families, the public, and their economic sphere. Mental health or soundness of mind is important at every stage of life from childhood and adolescence through adulthood to protect the brain from environmental stress. What makes mental health unlike genetic rare disorders is that there is no known single cause for this rising public health issue because it arises from multiple factors. These factors include early adverse life experiences, such as trauma or a history of abuse either because of child abuse, sexual assault or seeing any form of violence, experiences related to other ongoing (chronic) medical conditions, such as cancer or diabetes, biological factors or chemical exposure resulting in hormonal imbalances in the brain, and to a large extent having feelings of loneliness or isolation leading to suicidal action. Furthermore, the increase in mental health and its accompanying conditions depend on environmental with or without behavioral changes due to genetic stability may be associated with drug, alcohol, or substance abuse which is associated with the brain reward circuit which may need to compromise the neural circuit over a wide range of stressors on the human body interacting with the sequential neuronal cell cascade. Although humoral networking is associated with socio-behavioral change, work through family, religious, organizational engagement, and community support play major roles in its solution and management, it is consensually accepted that defining key determinants underlying molecular network altering by epigenetic and genetic factors have promise in empowering future systematic health and personal care including surveillance, prevention, treatment, and monitoring process. In the modern global and urbanization era, emerging new biomedical technological advances such as epigenetic tools, genomics editing, human genomics study utilizing sequencing technology, and reverse genetic resources from worm to animal models have enabled us to take a closer look at mechanisms that could be involved in mental illness and drug abuse or addiction using a pattern of metabolomics and its connectivity reflecting the interplay between mental illness and drug abuse and/or addiction. This paper describes a molecular-driven surveillance platform as a part of the power of prevention to care of populational health which could be beneficial by predicting risk and unfolding the impact of daily lifestyle on human behavior such as food intake, alcohol intoxication, and its outcome likely the effect of metabolism on mental illness and drug abuse. Interaction between environmental cues to neural circuits which may interplay with metabolic networks as well as potential risk resulting in various forms of phenotypic complications and behavioral alteration might be detectable using multi-omics platforms.",

Dabei handelt es sich um eine Restklasse der Restklasse, der auch andere, wenig mit ihr gemein habende Störungen, wie z.B. die Pyromanie, die Kleptomanie und die Trichotillomanie zugerechnet werden. Psychopathologische Analysen sowie klinische Erfahrungen zeigen, dass es sich beim pathologischen Spielen um eine weit über eine Impulskontrollstörung hinausreichende Erkrankung handelt; viele der an ihr leidenden Menschen weisen alle Zeichen einer Abhängigkeitsstörung auf. Es wird daher vorgeschlagen das pathologische Spielen und Wetten in den ICD–11 den Abhängigkeitserkrankungen zuzuordnen und nach folgenden Kriterien zu diagnostizieren: 1. Ein starker Wunsch oder eine Art Zwang zu spielen bzw. zu wetten. 2. Verminderte Kontrollfähigkeit bezüglich des Beginns, der Beendigung und der Dauer des Spielens bzw. Wettens. 3. Auftreten eines Entzugssyndroms bei Beendigung oder Reduktion des Spielens bzw. Wettens, nachgewiesen durch suchtspezifische Entzugssymptome oder durch die Aufnahme der gleichen oder einer nahe verwandten Tätigkeit, um Entzugssymptome zu mildern oder zu vermeiden. 4. Nachweis einer Toleranz. um die ursprünglich durch niedrige Dosen erreichten Wirkungen des Spielens bzw. Wettens hervorzurufen, sind zunehmend höhere Dosen erforderlich (ein Beispiel hierfür sind die steigenden „Tagesdosen“ von Spielern, die bei Konsumenten ohne Toleranzentwicklung schon zu einem Aufhören wegen schwerer Beeinträchtigungen, wie z.B. psycho-soziale, finanzielle oder Beziehungsprobleme, führen würden). 5.

It is widely interpreted as the emotional and biologic responses to novel or threatening situations. In humans, however, the term \"distress\" seems to be preferable, more clearly defining the fact that is the response that is being referred to, rather than the stimulus. Distress has been postulated to be capable of precipitating an overt illness, as when it occurs coincidentally with an incipient infection or neoplasm. Moreover, it is able to provoke several disorders and symptoms in many tissues and organs, including the skin. In this paper the authors focus on the main characteristics of stress and emphasize the relevance of psychosomatic medicine that proposes the simultaneous examination of psyche and soma. Special consideration is given to a peculiar form of skin disease, psychogenic purpura, together with the stigmata of mystics that, in large part, seem to be conditioned or provoked (or provocable) by emotional stress or by psychic influences on cutaneous fibrinolytic activity.",

      "abstract": "Pain is an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with acute and possible damage. It has a protective role because it protects the body from damage and helps to maintain organ function, the organism as a whole. Pain is one of the world's health problems, the most common causes of pain are injury, surgery, malignancy, and hormonal disorders. Delineation of pain is to: physical, mental and physical psychogenic caused. Physical pain is a symptom for which patients most often asked for medical help, the pain is a warning mechanism to inform that there is a tissue injury or dysfunction of individual organs. Mental pain and suffering often called. It is a state of deep sadness often associated with fear, anxiety and other negative emotions that occur after someone, for the individual, irreparable and significant loss. The relationship between pain and injury is not simple, that is possible: injury without pain, without injury, pain disproportionate to the severity of injury, pain after healing of injuries. Injuries without pain - some people are born without sensitivity to pain. This very rare genetic disorder is known as analgesia. Pain without injury - common in so-called. psychogenic pain where the pain occurs after mental tension and where there are no organic damage. Pain disproportionate the difficulty of injury- may occur in insignificant physical processes that do not have great physical significance for the total health of the individual, and cause very severe pain. The pain after healing injury - very common after injuring nerves and known examples of such pain are phantom pain and causalgia. Causalgia is very severe pain, burning type that occurs because of injury of damage causing their peripheral sensory nerves. Phantom pain is common in people who are missing the lower part of the body (leg, hand, and breast). Patients feel pain in a body part that they amputated therefore no longer exists, and so clearly perceived the pain that they feel that the body is still there. In addition to causing health, physical and mental difficulties, pain significantly affects the economic situation of the individual and society at large, so big attention should be paid to its prevention and cure. The doctor's obligation is to disclose the cause of pain and mitigate / eliminate pain. Access to treatment of chronic pain, sometimes acute, is multidisciplinary and should be administered pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments (physical therapy, TENS, ultrasound, laser, exercise, heat and cold), and sometimes pain treatment methods (acupuncture, chiropractic and other) . While there has been great progress in the treatment of chronic pain, many patients are still suffering because of poor pain assessment and treatment.",

Other monosymptomatic disorders are often referred to as essential tremor variants. Recent findings There is now solid evidence that essential tremor, however defined, is a syndrome with multiple causes. Summary A new tremor classification scheme is being developed by the International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society Task Force on Tremor. In this scheme, tremor in the absence of other neurological signs is called isolated tremor, and tremor in combination with other signs is called combined tremor. Many isolated and combined tremor syndromes can be defined on the basis of commonly recurring or unique clinical symptoms and signs, including historical features (age at onset, family history, and temporal evolution) and tremor characteristics (body distribution, activation condition, associated features). Essential tremor, however defined, is simply a syndrome and not a specific disease. Essential tremor should be defined and used consistently, or this term should be abandoned. As essential tremor is an arbitrarily defined syndrome, it makes no sense to refer to other tremors as variants of essential tremor or essential tremor syndromes.",

      "abstract": "Introducción El sueño es un estado natural y fisiológico rítmico, aparece por la melatonina activada por la oscuridad, esto disminuye la conciencia, inmovilidad, relajación muscular. También está enlazado a la salud integral, un desorden en su patrón o calidad conduce al cambio en el estado de ánimo; el insomnio es el más prevalente y se define como “dificultad persistente en el inicio del sueño que ocurre a pesar de adecuadas oportunidades para el mismo” De la misma forma, los problemas de menoscabo de sueño se han relacionado con trastornos de ansiedad y depresión en la población, es por ello como destaca “la depresión es un trastorno mental que se caracteriza por tristeza, perdida de interés o placer acompañados de sentimientos de culpa o autoestima baja, alteraciones del sueño o del apetito, fatiga y falta de concentración”. De la misma manera define la ansiedad como “la anticipación temerosa de peligro inminente acompañada de un sentimiento intenso en cualquier región geográfica corporal, implicando un presentimiento de que algo grave le va a pasar”. Los problemas de deterioro de sueño se han relacionado con trastornos de ansiedad y depresión, es por ello como destaca “la depresión es un trastorno mental que se caracteriza por tristeza, culpabilidad, autoestima baja, alteraciones del sueño o del apetito, fatiga y falta de concentración”. Conforme NANDA Esta investigación tiene como objetivo analizar el deterioro del patrón del sueño en los estudiantes de enfermería de la facultad Ciencias de la Salud de la Universidad Técnica de Ambato. Objetivos Determinar el deterioro del patrón del sueño en os estudiantes de enfermería según NANDA Método La presente investigación es de carácter cuantitativo, no experimental, descriptivo y transversal. Utiliza la recolección de datos con la aplicación de la encuesta del Índice de Calidad de Sueño de Pittsburg sobre la calidad de sueño en su versión en español contando con un alfa de Cronbach del 0.84 garantizando su fiabilidad, es así que la encuesta cuenta con 19 preguntas autoevaluadas y 5 preguntas evaluadas por el acompañante de habitación del paciente si está disponible, en donde los componentes son: calidad subjetiva del sueño, latencia del sueño, duración del sueño, eficiencia del sueño, alteraciones del sueño, uso de medicamentos para dormir y disfunción diurna. La puntuación de cada componente es de 0 al 3, donde 0 es muy bueno y 3 muy malo, solo las preguntas auto aplicadas están incluidas en este puntaje aplicándose en 78 estudiantes de enfermería y su posterior análisis en Excel e IBM SPSS 25. Principales resultados Al enfocarnos en los siete componentes del índice de calidad de sueño de Pittsburg: 1. Calidad subjetiva del sueño: 42,3% de los sujetos de estudio tienen una mala calidad subjetiva del sueño. 2. Latencia de sueño: 41% presentó sensación de dificultad para dormir por lo menos una vez a la semana. 3. Duración del dormir: 6 a 7 horas en un 33,3% es la duración promedio del sueño de la mayoría de los sujetos de estudio es 4. Eficiencia de sueño: 59% de los estudiantes de enfermería tienen una eficiencia del sueño mayor al 85%. 5. Perturbaciones del sueño: 61,5% tiene perturbaciones en el sueño por lo menos una vez a la semana. 6. Uso de medicamentos para dormir: 82,1% de los refieren que no ha tomado medicina para dormir en ninguna ocasión en el último mes. 7. Disfunción diurna: 44,9% de los sujetos de estudio ha tenido disfunción diurna del sueño por lo menos una vez a la semana mientras. Conclusiones En la presente investigación se concluye que los estudiantes de enfermería del ciclo académico octubre 2022 – marzo 2023 de la Universidad Técnica de Ambato presentan deterioro en el patrón del sueño con pocas horas de descanso, interrupción entre el mismo y acompañado de somnolencia; trayendo como consecuencias un leve problema en su energía para realizar actividades cotidianas. A su vez los participantes tienen una dificultad para dormir, problemática que podría acogerse a la automedicación, dado que en el presente estudio si se obtuvo resultados de toma de medicación para dormir y más en personas divorciadas y del género masculino, pudiendo así causar fármaco dependencia en un futuro o el inicio de automedicación de los estudiantes de enfermería.",

A mes a mes i com a consequencia de l'anterior tambe prediu un augment de l'us dels recursos sociosanitaris. No hi ha un consens en la definicio e fragilitat i per tant tampoc en els instruments a utilitzar pel seu diagnostic. Alguns autors nomes inclouen elements fisics pel seu diagnostic, mentre que d'altres hi afegeixen aspectes cognitius, emocionals o socials. Malgrat aquesta diversitat una de les definicions operatives de fragilitat mes acceptats i utilitzats es el proposat per L. Fried que inclou cinc criteris: perdua inexplicable de pes, debilitat muscular, cansament/ poca resistencia, lentitud en la marxa i baix nivell d'activitat fisica. Tenir tres o mes dels 5 criteris es indicatiu de la fragilitat, alhora que 2 corresponen a un estat pre-fragil. La prevencio de la discapacitat es un gran repte al que s'enfronta la nostra societat que envelleix. Calen intervencions eficaces en poblacions d'alt risc com les persones grans fragils pero la identificacio, avaluacio i intervencio sobre aquesta poblacio encara no esta consensuada ni sistematitzada. En els ultims anys, l'activitat fisica i la malnutricio han estat identificats com a causes potencialment reversibles de la fragilitat. De fet l'activitat fisica ha demostrat ser eficac per millorar els diferents components de la sindrome de fragilitat com la sarcopenia, el deteriorament funcional, la inactivitat fisica, el rendiment cognitiu i la depressio. La combinacio amb una alta ingesta proteica podria millorar-ne els resultats. La identificacio d'una poblacio mes exposada a patir resultats adversos de salut com ara les persones grans fragils, podria ser important per poder establir estrategies de prevencio de la discapacitat durant l'envelliment.",

      "abstract": "Background- Psychosomatic concept (Manodaihika Siddhanta),Dharaniya Vega (urges to be suppressed or controlled) and Sattvavajay Chikitsa (psychotherapy) are concepts of Ayurveda which are the core of this study. Psychosomatic concept is an inter-relationship of Mind (Manas) and body (Sharira). The diseases evolving due to mind-body interaction are termed as psychosomatic diseases.[1] Vega means the natural urges of the body and mind. Dharaniya Vega are the suppressible or controllable urges which are not only confined to psychological attribute but also to verbal and physical attributes.[2] Some diseases or their subtypes in Ayurveda are nomenclatured based on suppressible urges like Shokaja Atisara (diarrhea due to grief), Bhayaja Atisara (diarrhea due to fear), Kamaj Jwara (fever due to passion),etc.[3,4] Sattvavajay Chikitsa given in Charak Samhita is a psychotherapy which literary means controlling the mind from unhealthy actions which has been developed as a counselling tool. Conclusion- The study will provide clinical evidence that will establish,the role of Dharaniya Vega in remedial or prevention of psychosomatic diseases and the role of Sattvavajay chikitsa in Dharaniya Vega",

      "abstract": "Soggetti portatori di disabilitŕ presentano spesso disturbi endocrini e metabolici, primitivi o secondari alla menomazione psico-fisica. La disabilitŕ č spesso provocata da malattie geneticamente determinate, da traumi cranici o midollari con conseguenti alterazioni neurologiche, o da patologie infettive cerebrali con esiti significativi. Si comprende quindi facilmente la possibile associazione fra la disabilitŕ e disordini della funzione ipotalamica e ipofisaria, con quadri di ipopituitarismo di varia entitŕ. Ne conseguono manifestazioni cliniche, spesso subdole e non facilmente diagnosticabili, almeno nella fase iniziale, che, se non vengono riconosciute tempestivamente, possono avere conseguenze serie. Ad esempio un deficit di ormone della crescita o dell'ormone tiroideo o una carenza di cortisolo, in etŕ infantile possono dar luogo a gravi conseguenze patologiche. Un'altra patologia associata alla disabilitŕ č l'obesitŕ, sia ipotalamica che conseguente alla scarsa attivitŕ fisica. L'obesitŕ facilita lo sviluppo di diabete mellito, peraltro associato talora a malattie geneticamente determinate. Pertanto in una struttura residenziale per disabili č necessaria la consulenza di uno specialista endocrinologo al fine di riconoscere tempestivamente, sulla base di esami clinici e di laboratorio, eventuali patologie endocrine e metaboliche. Questo consente di intraprendere subito una terapia sostitutiva. L'assistenza sanitaria specialistica comprende l'attuazione di schemi di terapia adeguati, la compliance alla terapia, l'attuazione di idonei percorsi diagnostici e di follow-up. Grandi difficoltŕ si incontrano inevitabilmente nell'attuare programmi di attivitŕ fisica e di dieta al fine di limitare l'aumento ponderale. Un corretto intervento in questo campo richiede la collaborazione fra lo specialista e la strut- tura residenziale che assiste il disabile e percorsi di facilitazione per queste attivitŕ anche attraverso convenzioni stipulate ad hoc. Č fondamentale, infine, l'ottimizzazione di un'assistenza multidisciplinare ben integrata.",

      "abstract": "Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a severe and complex disorder precipitated by exposure to a psychologically distressing event. PTSD first appeared in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Psychiatric Disorders (DSM-III) in 1980,1,,2 arising from studies of the Vietnam war, and of civilian victims of natural and man-made disasters.3,,4 However, the study of PTSD dates back more than 100 years. Before 1980, post-traumatic syndromes were recognized by different names, including railway spine, shell shock, traumatic (war) neurosis, concentration-camp syndrome, and rape-trauma syndrome.2,,3 The symptoms described in these syndromes overlap considerably with what we now recognize as PTSD. According to the most recent edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Psychiatric Disorders (DSM-IV-TR),5 the essential feature of PTSD is the development of characteristic symptoms following exposure to an extreme traumatic stressor characterized by: direct personal experience of an event that involves actual or threatened death or serious injury, or other threat to one's physical integrity; or witnessing an event that involves death, injury, or a threat to the physical integrity of another person; or learning about unexpected or violent death, serious harm, or threat of death or injury experienced by a family member or other close associate. The person reacts to this event with fear and helplessness, and tries to avoid being reminded of it. Traumatic events include military combat, violent personal assault, being kidnapped, being taken hostage, terrorist attack, torture, incarceration, natural or man-made disasters, automobile accidents, or being diagnosed with a life-threatening illness. The principal symptoms of PTSD are the painful re-experiencing of the event, a pattern of avoidance and emotional numbing, and fairly constant hyperarousal.\n\nPost-traumatic reactions fall on a continuum, and many clinicians and researchers believe it is useful to conceptualize partial symptoms as well.2, …",

      "abstract": "Introduction Symptom (from Greek symptoma “anything that has befallen one”) is an each new manifestation by which some disorder is expressed. For the physician, it is a guide to diagnosis itself, and for the patient it is a signal which warns of new conditions of the body and soul or of a disorder. Objectives Mental disorders are most commonly presented by a group of symptoms, among which the patients often can’t point out the leading one. Anxiety as a symptom can occur in a number of psychiatric entities and it can stimulate differential diagnostic dilemma in daily practice. We will show a 26-year female in which the internal anxiety is the main symptom. Aim To underlined the importance of taking in to account a leading symptom of the disease in the way of establishing the correct diagnosis. Methods The psychiatric and psychotherapeutic interviews were performed together with a clinical assessment of mental status and structured clinical interviews (SCID I and SCID II), EEG and psychological testing. Results/conclusion Internal discomfort is a subjective feeling, respectively a symptom which the patient in this case continuously underlined, and which guided us (along with a comprehensive analysis) to a clear diagnosis. Following the choosing of an effective psycho-pharmacological combination, and with the goal of reducing a leading symptom, according to enlarged diagnostic process, we decided to diagnose the Schizoaffective disorders (F 25.2).",

Accordingly, PTSD is an anxiety disorder that develops in some individuals after a traumatic event defined by the DSM–IV (APA, 1994) as (1) experiencing, witnessing, or being confronted with an event that involves actual or threatened death or injury, or a threat to their physical integrity or that of others, and (2) responding to the event with intense fear, helplessness, or horror.",

      "abstract": "<b>Abstract:</b> Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a syndromic label for people with informant-corroborated memory problems and evidence of memory impairment on formal testing in the absence of more pervasive deficits in cognition and functional abilities. It is often described as a “risk factor” for dementia though this is misleading; patients with the first signs of Alzheimer9s disease (AD) will meet the criteria for MCI and as their illness progresses they will move to more traditional criteria for dementia (eg, DSM). Importantly though, they have not changed or “converted” from one disease to another. The problem with MCI clinically, and hence the reason why all such patients are not simply diagnosed with very mild AD is that as one moves closer to normal performance (ie, not clearly demented), the risk of patients who do not have AD (eg, so-called “worried well”; depression; alternate degenerative or non-degenerative pathology) being captured by the MCI syndrome increases. Furthermore, although the concept of MCI seems straightforward, “absence of dementia” or “intact cognition in domains other than memory” or even “objective evidence of memory impairment” varies according to the methods used to define each criterion. Nevertheless, with longitudinal follow-up to confirm that initial MCI status was due to incipient AD, this syndrome offers a important window to examine the earliest symptomatic stages of the disease. Emerging evidence from such studies have highlighted that incipient (MCI-stage) AD is underpinned by degeneration of an interconnected neural circuit including mesial temporal lobe, diencephalon and posterior cingulate regions—all of which, interestingly, have been implicated in memory processing from focal lesion studies in humans.",

Obsolete, because we are discovering changes in the tissues or in biochemical and immunological functions of the body in people with mental disorders, and because psychological complaints are frequent in all physical illnesses.

If an individual can cope successfully with the environmental challenge, little or no stress is experienced, the challenge is viewed as only minimal stressful and no major health consequences seem to arise. If an individual cannot cope or needs a great deal of effort to cope, stress is experienced, the environmental event becomes stressful and major health consequences seem to arise.

Alterations or lesions of the moral faculties as a morbid degree of depression, grief, anxiety, fear, etc.; 2. Alteration or lesion of the psychical or intellectual faculties, as false per ceptions, false conceptions, illusions, delusions, etc.; and 3. Alterations in miiotility; but, so far as we have yet gone, only an excessive motion or restlessness has been illustrated. There are cases in which the pro minent feature is a lesion of motility, but which con sists in an indispositioni t-o move-in torpor of rmove ment. Cases of this kind are next to be detailed. Bearing in mnind that the lesion of the moral faculty appears to be, as it were, the starting point or ground work of the disease, it would appear that cases are to be met with in which the whole of the phenomena seem to be confined to this division of the mental faculties, while in other cases this groundwork is in volved with one, or chiefly with one, of the other sub divisions. On the one hand, we m-neet with cases in .which the motility is scarcely affected; or, on the other hand, we findl cases in which the psychical func tions appear but very partially implicated. It is a common cause of surprise to the friends of melan cholic patients that the melancholic talks or writes quite rationally or coherently; that he is quite cor rect in memory; or that he argues as acutely as ever. When, however, there is torpid condition of the mo tility, the patient, though he often retains his intel lectual powers nearly intact, bears the expression of the lowest degree of dementia; the features are dull and heavy. The Frenlch call this form mnelancolie avec stupeur. Tphe next case is of this kind, and the intellect proper -was only partially implicated. CASE ix. A. K., aged 34, married, wife of a butler, was formerly a lady's maid. She lived, previously to her marriage, eleven years in one place, anAd married the butler. This appears to have been an unfortunate match. The famnily miiade frequent inquiries about the patient. The husband has taken very little interest abouat her. He attributed her disease to stubborn ness; and recluested by letter that she imiight be treated with firmness anid well routed. The medli cal cerltificate accompaiving the order of admission gave tlae following description of the patient just prior to her reception:- She sits weeping and miserable; says she has broken her husband's heart; that shle is better without food. Her landlord and fellow-lodgers found her in a state of comiiplete ex hauistion fromii wvant of food. The clhildren also ap peared half-famiished. She declares she heard voices forbidd!inu her to eat or cdrink, or light fire, or go to becl. In this hearing of voices there was evidence of dis tinct intellectual or ply,ychical disturbance. It never, however, manifested itself afterwards. On aclmission (Oct. 21st, date of disease uncertain), she conversed quietly and correctly, though in a weak tone of voice. She said slhe had been living in London with her children in a lodging. She had no headache. The tongue was much furred. The bowels were con lined. She took beef-tea only for dinner. She had no thirst. Pulse 60, feeble. There was no cough, nor any morbid chest-signs. She was ordered full diet, one eog, and two glasses of wine daily. Oct. 24th. Sho was up; was pale, but had consi derable turgescence of the vessels of the conjunctiva. The tongue was red; bowels not open. An aloetic draught twice a day was ordered. It will be sufficient to describe the progress of the case by entries taken at the different epochs. During the first three months, she continued constantly de pressed; was always more or less indisposed to exert herself; would not dress herself. She declinecl in strength, but made no complaint. During my temu porary absence from home, her head was shaved and blistered without apparent benefit. The bowels con tinued obstinate; but she would seldom take an aperient; and she occasionally refused food. Jan. 8th (three months after admission). She varied from day to day. One day she refused all food, and said she did not require it; that she could do without it. Another day she ate ravenously. The bowels seldom acted. She refuised medicine. She emaciated visibly. Pulse 70, regular. There were no cough nor chest-symptoms. She was always listless and depressed. The expression of the features was dull and heavy. Jan. 13th. Her mind was in the same state; but she ate ravenously. She would gorge herself if not watched; she filched the meat from the other patients' plates. Jan. 0Oth. She again refused food. She sat moodily in one position for lolng periods. Her features were dull and expressionless. She allowed the nasal secre tion and saliva to dribble from her as she sat. Feb. 10th (fotur months after admission). Motility was still more involved. She sat for lonog periods in one posture, apparently indifferent to all around, aand too lazy to move. She was like a statue in immobility; but the attitude was expressive of hebetude. She hung her head; the features were relaxed, and did not change; her arms dangled by the side of the chair as she sat. The secretions were dropping from the mouth and nose, and the lacrymnal secretion had dried upon her cheek. The breathing was slightly acceler ated. Her bowels were confined. She was at the pre sent date eating largely. Three grains of podophyllin were ordered. Feb. 26th. She was moving down the gallery at a snail's pace. Her head was drooping, and her arnms hanging heavily by her side. Her dress was neglected. She had not menstruated since admiiission. Compounlld iron mixture was ordered. March 2nd. She would not take the medicine; was still more dull and heavy. She stood about in one positioni, obstructing the passage, and did not moive to allow olne to pass. She appeared motionless and statue-like. Her arm-s and head drooped. The saliva and nasal secretion dribbled from her. She dropped her fIeces about, and wet herself as she stood. She never attempted to dress or wash herself. The pulse was 60; te circulation appeared torpid; the nose and lips were purplish; the hands cold anid puffy. At times she would eat, and at times refuLsed food for days together; she had, however, gained flesh. March 9th. She asked voluntarily for some paper, and sat down and wrote a letter to her sister, request ingf her to send her some needlework. The letter was correctly worded and spelt; bnt rather less neatly written towards the close; and it was without signa ture. Great improvement in the appearance of the pa tient took place from this date, and increased. The work was sent, and she took to it at once. 163rd day (or five months). Her expression was greatly improved. She was now quite animated. The 33",

La fréquence sous-estimée de pathologies somatiques et leur retard de prise en charge entraînent souvent des douleurs dont la seule expression peut être un trouble majeur du comportement ou un retrait inquiétant. Dans les cas de personnes n’ayant pas le langage, ou un langage fonctionnel limité (de type écholalique par exemple), ayant aussi des particularités sensorielles, il est utile d’avoir recours à des outils d’hétéro-évaluation de la douleur [1].

      "abstract": "A 37 year old woman presented to her general practitioner with a two month history of low mood, poor sleep, and irritability. She was initially treated for depression with sertraline. Her mood improved slightly over six weeks, but, because of continued insomnia and irritability, her medication was changed to citalopram, with no further improvement. Through regular review and the building of a trusting relationship with her doctor, the patient felt able to disclose that she was experiencing intrusive images of past domestic violence. She was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder and referred for trauma-focused cognitive behavioural therapy; over 15 sessions, this led to a substantial reduction in her symptoms. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a severe, prolonged, and impairing psychological reaction to a distressing event. The precipitating incident must be “exceptionally threatening or catastrophic”1 and can range from interpersonal violence and combat to accidents and natural disasters; sexual violence is a particularly potent cause.2 Serious illnesses or medical interventions can also precipitate PTSD if the individual perceived their own or someone else’s health or life to be under threat. The individual repeatedly relives the event through intrusive imagery, bodily re-experiencing, nightmares, and flashbacks. Irritability, insomnia, and other symptoms related to increased arousal also occur. Sufferers usually have difficulty remembering aspects of the event and avoid reminders of it (see box of diagnostic criteria). Children may act out the traumatic event through repetitive play, drawings, and stories, and have frightening dreams without recognisable content.3 Adolescents with PTSD can show aggressive or withdrawn behaviour and can find it difficult to relate to their peers. #### Diagnostic criteria for post-traumatic stress disorder (ICD-10 (international classification of diseases, 10th revision) classification of mental and behavioural disorders1)",

      "abstract": "Abstract Many neurologic symptoms may appear without organic lesions of the nervous system. Based on the underlying mechanisms, psychogenic (or functional) neurologic diseases are classified into three categories: conversion disorders, factitious disorders, and malingering. Abnormalities in patients with conversion disorders are involuntary, whereas patients with the other two conditions are voluntary. Malingering, in particular, might be purposeful for personal benefits such as financial reasons and escape from jail. Common phenotypes of psychogenic neurologic diseases are motor paralysis, sensory loss, constriction of visual field, and seizures (psychogenic non-epileptic seizures, PNES). Clinical features common to all kinds of psychogenic neurologic disorders include incongruity with ordinary neurologic symptoms, inconsistency (variability) of nature, degree and distribution in time, change due to distraction to other stimuli or other matters, and the presence of psychogenic factors in the social or family background.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Psychological factors are widely held to be important for the orderly function of the gastrointestinal tract as well as for the development and course of disorders affecting the gut. Evidence supporting these assumptions is scarce, although it has become clear that intestinal functions are influenced by the state of central nervous activation, i.e. by satiation, relaxation and sleep as well as hunger, tension and rage. Freud assumed that the accumulation of an unabreacted quota of affect induced defence or repression and a conversion of emotion into bodily symptoms. Subsequently, disorders such as globus sensation, diffuse oesophageal spasm and ‘cardiospasm’ were viewed as conversion symptoms. Other concepts claimed an aetiological role of specific conflicts, certain affective states and ‘inappropriate perpetuations of organ reactions adaptive to, or protective against, some stress in human life’. However, these and other psychosomatic concepts could not be verified. Conversely, an illness exacerbation may precipitate a disruption in a patient's adjustment to his/her environment and interfere with his/her ability to fight the disease. Psychotherapeutic interventions may help patients to cope with their illness and its consequences and possibly alter the course of disease. Psychosocial factors may determine a patient's reactions to, and handling of, a disease and thus should not escape the physician's attention.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The first part of this two-part series discusses psychological influences in delayed and failed recovery and resulting unnecessary work disability; the second part discusses theoretical and practical aspects of the issue, including evaluation and treatment. Delayed and failed recovery and unnecessary disability (DFRUD) refers to a lag in, or lack of, expected recovery from a medical condition and/or unnecessary resultant disability. Causation is complex, and we are not doing well at managing this group of workers using a biomedical model. The traditional biomedical model posits that disease or injury produces symptoms and signs that cause impairment and result in disability. This approach too strictly separates mental phenomena and bodily function (Cartesian dualism) and leads to scientific reductionism when actually six domains are active in worker disability: medical, personal, psychological, sociocultural, systematic (including compensation and insurance), and workplace elements. Medically unexplained physical symptoms (MUPS) should be understood as a disturbance of normal neurological and/or psychological processes underlying symptom production, perception, and experience and cannot be better explained by another physical or psychiatric illness. Within this system of evaluation, administrative and medical iatrogenicity are associated with unnecessary medical care and poor outcomes for individuals. In addition to determining industrial causality and apportionment, if evaluators accept some psychological factors, MUPS, and central sensitization, they must explain to what extent these are compensable. Part two of this article will discuss theoretical and practical approaches, including specific evaluation and treatment methods.",

These symptoms may or may not be explained by a medical condition. The two major changes to the DSM-IV criteria included eliminating the requirement that somatic symptoms be organically unexplained and adding the requirement that certain psychobehavioral features have to be present to justify the diagnosis. The new criteria also eliminated somatization disorder, undifferentiated somatoform disorder, hypochondriasis, and pain disorder from the previous definitions.

      "abstract": "Abstract Schizoaffective disorder was first described in the literature by Kasanin in 1933, referring to a group of patients in whom both psychotic (“schizo”) and mood (“affective”) symptoms are prominent features. A formal diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder requires that (1) a mood episode (major depressive, manic, or mixed) co‐occurs with active schizophrenia symptoms; (2) hallucinations or delusions have occurred for at least 2 weeks in the absence of prominent mood symptoms; (3) the mood symptoms are present for a substantial portion of the total active and residual phases of schizophrenia; and (4) the symptoms are not related to the direct physiological effects of a substance or a general medical condition. Schizoaffective disorder can be further broken down into two subtypes: depressive type (if the mood component consists of only major depressive episodes) and bipolar type (if a manic or mixed episode is part of the mood component). Because loss of interest or pleasure also resembles another common symptom of schizophrenia (i.e., anhedonia), the other essential feature of a major depressive episode, pervasive depressive mood, must be present in the depressive type of schizoaffective disorder.",

      "abstract": "The term „burnout” does not denote a psychiatric category, but a psychological label for the experience of a long-lasting exhaustion and loss of interest. Burnout is not an explicitly recognized disorder in prominent classifications of diseases. It is rather a state of emotional exhaustion and reduced sense of personal accomplishment than a syndrome or a disease. It can be assessed, e.g., by The Maslach Burnout Inventory which uses a three dimensional description of exhaustion, cynicism, and inefficacy. Some authors argue for an “exhaustion only” model that sees exhaustion as the hallmark of „burnout“. Engagement, which is characterized by energy and efficacy, may be regarded as the opposite to burnout, which is characterized by exhaustion, cynicism and inefficacy. On the other hand, this condition is described in the ICD-10 as “Problems related to lifemanagement difficulty” (Z73, i.e., not among mental disorders but among Factors influencing health status and contact with health services, Z00-99). As this condition is also described in DSM-IV as “adjustment disorder”, the concept of „burnout” seems to be redundant and useful only out of medicine as a journalistic label for a reaction which can be classified otherwise.",

      "abstract": "Psychiatry is a speciality of medicine concerned with the diagnosis, treatment and study of mental diseases or disorders. Its practitioners are psychiatrists (in the United States, physicians who complete four years of approved training following their 148graduation from medical school). A number of professionals from other disciplines treat patients with psychiatric disorders. The most important of these are clinical psychologists, psychiatric social workers and psychiatric nurses. They commonly refer to those who seek help as 'clients' rather than 'patients'. These professionals may work in various collaborative relationships with psychiatrists or as independent practitioners. They employ the same verbal therapies as psychiatrists. Psychiatry differs from these specialities in being a medical discipline whose practitioners are physicians. As such, psychiatrists are specifically trained to (1) make precise syndromal or aetiological diagnoses, whenever possible, and distinguish one syndrome from another; (2) diagnose (or know when to refer to other physicians) those organic conditions which mimic psychiatric disorders such as brain tumour, cancer of the pancreas, and hyperthyroidism (these conditions can present as anxiety or depressive disorders); (3) treat particular psychiatric disorders with psychotropic medications or other somatic treatments; (4) manage untoward psychological reactions to medical illness; and (5) integrate the biological with the psychological and social dimensions of mental disorders. In addition, the psychiatrist's training in medicine may encourage a research career in the biology of mental disorders. American psychiatrists as a whole have a high level of expertise in psychological treatments, particularly the psychodynamic approach. This is due to the impact of psychoanalytic theory on academic psychiatry especially since 1945, when many distinguished psychoanalysts assumed the chairs of academic departments.",

      "title": "States of consciousness: new insights and further questions",
      "abstract": "In the immediate aftermath of a severe brain injury survivors are usually in coma, which is characterised as a state of unresponsiveness without any understanding or purposeful functions, although reflex responses can still be elicited. If the injury is severe enough but not fatal, the coma can persist for days or weeks, but it is nonetheless recognised to be a transient condition which evolves into other defined conscious states. Consciousness may be regained, but if not signs of a persistent vegetative state (also called unresponsive wakefulness syndrome) or a minimally conscious state develop. Both the latter are characterised by spontaneous or induced eye opening and sleep wake cycles, with additional responses such as apparent crying, laughing, or smiling. In the minimally conscious state there are also reproducible if inconsistent visual, verbal, or gestural responses to particular stimuli. In both these states, signs depend on relatively intact brain stem function, contrasting with the locked-in syndrome, a condition in which brain stem dysfunction prevents a conscious person from demonstrating their awareness.1, 2 Recognition of the two states of reduced consciousness has informed treatment and management decisions. Families and others who can see obvious signs of improvement, in that a person is no longer completely unresponsive or comatose, often expect further recovery. Standard advice is that in adults and children the potential for recovery from the persistent vegetative state, and the time to allow, depends on the cause: significant improvement can still occur up to 12 months after traumatic injury, but only up to 3 months after a non-traumatic injury, such as near-drowning. The potential for recovery from a minimally responsive state may be better, but it is not clear by how much, or if the time scales differ. One group reported that in the first 3 months there is a good chance of reasonable recovery but this falls sharply with longer durations, especially after non-traumatic injuries. In the latter groups survivors may continue to improve in terms of responsiveness but most remain severely disabled.1, 3, 4 However, problems remain. Detailed definitions of the clinical features of the two states differ.3 Distinguishing the two states is clinically difficult, although specific scales increase diagnostic precision.2 It seems logical to expect that in some patients with additional brain stem damage a state of reduced consciousness might co-exist with a degree of locked-in syndrome. In addition, from personal experience some patients do not show spontaneous eye opening or sleep-wake cycles despite other responses suggestive of a minimally conscious state. Such cases are not defined or studied in the medical literature. Finally over the last few years functional neuroimaging studies, mostly in adults, have shown that some patients have much more cortical responsiveness than clinically suspected, meaning that some thought to be in a persistent vegetative state may be at least minimally conscious.5 In one study 13 out of 41 patients classified by a standard scale as being in the vegetative state showed activity compatible with a minimally conscious state on neuroimaging between 3 weeks and 8 years after the injury. Twelve months later some clinical improvement in consciousness had occurred in most, usually to a minimally conscious state. One, assessed approximately 5 weeks after a traumatic injury, had recovered fully but the other survivors were still severely disabled.5 Ideally perhaps patients should now all be assessed by functional neuroimaging, but that may be impractical. The predictive value of more accessible modalities such as EEG and transcranial magnetic stimulation are still being explored. For all these, it would be clinically helpful if outcome studies followed a standard format to report the state and how it was assessed at fixed times after the injury, such as 3 months and 6 months, and the prognosis at 12 months or thereafter, subdivided into traumatic and non-traumatic groups. In the meantime all patients in such states should be assumed to have some awareness some of the time, which means for example that there must be adequate analgesia for painful conditions or procedures, and that further discussion is needed on the relationship between responsiveness and awareness. In children these difficulties are even more marked. There is limited data on both the accuracy of clinical diagnosis and outcome, especially in the very young age groups.1 Clinical scales have not been validated in children. Some studies of functional imaging have included children or young people but do not always report their data separately. Patient and medical groups should lobby for standardized outcome studies in children, which should be large enough to provide useful data for smaller subgroups.",

      "abstract": "Chronic pain is a sensory experience that produces suffering and functional impairment and is the result of both sensory input as well as secondary adaptation of the nervous system. The sensitization of the nervous system to pain is influenced by physical activity (or inactivity) and medication exposure. Medication taking and physical activity are behaviors that are increased or decreased by positive and negative reinforcement. Patients often have comorbid psychiatric conditions at presentation, including addictions, mood disorders, personality vulnerabilities and life circumstances that amplify their disability and impede their recovery. Behavioral conditioning contributes to chronic pain disorders in the form of both classical (Pavlov) and operant (Skinner) conditioning that increases the experience of pain, the liability to ongoing injury, the central amplification of pain, the use of reinforcing medications such as opiates and benzodiazepines, and behaviors associated with disability. The term 'abnormal illness behavior' has been used to describe behaviors that are associated with illness but are not explained physiologically. Behavioral conditioning often amplifies these abnormal behaviors in patients with chronic pain. Addiction can also be seen as a behavior that is reinforced and conditioned. The same factors that amplify abnormal illness behaviors also increase the liability to addiction. Psychiatric comorbidities also complicate and amplify abnormal illness behaviors and addictive behaviors and further contribute to the disability of chronic pain patients. Model interventions that reinforce healthy behaviors and extinguish illness behaviors are effective in patients with addictions and chronic pain. Maladaptive behaviors including addictive behaviors can be used as targets for classical and operant conditioning techniques, and these techniques are demonstrably effective in patients with chronic pain and addictions.",

      "abstract": "The introduction of potent physical and pharmacological therapies for psychotic conditions has increased the need for accurate diagnosis, not only in terms of assigning a patient to the diagnostic category but of assessing the various trends which may result in a very mixed symptomatology. Therapy, be it physical, pharmacological, or psychotherapeutic directed against one or the other of these components may frequently intensify other symptomatology. A suitable combination of anti-depressant and anti-psychotic drugs plus the use of E.C.T. when indicated is necessary in the management of such cases. In the author's judgment this mixed symptomatology frequently results from the influence of personality trends and conflicts and particularly in these mixed states psychotherapeutic aid must also be included. In the words of Jules Masserman: “Even frankly psychotic behaviour patterns, whether depressive or schizoid, are not as sometimes inferred-merely shapeless fragments from a personality shattered by some hypothetical ‘mental disease’. On the contrary, the psychosis itself is an integrated syndrome which however socially deviant is adaptively operated at all levels from the physiologic to the most abstrusely symbolic.” (3)",

These disorders can also produce a variety of physical (or “neurovegetative”) symptoms that include changes in appetite, sleep, sexual function, and energy level, among others. Some people develop symptoms suggestive of other medical or neurological disorders, such as heart palpitations, shortness of breath, pain, and memory disturbances.

Behavioral, psychological, environmental, physiologic, metabolic, and genetic explanations are just some of the possibilities identified as contributing to or causing obesity; yet, each explanation encounters controversy and no one explanation has gained unanimous consensus. Ideally, once a patient has had weight loss surgery (WLS), he or she loses excess weight in a controlled, healthy manner and complies with all the components of the recommended bariatric treatment program; sometimes, however, patients \"modify\" their post-surgical instructions. The ability to identify program modifications may be initially camouflaged if patients continue to lose weight and their laboratory values and other medical tests indicate that their weight loss status is smoothly progressing. On the surface it may seem that all is well, but appearances may be deceiving. A dysfunctional relationship with food and other substances of abuse, such as alcohol, may be lurking underneath the surface of what passes as treatment success, and this condition, left untreated, may persist or evolve to a cross-addiction, also known as an addiction transfer or a substitute addiction. A cross-addiction occurs when an individual exchanges one compulsive behavior for another compulsive behavior, such as when a weight loss surgery patient is no longer overeating or bingeing, but instead is abusing alcohol. An incisive and comprehensive nursing assessment that includes how, why, and in what manner the WLS patient is losing weight needs to be conducted to uncover established or developing cross-addictive behaviors. Clearly, assuming that any weight loss is better than no weight loss is a dangerous proposition when the mechanisms of how this weight loss occurred are not identified.",

Where the individual is impaired due to alcohol, narcotics, barbituates and other drugs this limitation of mental capacity is rarely total. The situation is similar in states of fatigue, hunger or chronic illness, or even of emotional disturbance. The problem of impairment, even when only partial, is that a pattern of behaviour may emerge, due to disturbances in perception, judgment, and coordination which are grossly deviant from that of the individual in a sober state and do not represent his desire or intent in that state. The extent to which this person is addicted and the extent to which permanent brain damage exists also influence the degree of manifest disturbance when alcohol or drugs are used. These have pertinence in considering the culpability of persons accused of murder and other serious crimes, especially in attempting to determine appropriate sentence or disposal.",

Our interest in the subject of conversion hysteria originated during a study of the behavioral effects of acute brain injuries, when it was noted that subjects who developed hysterical anesthesias and paralyses recalled their accidents and described their injuries in language of violence. In contrast, patients without hysterical symptoms were either amnestic for or confabulatory about accident and injury, or used language which did not emphasize the physically traumatic aspects of the",

      "abstract": "Depression is a mood disorder characterized by hopelessness then heartbreak, helplessness, excessive and unable to decide to start an activity, then unable to concentrate, not having the spirit of life, and in the final stage trying to commit suicide. Depressive symptoms are a collection of behaviors and feelings that can be specifically classified as depression. Symptoms of depression are at least seen from three aspects, namely physical symptoms, psychic symptoms, and social symptoms. Some people have a negative stigma about individuals affected by mental disorders such as depression, some studies show data on affected individuals exposed to negative stigma, one of which was shown by McLean Hospital in 2020 which showed that 75% of individuals with mental disorders had been stigmatized by society. The stigma given by society related to people who have a mental disorder is very diverse, ranging from so-called insane, people who do not have reason, and so on, but the highlight in this study is the stigma from society against people affected by mental disorders is the stigma that those who experience depression or other mental disorders that they lack faith, lack of prayer, lack of belief in God, and various other stigmas, this is then exacerbated by \"religious figures\" who sometimes give the same stigma and do not provide solutions to what is being felt by people who are affected by mental disorders. The results showed that faith can be a factor that can improve the mental health of an individual.",

      "abstract": "Los problemas en la alimentación durante la infancia han sido descritos a lo largo del tiempo por diversos autores. El diagnóstico de Trastorno de Evitación y Restricción de la Ingesta de Alimentos, (ARFID, de sus siglas en inglés) fue incluido en el Manual Diagnóstico y Estadístico de Trastornos Mentales, 5ta Edición (DSM-5) el año 2013, como un nuevo diagnóstico dentro de los Trastornos Alimentarios y de Ingesta (TAI) para describir un grupo de pacientes que tienen conductas alimentarias evitativas o restrictivas que no están motivadas por una alteración de la imagen corporal o un deseo de adelgazar. Este trastorno puede manifestarse en una pérdida de peso significativa y/o deficiencia nutricional y/o una marcada interferencia en el funcionamiento psicosocial. Se describen tres formas de presentación que pueden ocurrir en conjunto o de manera independiente: (i) Niños con aversiones sensoriales (selectivos), que rechazan algunas comidas por sus sabores, texturas, olores o formas; (ii) otros que presentan inapetencia, baja ingesta o poco interés en alimentarse (ingesta limitada); (iii) y los que rechazan algunos alimentos o dejan de comer después de un evento traumático asociado (aversivos). Debido a la incorporación reciente del diagnóstico al DSM-5, existe aún escasa evidencia respecto a su enfrentamiento. El propósito de esta revisión es clarificar criterios diagnósticos, y exponer un manejo progresivo de enfrentamiento y tratamiento, con un enfoque multidisciplinario, sin ahondar en la resolución de las causas médicas orgánicas.",

      "abstract": "Human development is a process that continues throughout an individuals life. Any change of structure of function, not only of a progressive type, is a developmental change. Developmental defects of the neural tube, such an various form of myelomeningocele, which manifest themselves during the early stages of the intrauterine life, have an impact on the individuals further development. Its intensity depends on the extend of the defect itself, the feasibility of its correction (usually by surgical means) and a number of external, environmental factors which have an indirect influence on a child's development. The psychological consequences of such defects take the form of various disturbances in the development of cognitive processes: mainly the perception of the outside world and the formation of the cognitive structures involved in self-image formation. At every stage of his and her development, an individual of with a neural-tube defects is subject to many forms of social influence. These may either stimulate or hamper development. It is possible that mental development deficiencies observed in some individuals at a later stage result not so much from the defect itself as from the lack of appropriate social stimuli. The specific problems of children and adolescents (aged 13 to 17) with sacro-lumbar myelomeningocele have been discussed on the basic of a pilot study conducted at the hospital in Radziszów in the years 1996-1998.",

Its multifactorial dynamics can include aspects of the illness itself, such as anosognosia.

      "abstract": "I have described a group of patients who are seemingly successful in their professional and social lives, and who seek analysis ostensibly for professional reasons or for minor difficulties in their relationship. However, sooner or later they reveal phenomena which are strikingly similar to those observed in so-called autistic children. These autistic phenomena are characterized by an almost impenetrable encapsulation of part of the personality, mute and implacable resistance to change, and a lack of real emotional contact either with themselves or the analyst. Progress of the analysis reveals an underlying intense fear of pain, and of death, disintegration or breakdown. These anxieties occur as a reaction to real or feared separation, especially when commitment to analysis deepens. In the case I have described in detail the patient used various projective processes to deflect painful emotions either into other people, including the analyst, or into their own bodies. As a consequence the various objects or organs of the body swell up and became suffused with rage as a result of having to contain the unwanted feelings. This process leads in turn to intense persecutory fears and a heightened sensitivity to the analyst's tone of voice and facial expression. It would seem that the initial hypersensitivity of part of the personality is such as to lead it to anticipate danger to such an extent that it expels feelings even before they reach awareness. The sooner the analyst realizes the existence of this hidden part of the patient the less the danger of the analysis becoming an endless and meaningless intellectual dialogue and the greater the possibilities of the patient achieving a relatively stable equilibrium. Although the analyst has to live through a great deal of anxiety with the patient I feel that ultimately the results make it worth while.",

      "abstract": "Injury means, in our courts, physical one. The Supreme Court of Korea has sometimes tried to take into account of mental and emotional injuries in determining whether the defendant has imposed `bodily injuries` on the victim. However, it still hesitates to announce that mental injury is a part of bodily injuries. To the contrary, the United States Federal Sentencing Guidelines state that: “bodily injury” means injury involving extreme physical pain or the protracted impairment of a function of a bodily member, organ, or mental faculty; or requiring medical intervention such as surgery, hospitalization, or physical rehabilitation. Impairment of a function of mental faculty will be counted on finding criminal liability under the guidelines. Too many victims are suffering from mental and emotional injuries after the criminal accident. Typical symptoms are including depression and post-traumatic stress disorder but the victims are not qualified for the compensation from the government. Furthermore, the criminal courts do not care about what has visibly happened on the brains of criminal victims. They are often ignoring recent developments in the neuro-science, which clearly shows that mental defects are resulted from the criminal act on the victims. We need to re-define what is injury. Imposing mental illness on victim must be punished on a charge of injuring. It will help the criminal victims recover from the post-traumatic symptoms and get back to their daily lifes.",

The functions and implications of pain are clearest in situations of acute illness or injury or in chronic, organically based conditions in which actual or threatened tissue damage is signaled by its report. Much greater complexity is found in a variety of clinical presentations (conversion hysteria, hypochondriasis, chronic pain syndromes, Briquet's syndrome, Munchausen's syndrome) in which pain may form part or all of the clinical picture. In such conditions the relationship of the patient's report of pain to other phenomena (tissue damage, physiopathology, perceptual and cognitive styles, personality type, individual and family psychodynamics, anxiety, depression, behavioral patterns, social and economic factors, cultural influences) is important in elucidating pathogenetic mechanisms of which several may be operating in any one case. Awareness of the existence and interaction of these mechanisms facilitates the development and integration of treatment approaches.",

      "title": "The psychiatric epidemic in the American workplace.",
      "abstract": "Several characteristics help distinguish MPI in the workplace from illness outbreaks due to physical causes: no laboratory or physical findings confirming an specific organic cause evidence of specific physical or psychological stressors victims are mostly women and those of lower socioeconomic status in the workplace hyperventilation-type symptoms are prominent apparent transmission by audiovisual cues rapid spread of the illness followed by rapid remission of symptoms, unless symptoms are fixed by physicians and litigation benign morbidity If a physical or chemical cause of the illness is not obvious and if episodes recur, the illness remains a mystery and the workplace becomes a breeding ground for anxiety, confusion, fear, and rumor. Economic pressures to resume normal operations are counteracted by fears that an environmental contaminant still exists. Once all physical explanations have been ruled out, investigators may turn to psychological explanations and focus on mass hysteria, but that explanation is primarily based on the absence of physical evidence rather than the presence of agreed-upon psychosocial conditions. Some reports suggest that the diagnosis of MPI is really an excuse for not conducting an adequate evaluation of low-level environmental contaminants. The disability in some workers is prolonged and points to non-work-related factors that may be contributing. Were it not for the unverifiable physical complaints and the workers' insistence that the symptoms are the result of physical disease and their concern about the complaints and their reactions to dismissal of their complaints, we would not consider these patients to have a mental disorder. These individuals are reinforced in their beliefs by some physicians and attorneys, and resultant litigation tends to fix their symptoms. In fact, a \"conspiracy theory\" evolves when there are enough convinced people--and enough people trying to dissuade them. Group phenomena reinforce their beliefs and make renouncement tantamount to betrayal. The mass psychogenic illness or psychiatric epidemic that occurs in the workplace offers an opportunity not only to study the elements of a biopsychosocial system, but also offers opportunities for medical anthropological studies that relate the causes and courses of specific episodes of MPI to the cultures of the individuals who develop symptoms and the cultures of the area in which the epidemic occurs.",

Akuter Beginn der Erkrankung, variable Ausprägung der Symptomatik, Ablenkbarkeit und spezielle klinische Provokationsmanöver helfen bei der Diagnosestellung. So weisen ein akuter Beginn des Tremors oder aber auch eine spontane Remission, eine rasche Verschlechterung mit Ausbreitung auf den gesamten Körper mit anschließendem statischen Verlauf auf eine mögliche psychogene Ursache hin. Die Schilderung der Symptome durch den Patienten kann entweder von einer „belle indifférence“, d.h. mit einer abnormen Gleichgültigkeit gegenüber der Schwere der Erkrankung vorgetragen werden, die der Behinderung nicht angemessen erscheint. Der psychogene Tremor fällt durch die Variabilität in Amplitude und Frequenz auf, außerdem tritt er eher am Unterarm als an den Fingern auf, zeigt somit einen abnehmenden Gradienten von proximal nach distal. Manche Formen fallen auch durch eine bizarr anmutende Ausgestaltung oder eine an eine Tätigkeit erinnernde Form auf (Teigrührer-Tremor). Der Distraktionstest macht sich die Tatsache zunutze, dass die meisten organischen Bewegungsstörungen unter mentaler Anspannung eher zu- als abnehmen. Beim kontralateralen Aktivierungstest wird der Patient aufgefordert, eine Position einzunehmen, in der der Tremor am stärksten ausgeprägt ist. Dann soll er mit der nicht-tremorösen Hand auf einen vorher vereinbarten Punkt zeigen. Bei Bewegungsstart kommt es zu einem kurzfristigen Sistieren des Tremors auf der kontralateralen Seite. Dieses Sistieren tritt sowohl beim Parkinson-Tremor als auch beim essentiellen Tremor nicht auf. Beim Entrainment-Test fordert man den Patienten auf, einen Takt mit einer Hand zu klopfen, dessen Frequenz vorgegeben und variiert wird. Ein psychogener Tremor wird in der Regel aus dem Rhythmus gebracht werden, kurzfristig sistieren oder sich an den Klopf-Rhythmus anpassen.",

It can be seen in the elderly, arthritis, drug interaction checker, fibromyalgia, living healthy, lupus osteoarthritis, pill identifier, rheumatoid arthritis, sports injuries, etc. Musculoskeletal disorders are among the most common problems in sport injuries resulting loss of mobility and physical independence. Homoeopathic treatment schedule considers disease as a dynamic unit and the derangement of the whole man, expressed through the particular organs of the body, i.e. the ‘whole man’ is primarily diseased and individual organs/parts are only secondarily affected. It distinguishes each entity suffering from various or same diseases as different from others, because individuals are inimitable by virtue of their particular and peculiar mental and physical states, and characteristics. Concisely, it lays emphasis on, the ‘person diagnosis’, instead of the ‘disease diagnosis’. Therefore,” every diseases has a cure” is the believe of homoeopathy. Under this flow of homeopathy principle, the aim of this article is to present some of the most frequent musculoskeletal disorders in sports Injuries and their homoeopathic treatment schedule .Sports is an essential part of each nation. There are many ways to classify sports injuries based on the time taken for the tissues to become injured, tissue type affected, severity of the injury, and type of the injury occurred in the individual. Therefore, different homeopathic treatments are required to tackle different category of injury especially the outcomes of sport activities.

      "title": "Fuzzy Logic Based Approach for Automation of Emotion Detection in Misophonia",
      "abstract": "Human being mostly categories into two types, the one who follow distress cycle and other who believe on wellness cycle.Output of distress cycle is decreased productivity, decreased enjoyment and decreased intimacy, whereas output of wellness cycle is increased productivity, increased enjoyment and increased intimacy which is essential for life.Reason of distress could be anything like emotion, disease, environment, family, pain.One of the mostly unexplored areas of cause of distress is misophonia.It is a disorder related to various senses like sound, sight, smell, taste and touch.This disorder is not in DSM-V, underscoring that it is not known by psychiatric and medical communities.We have proposed an automatic fuzzy approach system for identification of intensity of emotions related to various triggers on the basis of age group. K EY W ORDSMisophonia,Emotion,Misophonia Activation Scale,Trigger Level Response 0 Person with misophonia hears a known trigger sound but feels no discomfort.1 Person with misophonia is aware of the presence of a known trigger person but feels no, or minimal, anticipatory anxiety. 2 Known trigger sound elicits minimal psychic discomfort, irritation or annoyance.No symptoms of panic or fight or flight response.3 Person with misophonia feels increasing levels of psychic discomfort but does not engage in any physical response.Sufferer may be hyper-vigilant to audio-visual stimuli.4 Person with misophonia engages in a minimal physical response -nonconfrontational coping behaviors, such as asking the trigger person to stop making the noise, discreetly covering one ear, or by calmly moving away from the noise.No panic or fight or flight symptoms exhibited.5 Person with misophonia adopts more confrontational coping mechanisms, such as overtly covering their ears, mimicking the trigger person, engaging in other echolalias, or displaying overt irritation.6Person with misophonia experiences substantial psychic discomfort.Symptoms of panic, and a fight or flight response, begin to engage.7Person with misophonia experiences substantial psychic discomfort.Increasing use (louder, more frequent) use of confrontational coping mechanisms.There may be unwanted sexual arousal.Sufferer may re-imagine the trigger sound and visual cues over and over again, sometimes for weeks, months or even years after the event.8Person with misophonia experiences substantial psychic discomfort.Some violence ideation.9Panic/rage reaction in full swing.Conscious decision not to use violence on trigger person.Actual flight from vicinity of noise and/or use of physical violence on an inanimate object.Panic, anger or severe irritation may be manifest in sufferer's demeanour.10Actual use of physical violence on a person or animal (i.e., a household pet).Violence may be inflicted on self (self-harming). ONLINE SURVEYOn July 8th, 2013, a group of people who suffer from misophonia, self-identified as a \"group of amateur researchers,\" compiled a survey of just over 120 questions with the hope of generating a data base of information.The survey was publicized to misophonia communities on at least three social media group sites, yahoo groups (Selective Sound Sensitivity Yahoo group), reddit (r/misophonia on reddit), and tumblr (misophoniasupport.tumblr.com).As an online survey with no log-in or opt-in requirements, it was an open survey available to the general public.Thus, for the following analysis, it is assumed that the people who answered the survey are misophonia sufferers. TRAINED DATASET GENERATION ON THE BASIS OF ONLINE SURVEYWe have observed 521 samples, 395 females and 126 males in the age group of 12-50.For better understanding of generation of emotion pattern we have sub-divided age as per following:",

      "abstract": "Exercise addiction (EA) is probably the most ‘hidden’ of the behavioural addictions. In a society in which a fit body is normally considered to be a symptom of a healthy lifestyle and success, the assessment and treatment of a maladaptive and health-threatening pattern of exercise may be challenging for healthcare professionals. Furthermore, the lack of guidance and literature on the topic may represent an additional complication on the diagnostic and therapeutic pathway. Although EA is not included in the DSM-5, it is mandatory to inform clinicians about it, as well as other healthcare providers (e.g., psychotherapists, physiotherapists), in order to better identify early signs of such an addiction and prevent injuries or other serious effects on physical or mental health. This chapter provides information on the aetiological basis of EA as well as a compendium of psychological and pharmacological interventions.",

In DSM system, such reactive disorders are listed as adjustment disorder, acute stress disorder, brief psychotic disorder with marked stressor and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). However, a growing number of individuals is suffering from a prolonged feeling of embitterment after exceptional negative life events and this condition could be diagnosed neither PTSD nor adjustment disorder nor depressive disorder in the context of DSM-IV diagnostic system. This clinical condition can be described as 'posttraumatic embitterment disorder' (PTED). PTED is a reactive disorder triggered by exceptional, though normal negative life events such as conflict in the workplace, unemployment, death of a relative, divorce, severe illness, or experience of loss or separation. The common feature of such events is that they are experienced as unjust, as a personal insult, accompanied by psychological violation of basic beliefs and values. The central psychopathological response pattern in PTED is a prolonged feeling of embitterment. In particular, the core emotion of embitterment can lead to the rejection of treatment. Therefore, wisdom therapy as a new treatment approach specifically designed for PTED has been developed. It is assumed that many patients suffering from PTED are often misunderstood and misdiagnosed. This review would help to introduce PTED into the clinical field in psychiatry.】",

      "abstract": "Interaction uneasiness of people with Parkinson’s disease .Human beings not only speak but also express their thoughts and emotions through facial expressions. People also relate to each other in interaction by watching each other’s facial expressions. The face of people with Parkinson’s disease gradually rigidifies as a consequence of a lack of dopamine production in the brain. This life story research with people with Parkinson’s disease shows that they appear to feel impeded in their interactions with others. In their stories, the informants show five signs of what Goffman labels as ‘interaction uneasiness’. Firstly, people with the disease themselves show difficulties with expressing their inner feelings and thoughts. Secondly, they perceive signs of uneasiness in others. Thirdly, they perceive uneasiness in their interactions. Fourthly, they perceive uneasiness in the eyes of third parties. And fifthly, they feel their face does not suit in the situation they are in. In the life stories indications of three conditions of this uneasiness have been found. The primary condition is difference in labelling, either caused by the lack of a label for the unusual face, or the fear that others might interpret their rigidified facial expressions wrongly. The secondary condition is a lack of culture: lack of culture for the uncommon and lack of knowledge of the culture of Parkinson’s disease. The third condition is the minimal legitimation work undertaken by people with the disease.As a consequence of the uneasiness in interaction, people with Parkinson’s disease are inclined to five different reactions: resistance, indifference, retreat from public interactional situations as well as feelings of exclusion and banishment. Parkinson’s disease thus appears to be a threat to customary social life for people with the disease.",

Specific areas of concern, either mental (Axis I) or physical (Axis III), would delineate the syndrome. Pathological Habit Disorder (PHD) points to treatment options where the syndrome is wholly or partly habit-driven. Whether the syndrome is habit-driven or not will remain a clinical judgement even though many conditions, previously thought immutable except by medication, are proving accessible to behavioural engineering. In the ICD system, PHD seems to fit in “Special Symptoms or Syndromes not elsewhere Classified”. It is demonstrably useful to have a diagnosis such as PHD and to incorporate it into the body of medical classification, recognizing current practices for dealing with unwelcome or damaging habits.",

Patients complain of a chronic change in perceptions concerning their own self (depersonalization) or their surrounding (derealization) lasting months and often years. They perceive themselves and/or their environment as unreal; as if they are in a dream; as if they are detached from themselves and their surroundings by an invisible wall; or as if they are observers of the self without any connection to physical or mental processes. Often, patients are incorrectly treated with antipsychotics under a misdiagnosed psychotic illness, or the disorder remains unconsidered in differential diagnoses despite the patients' immense suffering. First-line treatment is psychotherapy with no current approved drug treatments. Psychoeducation and grounding exercises might be sufficient for mild cases without significant impairment of personality functioning. In patients with more distress and impairment of personality functioning, an affect-focused psychodynamic approach is helpful, which simultaneously deals with impaired affect-tolerance and the massive affect-phobia and detachment.",

      "abstract": "Excited delirium syndrome (ExDS) has been defined as the sudden death of an individual involving an acute (minutes to hours) transient disturbance in consciousness and cognition, marked by disorientation, disorganized and inconsistent thought processes, inability to distinguish reality from hallucinations, disturbances in speech, disorientation to time and place, and misidentification of individuals. 1 In a majority of these deaths the individual exhibited violent behaviors, struggled with police, correction officers, or medical personnel during control and physical restraint of the person, within a matter of several minutes after the cessation of the struggle the person is observed to be in cardiopulmonary arrest and resuscitation is usually unsuccessful.Frequently an autopsy does not reveal anatomic evidence to show trauma or natural disease or toxicological findings sufficient to explain the death.Commonly, pathologists cite the symptoms of ExDS on the death certificate as contributing factors of the death. 2-4Deaths associated with ExDS were first reported in a case report in 1849 when psychiatrist Dr. Luther Bell at the McClean Asylum for the Insane in Massachusetts described the condition of 40 mentally ill patients who died from a fatal new disease. 5Common features observed in these patient's deaths included: fever, rapid pulse, increasing confusion, loss of appetite and sleep, mania, and violent behaviors.Patients condition deteriorated over several weeks before dying.The clinical condition was referred to as Bell's Mania or acute exhaustive mania and is considered the forerunner of the syndrome of ExDS. 1,2,4,6Other case reports described similar symptoms of Bell's Mania and were referred to as acute delirious mania, lethal catatonia, acute psychotic furors exhaustive syndrome, and typhoma.As new antipsychotic medications emerged through the 1950s, the incidence of deaths associated with Bell's Mania declined.By the mid-1980s a number of deaths associated with cocaine use were reported by Fishbain and Wetli and they described symptoms associated with chronic stimulant abuse as excited delirium. 7Common factors observed in these deaths included: acute drug intoxication, mental illness, agitation, hyperactivity, violence, bizarre and self-injurious behaviors, hallucinations, delusions, paranoia, and elevated body temperature.For years there has been a controversy as to a standardized case definition of ExDS.Case report and post-mortem literature since the 1990s has shown that ExDS comprises several clinical features including: delirium with agitation, hyperthermia, violent agitation, acute psychotic behavior, bizarre behaviors, profuse sweating, incoherent speech, extraordinary strength and endurance, lack of response to painful stimuli, hyperactivity, respiratory arrest, and",

Thus a specific role for neurochemical or neuroendocrine factors certainly cannot be postulated or elucidated to explain such behavior in its entirety. Even when the term “antisocial” is used in other than a legal or criminological sense – for example, when it is applied in psychiatric diagnostics in an attempt to define and understand individual human behavior more fully – it remains overinclusive. From a clinical standpoint, the term “antisocial” most often signifies antisocial personality disorder (American Psychiatric Association, 1952, 1968, 1980), which in the third edition of the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-III) is considered an “axis II” personality disorder, which may or may not coexist with certain “axis I” clinical syndromes or other conditions.

      "abstract": "In the study of the instances of the disease which I have just described, it was most clearly evident from their pathological course that their existence was intimately connected with a disturbance of some kind in the nervous system, and essentially dependent upon it. In both predisposition existed, in so far that the one (Case I.) the woman was worn out with anxiety, want of rest, etc., from nursing the member of her family who died just before the first attack of the disease, she was hysterical and nervous; in the other (Case II.) he had been subjected for years to severe responsibilities, cares, and worries, which had impaired his general health. In Case I, complete recovery took place after a certain length of time, and she remained well, until experiencing another mental emotion and shock—from business reverses—a relapse occurred. From this time on, every relapse slight or great, every recrudescence of the cutaneous symptoms, subjective or objective, could be traced to some such slight or severe mental emotion or impression, or increased worry, or care, or anxiety and furthermore the grade of the relapse, whether transient or grave, varied according to the grade of the emotion, shock, or other disturbance received. It was also constantly seen how objective manifestations constantly followed immediately upon neuralgic pains, or a hemicrania or some other evidence of sensory innervation. Still more conclusive, perhaps, of the neurotic character of the disease was the observation that diminution in the severity of the subjective and objective manifestations occurred in proportion as the patient's morale improved, and the final cessation of the pathological symptoms and entire quiescence of the disease were only obtained when the changed circumstances of the patient's life protected her against the occurrence of mental emotions or shocks and precluded the experience of annoyances, worries, or cares.

      "abstract": "Abstract A diagnosis of toxic-related injury/illness requires a consideration of the illness related to the toxic exposure, including diagnosis, causation, and permanent impairment; these are best performed by a physician who is certified by a specialty board certified by the American Board of Preventive Medicine. The patient must have a history of symptoms consistent with the exposure and disease at issue. In order to diagnose the presence of a specific disease, the examiner must find subjective complaints that are consistent with the objective findings, and both the subjective complaints and objective findings must be consistent with the disease that is postulated. Exposure to a specific potentially causative agent at a defined concentration level must be documented and must be sufficient to induce a particular pathology in order to establish a diagnosis. Differential diagnoses must be entertained in order to rule out other potential causes, including psychological etiology. Furthermore, the identified exposure at the defined concentration level must be capable of causing the diagnosis being postulated before the examiner can conclude that there has been a cause-and-effect relationship between the exposure and the disease (dose-response relationship). The evaluator's opinion should make biological and epidemiological sense. The treatment plan and prognosis should be consistent with evidence-based medicine, and the rating of impairment must be based on objective findings in involved systems.",

      "title": "Late Onset Depression",
      "abstract": "In the older population, one of the serious health concerns that are associated with comorbidity, impaired functioning, excessive use of health care resources, and increased mortality (including suicide) is a depressive disorder. Depression that occurs among individuals greater than or equal to 65 years with no previous history of depression is known as late-life depression, which is characterized as the affective state of sadness that occurs as a response to various of human situations including loss of a loved one, failing to achieve goals, or disappointment in love relationships. Major depression differs only in the intensity and duration or quality of the emotional state. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) defines major depressive disorder by the presence of depressed mood or a marked loss of interest or pleasure in activities along with 5 or more of the following associated symptoms: changes in appetite or weight (5% of the total body weight), sleep, energy, concentration, and psychomotor activity, feelings of inappropriate guilt or worthlessness and recurrent thoughts of death or suicide. There should be an impairment in social, occupational, and other areas of functioning.The symptoms of depression should have been present during the last two weeks. Depression in late-life is underdiagnosed and inadequately treated. It is a serious and life-threatening disorder which affects every 1 in 5 individual in a lifetime. When it occurs in old age, it becomes challenging to distinguish it from dementia, as both these diagnoses have overlapping symptom profiles, especially when depression affects the cognition and is presented as ’pseudodementia.’",

      "title": "The psychosocial effects of psychogenic non-epileptic seizures (PNES)",
      "abstract": "What are Psychogenic Nonepileptic Seizures? A recent research study conducted by Flinders University explores the experience of a disability which is both hidden and lacks physiological ‘evidence’; a condition which is not understood by health professionals, and results in individuals feeling confused and isolated. Psychogenic non-epileptic seizures (PNES) (also called pseudoseizures) are events resembling epileptic seizures, which are not associated with ictal electrical discharges in the brain but by psychological processes. PNES may be triggered by anxiety, psychological tension and heightened defence against intense emotions. In some cases PNES may be a result of psychological trauma, previous psychiatric history, physical and sexual abuse or posttraumatic stress disorder (Fiszman, Alves-Leon, Nunes, Dandrea, & Figueira, 2004). Health professionals often overlook PNES due to the common misconception that they are “fake” (Benbadis, 2005) or are categorized as a “non-disease” (i.e. not epilepsy) (Bodde, et al., 2009). However, this is a very real condition, with considerable psychosocial implications. People diagnosed with PNES feel anger, shame, helplessness, and experience suicidal ideation (thinking about suicide with some intent but without actually making plans to commit suicide) (Thompson, Isaac, Rowse, Tooth, & Reuber, 2009). Stigma is often attached with this label, fuelled by poor understanding and little education and support following diagnosis (Benbadis, 2010). One complicating factor is that an individual may experience both PNES and epileptic seizures. 15% of people with diagnosed PNES also have epilepsy (Benbadis, 2010), and it is estimated that 10 to 50% of individuals with “intractable seizures” (seizures not adequately controlled by AEDs) have either lone PNES or a combination of epileptic seizures and PNES (LaFrance, et al., 2006). Co-morbidity can cause significant diagnostic and management issues, with health professionals often unable to accurately identify the cause of seizures, and thereby communicate and manage them appropriately. The current study aimed to further explore the psychosocial effects of PNES and their implications for the development of appropriate multidisciplinary support and management strategies.",

Various health theories - biomedical, ability-based, biopsychosocial - are introduced and scrutinized from the point of view of enactivism and phenomenology. Health is ultimately argued to consist in a central world-disclosing aspect of what is called existential feelings, experienced by way of transparency and ease in carrying out important life projects. Health, in such a phenomenologically enacted understanding, is an important and in many cases necessary part of leading a good life. Illness, on the other hand, by such a phenomenological view, consist in finding oneself at mercy of unhomelike existential feelings, such as bodily pains, nausea, extreme unmotivated tiredness, depression, chronic anxiety and delusion, which make it harder and, in some cases, impossible to flourish. In illness suffering the lived body hurts, resists, or, in other ways, alienates the activities of the ill person.",

      "title": "Η σχέση υποκειμενικής γνωστικής έκπτωσης και διατροφής στον ελληνικό πληθυσμό τρίτης ηλικίας",
      "abstract": "Τα τελευταία χρόνια κερδίζει έδαφος η ιδέα της υποκειμενικής γνωστικής έκπτωσης (ΥΓΕ) ως υποψηφίου ισοδυνάμου του προκλινικού σταδίου της νόσου Alzheimer. Ως υποκειμενική γνωστική έκπτωση (subjective cognitive decline) ορίζουμε την (αυθόρμητη ή μη) αναφορά από ένα άτομο παραπόνων για εμμένουσα έκπτωση της μνήμης ή άλλων γνωστικών λειτουργιών σε σχέση με το προηγούμενο επίπεδο, χωρίς από την αντικειμενική εξέταση να προκύπτει νευρογνωστική διαταραχή (ήπια γνωστική διαταραχή ή κλινική άνοια), λαμβανομένων υπόψη της ηλικίας, του φύλου και του μορφωτικού επιπέδου. Η έκπτωση πρέπει επίσης να μη σχετίζεται με κάποιο οξύ συμβάν και να μην μπορεί να εξηγηθεί από άλλη νευρολογική, ψυχιατρική ή παθολογική νόσο, λήψη φαρμάκων ή ουσιών. Τα δεδομένα υποδηλώνουν ότι τα άτομα αυτά έχουν αυξημένο κίνδυνο νόσησης από άνοια στο μέλλον και συνιστούν ελκυστικό ερευνητικό στόχο, τόσο για επιδημιολογικές, όσο και παρεμβατικές μελέτες.Εφόσον η ΥΓΕ είναι παράγοντας κινδύνου για τη μετέπειτα εγκατάσταση κλινικής άνοιας, είναι ιδιαίτερα ενδιαφέρον να μελετηθούν οι παράμετροι που θα μπορούσαν να επηρεάσουν αυτήν την εξέλιξη. Ένας από τους πιο ενδιαφέροντες παράγοντες που σχετίζονται με τον τρόπο ζωής είναι η διατροφή, η οποία προσφέρεται ως στόχος για την υιοθέτηση ευρείας κλίμακας στρατηγικών πρόληψης της γνωστικής έκπτωσης με καλή σχέση κόστους-αποτελεσματικότητας. Καθώς η διεθνής βιβλιογραφία παρουσιάζει σημαντικές ελλείψεις στη μελέτη της σχέσης ΥΓΕ και διατροφής, η παρούσα διδακτορική διατριβή φιλοδοξεί να συνεισφέρει στην κάλυψη αυτού του κενού. Για το σκοπό αυτό, η εργασία στηρίχθηκε στα δεδομένα της μελέτης HELIAD [Hellenic Epidemiological Longitudinal Investigation of Aging and Diet (Νευροεκφυλιστικές και άλλες νευρολογικές νόσοι στον ελληνικό πληθυσμό – συχνότητες και παράγοντες κινδύνου)] και κινήθηκε σε δύο παράλληλους σχεδιασμούς:1.Συγχρονική μελέτη (cross-sectional), με στόχο τη διερεύνηση του επιπολασμού συγκεκριμένων ειδών ΥΓΕ και της σχέσης τους με ποικίλους παράγοντες, μεταξύ των οποίων και τη διατροφή·2.Προοπτική μελέτη (prospective cohort), με στόχο τη διερεύνηση της επίδρασης της διατροφής στην εξέλιξη της ΥΓΕ στο χρόνο.Τα παράπονα που σχετίζονται με ΥΓΕ αναδείχθηκαν με τη βοήθεια ενός δομημένου καταλόγου ερωτήσεων/θεμάτων για συζήτηση με το συμμετέχοντα. Η ΥΓΕ ταξινομήθηκε ανάλογα με το γνωστικό πεδίο στο οποίο ο συμμετέχων εντοπίζει προβλήματα, δηλαδή τη μνήμη, το λόγο, την οπτική-αντιληπτική και την επιτελική λειτουργία. Οι συμμετέχοντες θεωρήθηκαν θετικοί για ένα είδος ΥΓΕ σε περίπτωση τουλάχιστον μίας θετικής απάντησης στις ερωτήσεις του συγκεκριμένου γνωστικού πεδίου. Η συνολική βαθμολογία ΥΓΕ ορίστηκε ως ο αριθμός των αναφερόμενων γνωστικών πεδίων με ΥΓΕ και συνεπώς κυμαίνεται από 0 ως 4.Με βάση τα ευρήματα από το συγχρονικό σκέλος της μελέτης, η ΥΓΕ στον ελληνικό πληθυσμό ≥65 ετών είναι πολύ συχνή (84,6%) και εστιάζεται κυρίως στη μνήμη. Τα συμπτώματα άγχους και η ύπαρξη αγγειακού εγκεφαλικού κινδύνου σχετίζονται με αυξημένη πιθανότητα ΥΓΕ, ενώ προστατευτικό ρόλο φαίνεται να έχει η εκπαίδευση. Όσον αφορά τα είδη ΥΓΕ, σημειώνεται η επιβαρυντική δράση του γυναικείου φύλου, της γενετικής προδιάθεσης για γνωστική έκπτωση και της αυξημένης ενεργειακής πρόσληψης στην εμφάνιση υποκειμενικής έκπτωσης στη μνήμη. Η παρουσία συμπτωμάτων κατάθλιψης ή/και άγχους και η πρόοδος της ηλικίας συνδέονται επίσης με τα περισσότερα είδη ΥΓΕ.Αναλύοντας τα δεδομένα από την προοπτική παρακολούθηση του δείγματός μας, υπολογίσαμε ότι αρχική συμμόρφωση με το διατροφικό πρότυπο της μεσογειακής δίαιτας υψηλότερη κατά 10 μονάδες στην κλίμακα MDS (Mediterranean Diet Score) σχετίζεται με μείωση κατά 7% στην εξέλιξη της ΥΓΕ ανά έτος, και ότι κάθε επιπλέον μερίδα λαχανικών καθημερινά σχετίζεται με περιορισμό κατά 2,2% της προόδου της ΥΓΕ ανά έτος. Τα αποτελέσματά μας ενισχύουν την άποψη ότι η μεσογειακή δίαιτα δρα προστατευτικά έναντι ολόκληρου του συνεχούς της γνωστικής έκπτωσης, ξεκινώντας από τα πρώτα γνωστικά παράπονα. Η επιβεβαίωση των ευρημάτων αυτών και από άλλες μελέτες, ιδίως για συγκεκριμένες ομάδες τροφίμων, και η αποσαφήνιση των υποκείμενων μηχανισμών μπορεί να ενδυναμώσει το ρόλο της μεσογειακής δίαιτας ως εύκολα εφαρμόσιμης, χαμηλού κόστους και υψηλής αποτελεσματικότητας στρατηγικής πρόληψης που στοχεύει τους τροποποιήσιμους παράγοντες κινδύνου για γνωστική έκπτωση.",

Five of these cases were presented as having a factitious disorder, seven were psychotic and two had dissociative (hysterical) disorders. The remaining eight cases related to personality disorder or character deviance. In two cases diagnosis was impossible.

Although the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM–5) does not list malingering in its diagnostic section and therefore does not identify it as a formal mental disorder, malingering and verified mental illness commonly coexist. Some subtypes of feigning behaviors, such as partial or pure malingering, dissimulation, and false imputation, can be suspected when patients have marked discrepancies between reported stressors and objective findings. The article discusses these three theoretical concepts with their possible clinical aspects, illustrating each phenomenon by clinical case with self-reported and/or observed psychotic symptoms. We summarized relevant findings and provided a review of clinical considerations that physicians can use to aid in the evaluation of psychotic symptoms in the context of those three concepts.",

      "abstract": "Delusional disorder, the contemporary conceptualization of paranoia, is an uncommon condition characterized by the presence of one or more nonbizarre delusions and the relative absence of associated psychopathology. The delusions concern experiences that can conceivably occur in real life, such as being followed (persecutory type), having a disease (somatic type), being loved at a distance (erotomanic type), having an unfaithful sexual partner (jealous type), and possessing inflated worth, power, identity, or knowledge (grandiose type). The diagnosis requires at least 1 month's duration of the delusion; impact on functioning that is consistent with the delusion or its ramifications; generally normal appearance and behavior; and the exclusion of schizophrenia, mood disorder, substance-induced toxicity, and medical disease. Typically, patients are unaware of the psychiatric nature of the condition. They may present to internists, dermatologists, plastic surgeons, lawyers, or the police rather than to psychiatrists. Although the prevalence is low, delusional disorder is not rare. Age at onset is usually middle or late adulthood, and the course is variable. Familial transmission is suspected, and comorbidity (frequently mood disorders) may exist. Successful management is difficult and may include hospitalization, pharmacotherapy, and certain forms of psychotherapy.",

They have higher rates of medical and psychiatric comorbidity when compared to the general population and face considerable healthcare disparity. Challenging behavior such as physical or verbal aggression is the most common reason why this population interfaces with the mental healthcare system. Understanding and correctly diagnosing the underlying etiology of challenging behaviors requires comprehensive evaluations along with awareness of the key variables that contribute to the occurrence of these behaviors. The differential diagnosis of challenging behavior is wide and includes mental illness, medical illness, pain, side effects from medications, behavioral phenotype of underlying syndrome, behavioral/functional, deficit of skills, and/or developmentally appropriate behavior. This review contains 1 figure, 6 tables and 83 references Key words: behavioral phenotype, challenging behaviors, etiology, intellectual disability, mental retardation, mental illness, psychiatric disorders",

      "abstract": "Shame and disgust in relation to the body are regular features in clinical cases of neurologically damaged patients. The psychic and narcissistic deconstructions involved in such neurological disorders bring about the kind of vacillation of identity usually associated with the feeling of falling in love with the Other. Moreover, in a number of disorders, the shame of the subject crystallizes around a body that fails, falls, or becomes autonomous, totally independent of the subject’s will. On the basis of several clinical cases from a hospital neurology practice, and through the socio-historical treatment of these disorders, here we propose to examine the basis of the affect of shame in this experience of the body’s “dropping” of the subject and its becoming uncontrollable, as if abandoned to itself and its raw instincts. What exactly is it that falls for the subject and thus reveals itself to the gaze of the Other, and what may be the subject’s responses to this shame, and ways of “relieving” it ?",

      "title": "KNOWLEDGE REGARDING MENTAL HEALTH AND MENTAL ILLNESS IN COMMUNITY AMONG THE ASHA WORKERS",
      "abstract": "Mental health' and 'mental illness' are increasingly being used as if they mean the same thing, but they do not. Everyone has mental health, just like everyone has health. As the World Health Organization famously says, “There is no health without mental health.” In the course of a lifetime, not all people will experience a mental illness, but everyone will struggle or have a challenge with their mental well-being (i.e., their mental health) just like we all have challenges with our physical well-being from time to time. Amental illness is an illness the affects that way people think, feel, behave, or interact with others. There are many different mental illnesses, and they have different symptoms that impact peoples' lives in different ways. Just as it's possible to have poor mental health but no mental illness, it's entirely possible to have good mental health even with a diagnosis of a mental illness. That's because mental illnesses (like other health problems) are often episodic, meaning there are times ('episodes') of ill health and times of better or good health. With the right supports and tools, anyone can live well—however they dene well—and nd meaning, contribute to their communities, and work towards their goals. Objectives 1.To identify the knowledge regarding mental health and mental illness in community among the ASHAworkers in Kasaba Bawada, Kolhapur. Methodolgy: A non-experimental descriptive survey design was used for the study. Non probability purposive sampling technique was used to select 60 samples. Data collection was done using structured knowledge questionnaire. The data was analyzed by using descriptive (mean, S.D, Frequency and Percentage). The majority of the workers 40 (66.67%) belonged to the age group 31-40 years and minimum 08 (13.33%) workers belong to age group 41-50 years. The maximum of the workers 54 (90.00%) belonged to Hindu religion, and the remaining 6(10.00%) belonged to Muslim and Other religion. Maximum workers 56(93.34%) were married, and remaining 4 (6.66%) were widowed. Majority of the workers 28 (46.66%) studied till SSC and minimum 2 (3.34%) studied till graduation. Maximum 46 (76%) workers have poor knowledge and 13 (22%) have average knowledge regarding mental health and mental illness. Conclusion:The project work concludes that maximum workers have poor knowledge regarding mental health and mental illness, so there is need to focus on awareness of mental health among all the ASHAworkers.",

The symptoms categories associated with CD include (a) physical harm to people or animals, (b) destruction of property, (c) deceitfulness and theft, and (c) breaking societal norms. The severity of CD can be determined based upon the individual’s lack of empathy; greater lack of empathy across a variety of settings indicates more severe CD. In order to diagnose a child or adolescent with CD, the enduring and repetitive symptoms of CD must cause significant impairment in social, academic, and occupational functioning, occur more than once per week, and be present for at least three months (APA).",

In addition, a number of physical conditions can mimic fibromyalgia and must be considered in the patient's evaluation.

Taking a complete medical history and performing a thorough physical examination, including a complete laboratory assessment, can be very helpful in confirming the diagnosis or establishing an alternate diagnosis.",

      "abstract": "Psychiatric nosology is widely criticized, but solutions are proving elusive. Planned revisions of diagnostic criteria will not resolve heterogeneity, comorbidity, fuzzy boundaries between normal and pathological, and lack of specific biomarkers. Concern about these difficulties reflects a narrow model that assumes most mental disorders should be defined by their etiologies. A more genuinely medical model uses understanding of normal function to categorize pathologies. For instance, understanding the function of a cough guides the search for problems causing it, and decisions about when it is expressed abnormally. Understanding the functions of emotions is a foundation missing from decisions about emotional disorders. The broader medical model used by the rest of medicine also recognizes syndromes defined by failures of functional systems or failures of feedback control. Such medical syndromes are similar to many mental diagnoses in their multiple causes, blurry boundaries, and nonspecific biomarkers. Dissatisfaction with psychiatric nosology may best be alleviated, not by new diagnostic criteria and categories, but by more realistic acknowledgment of the untidy landscape of mental and other medical disorders.",

The physical, anatomic, and electrochemical expression of pain is treated by physical therapy, medicines, nerve block, electric stimulators, and surgery. The suffering component involves the patient's (1) nonacceptance, (2) fear of the unknown, (3) pessimistic evaluation of the meaning of pain, (4) feeling of no time limit to suffering, and (5) often self-destructive feelings of guilt and resentment. These emotions and imaginings are quite amenable to good hypnotherapy. When suffering is removed, pain tends to become tolerable or may even disappear.",

      "title": "Somatic Symptom and Related Disorders",
      "abstract": "Somatic symptom and related disorders comprise a heterogeneous group of psychiatric illnesses characterized by prominent physical symptoms or complaints that are associated with significant distress and impairment. The conceptualization of these disorders under the category of somatoform disorders in DSM-IV/DSM-IV-TR) (American Psychiatric Association 1994, 2000) required that these somatic presentations lack objective organic causes. This latter requirement has been deleted in DSM-5, largely because somatic symptoms often do have related medical conditions (American Psychiatric Association 2013). Even when such associations have not been established, the assumption that they are present has often led to patients being labeled in pejorative ways, as if they are faking symptoms or somehow responsible for their own suffering. The seven disorders encompassed in the DSM-5 category of somatic symptom and related disorders are somatic symptom disorder, illness anxiety disorder, conversion disorder (functional neurological symptom disorder), psychological factors affecting other medical conditions, factitious disorder, other specified somatic symptom and related disorder, and unspecified somatic symptom and related disorder. DSM-IV disorders that are subsumed under this new nomenclature include somatization disorder, undifferentiated somatoform disorder, hypochondriasis, pain disorder, and factitious disorders (which appeared in their own separate category in DSM-IV). Body dysmorphic disorder is not included in the new somatic symptom disorder category and is now classified as one of the other specified obsessive-compulsive and related disorders. Prevalence rates in the literature for what were previously labeled somatoform disorders varied by diagnosis, but in general and across ages these disorders have been seen in 16% of primary care outpatients and in 23% of outpatients with medically unexplained symptoms (de Waal et al. 2004; Smith et al. 2005). A comparison of DSM-5 and DSM-IV diagnoses in a sample of patients suggests that prevalence rates are similar across the old and new nomenclatures (Voigt et al. 2012). Older individuals with somatic symptom and related disorders are seen in all health care settings, where they frequently overuse medical services and overburden general practitioners (de Waal et al. 2008; Puri and Dimsdale 2011). They often come to the attention of a geriatric psychiatrist after another clinician has attempted unsuccessfully to resolve their physical symptoms. To date, the somatic symptom and related disorders have not been well studied in late life, in part because many of the disorders tend to begin in early adulthood. In addition, research involving older cohorts has usually focused on reported somatic symptoms rather than on specific diagnoses. A complicating factor is that somatoform symptoms in late life are often obscured by comorbid physical and psychiatric illnesses. In particular, these disorders have been strongly associated with stress, depression, anxiety, psychological trauma, substance abuse, and personality disorders (de Waal et al. 2004; Haftgoli et al. 2010; Hasin and Katz, 2007; Sack et al. 2007; Tomenson et al. 2012). DSM-5 is trying to make the diagnoses more parsimonious by eliminating the requirement for medically unexplained symptoms, but additional research is needed to further elucidate their characteristics under the new nomenclature.",

The 1970s witnessed an \"epidemic\" of dissociative disorder, particularly DID, which may have reflected enthusiasm for the diagnosis more than its actual prevalence. Traditionally, the dissociative disorders have been attributed to trauma and other psychological stress, but the existing evidence favoring this hypothesis is plagued by poor methodology. Prospective studies of traumatized individuals reveal no convincing cases of amnesia not attributable to brain insult, injury, or disease. Treatment generally involves recovering and working through ostensibly repressed or dissociated memories of trauma; at present, there are few quantitative or controlled outcome studies. Experimental studies are few in number and have focused largely on state-dependent and implicit memory. Depersonalization disorder may be in line for the next \"epidemic\" of dissociation.",

      "abstract": "Error awareness or detection is the conscious and subconscious processing to evaluate physiological signals that are different from a baseline or homeostatic level. Migraine is a unique neurological disorder in which there are repeated attacks interspersed by attack-free periods. These attacks are dynamic and multidimensional in the sense that sensory, affective, autonomic, and cognitive functions are altered and these changes evolve differently before (pre-ictal), during (ictal), and immediately after (post-ictal) an attack. Thus migraine serves as a model disease to understand how the brain monitors and react to the presence of errors.",

      "abstract": "O presente estudo teve como objetivo fornecer informações sobre a fisiopatologia, manifestações clínicas e os impactos físicos, sociais e emocionais que influenciam na qualidade de vida de idosos portadores doença de Parkinson. A doença de Parkinson é considerada uma enfermidade neurodegenerativa crônica e progressiva que limita a independência nas atividades funcionais e na qualidade de vida dos pacientes podendo causar uma série de desafios. Apresenta sintomatologia complicada, com disfunções de ordem motora, como fortes tremores de mãos, pés e corpo, rigidez muscular, alterações posturais, desequilíbrio, incontinência urinária, alterações na fala, entre outros. É caracterizada, também, por manifestações não motoras, como as sensitiva-sensoriais, autonômicas, afetivas, cognitivas, comportamentais e do sono, que poderão causar incapacidades e contribuir com a dependência do portador. A qualidade de vida atua como um indicador nos conceitos clínicos de doenças específicas por meio da avaliação do impacto físico e psicossocial que algumas enfermidades podem gerar, possibilitando assim um melhor conhecimento do paciente e de sua adaptação a determinada condição. Devido à possibilidade de incapacidade produzida pelos sintomas da doença, é fundamental a adoção de estratégias para melhorar a qualidade de vida dos portadores, como adoção de recursos terapêuticos complementares. Foi realizado um levantamento bibliográfico através de busca eletrônica de trabalhos científicos que nos possibilitou perceber que, devido ao caráter progressivo e degenerativo da doença é preciso que profissionais da área de saúde estejam atentos para conhecer e indicar maneiras adequadas para prevenir e minimizar os efeitos da enfermidade, proporcionando aos portadores manutenção/ melhoria qualidade de vida.",

In cancer patients, it is defined as ‘distressing persistent, subjective sense of physical, emotional, and/or cognitive tiredness or exhaustion related to cancer or cancer treatment that is not proportional to recent activity and interferes with usual functioning’. In the majority of patients receiving palliative care, the aetiology of fatigue is multifactorial. The most common factors associated with fatigue include anorexia/cachexia, pain, anxiety, depression, shortness of breath, sleep disturbances, anaemia, and inflammation. Routine screening for fatigue is essential for optimal assessment of fatigue. Initial management should aim towards identification and treatment of the reversible/underlying causes However, if there are no reversible causes identified or if the fatigue is not responsive to specific treatments, symptomatic treatment should be considered.",

In considering psychologic reactions to pain and disability, a gradient of simulation, malingering, symptom exaggeration, overvaluation, functional overlay and hysteria is useful.

Most illnesses, except the very trivial, require a period of adjustment and a re-appraisal of lifestyle, ability to work and engagement in leisure activities. Potentially fatal and rapidly progressive disease might be expected to result in more severe psychological reactions, but the evidence indicates that there is surprisingly little correlation between psychiatric morbidity and disease severity when this has been measured in a standardized manner. Metabolic changes accentuate the emotional response to illness. Effective communication is an essential element of good clinical practice. Conversely, poor communication is a source of frustration for patients, leading to uncertainty, resentment, anxiety and depression. Depression resulting from the emotional impact of an illness follows an appraisal of the implications that the illness has on relationships, lifestyle, work prospects, long-term disability and mortality.",

      "abstract": "Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) can occur after a traumatic experience and can cause severe symptoms that interfere with a person's psychological, physical, interpersonal, occupational, and social functioning. It is important to accurately identify genuine cases of PTSD and, as part of the differential diagnosis, to rule out instances of false PTSD. False PTSD diagnoses can adversely affect treatment planning, resource management, and research. The subjective nature of stressors, stereotypic presentation of symptoms, wealth of resources detailing how to malinger PTSD, and the high stakes for individuals involved in criminal, civil, and disability evaluations create challenges for making an accurate diagnosis. This article presents a systematic approach to help clinicians and forensic evaluators distinguish genuine PTSD from false variants of the disorder. It describes the types of false PTSD to be considered as alternative diagnoses, including malingered PTSD (for external gain, such as receiving a disability pension or evading criminal consequences), factitious PTSD (for internal gain, such as assuming the victim or hero/veteran role), and misattributed PTSD (legitimate psychopathology misdiagnosed as PTSD). The authors describe clinical features and psychological testing that may be leveraged to aid in reaching a more valid diagnosis.",

Compathy occurs when one person observes another person suffering a disease or injury and experiences in one's physical body a similar or related distress. Thus, compathy is the physical equivalent to empathy. Although the contagion of physiological (compathetic) responses has been previously documented (for example, as couvades or psychogenic epidemics of the workplace), it has not been theoretically explicated. Triggers for the compathetic response are identified and include observing the suffering, hearing, or reading—or even thinking about—descriptions of the symptoms. The relevance of the compathetic response in the caregiving relationship and the necessity of suppressing the response when inflicting pain as a part of providing therapy are described. The concept of compathy is analysed and defended.",

Patients with Alzheimer’s disease, however, often develop apraxia, which can be defined as a disorder of skilled movement not caused by weakness, akinesia, deafferentation, abnormal tone or posture, movement disorders (such as tremor or chorea), intellectual deterioration, poor comprehension, or uncooperativeness.3Moreover, subtypes of apraxia have been delineated and are defined by the nature of errors made by the patient and the means by which these errors are elicited.4 5 Accordingly, a patient with probable dementia of the Alzheimer’s type is described who had normal prosodic elements to his spontaneous everyday speech, but could not produce the same acoustical features underlying prosody to command.

      "abstract": "A esclerose múltipla remitente-recorrente (EMRR) é uma doença neurológica autoimune, onde o sistema imunológico ataca a bainha de mielina do sistema nervoso central, causando inflamação que prejudica a transmissão dos impulsos nervosos. Caracteriza-se por episódios de surtos com exacerbação dos sintomas, como fadiga, fraqueza em membros inferiores e superiores, tremores e equilíbrio dificuldade para andar, perda de visão, entre outros, seguidos de remissões com recuperação parcial ou completa, que podem durar meses ou anos, durante os quais a progressão da doença é mínima ou ausente. A insônia ou baixa qualidade de sono pode ocorrer indiretamente como consequência da EMRR. Ou seja, um sintoma secundário que é acarretado pela presença dos sintomas específicos da doença e dos pseudo surtos. A Percepção Corporal (PC) pode ser definida de duas maneiras, como Imagem Corporal (IC) e Esquema Corporal (EC). A IC está relacionada ao aspecto psíquico, emocional, cognitivo, sociocultural, evolucionário, genético e neurocientífico, em relação a expectativa da imagem de seu corpo. O EC é a perspectiva que possibilita, por meio de mecanismos cinestésicos e proprioceptivos, o reconhecimento do corpo anatômico e da relação que este estabelece com o meio e com os objetos a sua volta. Diante destas definições, surgiu a oportunidade para relacionar a qualidade de sono com a percepção corporal e os quadros sintomatológicos. Sendo assim, o objetivo do estudo foi analisar a relação entre a qualidade do sono e a percepção corporal, pelo aspecto do esquema corporal e os quadros sintomatológicos da esclerose múltipla. Participaram 18 pessoas, entre 21 e 67 anos, que foram avaliados quanto à qualidade do sono pelo questionário de Pittsburgh, à percepção corporal pelo Teste de Askevold, e aos sintomas por meio de uma entrevista estruturada. Os resultados indicaram que todos os participantes com sono adequado foram classificados como hiperesquemáticos, enquanto 67% dos que apresentaram sono inadequado foram classificados como hipoesquemáticos. Além disso, indivíduos com sono inadequado mostraram uma distribuição equilibrada entre sintomas motores e sensitivos, enquanto aqueles com sono adequado relataram predominantemente sintomas sensitivos. A fadiga foi um sintoma relevante em 67% dos indivíduos com sono inadequado. Esses achados sugerem que a qualidade do sono pode estar associada à percepção corporal e à manifestação dos sintomas na EMRR, destacando a importância de intervenções que melhorem o sono para o manejo dessa condição.",

Pathological laughter occurs when laughter is inappropriate, unrestrained (forced), uncontrollable, or dissociated from any stimulus. Pathological laughter is found in three main conditions: a) pseudobulbar palsy; b) gelastic epilepsy; and c) psychiatric illnesses. It is also found in other pathological conditions.

The term is misleading, for it suggests that this diathesis is confined solely to the mentally afflicted, and, further, its precise meaning is vague. A person is generally accused of possessing the neuro-insane diathesis if he presents a temperament which appreciably diverges from the mean of the sanguine and of the phlegmatic; if his actions are unduly strenuous or torpid, his expressions unwarrantably enthusiastic or lukewarm, his moods very variable or religiously constant; in brief, the neuro-insane diathesis may be resolved into a tendency to psychic or motor reaction disproportionate to the exciting stimulus. In common speech the person is emotional. But every person who is emotional is not an incipient lunatic. The faculty of conceiving undue enthusiasm, of persevering unfalteringly in ambition, in order to attain the acme of success in any sphere of life, demands an emotional power in excess of the normal. It is ridiculous thus to brand the best men of all nations as possessors of the neuro-insane diathesis. The term, with its plausible air of scientific accusation, is misleading and vague, and should be wholly discarded. All that psychiatrists wish to convey by it may be more accurately and more descriptively called the emotional diathesis.",

Stressors range from minor to major, and can be positive or negative events. Generally stressors are life events, such as daily annoyances, pressures at home or on the job, marital discord and conflicts, emergencies, motor vehicle accidents, illness, and injury. Positive stressful life events and transitions include birth of a newborn, graduation ceremony, a family vacation, or a job promotion (Kaplan &amp; Sadock, 1998).",

      "title": "The Problem of &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Functional&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;",
      "abstract": "Functional neurological disorder is an entity that is commonly referred to by names such as psychogenic or conversion disorder [1]. It is defined as a neurological disorder caused by psychological factors, falling into the category of somatic symptom disorders in the most recent version of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-V). Some well-known examples of somatic symptom disorders involving other organ systems include irritable bowel syndrome, interstitial cystitis, and chronic pelvic pain [2].\r\n\r\nPatients with functional disorders are seen in various clinical settings and are commonly admitted as an inpatient for further work-up and symptom management [3]. Those with neurological symptoms in particular may receive work-up beyond the scope of being thorough, as their symptoms can be concerning for neurological disorders such as stroke, epilepsy or multiple sclerosis. Physicians may ultimately become convinced that these patients’ symptoms are due to a psychological cause, but convincing these patients may not be easy, as the suffering is real but the treatment is not instantaneous.\r\n\r\nAs a movement disorders clinical fellow, I often see patients with functional movement disorders. Functional movement disorders can present in various ways such as tremor, myoclonus, or dystonia, but share common clinical features on examination such as variability, distractibility and entrainibility of the movements [4]. Although the term psychogenic is considered to be less ambiguous than functional, its negative nuance may add to the patients’ struggle to accept the diagnosis. Some common reactions are: “Are you saying it is all in my head?” “I find it hard to believe that what I am experiencing is just from stress.” “…but I don’t feel stressed.”\r\n\r\nThrough my fellowship, I have tried different ways of delivering the diagnosis of a functional movement disorder. My strategy has evolved with experience, a mix of successful and unsuccessful situations. For example, the patient might seem to be initially receptive of the diagnosis and considering the recommended treatment options with a positive attitude. When this appeared to be the case, I would feel not only relieved, but also a sense of triumph-I had successfully dealt with a challenging situation, and now surely the patient would be on the road to recovery! I quickly realized that this was not always the case. In the following days, I would receive emails doubting or misinterpreting the diagnosis that seemed to be clear at the time. Some patients seemed unhappy, if not angry or disappointed. I would often review the approach that I had used to deliver the diagnosis on the day of the visit, and try to revise my strategy accordingly, hoping to be more successful the next time.\r\n\r\nSeveral reasons may underlie this difficulty of accepting the diagnosis of a functional disorder. Currently, the knowledge on the physiology of the disorder is limited, and we cannot satisfactorily explain to these patients exactly how this occurs, which may add to the patient’s skepticism towards the diagnosis. The variability of symptoms, a common feature of the disorder itself, may confuse and deceive the patients, leaving them to wonder what rare organic neurological disorder they might have as the cause. Last but not least, patients may be influenced by the stigma of having any disorder that has relation to psychological factors, and even misinterpret the diagnosis as malingering, an intentional production of symptoms.\r\n\r\nBut do we physicians also have difficulty embracing the diagnosis of a functional disorder? Some patients are seen by several physicians and undergo extensive testing until seen by someone who might finally share the diagnosis. It is not unusual that this can be years later since the beginning of symptoms. Delivering the diagnosis is certainly challenging for reasons mentioned above, and physicians fear missing an organic neurological disorder. However, simply labeling these patients as having ‘medically unexplained symptoms’ not only leads to increased healthcare cost [5], but can result in increased morbidity and mortality from unnecessary diagnostic workup or treatment.\r\n\r\n“How can you tell me it’s functional when I am not functional?” The words of a patient echo through my head as I share this diagnosis with yet another patient. I only hope to be able to help my patients so that they understand that the diagnosis was achieved through identifying positive signs and symptoms, and that it is not merely a diagnosis of exclusion. I try to reassure them that this disorder is very much real, involuntary and acknowledge that it can be very disabling. Some patients have accepted the diagnosis and made a substantial recovery through cognitive behavioral therapy. Hopefully, with more knowledge on the physiology, increased awareness of the disorder in both patients and the medical community and better strategies of sharing the diagnosis functional can one day become truly functional.",

      "title": "Opposite-Gender Identity States in Dissociative Identity Disorder: Psychodynamic Insights into a Subset of Same-Sex Behavior and Attractions",
      "abstract": "Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID) is a psychological condition wherein the individual experiences (1) the presence of two or more distinct identities or personality states (each with its own relatively enduring pattern of perceiving, relating to, and thinking about the environment and self), of which (2) at least two of these identities or personality states recurrently take control of the person's behavior, resulting in (3) an inability to recall important personal information that is too extensive to be explained by ordinary forgetfulness and is (4) not explained by substance abuse or a general medical condition (American Psychiatric Association, 1994; International Society for the Study of Trauma and Dissociation, ISSTD, 2011). Generally, DID is considered a trauma-driven disorder, presumably originating out of recurrent abuse commencing in early childhood. While subjectively compelling for the patient, these alternate identities are not separate persons but rather enactments of trauma related intrapsychic conflict, memories, and affects (ISSTD, 2011).Child, persecutor, and protector identity states are often exhibited by DID sufferers. A less well noted but relatively common alternate identity for these patients is one that takes the form of the opposite-gender (e.g., a male identity state in a biologically female patient). Early accounts in the literature suggested that approximately 5066% of DID patients have at least one oppositegender identity (MacGregor, 1996; Putnam, 1989; Ross, 1989)· Putnam indicated that child, adolescent, or adult male personality states are found in about 50% of female patients and approximately two-thirds of male patients present with a female alternate identity. Ross found that 62.6% of a sample of 236 DID cases evidenced a dissociated identity of the opposite gender.Early in the heyday of DID, ego-state theorists John and Helen Watkins were observing opposite gender ego states and suggesting that sexual identity needed to be studied from an ego-state perspective (Watkins & Watkins, 1982). They reported that opposite gendered ego states seemed to be organized around the stereotypes of maleness or femaleness. More recently, Howell (2002) has speculated that much of gendered behavior, and especially its pathological extremes, derives from trauma and that specifically gendered self-states are created by trauma. While opposite-gender identity states may be highly stereotypical, the outward presentation of the DID patient is often more unisex, which allows for opposite-gender identities to emerge without creating confrontations or awkward situations in their interpersonal world (MacGregor, 1996).Although the early literature in this area seemed to affirm the scientific legitimacy of studying the potential relationship between opposite-gender identities and sexual orientation, the subsequent evolution in the social and professional cultures as regards homosexuality appears to have brought such inquiry to a halt. I believe that the subject still indeed has merit, but certainly it is complex, controversial, and ultimately beyond the scope of this paper. Instead, using composite case material, I intend to focus more pragmatically on the manifestation of same-sex behavior and attractions in DID patients that arise from the activity of opposite-gender identities. By reviewing the psychodynamics of this phenomena, I think important insights can be gained for the therapeutic care of DID patients as well as a subset of adult victims of childhood trauma who report same-sex attractions and behavior.Case MaterialGina was a 27-year-old single Christian woman who had been referred for psychotherapy by the church where she had been helping in college ministry. Her referral was precipitated by the discovery that she had engaged in homosexual behavior with another woman whom she had met during a community-wide church event. Though historically depressed and emotionally over controlled, this impulsive act so startled Gina that she readily consented to treatment. …",

      "abstract": "Depression is a highly prevalent disorder of affect characterized by persistent sadness or anhedonia (an inability to experience pleasure), typically accompanied by additional symptoms such as negative cognitions (self-perceptions of failure, feelings of guilt, and/or suicidal thoughts), somatic dysfunction (fatigue, loss of appetite, fatigue, disturbances in sleep), and impairment in daily functioning (e.g., indecisiveness) (Gelfand & Teti, 1990).When such a symptom pattern persists for at least two consecutive weeks and is not accompanied by period manic swings, the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM-IV-TR; American Psychiatric Association, 2000) identifies it as a major depressive episode (MDD).A formal DSM-IV-TR diagnosis of MDD can be given for a single major depressive episode, or for multiple, recurring episodes over time, which is common.Other depressive disorders identified in DSM-IV-TR include dysthymic disorder, and adjustment disorder with depressed mood.Depression is more likely to occur under adverse circumstances, such as poverty, single parenthood (Gallagher, Hobfoll, Ritter, Lavin, 1997;Grant, Jack, Fitzpatrick, & Ernst, 2011), and chronic illness (Davidson, Echeverry, Katon, Lin, & Von Korff, 2011), and it may also be co-morbid with other psychiatric disorders.It is common to find, for example, that depression co-occurs with anxiety (Balta, & Paparrigopoulos, 2010) and that chronic depression is a salient feature of some personality disorders (Brieger, Ehrt, Bloeink, & Marneros, 2002).Because of the ubiquity of depressed mood as a feature of psychiatric, medical, and psychosocial conditions, researchers frequently focus on the severity and chronicity of depressive symptoms as a predictor of behavior in different contexts, using well-established, validated questionnaires that tap directly into participants' level of sadness, anhedonia, negative dysfunctional cognitions, somatic complaints, and impairments in daily living.Such measures include the Beck Depression Inventory (Beck, Steer, & Garbin, 1988), the Center for Epidemiological Studies -Depression scale (Radloff, 1977), and the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (Hamilton, 1960).These assessments tap the frequency and severity of depressive symptoms and provide overall scores and cut points that, when exceeded, identify individuals with clinical levels of symptom severity.www.intechopen.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Blunt injuries are caused by mechanical force resulting in damage to the affected tissues mainly due to compression, traction, torsion, and shear stresses. The impact is induced either by a moving blunt object hitting the body or the victim's movement against an obstacle having a hard surface. In forensic practice, injuries from blunt force are often seen after criminal assaults where they may be inflicted, for instance, by fist blows or kicking. They not only occur in physical child abuse and other kinds of domestic violence, in traffic, sports, and industrial accidents but also in falls brought about by the victims themselves for various reasons (e.g., in drunken, infirm, or sick persons or in suicides jumping from a height). On skin, blunt traumatization produces abrasions, contusions (bruises), and lacerations. In some cases, a patterned configuration helps to determine characteristic features of the causative instrument. Within the body, blunt traumatization may be followed by bone fractures and laceration/rupture of vessels and organs with concomitant blood loss and potential failure of vital functions. The article shortly describes and illustrates the most important manifestations of blunt force injuries (including head trauma) under reconstructive aspects and from the medicolegal point of view.",

Literally the term disease means a state of dis-ease (dis = negation or lack of, ease = ease— therefore a state of lacking ease or of un-ease). Many states of discomfort, such as grief, reactive depression, or anxiety, only qualify as a disease if they exceed normal limits. The concept of “normality” and “abnormality”: The concept of disease and its diagnosis rests on the assumption that human beings exist in definable states of health or disease, but health and disease exist in a continuum. No strict dichotomy separates them, particularly in regard to mental illness. Some unusual, often creative people, like the mathematician Paul Erdös (Hoffman, 1998), defy a simple normal/abnormal dichotomy. Nevertheless, we can assume that a standard healthy “normal” or “average” person exists, normal in mind and body, to the degree that we could enshrine the person in the Bureau of Standards in Washington, D.C., along with the standard meter bar and standard kilogram. By matching the findings in a given patient against normal persons of like age, race, sex, and culture, physicians recognize abnormal states of body and mind that constitute disease.",

The stress response is adaptive, to begin with, that prepares the body to handle the challenges presented by an internal or external environmental challenge (stressor) e.g., the body's physiologic responses to trauma and invasive surgery serve to attenuate further tissue damage. But if the exposure to a stressor is actually or perceived as intense, repetitive (repeated acute stress), or prolonged (chronic stress), the stress response becomes maladaptive and detrimental to physiology e.g., exposure to chronic stressors can cause maladaptive reactions including depression, anxiety, cognitive impairment, and heart disease.",

      "abstract": "The death of a loved one is a universal experience, and marker of the human condition. Grief, the cognitive, emotional, and behavioral responses to bereavement, is both a ubiquitous and a unique psychological process. Thus, health providers often find themselves in a dilemma, caught between the need to alleviate an individual's distress and impairment, and the danger of overly \"pathologizing\" their grief reaction. This chapter reviews how acute grief reactions generally evolve over time, the clinical presentation of complicated grief, and finally, other psychiatric disorders that might develop or be precipitated in the aftermath of the death of a loved one, particularly prolonged grief disorder.",

      "abstract": "Many studies of social anxiety disorder (SAD) have been conducted because diagnostic criteria are defined as social phobia in DSM-III in the West. In Japan, several studies have examined pathological conditions similar to SAD, known as taijin-kyofu (TK). This highly remarkable disorder involves a convincing fear of giving another person discomfort from one's physical faults (e.g. feeling that neighboring people detect an unpleasant smell from one's body, \"jikoshu-kyofu\", or feeling that neighboring people feel unpleasant because of one's appearance,\"shukei-kyofu\") termed \"convinced subtype of TK\" (c-TK; also known as offensive subtype of TK). In DSM-5, the definitions of feeling rejection and offense of others are added to a fear of humiliating or embarrassing oneself. Moreover, TK is a sufficient criterion for SAD. However, it is confusing that body dysmorphic disorder is not in category of somatoform disorders but in that of obsessive-compulsive disorder and related disorders and that the Japanese terms of \"jikoshu-kyofu\" and \"shubo-kyofu\" are categorized as other specified obsessive-compulsive disorder and related disorders. The efficacy and tolerability of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) for the treatment of SAD has been reported in many controlled studies. Recently, SSRIs are regarded as first line pharmacotherapy for SAD. Cognitive behavioral therapy is also effective for SAD treatment. High rates of co-occurring SAD and other psychiatric disorders can be found in clinical samples and in the general population. Additional research must be conducted for these patients and for the management of treatment-refractory SAD patients.",

In a normal state of consciousness, the brain seamlessly integrates sensory perceptions, emotional states, current thoughts, and past memories. The essential feature of the various dissociative disorders is that these elements have become disrupted, dissociated, from each other. The distinctions between the different types of dissociative disorders are based on which particular aspect of subjective experience has become dissociated from the others. Dissociative amnesia is characterized by dissociation of memory. The affected individual demonstrates an inability to recall important biographical information, usually of a traumatic or stressful nature. The memory deficit is too extensive to be explained by ordinary forget-fulness. Dissociative fugue is characterized by an even greater dissociation of memory, such that the individual dissociates not only key historical information but also his own sense of identity. Affected individuals may engage in sudden, unexpected travel away from their homes or customary places of work, accompanied by an inability to recall their past, confusion about their personal identity, or the assumption of a new identity.",

      "abstract": "Serious physical illness naturally leads to emotional disturbance, particularly when the illness is disabling or life-threatening, so it is not surprising that stroke is associated with mood disorder, manifested as an increase either in general levels of distress or in the rate of clinically diagnosable states. In recent years, considerable interest has been expressed in the idea that there is more to it than that; that in fact affective disorder-and more specifically depressive disorder-is a specific complication of stroke. The quasi-diagnostic use of the term poststroke depression tends to reinforce belief in this notion of depression associated with stroke as being something special. If depression is indeed a specific complication of stroke, then we should expect to find evidence in one of three spheres. First, perhaps the basic clinical phenomena are different in stroke: there may be specific depressive syndromes not found in other physical disorders, on the rates of depressive disorder may be higher than those found in other illnesses of equivalent severity, or the natural history may be different for any depressive disorder that does exist. Second, whatever the appearance of depression may be, its etiology may be different in stroke. And third, it may be that depression associated with stroke has different characteristics in response to treatment that suggest it is not like depression associated with other physical illnesses.

      "abstract": "The disruption of psychosocial functioning (PSF) is currently listed as one of the DSM IV diagnostic criteria for schizophrenia and PSF is increasingly recognized as an important determinant of successful treatment of the disease. Many factors influence patients psychosocial functioning; they can be grouped into illness related factors, context related factors and factors related to individual resources. Among illness related factors, negative symptoms and cognitive impairment are the most largely investigated domains. Evidence has been provided that negative symptoms are related to a poor psychosocial outcome; however, whether negative symptoms contribute to patients disability or represent its consequence is an open issue. Moreover, the study of relationships between negative symptoms and psychosocial functioning is further complicated by the overlap between the two domains in several assessment instruments and by the definition of negative symptoms as a unitary construct. Cognitive impairment has also been reported in association with poor psychosocial functioning. It is debated whether a global impairment in cognition is relevant to poor functioning in the real life, or deficit of specific cognitive domains (including social cognition) play the most important role, or whether specific cognitive deficits are actually responsible for the impairment of specific aspect of psychosocial functioning. The need for future treatments to target negative symptoms and cognitive impairment for their direct and indirect impact on psychosocial functioning will be highlighted.",

      "title": "Suffering and the Dying Patient",
      "abstract": "SUMMARYSuffering in the dying patient derives from immediate sources of physical distress, perceived threats to the integrity of the self, and the psychological make up (memory, beliefs, expectations) of the individual at the end of life. The most common causes of somatic distress in dying patients with cancer are: (1) pain, (2) shortness of breath, and (3) nausea and/or vomiting. Other noteworthy problems include confusion, restlessness, itch, disturbed bladder and bowel function, sleep disruption, low energy, sedation and cachexia. Specific physiological mechanisms foster suffering in dying persons. These include tissue trauma, visceral distention and cardiovascular events. Neurological signals generated by tissue trauma or sensitization during inflammation lead to sensations of pain and also produce emotional arousal in noradrenergically innervated limbic brain structures. In addition, such signals stimulate the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenocortical axis. This creates a stress response which, if prolonged, disturbs circadian and ultracadian biological rhythms. One can direct preventative and palliative interventions toward such mechanisms. Patients also suffer because of unmet psychological needs or psychosocial problems. Identifying such needs or problems and addressing them can often contribute substantially to patient comfort. Since we have the resources to prevent or largely alleviate pain and other distressing conditions in the majority of cases, and care providers can meet most patients' psychological needs once they identify them, unaddressed suffering need not accompany death from cancer or other prolonged disease.",

      "abstract": "Unlike acute pain that warns us of injury or disease, chronic or persistent pain serves no adaptive purpose. Though there is no agreed on definition of chronic pain, it is commonly referred to as pain that is without biological value, lasting longer than the typical healing time, not responsive to treatments based on specific remedies, and of a duration greater than 6 months. Chronic pain that is severe and intractable has detrimental consequences, including psychological distress, job loss, social isolation, and, not surprisingly, it is highly comorbid with depression and anxiety. Historically, pain without an apparent anatomical or neurophysiological origin was labelled as psychopathological. This approach is damaging to the patient and provider alike. It pollutes the therapeutic relationship by introducing an element of mutual distrust as well as implicit, if not explicit, blame. It is demoralizing to the patient who feels at fault, disbelieved, and alone. Moreover, many medically unexplained pains are now understood to involve an interplay between peripheral and central neurophysiological mechanisms that have gone awry. The new Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, somatic symptom disorder overpsychologizes people with chronic pain; it has low sensitivity and specificity, and it contributes to misdiagnosis, as well as unnecessary stigma. Adjustment disorder remains the most appropriate, accurate, and acceptable diagnosis for people who are overly concerned about their pain.",

The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental disorders, 4th edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV- TR; American Psychiatric Association [APA], 2000) specifically defines trauma as direct personal experiences of an event that involves actual or threatened death or serious injury, or other threat to one's physical integrity of another person; or learning about unexpected or violent death, serious harm, or threat of death or injury experienced by a family member or other close associate. The person's response to the event must involve intense fear, helplessness, or horror (or in children, the response must involve disorganized or agitated behavior). Trauma can also be defined as the experience of survivor. Two people could face the same noxious situation and one person might be traumatized and the other person remains relatively unscathed. DSM-IV-TR provide a list of potentially traumatic events including combat, sexual and physical assault, robbery, being kidnapped, being taken hostage, terrorist attacks, torture, disasters, severe automobile accidents, and life threatening illnesses, as well as witnessing death or serious injury by violent assault, accidents, wars or disaster. Holbrook ,Hoyt, Setin, Sieber (2002) in their study of gender differences in long-term Post Traumatic Stress Disorder outcomes after major trauma found that women were at higher at higher risk of higher risk of prolonged Post Traumatic Stress Disorder onset which was associated with reduced quality oflife markedly worse quality ofwell-being outcomes. The psychological effects caused by trauma are likely to be more severe if the trauma is human caused, repeated, unpredictable, multifaceted, sadistic, undergone in childhood and perpetrated by caregiver (Wortman, Battle, & Lemkau, 1997). Nightmares, insomnia, somatic disturbances, difficulty with intimate relationships, fear, anxiety, anger, shame, aggression, suicidal behaviors, loss of trust and isolation are the symptoms commonly seen after trauma (Allen, 1995). Tedeschi and Calhoun (1996) developed 21-item scale including factors new possibilities, relating to others, personal strength, spiritual change and appreciation oflife found that women tend to report more benefits than do men. Sears, Stanton, Danoff and Sharon (2003) found distinct significant predictors and outcomes of benefit finding, positive reappraisal coping and Post Traumatic Growth from a longitudinal study of women having breast cancer.The neuroscience of trauma reveals that trauma actually changes the structure and function of the brain, at the point where the frontal cortex, the limbic system and the brain stem converge. The two factors that facilitate Post Traumatic Growth are the cognitive processing and disclosure (Tedeschi & Calhoun, 1998). It is also suggested that Post Traumatic Growth mutually interacts with life wisdom, and the development of the life narrative, and that it is an ongoing process, not a static outcome. The review also revealed inconsistent associations between adversarial growths, socio-demo graphic variable and psychological distress. Ickovics, Meade, Kershaw, Milan, Lewis and Ethier ( 2006) studied traumatic events, Post Traumatic Growth and emotional distress over eighteen months among urban adolescent girls and found post traumatic growth was associated with subsequent reduction in short and long term emotional distress. Women are the marginalized group of the society, especially in Indian context women are always protected and are considered safe at home. They live in guarded environment from childhood to marriage. Certain circumstances after marriage leave them exposed to world, making them vulnerable to all kind of situations. They face the trauma, they live with traumatic experiences and they survive after trauma. …",

      "title": "Abuse and Maltreatment: Their Effect on Headache",
      "abstract": "Research has shown that sexual, physical, and especially emotional abuse create a predisposition to headache. Individuals with migraine may have experienced abuse in early life. Childhood maltreatment is associated with an earlier onset of migraine and a tendency for episodic migraine eventually to become chronic. How Would You Define Abuse? Physical abuse includes slapping, hitting, kicking, striking, pinching or pushing another. Emotional abuse includes neglect, threats, harassment, controlling behavior, attempts to isolate, and bullying. Sexual abuse is any nonconsensual sexual activity. For children and adolescents, it also includes any sexual activity with an older individual, whether consensual or not. Tell your Physician About Your Abuse In assessing your health concerns and planning your course of care, it is beneficial for your health-care provider to know if you are currently being abused, feel in danger of being abused, or have been abused in the distant past. If the topic of abuse is not openly addressed, the consequences can include failure of medical treatment and a continued cycle of abuse and poor physical and emotional health. Is the History of Abuse Important Even if it Occurred as a Child? As it may be linked to many medical and psychological problems, early abuse is indeed important. Significant stress occurring early in life may lead to an exaggerated response to stress later in life. For some, stress is the most important trigger for migraine. Migraine may also be aggravated by the depression and anxiety that so often follow abuse. What If I Am Currently Being Abused? Your health-care providers can guide you to resources offering psychological support and, when needed, personal safety. A sampling of the resources available is listed in the following. If you are currently in danger, ask for help. Place these calls from a phone where you will safe from your abuser. If your children are being abused, inform your health-care team so that this can be reported to the authorities. How Can I Best Deal With My Abuse? If you attempt to “forget” about prior abuse or deny that it ever happened, you are not dealing with the problem, but rather ignoring it. Talking to a counselor, speaking to an abuse advocate, or calling an abuse hotline may help you deal cope more effectively. From a perspective of treating your headache, therapies that help with stress management may be beneficial. Are Resources Available?

By contrast, a pain which is chosen and controlled through personal discipline with the goal of pushing oneself to one’s limits (sport, body art, suspensions, getting a tattoo or a piercing, etc.) contains only a trifling element of suffering, even if it hurts. One merely has to accept a bearable level of discomfort. And the paradox is that, on occasion, recourse to pain is a means of combating suffering, as in the case of teenagers who self-harm.",

      "title": "An Evaluation of Psychobiologic Factors in the Re-Education Phase of the Kenny Treatment for Infantile Paralysis*",
      "abstract": "In addition to being studied as a function of the neuromuscular system, muscular activity should be studied also as a function of the total organism as embodied in the concept of the personality and its functions. “Mental alienation” is composed of a sensory factor (“loss of mental awareness”) and a motor factor (“mental alienation” in its narrower sense) and is therefore not one but two distinct though related symptoms. From the definitions and descriptions of “loss of mental awareness” and “mental alienation” given by Miss Kenny and her associates, it cannot be stated with certainty what roles structural, physiologic and psychobiologic changes play in their production. There are certain aspects of these symptoms which bear a resemblance to well recognized psychobiologic and psychopathologic reactions. “Loss of mental awareness” seems to correspond to psychosensory (proprioceptive) dissociation and “mental alienation” to psychomotor dissociation. Therefore it appears that these symptoms may be explained more satisfactorily on the basis of psychobiologic dissociation than on the basis of “physiologic block” as has been attempted by the group of physicians associated with Miss Kenny. “Muscular incoordination” also described by this group is a natural consequence of “loss of mental awareness” and “mental alienation” as well as of pain, spasm and actual paralysis and as such is one of several factors in the production of a series of personality adjustments which may stretch throughout the patient's active life. In the treatment of these symptoms Miss Kenny employs a number of well established psychotherapeutic principles. By means of the Kenny treatment it is to be expected that not only will the chronic physical crippling of infantile paralysis be curbed but that chronic changes in personality functioning also will be interrupted. Careful psychiatric study of case material will prove whether the above concept is essentially near the truth, and to what extent personality factors influence the elaboration and persistence of the symptoms “loss of mental awareness,” “mental alienation” and “muscular incoordination.” Once developed, these symptoms may in turn influence the personality functions of individuals to varying degrees. Finally, this syndrome comprising disturbances in the proprioceptive and motor functions of the personality is not peculiar to infantile paralysis. Rather, it appears to be the psychobiologic reaction to muscular immobilization due to any cause and has as its background not cellular pathology alone but the entire psychobiologic organization of the individual.",

      "abstract": "The delusional misidentification syndromes (DMS) are a group of disorders, characterized by patients mistaking the identity of people they know, although they recognize them physically. The term DMS is an umbrella term which may cover disorders whose definition extends to objects other than people, such as animals, places, or familiar material objects. The most common and best known DMS is Capgras syndrome. In this disorder, the misidentification leads to the delusional conviction that a close friend or relative has been replaced by an identical - or almost identical - \"double,\" whose original has disappeared. This double is an imposter without name or identity. Most often considered as a persecutor, the double may be subjected to aggression, which may be very violent. Neuropsychological hypotheses based on cerebral dysfunctions are now commonly considered to be at the origin of the disorder. They have been elaborated from achievements in the neurosciences, particularly the facial recognition models. In return, knowledge about the normal cognitive processes involved in recognition and familiarity has benefited from the work that cognitive neuropsychiatry has invested in these disorders. The DMS are observed in various contexts of morbidity: primary psychiatric diagnosis, or secondary to various organic disorders, particularly in neurodegenerative disease; they are rarely met in isolated form. Most often, they develop in line with the associated pathology. In the absence of consensual clinical description, the epidemiology of DMS is uncertain; they may be more frequent than previously supposed. There is no specific treatment for these disorders; neuroleptics are generally used in association with treatment of the concomitant disorder. The frequent association of DMS with organic disorders which may be curable and the particularly dangerous profile of these patients are factors that underline the need for better screening.",

      "abstract": "Abstract A disease is a distinct abnormal state that significantly affects the functioning of all or part of an individual and is not caused by external harm. Diseases are frequently understood to be medical conditions that are connected with distinct indications and symptoms. According to a fairly wide categorization, diseases can also be categorised as follows –mental disorders, deficient diseases, genetic diseases, degenerative diseases, self-inflicted diseases, infectious diseases, non- infectious diseases, social diseases, physical diseases. Prevention of the diseases are of multiple instances. Primary prevention seeks to prevent illness or harm before it ever happens. Secondary prevention tries to lessen the effect of an illness or damage that has already happened. This is done through diagnosing and treating illness or injury as soon as feasible to stop or delay its course, supporting personal ways to avoid recurrence or reinjury, and implementing programmes to restore individuals to their previous health and function to prevent long-term difficulties. Tertiary prevention tries to lessen the impact of a continuing sickness or injury that has enduring repercussions. Diagnosis of the disease at the earlier stage is important for the treatment of the disease. Hence here in this study deep learnming algorithms such as VGG16, EfficientNetB4, ResNet, etc.., are utilized to diagnose various diseases such as Alzheimer, Brain tumors, Skin diseases, lung diseases, etc..,.Chest X-Rays, MRI scans, CT scans, skin lesions are used for the diagnosis of the mentioned diseases.

      "abstract": "The essential feature of functional somatic syndromes is the presence of symptoms without medical explanation. the syndromes have a high psychiatric co-morbidity, and stress and anxiety are assumed to play a role, at least in the maintenance of the complaints. Psychophysiological models traditionally attribute the symptoms to stress or anxiety-related disregulations in specific physiological mechanisms. In fact, however, there is no convincing empirical proof for such models. The idea of a direct coupling between self-reported symptoms and corresponding physiological disregulations thus seems hardly tenable. Therefore, we propose a reformulation of the potential role of stress physiology in diagnosing functional somatic symptoms. Physiological measures should not be used anymore to demonstrate explanatory physiological disregulations. They should instead be used to provide additional information about the state of activity of the central fear network . This alternative approach is based on the fact that self-reported and physiological manifestations of an emotional state are only loosely coupled, making both aspects complementary indicators of the brain activity involved. Physiological measures may thus provide additional information (above self-report) regarding emotional states implicated in functional complaints. A suggested application of this approach is to define sub-groups of functional somatic patients on the basis of similarities in disregulated physiological stress-response profiles. This in future may contribute to the development of more specific diagnostic tools and better tailored treatments.",

The phenomenon of becoming ill on weekends and/or during vacation has been termed \"leisure sickness\". Attempts to understand this problem can be found in the current literature. Vacation for the wrong motivations or a mismatch between leisure activity and personality are some of the reasons. Other reports show associations between similar health-affecting patterns and personality traits or increased stress, but these factors have not been directly linked to leisure sickness before. Indeed, leisure sickness is not a specific defined illness yet but is more an accumulation of different symptoms that lead to indisposition. If leisure sickness is not only a phenomenon but is actually a real illness, it is seriously preventing people from the benefits of leisure time on the one hand and directly affects vacation experience with respect to destination, hotel and other tourism products on the other hand. Therefore, leisure sickness deserves further investigation.",

      "abstract": "Delusional misidentification syndrome (DMS) is an umbrella term for syndromes of intermetamorphosis, Fregoli, and Capgras. DMS) is thought to be related to dissociation between recognition and identification processes. DMS was described for the first time in 1932 as a variant of the Capgras syndrome and is currently on the DSM-V list of diseases as an independent disease entity. Patients affected by DMS believed that people around them, most often family, have changed physically (appearance) and mentally (character). Other symptoms include confabulation, derealization or depersonalization. In patients, aggressive behavior is often observed, aimed at alleged doppelgangers resulting from the sense of being cheated and manipulated. With the intermetamorphosis syndrome, for example, schizophrenia, depression, bipolar disorder or other misidentification syndromes (Fregoli's, Capgras) may coexist. There is also a reverse intermetamorphosis, where the object of the changed appearance or character becomes the patient himself. One of its forms may be lycanthropy. The etiology of the intermetamorphosis has not been fully understood, one of the reasons may be brain damage and changes in the parietal and/or temporal lobes of the right hemisphere. It may then damage long neuronal connections to the frontal areas of the brain, disturbances of working memory (WM) accountable for the keep and online management of data, so that it is available for further processing, and the patient's will be uncritical. The basic method of diagnosis of this delusion is a medical interview with the patient. Other diagnostic methods include computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, EEG and ERPs. Experimental methods include searching for the neuromarker of DMS. Currently, there are no treatment guidelines of this delusional disorder, and pharmacotherapy experimental, but the drugs from the group of neuroleptics and lithium seem effective. Some hope for the treatment is created by neurotherapy, but it is also experimental.",

      "title": "Management of intimate partner abuse",
      "abstract": "Opening Vignette Sarah visited your clinic with her boyfriend for a cough and runny nose. During auscultation, you noticed a few bruises in the shape of a hand and of different ages on her chest, stomach and upper arm. She also appeared timid and avoided any eye contact with you. You asked her about the bruises, and her boyfriend replied that she was careless and fell frequently.WHAT IS INTIMATE PARTNER ABUSE? Intimate partner abuse is when an intimate partner inflicts violent, threatening or controlling behaviour. An intimate partner could be a current or former spouse, or a non-spouse (e.g. boyfriend, girlfriend or dating partner). Intimate partner abuse is broadly categorised into physical, sexual, emotional-psychological, economical, wrongful confinement or social isolation. It can result in direct injuries such as physical injuries and pain, or indirect injuries such as mental disorders, e.g., posttraumatic stress disorder, major depressive disorders, generalised anxiety disorder and decline in functional or cognitive ability, low self-esteem or poor self-care.[1] Intimate partner abuse is the most common form of domestic violence in Singapore. Abuse tends to recur in a repetitive escalating pattern, with many victims not seeking help until much later, if at all. A local survey found that only 23.4% of victims reported a recent abuse incident to the police.[2] Primary care practitioners are often the first point of contact, as victims may present with related injuries or for unrelated medical consultations. They can present for reasons such as acute respiratory infections, chronic disease management or routine health screenings. With a high index of suspicion, physicians can seize these opportunities to detect such cases and enable early intervention before serious injuries or death occurs. WHAT ARE THE RISK FACTORS FOR ABUSE? Individual factors: The perpetrator has a history of substance abuse or interpersonal violence and certain personality traits or psychopathology, such as hostility, jealousy, a suspicious nature, anger-management issues, low self-esteem, high emotional dependency and feeling of depression. He/she may also experience social isolation and have a history of exposure to abuse or a belief in strict gender roles. Relationship factors: These include relationship styles that may contribute to poor communication, conflict-management and problem-solving skills, or the need for power and control. The perpetrator may also have experienced socialisation issues in childhood or a culture of dominance and control by one partner over the other, recent separation between partners, and unhealthy family relationships and interactions. Community factors: These include job loss, economic stress, poverty and its associated issues (e.g., overcrowded housing), and low social capital. Safe management measures imposed during the pandemic may exacerbate the tension between partners in a confined living arrangement. Societal factors: The perpetrator may have patriarchal values, with views that men hold power and dominate in rigid gender roles against women — including men having control over decision-making and limitations to women's independence in public and private life. WHAT ARE THE SIGNS SUGGESTIVE OF ABUSE? Clinicians may suspect possible abuse based on history taking, clinical signs or non-verbal cues. During history taking, if the history given is vague and inconsistent, where explanation for injuries is inadequate or does not match the physical findings, this may be cause for concern. Other hints include a clinical visit that does not address any obvious injuries or significant delays in seeking treatment from the time of injury, or where the patients continually minimise their symptoms. General observations of poor hygiene or malnutrition with decreasing body mass index may also raise red flags. The patient may attempt to hide the injuries with long sleeves, makeup, or cover the neck with hair. During physical examination, suggestive clinical signs include injuries located in unusual areas such as the back, buttocks or ears, patterned injuries such as from a belt or cigarette butts, injuries in multiple areas or multiple injuries of various ages. The patient may give irrelevant answers and excuses for injuries or check in with his/her partner before responding. In addition, non-verbal cues such as the patient being overly submissive or afraid, especially in the presence of the spouse or partner, or a lack of eye contact and avoidance of the spouse or partner are tell-tale signs. The reactions of the spouse or partner, if present, may also give clues. These include the spouse or partner showing incongruent reactions, downplaying or dismissing the symptoms, disallowing the patient to answer questions, or attempting to end the consult prematurely. HOW DO I ELICIT MORE INFORMATION? As patients may not offer abuse as their first presenting complaint, a high index of suspicion is needed. Victims may also minimise or deny their symptoms of abuse. To elicit more information, it is essential to establish a conducive environment for the patient to confide and trust in the doctor. This includes ensuring that the presence of a third party does not interfere with history taking and assessment, and asking the third party to step out if necessary. Direct and sensitive questions can aid in identification of abuse. For instance, physicians may start with a general statement, \"No matter how well people may get along, there are times when they disagree or get annoyed by the other person, or just have spats or fights because they are tired or in a bad mood.\" This can be followed by more detailed questions on whether the spouse or partner has done any of the following: (a) did or said something to spite the patient; (b) threatened to hit or throw something at the patient; (c) threw or smashed something at the patient; (d) pushed, grabbed, slapped, hit, kicked or shoved the patient; (e) threatened to hit other family members of the patient; (f) interacted with the patient in a way that makes him/her live in constant fear; (g) threatened the patient with a weapon; and (h) prevented the patient from contacting his/her extended family, relatives or friends. Screening tools that may be useful include the HITS (Hurt, Insult, Threaten and Scream) questionnaire (consists of only four questions), the Abuse Assessment Screen and the computer-based intimate partner violence questionnaire. Further information on screening tools can be obtained from the recommended readings. Inquiring about the presence of psychiatric illness in the spouse or intimate partner could be considered, as it is a potential risk factor and could have implications on the management of the patient. Special care should be taken when gathering information about suspected abuse. A balance should be struck with the amount of information gathered about the alleged abuse, bearing in mind that each time the patient talks about the alleged abuse, it can be potentially traumatic. Dissociation (e.g. glazed eyes, looking away) is a sign of distress when talking about abuse. The general practitioner can engage the patient in grounding techniques to re-establish a sense of safety and to re-orientate the patient to the present reality. Grounding techniques may include getting the patient to focus on who he/she is and the current location, and asking the patient to name three things that he/she can see, hear or feel in the room. Having a listening ear can be an empowering experience for the patient. The general practitioner should give the patient space to tell his/her story while offering validation and reassurance. It is also important to communicate to the patient that he/she is not at fault. The physician can do so by saying that \"Violence is unacceptable\", but should avoid asking questions such as \"Why did this person hit you?\", or saying anything that may suggest that the patient can control the violence. Patients may also need immediate help to formulate a safety plan, including advanced preparation in case of escalating violence and the need to safely leave the abuser (e.g., list of emergency contact numbers, alternative accommodations, linkup to family social service centres, and advice on making police report and applying for legal protections). WHAT CAN I DO IN MY PRACTICE? Physicians are reminded that the duty of care is to the patients and not to the patients' intimate partners. The management of suspected abuse includes providing appropriate medical care, ensuring protection for the victim if there is a risk of imminent danger, notifying the appropriate authorities and informing the patient of avenues of assistance if needed. Firstly, appropriate medical care should be provided. This may include a referral to the emergency department if medically indicated. A lower threshold can also be applied for suspect cases to enable further investigations such as imaging. In such cases, physician should indicate non-accidental injury in the referral. Secondly, the suspected abuse has to be stopped and the physician can assist the patient to get the help needed to stop the violence. It is useful to understand how the existing legislation framework and protective and personal social services can support these patients. The Women's Charter, Penal Code, Children and Young Persons Act, Mental Capacity Act, Vulnerable Adult Act and Protection from Harassment Act have made provisions for definitions of abusive behaviour, chargeable offences, punishment and deterrence of the abusive behaviour, and provisions for protection of the victims. Protection of the victims come from the following: Personal Protection Order (PPO): This order is issued to the perpetrator and given to the victim to restrain the perpetrator from abusing the victim. If the perpetrator violates the order, he/she can be arrested by the police when the latter is called in. The perpetrator may be concurrently issued a Mandatory Counselling Order together with the PPO to require him/her to attend counselling. Domestic Exclusion Order (DEO): This order is issued to grant the victim exclusive occupation of the shared residence or a specific part of the shared residence to protect him/her from the perpetrator. Expedited Order (EO): If there is imminent danger of domestic violence against the victim at the time of application of PPO, the court can issue an EO to be served on the perpetrator. This is a temporary protection order granted in the absence of the perpetrator, pending the issuance of PPO. Counselling Order, Mandatory Assessment and Treatment Orders: These orders are usually issued to perpetrators to mandate them to receive counselling and treatment. General practitioners should be acquainted with the family service centres (FSCs) in the neighbourhood so that victims of intimate partner abuse can be referred to these centres expeditiously. The FSC social workers can then handhold these patients in the application for these orders either at the court or at the nearest specialist family violence centre, where video linkup with the court for virtual application is available. The FSC can also assist to arrange for crisis shelters for patients who need them. Children in the affected families may also be victims or witnesses of abuse. These experiences can be traumatic for them and hence, it is important to encourage patients to receive assistance from the FSC, if not for themselves (particularly if they show reluctance), then for the sake of their children. Thirdly, medical practitioners are legally required under Section 424 of the Criminal Procedure Code to notify the police in the event of assessment of grievous hurt or high risk of imminent intimate partner violence that might lead to grievous hurt or death. To ensure the safety of the victim, it is recommended that the physician and social worker, in collaboration with the victim, should devise a safety plan to ensure ongoing support for the victim and other vulnerable persons in the family. Importantly, physicians will not be penalised for reporting cases that turn out not to be an abuse case, if there was reasonable suspicion for abuse. General practitioners practising within an institution can follow institutional guidelines for reporting. Otherwise, a police report can be made via the Police Report E-services portal at https://eservices.police.gov.sg/content/policehubhome/homepage/police-report.html. The following details should be clearly documented and included in the report: a description of the injuries sustained (written and/or pictorial description), the circumstances of the incident and the incident location. Finally, if the medical practitioner assesses a risk of potential abuse, but the patient turns down referrals for help, the patient may be discharged from medical follow-up. In such cases, the medical practitioner should still advise victims regarding the available avenues of assistance [Table 1], such as informing them that they can call the police at 999 or seek safe haven at any medical facility or FSC at any point in time, if they are at risk of immediate danger.Table 1: Avenues of assistance for victims of intimate partner abuse.WHAT IF I AM NOT SURE? If the medical practitioner is not certain whether the patient may be a victim of abuse, he/she should consult the National Anti-Violence 24/7 hotline at 1800 777 0000. RECOMMENDED READINGS 'Intimate partner violence: Diagnosis and screening' from UpToDate, by Weil A.[3] Intimate Partner Violence and Sexual Violence Victimization Assessment Instruments for Use in Healthcare Settings: Version 1 by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for Injury Prevention and Control.[4] TAKE HOME MESSAGES Primary care providers are one of the first touchpoints of potential abuse cases and can help in early detection and escalation for intervention in these cases. A high index of suspicion is necessary as patients may not offer abuse as the presenting complaint. There are various types of abuse — physical, sexual, emotional-psychological, economical, wrongful confinement or social isolation. Clinical signs suggestive of abuse include injuries that cannot be adequately explained, injuries located in unusual locations, patterned injuries and multiple injuries of various ages. Clinicians can look for non-verbal cues and ask appropriate questions to identify abuse cases. Screening tools that may be useful to identify abuse cases include the HITS questionnaire, the abuse assessment screen and the computer-based intimate partner violence questionnaire. Clinicians have a duty of care to their patients, and not to the patients' intimate partners. Primary care providers should provide patients with adequate medical care or refer them to further medical care. They need to ensure that unclear cases who are discharged are counselled on the avenues for help. Clinicians should know the FSCs in the neighbourhood and refer their patients to the FSCs, if necessary. Medical professionals will not be penalised for reporting cases that turn out not to be an abuse case if there was reasonable suspicion for abuse. Failing to do so is an offence under the Criminal Procedure Code. Clinicians should keep a clear and detailed documentation of the injuries sustained, the circumstances of the injuries and the incident location to aid in subsequent investigations. Closing Vignette You requested for the patient's boyfriend to step out for you to perform a physical examination and managed to obtain a more detailed history. You assessed that Sarah may be a victim of abuse, documented your findings from the physical examination and assessment, and proceeded to treat her injuries. There was no serious bodily harm, and she had already moved back to her parent's home. As there was no immediate danger to the patient's life and she had a safe place to stay, you decided to refer her to the nearby FSC instead of the police. In addition, you provided her with information on the National Anti-Violence Helpline and advised her to make a report of the abuse at the nearest police station.Financial support and sponsorship Nil.

      "title": "Social trauma : consequences of emotional maltreatment on physiological reactions to social rejection in subjects with social anxiety disorder",
      "abstract": "A history of child maltreatment is associated with psychopathology, predominantly affective and anxiety disorders as well as substance abuse. In the past, research has primarily focused on the consequences of physical abuse, sexual abuse, physical neglect or combinations of these types of maltreatment. However, besides physical and sexual transgressions, child maltreatment does also involve emotional abuse and emotional neglect. Although it was suggested that the consequences of emotional maltreatment might be as severe as the outcomes of physical or sexual maltreatment, there is little knowledge about the unique effects of emotional maltreatment on psychopathology. However, there is a growing body of evidence for an association of emotional maltreatment by caretakers and psychopathology, particularly social anxiety.\r\nIn addition to emotional maltreatment that involves abuse and neglect by parents and other caretakers, emotional abusive treatments (also referred to as emotional victimization) are highly prevalent among peers. Similar to emotional maltreatment by parents or caretakers, emotional peer victimization contributes to various forms of general psychopathology, e.g., depression, anger-hostility, dissociation, and drug use. However, peer victimization is particularly associated with characteristics of social anxiety disorder.\r\nSocial anxiety disorder (SAD) is a common anxiety disorder, which is characterized by persistent fear of social or performance situations, fear of negative evaluation, social avoidance of general and new situations, as well as physiological symptoms in social situations. However, the mechanisms that associate emotional maltreatment by caretakers as well as peers and social anxiety are still unknown. Models of cognitive vulnerability suggest that negative learning experiences establish associative information structures in memory that activate various stereotype and pathological behavioral programs in similar situations. This conceptualization predicts that social events may provoke more intense reactions in emotional maltreated subjects as such situations trigger associative response elements of social traumatic experiences. \r\nA key element of emotional maltreatment is social rejection. Experiences of social rejection elicit negative mood, emotional distress, and activity of neural networks that are associated with the processing of physical pain. However, because physiological reactions to social rejection were found to be ambiguous, there remains a need for clarification of the impact and direction of social rejection on other physiological measures such as heart rate and skin conductance. In socially anxious subjects, social rejection elicited immediate and delayed effects on psychological outcomes. Therefore both, physiological reactions in healthy subjects as well as increased psychological reactions in socially anxious subjects were suggested in previous studies. However, a combination of these, i.e., an investigation of physiological reactions in socially anxious subjects, was not presented, yet. This might be of specific interest, as fear of social rejection is one of the core components of social anxiety. Accordingly, socially anxious subjects should present stronger and prolonged physiological reactions to social rejection.\r\nHowever, there is so far minimal evidence that experiences of aversive social situations evoke an associative network and an activation of associative memory processing. The aim of the present work was to address this point and to explore the impact of prior emotional maltreatment on physiological reactions to social rejection. In addition, it was assumed that associative memory representations are potential links between maltreatment and social anxiety disorder. Thus, the effect of a history of emotional maltreatment on the experience of potential traumatic social events was expected to be even stronger for subjects with SAD.\r\nIn a first step, the association of emotional maltreatment with social anxiety was examined. Results indicate a relation of childhood maltreatment with psychopathology, and in particular, social anxiety symptoms. Moreover, it was demonstrated that the relative impact of emotional forms of abuse and neglect might even be higher than indicated by previous research on child maltreatment, which had mainly focused on physical and sexual types of abuse and neglect. Moreover, emotional maltreatment mediated the association of physical maltreatment and social anxiety. In addition to emotional maltreatment through parents and other caretakers, reports of emotional peer victimizations were independently related to social anxiety symptoms. Thus, it was concluded that symptoms of social anxiety are mainly predicted by emotional types of victimization, either in childhood through the caretakers, or during childhood and adolescence through peers.\r\nAs a second step, physiological reactions to social rejection were examined in healthy subjects. The results suggest that social rejection evokes reactions of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) apparent in accelerated heart rates. Although the effects of social rejection did not imply changes of skin conductance levels, it was concluded that the autonomic nervous system is affected by experiences of social exclusion indicating that behavior activation rather than inhibition is associated with socially threatening events. \r\nAfter that the link between social rejection and physiological reactions had been established, it was examined whether these reactions are affected by histories of emotional maltreatment and symptoms of social anxiety. Data suggested that reactions to an episode of social exclusion were primarily influenced by the degree of relational peer victimization rather than by the diagnosis of SAD. While an increase in skin conductance immediately after the exclusion was observed for all groups of subjects, this physiological response was attenuated among the subjects with a history of peer victimization.\r\nIn general, the results provided evidence for the existence and significance of associative networks and associative memory processing that is established by experiences of emotional maltreatment. In line with memory models of traumatic events and network models of emotional processing, a history of emotional maltreatment altered physiological reactions to a social challenge. After it has been demonstrated that experiences of emotional maltreatment place individuals at risk for symptoms of social anxiety disorder, findings indicate that associative information processing may account for an enhanced cognitive vulnerability for social anxiety. Although the mechanisms involved remain uncertain, it may be speculated that altered physiological reactivity in subjects with a history of emotional maltreatment contributes to the development of social anxiety. \r\nImportantly, the findings of the present research highlight the role of emotional forms of abuse and neglect in the development of a wide range of psychological disorders. Besides the impact of emotional maltreatment on social anxiety, the present research suggested influences of emotional maltreatment on various types of psychopathology. These findings establish a cross-diagnostical perspective on the consequences of emotional maltreatment. Assuming that experiences of emotional abuse and neglect account for various forms of symptomatology, it may be speculated that a plurality of patients would benefit from treatments that address these experiences. Therefore, the development of therapeutic interventions that combine disorder-specific treatments with an approach that focuses on adverse life experiences including social trauma should be a main goal of future clinical research.",

      "abstract": "Delusional Infestation (DI), also termed Ekbom’s Syndrome or delusional parasitosis, is a psychiatric disorder that manifests as an unshakable false belief of being infested with living or inanimate pathogens. The chief complaint of patients with DI is a rigid belief against all medical evidence that they are infested. Approximately 40% of reported cases are due to a primary psychosis, while the remaining 60% are secondary to neurologic or other psychiatric disorders, side effects of medications, substance abuse, or other metabolic diseases (1).\r\n\r\nMost commonly, DI manifests as a mono-delusional disorder, where only the patient experiences the delusion on their body. However, variants of this disorder exist, including a shared delusion (also known as folie a deux), in which more than one person believe themselves to be infested, and DI by proxy (DIP), in which the patient projects the delusion onto a third party who usually cannot share the delusion (e.g., a pet, a young child, or a mentally disabled person) (1). Recently, we proposed a third variant, termed a double delusional infestation (DDI) (2), in which the patient believes that both they, and a third party who cannot share the delusion, are infested.\r\n\r\nThere are sporadic case reports of DIP, in which the delusion was projected onto a pet or a child (3–6). Authors have suggested that this is a “rare” manifestation of DI (7). However, recently, we examined this phenomenon via a survey of veterinarians, and identified over 700 cases in which the veterinarian was reasonably convinced that the client was suffering DIP or DDI (2). Thus, from this study, it appears that the disorder, while relatively uncommon in everyday veterinary practice, occurs frequently enough to be of concern to the clinician. Furthermore, because the projection is onto a pet, the client is unlikely to present to a physician or be referred for psychiatric evaluation, explaining the apparent “rarity” of the condition in the medical psychiatric literature.\r\n\r\nIn our study, we examined the courses of action taken by the clinician, both in the initial diagnosis, and in any recommendations that they made by means of a survey amongst 724 veterinarians from several countries (mainly the US and Canada) recruited via the Veterinary Information Network (VIN, www.vin.com) (2). Furthermore, we identified frustration in many of the respondents in not knowing what should or should not be done with clients presenting with suspected DIP.\r\n\r\nTherefore, based on this study, we have now attempted to provide veterinarians with some guidelines that might assist them in dealing with clients in whom they suspect DIP or DDI.",

DMDD is a condition with an early age of onset (i.e., symptoms apparent by age 10, although the diagnosis cannot be made before age 6); however, nothing is known about the condition among adults in part because questions about temper outbursts (versus \"often losing temper\") are not consistently asked after 6 years of age. Other qualifiers are present so that better-known conditions are not overlooked. For instance, manic symptoms that are present for more than 1 day, symptoms that are not exclusively occurring during major depressive disorder, or symptoms that are better explained by autism, posttraumatic stress disorder, separation anxiety, and dysthymia are exclusionary. Although DMDD can co-occur with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), conduct disorder, and substance use disorder, it preempts diagnoses of both oppositional defiant disorder and intermittent explosive disorder.",

Agitation can arise from any number of sources, including pain, physiological compromise, or anxiety [2]. Sikich and Lerman [3] defined emergence delirium as “a disturbance in a child’s awareness of and attention to his/her environment with disorientation and perceptual alterations, including hypersensitivity to stimuli and hyperactive motor behavior in the immediate postanesthesia period.” Emergence agitation and emergence delirium have been used interchangeably in most of the literature. Despite numerous attempts to explain the causes of emergence agitation/delirium, there is no definitive explanation. Possible causes include pain, preoperative anxiety, type of surgical procedures, personal characteristics of the patient, and type of anesthetics, although no sole factor can explain the etiology of emergence agitation/delirium [4], in large part due to the greatest obstacle to understanding emergence agitation/delirium is the lack of a standardized tool to assess it. The reported prevalence of emergence agitation/delirium varies greatly in the literature, ranging from 10% to 80% [5,6], depending on the definition and criteria of emergence agitation/delirium.

Pain is a subjective experience that cannot be measured or “objectively” verified by other individuals. Reactions to pain, however, can be registered by others. Pain in the orofacial area may have several etiological explanations. Since the functional pattern of the area is multi‐faceted, persisting pain in the area most likely has a multi‐factorial background, and also a variety of effects. Treatment should be made considering delicate diagnostical distinctions. A thorough clinical examination contains lots of treatment components.

Of course, general medical problems inherent to late life are associated with loss of autonomy together with increased chronicity of depression and refractoriness to treatment. Some individuals who are depressed may simply develop failure to thrive. Other depressives in old age manifest major depression or bipolar disorder as an extension of earlier episodes or are caused by neurobiologic changes or damage such as vascular disease. Subsyndromal depression may also be present or atypical forms of depression including masked depression with sadness or dysphoria; depressive pseudodementia with reversible cognitive impairment, and hypochondriasis or depression with prominent somatic complaints.",

When there are evidences of associated functional disturbances in other organ systems or in the patient as a whole, or characteristic clinical syndromes are present, and there is lack of symptomatic or objective evidence of organic disease on careful examination, the diagnosis of functional gastrointestinal disorder is likely. Treatment of functional gastrointestinal disturbances rests fundamentally on the art of medicine in the treatment of the patient and not on the science of medicine in the treatment of a disease. The essential steps in successful treatment include convincing the patient of the diagnosis, improving and relieving symptoms and avoiding or adequately controlling recurrences.Psychotherapy is a keystone in the treatment of functional gastrointestinal disorders. Not often, however, are the services of a psychiatrist necessary.

Acute pain is experienced for short time (two weeks) due to trauma while chronic pain last longer than three months and is associated with injury to tissues or nerves. There are four factors that commonly affect pain expressions: Location, Duration, Intensity and Etiology. The location is the place where the pain occurs. Duration is the time that pain lasts, and is classified as chronic or acute. Intensity tells how severe the pain is. It is usually measured through a pain scale from zero to ten.

The social factors are critical for a successful adaptation, while emotions are means of both signaling the organism's state and of adapting the physiological responses to environmental challenges. Hence the importance of a biopsychosocial model of health and disease. Psychoemotional distress generates and/or amplifies somatic symptoms. Somatization may be viewed as an altered cognitive process, inclining the individual to an augmented perception of bodily sensations and to an increased degree of complexity in reporting negative experiences (hence the greater cognitive effort allocated thereto). Somatosensory amplification and alexithymia are key elements in this process. The brain's right hemisphere is more involved in the generation of emotionally conditioned somatization symptoms. Somatic symptoms have various psychological and social functions and are strongly influenced by the particular belief system of the individual. Inappropriately perceiving the environment as an aggressor and excessively responding to it (by activating the cytokine system in correlation with the arousal of the psychic, nervous, and endocrine systems) may be a key element in the altered cognition conducive to ill health.",

The first person is describing an internal experience whilst the latter is inferring from observed behaviour.

      "abstract": "Zusammenfassung Mit dem Begriff Fatigue werden Zustände ungewöhnlicher Müdigkeit und Erschöpfung beschrieben, die in Zusammenhang mit verschiedenen körperlichen Erkrankungen, insbesondere bei Krebs, multipler Sklerose, Parkinson und rheumatoider Arthritis, auftreten können. Im Gegensatz zu Erschöpfungszuständen bei Gesunden ist diese Form der Fatigue dadurch gekennzeichnet, dass sie über längere Zeiträume andauern kann, in keinem angemessenen Verhältnis zu vorangehenden Aktivitäten steht und sich durch Erholungsphasen nicht zurückbildet. Diese Form der Müdigkeit wird als ein multidimensionales Problem beschrieben, das physische, emotionale und kognitive Aspekte umfasst und mit einem hohen subjektiven Leidensdruck verbunden ist. Je nach Ausprägung und Verlauf der Symptomatik führt Fatigue zu einer starken Beeinträchtigung der Lebensqualität und schränkt die Teilhabe und Alltagsbewältigung ein. Ebenso kommt es häufig zu Einschränkungen der Arbeits- und Erwerbsfähigkeit. Wenngleich die Ursachen der Fatigue immer noch nicht vollständig geklärt sind, ist die Fatigue in Zusammenhang mit körperlichen Erkrankungen vor dem Hintergrund eines multifaktoriellen biopsychosozialen Modells zu verstehen. Die Möglichkeiten der Diagnostik und eine Übersicht über verschiedene Verfahren zur Abklärung der Fatigue werden dargestellt. Ebenso werden die Herausforderungen für die medizinische Versorgung skizziert und Hinweise für den Umgang im klinischen Alltag gegeben.",

This alteration in emotional self-regulation implies greater disability than that attributed to the traditional dimensions -attention deficit and hyperactivity- with an evident impact on the development of personality.To review how the confluence of poor self-regulatory skills, emotion awareness and autonomy, and a particular temperament profile increase the risk of children diagnosed with ADHD for the development of a range of adjustment problems in childhood and adolescence.The typical temperamental profile of children with ADHD is characterised by high emotional reactivity and poor self-regulatory skills. The effects of the interaction of emotionality and temperament in ADHD can be either direct on the child himself or indirect on the environment, interactional by fitting or mismatch with environmental expectations, and transactional due to their dynamic relation with other characteristics in the child's environment.The confluence of poor self-regulation skills, emotion awareness and autonomy, and a temperament profile with a higher novelty seeking and lower persistence increase the risk of children diagnosed with ADHD for the development of a series of adjustment and adaptation problems in childhood and adolescence.Emocionalidad y temperamento en el trastorno por deficit de atencion con o sin hiperactividad.Introduccion. Existe en el trastorno por deficit de atencion con o sin hiperactividad (TDAH) una dificultad para dirigir las emociones para resolver retos o problemas. Esta alteracion en la autorregulacion emocional implica mayor discapacidad que las atribuidas a las dos dimensiones tradicionales, deficit de atencion e hiperactividad, con un impacto notorio sobre el desarrollo de la personalidad. Objetivo. Revisar como la confluencia de pobres habilidades de autorregulacion, conciencia y autonomia emocional, y un perfil de temperamento determinado potencian el riesgo de los niños diagnosticados con TDAH para el desarrollo de una diversidad de problemas de ajuste en la infancia y la adolescencia. Desarrollo. El perfil temperamental tipico de los niños con TDAH se caracteriza por una alta reactividad emocional y pobres habilidades de autorregulacion. Los efectos de la interaccion de la emocionalidad y el temperamento en el TDAH pueden ser directos en el propio niño o indirectos sobre el entorno, de interaccion por encaje o desajuste con las expectativas ambientales y transaccionales por su relacion dinamica con otras caracteristicas del entorno del menor. Conclusiones. La confluencia de pobres habilidades de autorregulacion, conciencia y autonomia emocional, y un perfil de temperamento con una busqueda de la novedad mas elevada y persistencia mas baja potencian el riesgo de los niños diagnosticados con TDAH para el desarrollo de una serie de problemas de ajuste y adaptacion en la infancia y la adolescencia.",

These events range from extreme high magnitude stressors such as torture, terror attacks, rape, childhood sexual abuse, natural disasters, or war to more commonly experienced stressors such as the loss of a romantic relationship, persistent physical illness, or business difficulties. Traumatic-stressor exposure is common and, for the majority of individuals exposed to stressors, normal psychological reactions that occur in the immediate aftermath will abate within days or months of the event. Posttraumatic stress disorder and acute stress disorder share the same traumatic stressor criteria involving \"exposure to a threatened death, serious injury, or sexual violation\" and include direct experiencing, witnessing, or learning about a stressor.",

      "abstract": "Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by impaired social interaction, and verbal and nonverbal communication as well as limited and repetitive behaviours. Although symptomatology of autism may be noticed around early months, diagnosis generally occurs around 24-36 months, however in some cases diagnosis may be delayed to adulthood [1]. Since behavioural symptoms and the degree of functional impairment are variable, the au‐ tistic disorder is described as a heterogenous symptom cluster of varying etiological and pathological basis [2]. Described as a multifactorial disorder created by interaction of neuro‐ logic, immunologic, environmental, and genetic factors, autistic disorder has no definite cause [3, 4]. In many cases in whom the etiology remains unclear are diagnosed as idiopath‐ ic autism or non-syndromic autism [5, 6]. Seventy percent of cases with idiopathic autism have basic symptoms without physical abnormalities whereas 30% have complex autism in which dysmorphic features are detected such as microcephaly and/or structural brain mal‐ formations [7]. Autism is associated with other syndromes such as Fragile X syndrome, Down Syndrome, and tuberosclerosis in 5-25% of the cases ([8, 9]. Although phenotypic het‐ erogeneity is the biggest challenge for research efforts directed to identify autism etiology [10], currently it is widely accepted that environmental and genetic factors play essential role in genesis of autistic disorder thanks to a recent advance in research techniques related to biological factors and widespread studies in this field [11, 12].",

Diese Verhaltensstörungen treten häufig bereits in frühen Stadien des Krankheitsverlaufs auf, noch bevor sich ausgeprägte Gedächtnisstörungen oder Störungen der Alltagskompetenz zeigen.

Uncontrolled seizures are linked to medical and psychological illness, dependent behavior, a low quality of life, and a higher risk of untimely death. Epilepsy affects people of all ages, ethnicities, sexes, levels of education, socioeconomic status, and social classes worldwide. The prodrome phase is a pre-epileptic feeling or experience that might start hours, days, or even weeks in advance of the actual seizure. The most prevalent prodromal phase symptoms include difficulties maintaining focus, tension, exhaustion, sleep disruptions, behavioral changes (differently smelling, tasting, having ringing in the ears, feeling queasy, etc.), restlessness, and others. The ictal phase defined as spans the interval between the start of a seizure and its conclusion. The phrase \"interictal\" refers to a phase that occurs between seizures or headaches. \"Postictal\" refers to the period following a seizure. The duration of postictalphase varies from minutes to hours depending on the type of seizure, the frequency and intensity of seizures, and the length of the seizure.",

Forensic Neuropsychology establishes an expert valuation of the brain-injured patient (or supposed), or of the law offender people (or supposed) requiring law protection due to their illness. This discipline has a fundamental role in the study of cerebral organic syndromes, particularly in the dementias. DEVELOPMENT. The demential syndrome is common to a group of diseases as degenerative or cardiovascular disorders, brain tumors, syphilis, alcoholism or toxic factors, etc. When speaking of dementia we refer to a syndrome characterized by a progressive and global deterioration of the cognitive functions (memory, language, attention, space-temporal orientation, praxis, thinking, etc.) with preservation of the level of conscience (DSM-IV). This symptomatology affects the personality of the individual as reasonable being , as well as to his behavior and social adaptation. The decrease or loss of the intellectual and volitives abilities of the affected person of a demential syndrome, if it is permanent, also implies a change in its legal situation, since its legal capacity is altered. Therefore, it will be necessary to adopt protective measures for his person and his patrimony.

It is an ultimate response that occurs because of chronic exposure to stressors from the job characterised by the magnitudes/key dimensions which are feeling of cynicism, sense of ineffectiveness, detachment from the job, lack of accomplishment and overwhelming exhaustion.1 This implies that burnout characterised by a variety of factors can cause extreme suffering to an individual. Exhaustion is a central quality of burnout and the most obvious manifestation of this complex syndrome. It refers to feelings of being overextended and depleted on one’s emotional and physical resources. The individual feels drained due to perpetual lack of energy as a result of which, the quality of work responsibility is compromised. The major sources of this exhaustion are work overload and personal conflicts at the work place. The cynicism dimension represents the interpersonal context that refers to negative, callous, or excessively detached response to various aspects of the job which results in the loss if idealism and dehumanisation of others. The inefficacy dimension represents the self-evaluation component of burnout that refers to feeling of incompetence and lack of achievement and productivity in work. Burnout is a cumulative reaction on ongoing occupational stressors. Healthcare professionals, especially clinicians seem to be at particular risk for burnout. Additionally nurses, specifically psychiatric nurses are considered as a group at risk for excessive stress and burnout because they are in constant interaction and frequent interpersonal contact with psychiatric clients and their families.2 These reasons and risk factors can be same in between the professions, however, even within the discipline there are gender differences that calls for further discussions.

      "abstract": "El Sindrome de Alienacion Parental (SAP) es un conjunto de sintomas que se producen en los hijos cuando el progenitor alienador, lleva a cabo una campana injustificada de denigracion contra el otro, en la cual mediante distintas estrategias transforma la conciencia de los ninos con el fin de impedir, obstaculizar o destruir sus vinculos con el progenitor alienado. Es una problematica que ha venido aumentando con el paso de los anos, teniendo en cuenta que se da mayormente en el contexto del divorcio cuando se torna en un proceso contencioso, donde los padres empiezan a hacer participes a los hijos de ese conflicto, sin tener en cuenta el dano y malestar que esto les genera. El presente documento tuvo como finalidad, mediante una revision sistematica de literatura, describir las principales consecuencias a nivel psicologico en los hijos que experimentan el SAP, encontrandose a nivel cognitivo, distorsiones o incluso cuadros psicoticos; a nivel emocional, dependencia y falta de empatia; por ultimo, a nivel conductual, sintomas asociados a trastornos de ansiedad.",

In Autism Spectrum Disorder the word Autism means- a developmental disorder that is characterized by difficulty in social interaction and communication. It is derived from Greek word ‘auto’ which means ‘self’. Spectrum means- which is not limited to specific conditions and Disorder means- a state of confusion/mess. Characteristics related to ASD can include can’t able to make eye contact with others, does not respond to name and can’t able to show facial expressions like happy, sad, angry, and surprised by 9 months of age, showing no gestures by 12 months of age, does not show interest to play with other children by 36 months of age. Some other characteristics include-delaying language skills, delaying learning skills, unusual eating and sleeping habits, gastrointestinal issues (for example, constipation), unusual mood or emotional reactions, anxiety, stress, lack of fear or more fear than expected [1].",

      "abstract": "Psychiatric disorders (PDs) in neurology are more frequent then it verified in routine exam, not only in the less developed but also in large and very developed neurological departments. Furthermore, psychiatric symptoms (PSs) in neurological disorders (NDs) among primary health care physicians and other specialties are often neglected. Anxiety and depression are most common, but hallucinations, delusions, obsessive-compulsive disorder and delirium or confusional state are also frequent comorbidity in many neurological conditions such as stroke, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis (MS), Parkinson disease (PD). Depression and NDs also have a bidirectional relationship, as not only are patients, for example with stroke at greater risk of developing depression, but patients with depression have a two-fold greater risk of developing a stroke, even after controlling for other risk factors. Dementia or cognitive impairment are part of clinical picture of PD, stroke patients, patients with MS, Huntington disease etc. The prototype of dementia in PD and other NDs is a dysexecutive syndrome with impaired attention, executive functions and secondarily impaired memory. So-called \"functional\" (or psychogenic or hysterical/conversion) symptoms are relatively infrequent in \"neurological\" conditions, but very often unrecognized and not properly treated. Treatment of PSs in neurology, basically are not different then treatment of these symptoms in psychiatry and should be include pharmacotherapy and psychiatry. This presentation gives an overview of frequency and type of PSs underlying necessity to recognize these disorders in every day routine exam and properly treatment.",

However, a generally accepted understanding and clear definition of what is constituted by psychological pain do not exist. Morse and colleagues' criteria (definition, characteristics, boundaries, preconditions, outcomes) were used to analyze related concepts (suffering, psychache, emotional pain, and psychic pain) that could contribute to a definition of psychological pain. The analysis indicated that psychological pain may best be defined as a lasting, unsustainable, and unpleasant feeling resulting from negative appraisal of an inability or deficiency of the self. This negative self-appraisal is typically brought on by loss of someone or something, or failure to achieve something that is intimately linked to core psychological needs.",

The basic features involve the development of impairing stress symptoms, including re-experiencing of the event in the form of “flashbacks” (distressing images, thoughts or perceptions) or nightmares, avoidance of thinking or talking about the event, of places or people associated with the event and of things that remind one of the event. Hyperarousal, or feeling on edge, irritability and exaggerated “startle” responses to stimuli, and emotional numbing (sufferers feeling cut off and detached) have also been described.\n\nPTSD in children was originally described after particularly traumatic events such as physical and sexual abuse1–3 and the witnessing of violence.4 It has been recognised following both natural5,6 and man-made7,8 disasters, and extensively documented in refugees,9,10 war situations11 and in response to terrorism-induced trauma.12\n\nMore recently, attention has focused on PTSD occurring as a consequence of a variety of paediatric conditions, some life threatening, including cancer,13 head injury14 and motor vehicle accidents15,16 as well as mild to moderate paediatric trauma,17 acute illnesses resulting in admission to paediatric intensive care units,18 children who undergo organ transplantation19 and after diagnosis of diabetes mellitus type 1.20\n\nStressful experiences related to serious paediatric illness in children may be expected to affect parents psychologically.

Although the diagnostic reliability of GAD is comparatively low, the features constituting the diagnostic criteria have been noted to be reliable (). A study that compared the distribution of somatic symptoms associated with GAD in patients with \"pure\" GAD and patients with GAD plus comorbid current or lifetime psychiatric diagnoses showed that GAD is a distinct disorder that is relatively consistent in presentation in patients with or without other psychiatric disorders (). The hypothesis of the existence of distinct subtypes of GAD, i.e. a \"pure\" GAD and a \"secondary\" type with comorbid disorder, representing possibly a prodromal/residual state or an epiphenomenon associated with another disorder, was therefore not confirmed.",

Unmada is classified into five (vataja, pittaja, kaphaja, sannipataja and agantuja) types, and \"Vataja Unmada\" (VU) is one among them. The description of VU is available in all major Ayurvedic classical texts, and it comes under \"Doshaja\" (psychiatric disorder which occurs due to the aggravation of doshas) category. Studies or scientific literature on VU has been lacking, and the present work is focused on to explore this condition. The etiopathology of VU denotes deficiency of various nutritional factors such as vitamins, minerals, omega-3-fatty acids, amino acids, and antioxidants. Lacking or deficiency of these nutritional factors leads to structural and/or functional damage and degeneration of the brain (neurodegenerative or demyelinating pathology) which ultimately leads to the manifestation of different degenerative psychiatric disorders. The clinical picture of VU resembles various psychiatric or neuropsychiatric conditions such as \"disorganized schizophrenia\" or \"hebephrenia\" or \"catatonia\" or \"dementia\" or \"bipolar disorder with psychotic features\" or \"mania with psychotic features,\" or \"organic or secondary psychoses.\" VU is a treatable condition, and it can be managed successfully by \"Panchakarma\" procedures along with internal medicines.",

The complications of occupational exposure to neurotoxins and putative neurotoxins are also covered in so far as they relate to the fitness of an exposed employee to continue working. In addition to a few well-known and common conditions, many uncommon but distinct neurological disorders may present at work or affect work capacity. Fitness for work in these disorders will be determined by the person’s functional abilities, any co-morbid illness, the efficacy or side effects of the treatment, and psychological and social factors, rather than by the precise diagnosis. This will also need to be put into the context of the job in question, as the basic requirements for a manual labouring job may be completely different from something more intellectually demanding. Indeed, even an apparently precise diagnostic label such as multiple sclerosis can encompass a complete spectrum of disability, from someone who is entirely asymptomatic to another who is totally incapacitated. Furthermore, reports by general practitioners, neurologists, or neurosurgeons may describe the symptoms, signs, and investigations in detail, but without analysing functional abilities. These colleagues may also fail to appreciate the workplace hazards, the responsibilities of the employer, or what scope exists for adaptations to the job or workplace.",

      "title": "A Comparative Analysis of Psychiatric Profile, Depression andBody Dysmorphic Disorder in patients with Amputation and PostStroke.",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION:\r\nAmputation is defined as the removal of extremities of body part by trauma or by\r\nSurgical procedure. Amputees may feel empty, and mutilated. Amputation due to\r\nTrauma is a catastrophic injury and causes major disability in most of the cases\r\n(Wald 2004)1. Loss of limb is associated with low self-esteem, body image\r\nDisturbance, social isolation and also a sense of stigmatization (William et al.\r\n2004). In many conditions amputation is unavoidable. Irrespective of the aetiology,\r\nAmputation is considered as a mutilating surgery and it definitely affects the lives\r\nOf the patients (De Godoy et al. 2002). Limb amputation is a more commonly\r\nOccurring event in the present society.\r\nThe loss of a limb distorts the individual’s body image leading to the thought of\r\nNot being a complete human being. The loss of the functions performed with that\r\nLimb renders him helpless for sometime. The amputee not only loses physical\r\nFunctioning, he also loses hope and future aspirations, his plans and ambitions get\r\nShattered. Thus, he loses not only a limb but also a part of his world and future.\r\nMost of them remain anxious and worried about their interpersonal relationship in\r\nThe social, vocational, familial and marital milieu. Individuals having an overt\r\nMental breakdown will need active psychiatric intervention whereas careful\r\nPsychiatric interview is necessary for the ones whose mental symptoms are not so\r\nObvious.\r\nLimb loss is a major event that can severely impact the psychological health of the\r\nIndividual concerned. Studies show that 20-60% of the amputees attending follow\r\nUp clinics are assessed to be clinically depressed. Individuals with traumatic\r\nAmputation irrespective of the age are likely to suffer from body image problems,\r\nBut these findings are more common in younger individuals. The psychological\r\nReactions to amputation are clearly diverse ranging from severe disability at one\r\nExtreme; and a determination to effectively resume a full and active life at other\r\nEnd. In adults the age at which an individual receives the amputation is an\r\nImportant factor. Studies by Bradway JK et al (1984)2, Kohl SJ Et al (1984)3,\r\nLivneh H (1999)4, on the psycho-social adaptation to amputation has led to a\r\nPlethora of clinical and empirical findings. Kingdon D et al 1982 equated\r\nAmputation with loss of one’s perception of wholeness, while (Parkes CM 1976)5\r\nWith loss of spouse and (Block WE et al (1963)6 with symbolic castration & even\r\nDeath. The individual’s response to a traumatic event is influenced by personality\r\nTraits, pre-morbid psychological state, gender, peri-traumatic dissociation,\r\nProlonged disability of traumatic events, lack of social support and inadequate\r\nCoping strategies. Previous studies on amputation mainly focused on demographic\r\nProfile, coping skills and outcome; with there being a scarcity of literature on\r\nPrevalence of various specific psychiatric disorders in the post-amputation period.\r\nMost patients with a limb loss irrespective of whether due to traumatic injury or\r\nSurgical procedures go through a series of complex psychological reactions\r\nReported by Cansever et al (2003)8. Most people try to cope with it, those who\r\nDon’t succeed develop psychiatric symptoms Frank et al (1984)7. Shukla et\r\nAl9 noted that psychological intervention in some form is needed in about 50% of\r\nAll amputees, and Shukla et al9 reported depression to be the most common\r\nPsychological reaction following amputation.\r\nThe three major problems faced by many amputees are anxiety, depression and\r\nPhysical disability (Green 2007)\r\nHorgan & maclachlan (2004)10 found that anxiety is associated with depression,\r\nLow self esteem, poorer quality of life and higher level of general anxiety. Both\r\nAnxiety and depression are associated with higher disability as age increases.\r\nBody image is the combination of psychosocial adjustment and attitude of the\r\nIndividual that are related to the function and appearance of one’s own body which\r\nCan be influenced by the individual and his environmental factors (Horgan &\r\nMaclachlan 2004)10. Each person has an idealized body image, which he uses for\r\nMeasuring perceptions and concepts of his or her own body (Fishman, 1959)11.\r\nFrom another perspective, Flannery & Faria (1999) body image is viewed as a\r\nDynamic, changing phenomenon occurring in a person and it is formed by the\r\nConstantly changing perceptions about his body. According to Newell (1991)13,\r\nAttractive people after amputation will receive less reinforcement from others\r\nLeading to low self-esteem and reduced positive self-image. Jacobsen et al (1997)\r\nSupports this stating i.e. Amputation leads to disfigurement which in turn leads to a\r\nNegative body image and greater loss of social acceptance. The relationship\r\nBetween disability experience and stigma are interwoven and inter-dependent. The\r\nReason for the amputee’s subjective perception of being unfit for the society\r\nProbably is that body image provides a sense of ‘’self’ ’and also affects the\r\nPersons thinking (Wald 2004)1. According to Kolb (1975)14, changes in body\r\nImage may cause series of psychological reactions.\r\nThe psychiatric aspect of amputation has received scant interest in our country, in\r\nSpite of accidental injuries being common (Shukla et al., 1982)9. The commonest\r\nPsychiatric disorder seen in amputees is major depression. Randall et al. (1945)15\r\nHave reported an incidence of 61 % in non-battle casualties, while Shukla et al.\r\n(1982)9 found depressive neurosis (40%) and psychiatric depression (22%) to be\r\nThe leading psychiatric disorders in amputees; only 35% of the total sample in the\r\nLater study had nil psychiatric disorders. The paucity of literature in this field has\r\nPrompted us to study about amputation and its co morbid psychiatric conditions so\r\nThat proper care & management for the patients can be planned. The present study\r\nWas undertaken with the aim of studying the psychiatric problems especially\r\nAnxiety, depression and Body Dysmorphic Disorder which may be associated with\r\nDisability or changed life circumstances in the immediate post-amputation period.\r\nA comparison was made with Stroke patients, as these patients often experience\r\nPhysical and social handicaps similar to amputees.\r\nDepression is the most common mood disorder to follow stroke (Starkstein &\r\nRobinson, 1989), with major depression affecting around one quarter to one third\r\nOf patients (Hackett16)..\r\nDepression hampers functional recovery in a post stroke individual. In Diagnostic\r\nAnd statistical manual (DSM) IV Post Stroke Depression classified under “mood\r\nDisorder due to general medical condition (i.e. Stroke)” with the specific depressive\r\nFeatures, major depressive-like episodes, manic features or mixed features. Studies\r\nDescribe that cerebral ischemia is associated with two types of depressive disorder.\r\nIncidence of major and minor depression is 25% and 30% respectively. Prevalence\r\nMay vary over time with an apparent peak 3months after the stroke and\r\nSubsequently decline in prevalence at 1 year. Robinson and colleagues studies\r\nShowed a spontaneous remission in the natural course of major depression\r\nOccurring post stroke in the first to second year following stroke. However in few\r\nCases depression may become chronic and persist for a longer period.\r\nWhile some propose that post stroke depression is due to stroke affecting the\r\nNeural circuits concerned with mood regulation (thereby supporting a primary\r\nBiological mechanism), others in the scientific community claim it to be due to the\r\nEnsuing psycho-social stressors occurring as a result of stroke. Though an\r\nIntegrated bio- psycho- social model is warranted, most studies clearly suggest\r\nBiological mechanism to have an upper hand in the later post stroke period than in\r\nThe immediate phase.\r\nIn the same way Anxiety is also common in post stroke individuals with the\r\nIncidence rate being 20%, and it is most common in first three to four months after\r\nThe stroke.\r\nStudies and literatures on post stroke anxiety are very few still remain in its\r\nInfancy. Studies have concentrated on socio-demographic variables, cognitive\r\nFunctions and laterality as examined for post stroke depression. Many studies show\r\nThat there is correlation between anxiety and right hemisphere lesions and also that\r\nCo-morbid post stroke anxiety and depression are associated with left hemisphere\r\nLesions [Astrom, (1996)17]. Many studies have shown the relationship between post\r\nStroke anxiety, age and gender. Women and younger individuals are more\r\nVulnerable to develop post stroke anxiety (Morrison, walter et al 200069), while\r\nAnother study reports no such relationship (Schultz et al).19",

The onset of symptoms within 1 month (ICD) and 3 months (DSM) is not evidence based. The symptoms may be depressive, anxious, behavioural, or a mixture of these. A useful clinical indicator that the event was the trigger is that the intensity of the symptoms increases when it is being recalled or recounted and diminishes when the person is removed from it. A number of differentials should also be considered. ICD-11 proposes specific criteria for ICD-11 that include preoccupation with the stressor and difficulty adapting, as evidenced by impaired concentration, sleep disturbance, and so on, causing impairment in functioning. It is unclear whether those diagnosed with AD using the new criteria will be the same clinically as those currently so diagnosed.",

      "title": "Análisis de las respuestas cognitivas relacionadas con el diagnóstico de cáncer en pacientes mexicanos",
      "abstract": "Cancer has been defined by the World Health Organization as “a disease caused by abnormal cells growing uncontrollably in the body, going beyond their usual boundaries, invading adjoining parts of the body and spreading to other organs”. Being diagnosed with cancer has been described as an experience with diverse emotional reactions and difficulties in adaptation, having psychological consequences, being most common depression, anxiety and psychological distress; but also, some patients present positive consequences after having a cancer diagnosis, such as post traumatic growth, which includes positive changes presented after the disease experience. Subjective appraisal about cancer has been defined as a mediating variable for the emotional response presented after a stressor, such as cancer diagnosis, treatment, or important changes during disease process (initiating and finalizing treatment, presenting relapse or remission, as well as when having control studies). The subjective appraisal can be presented with different thought content and styles. Thought style is referred as the way thoughts about the stressor are presented, it has been classified as rumination (thoughts that are intrusive and repetitive that also increase psychological distress), cognitive engagement (thoughts associated with problem solving and meaning finding) or avoidance (aiming to stop thinking about stressor or feeling associated with it). Depending on the thought style presented at a stressor, could be the emotional response (anxiety, depression, distress, post-traumatic growth). The aim of the present study was to describe the thoughts (style, content, valence and temporality) related to cancer diagnosis in a group of ten oncologic patients. To identify if differences between thought style, valence and temporality were presented. The study design is qualitative from a phenomenological point of view. Ten oncologic (different cancer type, clinical stage and treatment) patients were asked to write the five more frequent thoughts since their cancer diagnosis. Each thought was classified by: thought style, valence, and temporality (top-down, classifying the thoughts according to theory). The same thoughts were also classified in semantic units (bottom-up, classifying the thoughts according to their own contents), generating concerns from the content. Cross tabs were made to identify contents and temporality for thought style and valence, which were analyzed by chi square to identify differences between thought style, temporality and valence. The most common thought style was cognitive engagement, followed by rumination (almost same frequency). On what respects to thought style and temporality, rumination was more focused on past (causes and attributions of cancer) and future (uncertainty about death and treatment effectiveness); meanwhile, cognitive engagement was focused on present (to enjoy present moment and focus on daily actions). Chi square was made to identify if this difference was significant, showing temporality was significantly different in cognitive engagement and rumination. The concerns identified in study participants were uncertainty about future and disease, family (communication and wellness of the family), finances (due to expensive treatments), causes and guilt about having cancer. Thoughts that were more centered in present, were more likely to be associated with cognitive engagement. Cognitive engagement has been described previously as an important variable associated with post traumatic growth. Thoughts centered in the past and present were more associated with rumination. Rumination has been associated with depression and post-traumatic stress disorder. Because of mediating role of thought style in disease adaptation, emotional response to the disease, and the relation of this adaptation with the perception of quality of life in cancer patients, the design of psychological interventions aiming on promoting cognitive engagement by problem solving skills, meaning finding, and focusing on present could be a research line derived from present studies results. https://doi.org/10.16888/interd.2022.39.1.9",

      "title": "Somatization",
      "abstract": "Abstract Medically unexplained symptoms (MUS) are particularly common presentations in primary care settings. They lie on a severity spectrum, with significant overlaps with other functional somatic syndromes, psychiatric diagnoses like depression and anxiety, and general medical conditions. Typically, symptoms present with either no identifiable medical aetiology, or are disproportionate to the cause, with associated distress and preoccupations, health-related anxiety, and help-seeking behaviours. Cultural factors are known to shape shared mental representations about interpreting such symptom experiences and are therefore vital determinants of health and illness reporting. The nosology of MUS has been debated, deliberated, and transformed several times over the last century. Several models have been proposed to understand the pathogenesis of MUS based on the complex interaction of developmental, personality, cognitive–perceptual, cultural, and emotional processes within a bio-psycho-socio-cultural framework. Effective and sensitive communication of socio-culturally grounded and individualized illness formulations that link the individual’s belief systems, diagnosis, and treatment options are key to managing MUS. Medications are used to treat severe symptoms or comorbid psychiatric diagnoses. Psychotherapy that targets coping, help-seeking behaviours, and real-world functioning is also effective.",

      "abstract": "Post-stroke mood and emotional disturbances are frequent and diverse in their manifestations. Among them, post-stroke depression is the best known. Although post-stroke anger (PSA) has been studied relatively less, it can be as frequent as depression. Manifestations of PSA range from overt aggressive behaviors (including hitting or hurting others) to becoming irritable, impulsive, hostile, and less tolerable to family members. The possible pathophysiological mechanisms of PSA include neurochemical dysfunction due to brain injury, frustration associated with neurological deficits or unfavorable environments, and genetic predisposition. PSA causes distress in both patients and their caregivers, negatively influences the patient’s quality of life, and increases the burden on caregivers. It can be treated or prevented using various methods, including pharmacological therapies. In addition, anger or hostility may also be a risk or triggering factor for stroke. The hazardous effects of anger may be mediated by other risk factors, including hypertension or diabetes mellitus. The identification of anger as a result or cause of stroke is important because strategic management of anger may help improve the patient’s quality of life or prevent stroke occurrence. In this narrative review, we describe the phenomenology, prevalence, factors or predictors, relevant lesion locations, and pharmacological treatment of PSA. We further describe the current evidence on anger as a risk or triggering factor for stroke.",

While classical forms of major hysteria are less frequent in occurrence in recent years, the etiological basis of the pattern still is clinically significant. Conversion reactions and psychophysiological reactions affecting various body systems continue to be a part of the spectrum of psychiatric illness seen in active practice. While no organic cause for the symptoms is present, the loss of function, when substantial and persistent, equates with the loss of function resulting from actual organic disease. Not all of these reactions occur in the ‘hysterical personality’, and both social and cultural patterns must be taken into account. In evaluating the severity of an impairment (loss of function) resulting from a functional illness, the psychological and physiological homeostasis of the patient is a crucial consideration. Symptoms derived from purely conscious reactions are seldom associated with actual loss of function.",

      "abstract": "Disease with Lewy bodies or dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), particularly at the prodromal stage, is a complex disease to diagnose because of different clinical beginnings and variable paths in terms of clinical expression. Thus DLB can be entcountered in different input modes: mild cognitive impairment, depression, acute behavioral disorders, confusion and delirium, or sleep disorders. In the aim to better diagnose the disease, should be sought obviously to search for the key symptoms: fluctuations, hallucinations, extra-pyramidal syndrome, and REM sleep behavior disorder. These symptoms are more subtle at the prodromal stage (mild neurocognitive disorder) than at the major stage. Thus fluctuations can be cognitive, simply as attentionnal fluctuations, or of alertness, such as sleepiness or more frequent nap; the visual phenomena can begin by sensation of passage, sensation of presence, or illusions; the extra-pyramidal syndrome can be really subtle such as isolated amimia or rigidity detected only with Froment's manœuvre. The frequent accompagnying symptoms are autonomic symptoms such as rhinorrhea or constipation, or sensorial symptoms such as olfactory impairment. The clinician has to be aware of the frequent presence of geriatric syndroms, also at the prodromal stage and including: falls, orthostatic hypotension, syncopa, urinary troubles, depression, delirium (after surgery, during infection...). On neuropsychological tests, sub-cortical frontal syndrome is frequent, visual memory impairment, visuospatial impairment and visuo-constructive difficulties are also characteristics. On brain MRI, isolated diminished insula is to look for. CSF analysis is usually normal but sometimes with low Abeta-42. Dat-Scan and MIBG scintigraphy were not enough explored in this context. Thus, with every patient presenting a compatible input mode, the search for symptoms of DLB has to be systematic, in the aim to have an etiological diagnosis of prodromal DLB, to avoid adverse drug events (neuroleptics) and to optimize care for patients.",

      "abstract": "The psychopathology of stroke encompasses several psychiatric and behavioral disorders that have high prevalence in the geriatric population, reduce the patient autonomy and increase the caregiver's burden. These disorders are usually associated with other cognitive and neurological deficits, and are labelled as neuropsychiatric when the whole clinical picture is consistent with the specific dysfunction of a neural system or brain region. Thus the neuropsychiatry of stroke comprises disorders of the perception/identification of the self and the environment (anosognosia of hemiplegia, misidentification syndromes, confabulations, visual hallucinations, delirium and acute confusional state), amotivational syndromes (apathy and athymhormia), disorders of emotional reactivity (blunted affect, emotional incontinence, irritability, catastrophic reactions), poor impulse or ideation control (mania) and personality changes. The clinical profile of the subcortical vascular dementia also points to specific brain dysfunction (frontal-subcortical pathways) that manifests with behavioral (depression, emotionalism, irritability) and cognitive symptoms (psychomotor retardation, attention, executive and memory deficits). However, post-stroke depression and anxiety, which have a more variable clinical presentation and might be assimilated, for several aspects, to post-traumatic or adaptive disorders, are disorders less characterized in their neural correlates.",

Somatization is an individual's unconscious use of the body or bodily symptoms for psychological purposes or psychological gain. As the AMA Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment ( AMA Guides ), Sixth Edition, notes, somatization is a “tendency to experience and report somatic complaints (physical symptoms) in response to psychosocial stress and seek health care services for them.” The AMA Guides also advises evaluators that “exclusion or inclusion of somatization disorder, factitious disorder, and/or malingering must be done with care.” A table lists developmental factors that may dispose to somatization (eg, somatizers are present in the family of origin, or coping mechanisms other than illness behavior are absent or unacceptable); a second table compares disorders that may involve somatization. Somatization is prevalent in clinical practice and is likely to occur with equal, or higher, frequency in the evaluation setting. The presence of somatization distorts symptom presentation and can exert a confounding effect on impairment assessment methodologies that rely on the accuracy of patients’ self-presentations.",

Here, we shall refer to conditions with long-lasting and disabling symptoms, not trivial or passing symptoms. Such conditions are called medically unexplained symptoms (MUS). Syndromes with specific diagnostic criteria, such as fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome, or irritable bowel syndrome, are often included among MUS conditions.2\n\nAlthough management of patients with MUS presents several challenges, GPs accept the responsibility for investigation, diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up.5\n\nBiopsychosocial approaches are commonly applied in medical practice, whether the aim is full recovery or coping with symptoms and disability,1 and psychologically based interventions (especially different cognitive behavioural therapies [CBT]) have been developed for coping and symptom relief. Yet, such approaches do not substantiate MUS as a mental disorder. Lamahewa et al found, for example, that comorbidity with depression and generalised anxiety disorder occurred in only one-third of these patients.2 Studies have evaluated effects of CBT on different outcome measures, such as pain, function, work ability, or healthcare use, often presenting limited or no significant effects based on weak evidence.4\n\nMUS is not a clinical diagnosis but an analytical concept, unifying a diverse group of health problems where no joint cause or biomarker have been identified. Together MUS conditions dispute the idea that objective findings are needed to confirm subjective symptoms as disease.

This syndrome encompasses a spectrum of symptoms, including anxiety, panic attacks, and psychosomatic symptoms such as chest pain, headache, hysterical attacks, and many more with minimal positive investigations and other evaluations. Its prevalence is notably high among high-profile individuals such as politicians and bureaucrats in contexts marked by corruption, especially in India. The onset of symptoms typically occurs in response to arrest or legal proceedings, complicating clinical diagnosis due to the lack of identifiable organic causes. Distinguishing jail syndrome from genuine medical conditions such as acute coronary syndromes is crucial for effective management. The syndrome reflects a circumstantial diagnosis influenced by the psychological stress of legal consequences, necessitating a careful assessment of both psychological and physiological health. Large-scale studies, research, and data analysis are essential to validate jail syndrome as a recognized clinical diagnosis. Jail syndrome is a self-explanatory clinical diagnosis to convey the onset of symptomatology, etiopathology, and treatment strategy in a person involved in illicit activities with history of charges, imprisonment, or sentencing to jail. Most important is to rule out organic disease because many times organic causes such as acute coronary syndrome, diabetes mellitus (DM), and hypertension (HT) are present. Very important is that large-scale data and their scientific analysis are required to confirm and recognize it as a definite clinical diagnosis of \"jail syndrome.\" No doubt the term jail syndrome is self-explanatory and conveys the message we want to convey.",

A wide range of reactions, responses and emotions can be brought forth by such experiences. Reactions directly following the event can be characterized as shock. Such reactions might include a feeling that nothing is real, emotional apathy and confusion, as well as physical responses such as trembling, shivering or nausea. Children often react differently than adults. For this reason, adults do not always understand the connection between the child's behavior and the traumatic experience. For instance, depressed children are often active and restless, while depressed adults are sluggish and move at a slower speed. Moreover, children suffer from extreme mood swings, from jubilant at the one extreme to deeply sorrowful.",

As far as the choice of interventions is concerned, the indication for its use may not be well justified, and the choice itself may be determined by the type of specialist and not by the actual clinical picture. The various treatment interventions usually fail due to non- compliance of patients towards the untoward side effect of the systemically used drugs.

      "title": "The nature of emotional abnormalities in schizophrenia: Evidence from patients and high-risk individuals",
      "abstract": "Schizophrenia is a psychiatric disorder that affects about one out of 100 people with symptoms generally emerging in early adulthood. According to the DSM-IV, schizophrenia is characterized by psychotic symptoms, such as hallucinations, delusions, bizarre behavior or speech and negative symptoms such as flattening of affect. Psychotic symptoms such as hallucination and delusions are regarded as particularly characteristic for schizophrenia, although they may also occur in other psychiatric disorders. Besides these psychotic symptoms, which are often treatable with antipsychotic medication, people with schizophrenia experience negative symptoms (social withdrawal, affective flattening, apathy, alogia) and cognitive disturbances, e.g. memory dysfunction, attention problems, and emotional dysfunction. It are mainly these latter problems that cause that the majority of people with schizophrenia are unable to built up a social network, career and romantic relationships, making it one of the most invalidating psychiatric disease. Currently, the prevalent idea is that emotion processing is generally deficient in schizophrenia. Thus, the emphasis is solely on reductions or impairments. However, some studies suggest that schizophrenia is associated with a reduced ability to perceive and express emotions, with at the same time intact or even heightened emotional experience. This disjunction between emotional processes in schizophrenia was investigated in more detail. Second, this thesis dealt with investigating the presence of emotional abnormalities in individuals high on the schizophrenia spectrum continuum. Emotional abnormalities in people at high-risk for schizophrenia are hypothesized, because emotional abnormalities appear to be a core feature of schizophrenia and would therefore be expected to be present to a certain degree in high-risk individuals. Finally, we investigated the influence of social-emotional aspects on other cognitive functions, such as decision-making, in patients with schizophrenia and individuals at high-risk for schizophrenia. The most important findings are that emotional abnormalities appear to be central to schizophrenia and are also present in individuals with a liability for schizophrenia-like traits or an increased genetic risk. This suggests that emotional abnormalities can be regarded as a vulnerability marker for schizophrenia. However, these emotional abnormalities do not reflect an overall reduction in all aspect of emotion processing, i.e. perception, expression, experience and psychophysiology. Instead, schizophrenia patients and individuals at high risk report normal or higher levels of emotional experience, whereas the expression of emotions appears deficient. With respect to the perception of emotion, results depend on the type of processing that occurs, i.e. automatic, incidental processing or controlled, elaborative processing of affective information. These findings suggest a disjunction between deficits in elaborative processing of emotions on the one hand, and normal or increased emotional reactivity on the other hand. Moreover, deficits in the perception and expression of emotions appear to be consistently related to negative symptoms, such as blunted affect and social emotional withdrawal. In addition, positive symptoms might be related to an increased subjective emotional arousal. The finding of a particular pattern of emotional abnormalities in patients with schizophrenia and individuals at high risk for schizophrenia could give clues about the underlying brain pathology and ultimately the development of treatment strategies that selectively target those brain systems.",

      "abstract": "In cognitive-behaviour therapy attention paid to the self and identity has primarily involved self-representations (the Me-Self) rather than how the self is experienced (the I-Self). Within the I-Self experiences vary on a continuum from pre-reflective consciousness (raw experienced perceptions and states of being) to self-awareness (permitting reflection on and evaluation of subjective experience). There is considerable evidence that the I-Self is affected in many if not all disorders, and I review illustrative studies of OCD, eating disorders, body dysmorphic disorder, PTSD, and personality disorder. These indicate that patients often experience themselves as being defective in various ways, or as having an unstable or contradictory I-Self. Recognition of this neglected aspect of patients' experience has major implications for assessment and treatment. For example, acknowledgment that their sense of self may fluctuate dramatically from moment to moment, may be fragmented, or may consist of a sense of emptiness, may help to build a more empathic therapeutic relationship. If frightening or distressing pre-reflective experiences are the cause of avoidance or other maladaptive coping strategies, conscious attention paid to them in therapy may help to better integrate the I-Self and Me-Self, restoring a sense of predictability and control.",

PTSD results in significant distress and morbidity. For example, following an assault a person may experience intrusive thoughts of the assault, suffer from nightmares of threat or assault, or experience flashbacks of all or some portions of the assault. Avoidance of reminders is common and may include, for example, avoidance of the site of the assault or similar places, avoidance of people who are similar to the perpetrator, or avoidance of conversations about community or domestic violence. Following a traumatic event, emotional numbing such as a sense of being unable to have loving feelings, feeling detached from others, or having decreased interest may occur. Difficulty falling asleep, being easily startled, irritability, and hypervigilance are common hyperarousal symptoms (see DSM-IV for criteria) (1).",

      "abstract": "SUMMARY. Nonconvulsive status epilepticus (NCSE) is an epileptic condition, lasting more than 30 min, characterized by con tinuous or recurrent epileptic activity on EEG, which is responsible for various clinical symptoms (especially in mental status or behavior) in the absence of manifest seizure activity. It includes different clinical forms, from minor confusion to complex behavioral disorders, psychosis, or coma. These psychotic symptoms can be very complex and their differential diagnosis can be difficult. We report the case of a 31-year-old male patient without previous personal or family recorded history of epilepsy and/or schizophrenic disorder, without identifiable stressors, showing a subacute episode of anxiety with aggression. Initially, he was discharged without treatment. Seven days later he went to the emergency services accompanied by his family members reporting delusions of injury. He presented a disorganized behavior with self-harm, anxiety, dysesthesia, cenestopathy and in ternal field hallucinations (auditory and visual). The initial EEG study revealed a nonconvulsive status with an active tempo ral focus. In this patient, the psychotic symptoms and EEG abnormalities consistent with NCSE appeared simultaneously. Once the EEG returned to normal, the symptoms only persisted residually and were compatible with intraictal psychosis.",

      "title": "Being psychotic is not necessarily being ill: Psychotic continuum and the relevance of lacanian psychoanalytic approach",
      "abstract": "Introduction The notion of subclinical psychosis is as old as Eugen Bleuler’s work on schizophrenia. It is also consistent with psychodynamic theories (see PDM-2) on the organization of personality on different levels including, among others, a psychotic level of personality organization. Research on the continuum of psychosis has offered substantial support to the view that psychotic phenotypes are significantly more prevalent than clinical psychosis. Objectives This may imply that being “psychotic” is not necessarily being ill. This assumption raises important theoretical and clinical questions: what causes psychosis to manifest itself clinically and, conversely, what possibly prevents it from doing so? Methods At the same time, it potentially frees psychiatry from certain diagnostic and therapeutic impasses. It allows for a shift of emphasis from misguiding classifications and often frustrating “evidence-based” therapeutic attempts to a more personalized approach. Results Diagnosis may thus rely on psychoanalytical “markers” or “indicators” regarding the subject (e.g. deficits in the symbolic register, dysregulated rapport with one’s body, problematic inscription in social relations etc.) at least as much as on symptomic phenomenology. Therapy may also take advantage of and deploy the unique coping strategies employed by the psychotic individual. Conclusions The diagnostic and therapeutic insights offered by Lacanian psychoanalysis create the possibility of a fruitful theoretical, diagnostic and therapeutic approach for clinical and subclinical psychotic conditions; indicate that psychoanalysis is indispensable for clinical psychiatry; and signal the possibility of a time-honored alternative to the in-vogue neurocognitive paradigm of “personalized” psychiatry.

Specifically, a young person may have an underlying biological or cognitive vulnerability to bipolar disorder, which results in the reduced effectiveness of the person's “shock absorbers” for significant events. Therefore, when a significant event occurs, he/she may experience more marked cognitive, behavioral, or affective change than would someone without the disorder. Following this, he/she may experience either decreased social or occupational functioning or social withdrawal leading to depression, or increased activity and sleep disruption resulting in mania. These changes may in turn exacerbate the initial mood state, and lead to a cycle towards more marked symptomatology (see Figure 6.1).",

Virtually pathogmonic symptoms include re-experiencing the event through play and ceaselessly repeated behaviors (re-enactments), cognitive distortions when relating the facts (chronological errors, belief in omens), changes in attitudes towards others and life in general, and neurovegetative hyperactivity (hypervigilance, startle responses, difficulties controlling impulses). Although adequate follow-up data are lacking, the disorder can probably become chronic in children, as in adults. This nosographic entity raises the theoretical issue of the roles of life events and individual vulnerability. A number of factors may either \"predispose\" or \"protect\" the child: degree and duration of exposure to the trauma, nature of the event, preexistence of psychiatric disorders, level of cognitive development, sex, degree of social support, and containing or noncontaining attitude of the family. Treatments advocated in adults (pharmacotherapy, cognitive and behavioral therapies, group therapy) remain to be used and evaluated in children.",

      "title": "A CONTRIBUTION TO THE NOSOLOGY OF THE IMPULSE DISORDERS",
      "abstract": "We have presented certain clinical pictures typified by a disorder of impulse. This disorder may express itself in a rather specific symptomatic disturbance appearing as an impulse neurosis, a perversion, or a catathymic crisis. On the other hand, the disturbance may be more diffuse and nonspecific, pervading the total personality and behavior of the individual, expressing itself in a character disorder. In the impulsive character disorder we sometimes find evidence of a relationship to organic factors. However, there is another large group belonging to the impulsive character disorders which does not show such evidence of organicity and yet is characterized by the same infantile, explosive, impulsive behavior seen in the former. In surveying the genetic and dynamic factor, it is apparent that no one factor in and of itself determines the development of an impulse disorder. Constitutional factors, early developmental experiences, present-day forces and stresses impinging upon the individual contribute to the efficacy of the control apparatus or to the strength of drive. Constitutionally, varying drive and control potentials, physiologically as well as psychologically, interweave with early developmental experiences. Among the latter are psychological ones such as oral traumata possibly leading to an intolerance of frustration with demands for immediate gratification. Interference with speech-action relationships may result in the latter persisting as the medium of communication, thus leading to a tendency toward acting out. Physiologically, illness and physical traumata may increase the strength of the drives or weaken the control apparatus. The constitutional and early developmental experiences may lend a quality of impulsivity to the character, which in the face of current forces and stresses may result in impulsive behavior. Specific early experiences may supply the clinical clothing which envelopes the impulse skeleton leading to either direct or distorted expression of a given early impulse. The result is a wide array of clinical syndromes, which have as their common denominator an impulse disorder.",

      "abstract": "Out-of-body experiences (OBEs) are hallucinatory visual experiences that involve seeing the physical body placed in an external visual space. Many psychiatric disorders, brain dysfunctions, pharmacological agents, and altered psychological states are reportedly associated with these phenomena. OBEs have been linked to various brain lesions, particularly in the parietal and temporal regions, psychiatric disorders, severe emotional states like a near-death experience, substance use, migraine, and epilepsy, but very few have been reported in dissociative identity disorder. In this report, we present the case of a 15-year-old male patient who described a strange experience where he found himself to be floating outside his own body while he visualized his own body from a third-person perspective. On further evaluation, a diagnosis of dissociative identity disorder and dissociative fugue was formulated. The patient showed improvement after undergoing abreaction, hypnosis, and relaxation training along with supportive psychotherapy. Dissociative disorders occur due to an internal conflict between ego and self, when a person is unable to successfully repress a traumatic experience, or when a repressed memory or experience comes out of the cocooned barrier, leading to an altered state of perception and self-experience, which is described by the patient as OBE. This report presents a scarce differential in the context of psychiatric illness, which might be helpful in the formulation of approaches toward management in cases of such OBE, making it a strange yet intriguing addition to the literature.",

But, in the specific field of psychosis, there \nis an additional contradiction that a fundamental impossiblility in thinking leds the \nsubject to a paradoxical excess of mentalization and keeps him in anxious and attentive overtones concerning his psychic life, which is very different from what escapes \nfrom this mentalization for a logic of another order in the psychosomatic process.",

      "abstract": "The physical symptoms attending the general paralysis of the insane have been shown to present in their progress three well-defined stages. Some of the earliest physical signs—any one of which associated with a particular form of insanity will almost infallibly indicate the first stage of this special disorder—are the intermittent pulse, the irregular or contracted pupil, the quivering lip or embarrassed articulation. The second stage is marked by loss of power in the upper extremities, by a gait more or less unsteady, by diminished sensation in the cutaneous nerves, or by the loss of some of the special senses. In the third period the disease approaches its climax, in an entire want of motory power, and by an impairment of all the nervous functions so universal, that although organic life may, under careful treatment, be prolonged for a considerable time, the patient may be said to exist rather than to live. Epileptiform attacks may precede or accompany any one of these stages. They sometimes very distinctly mark out their boundaries, or the disorder may run its course without any recognised convulsive seizures.",

      "abstract": "Objectives: The dystonias belong to a group of patologies included on movement disorders. They can be classified in some ways, of which we highlight those in terms of its localization or etiology. Psychogenic dystonia is an exclusion diagnosis, which is infradiagnosed due to the difficulty to specify the disorder. We proposed a review over its use in usual clinical practice, in relation to the symptoms, difficulties of diagnosis, prognosis and treatment. Development: The inconsistency of symptoms and incongruity with the classical symptomatology, and so the poor therapeutic answer to usual treatments set out to the diagnosis. Its psychiatric comorbility with anxiety, depression, somatizations, conversion symptomatology or personality traits would support the diagnosis; but its presence is not strictly necessary. Psychiatric characteristics are sometimes seen trough the basis of movement disorder of neurological origin. Symptoms of depression or anxiety are related with a better prognosis, while cronification, insidious onset, the diagnosis of hypocondria, the factitious disorder or the simulation are related with poor prognosis. It's recommended a combined pharmacologic-psycotherapic treatment. Recent studies with antidepressants have shown encouraging results. Conclusions: It's very important to make a correct differential diagnosis that allows to approach to the disorder to avoid iatrogenia o unnecessary invasive tests.",

Autobiographical amnesia, loss of insight and executive dysfunctions are the major reasons of vulnerable \"self\" in FTD. Mind representation deficits, decrease of perception of emotions and semantic amnesia contribute to reduced recognition of the relative's identity. Alterations of body expressions, social disinhibition, changes in social and religious values decrease the recognition of patient's identity by the relatives. Different psychological components of identity are modified by the FTD such as feeling of unity, of consistency, of temporality and of affiliation. The fact that brain lesions of FTD are focalized can contribute to understand the biological knowledge of \"identity\".

      "abstract": "Torture is considered as physical or mental harassment, torment, causing pain, injuries and humiliation of an innocent person occurring during the shorter or longer period of time. Is human emotional behavior based on primary biological mechanism that human inherited not only from close animal predecessors, but also significantly more distant kinds on evolutionary ladder? Results of researches indicate that aggressiveness is stable pattern of behavior in children and young people. Aggressive behavior of humans decreases over the years, although certain types of personalities preserve stability of aggressive behavior. Psychological profile of torturer includes diagnostical category of antisocial personality disorder. Mental consequences resulting from torture are depression, psychosomatic reactions, aggression, state of anxiety. The contribution of victimology is significant, particularly from aspect of “selecting” psychopathological reaction. It is also important whether the torturer is known to be victims or it is a stranger. It is understandable that consequences are much more severe with people who had unfortunate to be tortured by known person. The most common psychopathological reactions are: 1. Fear lived during the torture. 2. Depressive reaction. 3. Aggression - which may not be demonstrated in adequate manner, may be shifted to other people, which may create interpersonal disputes, before all for the victim and represents one of physical consequences resulting from torture. Torture prevention is problem of individuals, community and society as whole. Degradation of authorities in one society leads to moral erosion, and on its part, to torture on all functioning levels.",

      "title": "Gambling Disorder",
      "abstract": "Gambling disorder is characterized by a persistent and recurrent maladaptive pattern of gambling behavior, preoccupation with gambling activities, loss of control, and continued gambling despite problems in social or occupational functioning (Box 62- ). It is associated with significant financial losses, legal problems, and disrupted interpersonal and familial relationships. Individuals with gambling disorder are also at increased risk for suicide attempts (Phillips et al. 1997), new-onset comorbid psychiatric disorders (Kessler et al. 2008), and several medical conditions (Morasco et al. 2006). DSM-5 Diagnostic Criteria for Gambling Disorder 312.31 F63.0 Persistent and recurrent problematic gambling behavior leading to clinically significant impairment or distress, as indicated by the individual exhibiting four (or more) of the following in a 12-month period: Needs to gamble with increasing amounts of money in order to achieve the desired excitement. Is restless or irritable when attempting to cut down or stop gambling. Has made repeated unsuccessful efforts to control, cut back, or stop gambling. Is often preoccupied with gambling (e.g., having persistent thoughts of reliving past gambling experiences, handicapping or planning the next venture, thinking of ways to get money with which to gamble). Often gambles when feeling distressed (e.g., helpless, guilty, anxious, depressed). After losing money gambling, often returns another day to get even (\"chasing\" one's losses). Lies to conceal the extent of involvement with gambling. Has jeopardized or lost a significant relationship, job, or educational or career opportunity because of gambling. Relies on others to provide money to relieve desperate financial situations caused by gambling. The gambling behavior is not better explained by a manic episode . Specify if: Episodic: Meeting diagnostic criteria at more than one time point, with symptoms subsiding between periods of gambling disorder for at least several months. Persistent: Experiencing continuous symptoms, to meet diagnostic criteria for multiple years. Specify if: In early remission: After full criteria for gambling disorder were previously met, none of the criteria for gambling disorder have been met for at least 3 months but for less than 12 months. In sustained remission: After full criteria for gambling disorder were previously met, none of the criteria for gambling disorder have been met during a period of 12 months or longer. Specify current severity: Mild: 4–5 criteria met. Moderate: 6–7 criteria met. Severe: 8–9 criteria met. Despite its serious consequences (Kessler et al. 2008; Petry et al. 2005), gambling disorder is rarely diagnosed and even more rarely treated (Slutske 2006). Less than 10% of individuals with gambling disorder ever seek treatment (Slutske 2006), probably because of a combination of ambivalence about seeking treatment on the part of the patients and limited access for those who wish to seek it. Although some data suggest that many individuals with gambling disorder recover without formal treatment (Hodgins and el-Guebaly 2000; Slutske et al. 2003), there is no available information on the time to remission in natural recovery or the risk of recurrence. Fortunately, despite our limited knowledge about the epidemiology and etiology of gambling disorders, a growing body of literature has examined pharmacological and psychological treatments for gambling disorder.",

The close relationship between stress and migraine attacks and the significant psychiatric comorbidities in migraine provide evidence of a \"paradigm\" of tight interaction between somatic and psychological aspects in paediatric migraine. In particular in younger children, an uncomfortable situation, a psychological problem or an emotional distress is rarely expressed directly but usually through physical symptoms. So migraine may be considered as a disorder of psychobiological adaptation in which genetic predisposition interplays with internal and/or external environmental influences such as psycho-emotional, climatic, hormonal, dietary or other factors.",

      "title": "The threshold problem of impairment criteria in psychiatric diagnosis",
      "abstract": "Dear Editor, Psychiatric diagnoses are made based on careful ascertainment of cluster of signs and symptoms. However, just having symptoms and signs is not sufficient, these need to create problems to the person (or others around him/her) and manifest as distress or functional impairment. For example, a person may have third-person-discussing-type auditory hallucinations for over a month, but he or she may be able to attend to most social occasions and conduct the occupation as an agriculturist diligently. Similarly, individuals may present with symptoms of cannabis use disorder, but not manifest impairment of substance use disorder.[1] We argue that there is considerable heterogeneity in the conceptualization, practical ascertainment, and interpretation of functional impairment. This results in, at least to some degree, nebulousness of determining the threshold of psychiatric disorders.[2] Determining a threshold has implications in adjudicating the prevalence of psychiatric disorder, whether a psychiatric disorder is in remission, and whether a person needs treatment. We envisage three main reasons contributing to the threshold of psychiatric diagnosis. The first is the individual context of the person being interviewed for a diagnosis. A pilot experiencing sleep difficulties due to anxiety and missing a day of flight would be considered to have a diagnosis, whereas a college student missing a class in a month might not be considered passing the diagnosis threshold. The second is the social and cultural context of the person being evaluated. A person from rural parts of Punjab in India being extremely jocular and interrupting the therapist occasionally may be passed off as nonimpairing. A similar presentation of an individual from rural Tamil Nadu may be considered manifesting impairment associated with an affective illness. The third factor is the experience and expectations of the therapist. The therapist decides whether a person crosses the threshold or not. This may have something to do with how they appraise the information and what clinico-therapeutic experiences they may have had in the past. Since there is heterogeneity in determining the threshold of psychiatric diagnoses, there are a few suggestions to address the issue. One is acceptance of the subjectivity of the process of determining the threshold of diagnosis. One could determine kappa values of interrater reliability of impairment criteria. Interrater reliability of diagnoses and functional impairment assessment has been found to be acceptable, though not completely concordant.[3] The second approach could be greater recognition of contextual aspect in determining diagnosis and addition of an explanatory note on how social, educational, economic, political, legal, and other factors might have influenced determining threshold in a particular case. The third approach could be to put a-priori note during diagnostic evaluation process, when the diagnosis is being made and about in what circumstances or degree of functional impairment would the mental health professional not consider a psychiatric diagnosis or the diagnosis to be deemed to be in remission. To conclude, we do proffer that subjectivity exists in determining the lower threshold of impairment of psychiatric disorders, and being cognizant of this may help in rationally labeling an individual as having psychiatric disorder.

      "title": "[Psychosomatic pain in the field of gynecology. Stages of the formation of psychosomatic reactions and symptoms with examples of cases (author's transl)].",
      "abstract": "1. Understanding disease in the context of a hermeneutic of the ill person's life history forces us to abandon the old understanding of causality which is represented by the model of body-soul polarity. The real onset of an illness has a biographic pre-history. Long latent periods may occur before and between \"functio laesa\" and actual damage to the involved organ. On the basis of psychosomatic case histories, we can conclude that the future-orientation of an individual's life, that for which man must make decisions, is also that which causes the crises situation for those who are suffering. 2. Psychosomatic medicine cannot simply be included in an already existing medical discipline such as, for example, perinatology can be included in gynecology or pediatrics. It implies a whole new understanding of illness and, above all, it requires a new attitude on the part of the physician. The patient must be allowed to cooperate in his self-realization; the physician himself becomes the medicine. 3. An attempt was made to illustrate the concept of \"organ language\" on the basis of 6 brief examples from psychosomatic gynecology. Here only the most important information was presented. According to the concept of \"organ language\", the soma and psyche of the suffering person can represent and interpret each other reciprocally. It also becomes obvious that conflicts at various strata of being can use one and the same physical symptom if a common denominator is present (e.g., defence overagainst a danger, a disease or a role). This type of teleological nosology implies a new dimension for the consideration a disease, namely, the question of the meaning of suffering. 4. The examples cited are almost exclusively found in the understanding of sexuality in the broadest sense of the word. The threat of individuation as the final personality organization resulting from inadequate realization of the individual's own sex determination (Friedrichs) is present. 5. The sixth example clearly illustrates that sexuality is not what it is commonly considered to be. Rather, it permeates all state of personality and extends beyond them into areas of cultural and intellectual life. Whether or not a woman engages in sexual activity is not important (as had originally been thought). What is important is her attitude toward her own sex, toware her sexual activity and, therefore, also toward her partner and the environment. True sexual activity means infinitely more than just the automatic physiological act. In total self-abandonment to the \"Thou\", perfect sexual love becomes a knowing penetration of being. Genesis 4:1 states: \"Now Adam knew Eve his wife...\". The Hebrew word for \"know\" (yada') means both to know and to beget. Through the mystery of this word, something of the perfection, of the \"participation mystique\" in the work of creation becomes transparent in the perfect sexual union of two human beings!",

Principales signos etiologicos: 1. o El delirio de relacion sensitivo se presenta con mas frecuencia sobre un fondo hereditario muy acentuado en individuos que muestran marcada debilidad de orden reactivo y, a veces, de orden endogeno. 2. o La constitucion psicopatica se resalta, en su aspecto biologico general, ante todo por su gran fatigabilidad. El agotamiento causado por el trabajo o por la presion ejercida por los afectos representa un importante momento auxiliar en la evolucion de la enfermedad. La constitucion sexual muestra, al tiempo que una nitidez de las tendencias pasionales, una dificultad del contacto con el sexo opuesto, una inhibicion extremadamente fuerte de las pulsiones y una carencia del instinto erotico. Dicha constitucion revela los estigmas de una maduracion parcialmente retardada. 3. o La edificacion de la enfermedad, una vez se han admitido los elementos endogenos ya expuestos, es psicologica y reaccional, y se caracteriza por la triada formada por el caracter, la experiencia vivida y el medio. 4. o El delirio de relacion sensitivo esta condicionado por la disposicion caracterial 1; se forma segun reglas precisas: cuanto mas sensitiva es la disposi­ cion, mas tipicas son las manifestaciones del delirio. El caracter sensitivo es enor­ memente astenico. Desde una perspectiva psicologica, se ubica entre el caracter expansivo y el caracter astenico puro. Se caracteriza por una falta de expansion, una incapacidad psiquica de efectuar una descarga. La neurosis de relacion sensi­ tiva se diferencia de la variante obsesiva del caracter sensitivo por el contraste mas acentuado de tensiones interiores. La personalidad de un neurotico sensitivo presenta, por una parte, una suavidad extrema, una debilidad, una sutileza, una vulnerabilidad y, por otra parte, un cierto grado de ambicion, de conciencia en si y de tenacidad.

Every hour, someone becomes a victim of violence, a victim of a\r\n psychological trauma, either directly or as a witness. Consequences such as sexual and / or\r\n psychological abuse, participation in war operations, murders, heavy traffic accidents, natural\r\n disasters, sudden deaths of close relatives can be expressed immediately or developed into\r\n posttraumatic stress disorder. If he is a victim, he certainly wants to know what exactly happened\r\n to be able to take healing, recovery and return to normal life circumstances.\r\n Traumatic experience leaves a lasting mental, emotional, behavioral and physical\r\n consequence that the traumatized person wears on a daily basis. The quality of life and health is\r\n impaired. The person is no longer the same as before or before the trauma. It best recognizes and\r\n finds his family suffering the most. Psycho-radiotherapy is distanced and alienated from its\r\n family, can not function normally in a working and family environment, and what is\r\n characteristic not only of a person suffering from illness but also of members of his family is a\r\n feeling of helplessness that occurs. Family members do not know how and how to help. There is\r\n a need to react in time and seek professional help. Successful treatment is very important for\r\n good communication that needs to be established with the patient and that his family is involved\r\n with the patient as well, because it should be the greatest support and support, and this can\r\n greatly affect the course and outcome of the treatment. The first contact of the patient and his\r\n family with the doctor is through a medical interview, and by the arrival of the patient in the\r\n institution and the search for professional help, the health care service begins to be provided on\r\n an individual level for each patient in a holistic approach involving the entire health care team\r\n employees.\r\n Social awareness of human rights, violence and disasters has increased over the last 20 years,\r\n which has contributed to wars and natural disasters, which has led to the development of\r\n psychotraumatology. In Croatia, the area of psychotraumatology began to develop more\r\n intensively at the beginning of the 90s of the last century or during the Homeland War.",

      "abstract": "The term \"theory of mind\" (ToM) refers to the capacity to infer one's own and other persons' mental states (e.g. their beliefs, feelings, intentions or knowledge). It was found that children in the autistic spectrum have deficits in ToM. One of the suggestions was that unlike autistic people, ToM skills are normally developed in schizophrenia patients, but \"lost\" in the first psychotic episode. The deficit may disappear on remission from the acute phase, as described in some studies. A substantial body of research has highlighted the impaired ToM in schizophrenia. There is good empirical evidence that ToM is specifically impaired in schizophrenia and that many psychotic symptoms--for instance, delusions of alien control and persecution, the presence of thought and language disorganization, and other behavioral symptoms--may best be understood in light of a disturbed capacity in patients to relate their own intentions to executing behavior, and to monitor others' intentions. However, it is still under debate how an impaired ToM in schizophrenia is associated with other aspects of cognition, how the impairment fluctuates with acuity or chronicity of the schizophrenic disorder, and if it is a state or trate marker. The paper reviews the current literature and suggests potential implications and future research areas.",

      "abstract": "Four cases of compulsive self-injurious behaviour (SIB) with variable degrees of tissue damage targeted to the painful body part are reported in humans with neuropathic pain. Review of human literature revealed several cases, primarily after central nervous system (CNS) lesions, during which non-psychotic verbally communicating humans (mostly with intact mental status) target specifically the painful part which is usually analgesic or hypoalgesic. In few instances, however, the involved part is not only sentient but also hyperalgesic in part or as a whole. The act is characterized by uncontrollable urge and compulsion, aggravated under conditions of stress, isolation, confusion or depression, and occasionally occurring in patients with personality disorders, ongoing drug abuse and pre-existing compulsive habits (i.e., habitual nail biting or picking). It fails to be deterred by the appearance of the injured part, social mores or even the experience of pain. Successful treatment of underlying painful dysesthesiae with specific medications, neurostimulation or surgery has resulted in marked improvement of dysesthesiae accompanied by wound healing in several cases. The four presented cases and the human literature experience provide evidence that compulsive targeted SIB in humans with neuropathic pain and painful dysesthesiae is consistent with the concept that animal autotomy may result from chronic neuropathic pain after experimental peripheral or CNS lesions.",

Leitsymptome des psychiatrischen Notfalls sind Störungen des Bewusstseins, des Antriebs und der Stimmung. Ein psychiatrischer Notfall erfordert zum Ausschluss einer exogenen Ursache oder organischer Erkrankung neben der Erhebung eines differenzierten psychopathologischen Befundes obligatorisch eine körperliche Untersuchung und den Einsatz apparativer Untersuchungen. Psychiatrische Notfälle sind nach internistischen Notfällen die zweit- bis dritthäufigste Einsatzursache für einen Notarzt. Psychiatrische Störungen werden in Notaufnahmen nur zum geringen Teil erkannt und angemessen versorgt. Selbst bei gesicherter Suchtmitteleinnahme sollte nach weiteren Ursachen für die Symptomatik und nach begleitenden Verletzungen gesucht werden, damit Differenzialdiagnosen nicht übersehen werden. Für Erregungszustände und sich ankündigende Aggressivität gibt es charakteristische Prodromalsymptome. Sie können jedoch auch unvermutet und völlig unverhältnismäßig auftreten (Raptus). Über 10 % der Ärzte erleiden im Laufe ihres Berufslebens Verletzungen als Folge von Aggressivität durch Patienten. Bei Lebensbedrohung, blindwütigem Rasen oder im Erregungssturm ist das entschiedene, unmissverständliche und koordinierte Vorgehen von medizinischem Personal, Ordnungs- und Rettungskräften zur Verhinderung von Personenschäden aus zahlenmäßig hoher Überlegenheit unumgänglich. Mit der Durchführung eines Suizidversuchs ist Suizidalität in der Regel nicht erloschen. Eine Krisenintervention ist auf die unmittelbare Stabilisierung des Patienten ausgerichtet. Eine Krise wird in den seltensten Fällen durch die Krisenintervention gelöst. Die Kombination von Antipsychotika und Benzodiazepinen ist bei schweren Unruhe- und Erregungszuständen am effektivsten. Eine rasche Besserung bei ängstlichen Depressionen oder quälender innerer Unruhe kann durch Benzodiazepine (z. B. Lorazepam) erfolgen. Clomethiazol ist bei manifestem Vorliegen eines Alkoholentzugsdelirs nicht mehr gut wirksam.",

      "abstract": "WHAT IS FROZEN SHOULDER?Frozen shoulder, also known as adhesive capsulitis, is defined as \"a condition of uncertain aetiology, characterised by significant restriction of both active and passive shoulder motion that occurs in the absence of a known intrinsic shoulder disorder\". (1)Patients with frozen shoulder typically experience insidious shoulder stiffness, severe pain that usually worsens at night, and near-complete loss of passive and active external rotation of the shoulder. (2)There are typically no significant findings in the patient's history, clinical examination or radiographic evaluation to explain the loss of motion or pain.Frozen shoulder can be classified as primary or secondary.Primary idiopathic frozen shoulder is often associated with other diseases and conditions, such as diabetes mellitus, and may be the first presentation of a diabetic patient. (3)Patients with systemic diseases such as thyroid diseases (4,5) and Parkinson's disease (6) are at higher risk.Secondary adhesive capsulitis can occur after shoulder injuries or immobilisation (e.g.rotator cuff tendon tear, subacromial impingement, biceps tenosynovitis and calcific tendonitis).These patients develop pain from the shoulder pathology, leading to reduced movement in that shoulder and thus developing frozen shoulder.Frozen shoulder often progresses in three stages: the freezing (painful), frozen (adhesive) and thawing phases (Fig. 1).In the freezing stage, which lasts about 2-9 months, there is a gradual onset of diffuse, severe shoulder pain that typically worsens at night.The pain will begin to subside during the frozen stage with a characteristic progressive loss of glenohumeral flexion, abduction, internal rotation and external rotation.This stage can last for 4-12 months.During the thawing stage, the patient experiences a gradual return of range of motion that takes about 5-26 months to complete. (7,8)Although adhesive capsulitis is often self-limiting, usually resolving in 1-3 years, (9) it can persist, presenting symptoms that are commonly mild; pain is the most common complaint. (10,11)",

      "title": "Doctor patient communication Content or process",
      "abstract": "In the doctor-patient interview, there is a tendency to think of a dichotomy between content or background (the patient's complaint, his symptoms, medical decision-making subject to evidence -evidence-based medicine (EBM)-, drug prescription, etc.) and the process or form of the interview (the modality of the doctor-patient relationship, empathy/assertiveness, sympathy, compassion, transference and countertransference, the placebo effect, etc.). This approach is as reductionist as the usual mind-body dualism. And the problem is that, as in the bio-psychosocial (BPS) approach, the holistic content-process approach to doctor-patient communication has not been integrated into the daily practice of general practitioners (GPs) with little time, who care for most patients with acute and chronic, physical and mental illnesses [1, 2]. General Medicine (GM) presents special characteristics that differentiate it from other medical specialties. In GM it is necessary to evaluate the presentation of symptoms, in addition to the symptoms themselves. That is, the reason for the consultation initiates or emphasizes important issues for the pat ient, and not just symptoms, in a communication context [3, 4]. GPs often assume that in consultation the patient will ment ion the most important symptoms and signs in relation to it, and that patients will spontaneously report all their fears and worries; neither of these assumptions is true (5). When a pat ient comes to the office, the GP must face a certain amount of uncertainty about the evaluation and optimal treatment of it. Uncertainty is frequently represented in terms of probability or normative reasoning, and EBM. But, the reason for consultation expressed by the patient is only a manifest content. The GP must transform or complete those ideas that are latent or initially hidden [6, 7]. Symptoms are often \"disorganized\", not readily recognizable, and can be presented by symbols, as does the arrangement of notes in a musical score. Perhaps the family doctor has to approach the symptoms as if they were \"music\": like a mysterious constellation; seeking order in disorder, or better trying to understand some of the disorder [8]. The symptom is an indicator of a process that is not always fully visible. The loss of internal balance manifests itself in the body in the form of a symptom. In addition, the symptom is not an enemy whose destruction should be the main objective, but can be an ally to find the disease. In reality, the symptom indicates what the patient “misses” (9). The GP try of knowing the latent material by means of “reading the patient’s manifest signs and symbols”. The messages of our patients contain “facts” and “feelings”, and we must be attent ive and understand the emotional messages. The reason for consultation / symptom / manifest problem that the patient initially expresses is a “symbolic representation” (with universal and particular symbols); and in addition, the doctor looks for what seems to be the cause of the patient's problem in the doctor-patient relationship itself [10]. The process of communication or presentation of the reason for the visit that the patient makes to the doctor is itself a content of the health problem, it gives information about the psychic life, and it can be a signal that tells the doctor which direction to take [11-13]. In order to fully understand the symptom we must distance ourselves from the usual valuations. It is convenient to replace an excessively analytical and rational thought, with another plastic, symbolic and analogical one. Illness is a system of interpretation; and to understand disease we have to see a system of relationships. The emotional response expressed by the patient has the effect of a linguistic transfer from social complexity to psychic complexity. Illness is expressed as a contrast –not as its own unequivocal entity, but as a contrast between relationship systems-, as in painting a contour, a line, appears from the contrast between two colours instead of how a line is actually drawn [14].",

Reaction to pain cannot be easily generalized; group differences are postulated, based on sex, age, culture, psychiatric diagnosis and personality variables. Early developmental aspects of pain and discussed in animal studies and case reports but little systematic data exist. Experimental findings show the influence on pain response of cognitive and emotional factors. Clinically, the variables determining perception, reporting and reaction to pain are numerous and harder to study scientifically. Acute and chronic pain should be distinguished: the latter is more complicated, leading of ten to diagnostic problems and management stalemates. Discovering the relationship of pain to emotional phenomena, as cause or effect, is difficult, though essential to effective treatment. Various frames of reference apply: e.g., individual medical, familial, and \"workmen's compensation\" models. Reaction by family, lawyer, or work commission involves potential secondary gain and may reinforce or discourage pathological responses by the patient. The potential of pain for symbolic meaning and its acceptance as a \"legitimate\" medical symptom renders it ideal for both expression and masquerading of intrapsychic and interpersonal conflicts involving anger, punishment, control and dependency. Teaching about pain and its significance is best done in clinical settings such as obstetrical units and multidisciplinary pain clinics. Videotaped modular presentations with discussion provide a satisfactory though less desirable alternative.",

      "title": "Behavior therapy of the sexual disorders",
      "abstract": "The behavioral therapies are bringing with them a new and interestingly effective approach to the treatment of sexual disorders based upon theories of learning. The two basic means used are: (1) reciprocal inhibition, as shown in J. Wolpe's (1958, 1961) systematic desensitization, wherein anxietyprovoking situations are overcome by the presentation of graduated fear stimuli in the presence of relaxation, and (2) aversive techniques, wherein pleasureful sexual sensations are converted to painful ones by chemical or electrical means. Systematic desensitization is what its name implies, a systematic or gradual desensitization to a noxious agent, through the use of the patient's visual imagination. It is most successful when employed against anxiety-provoking situations such as impotence, premature ejaculation, and frigidity. Also against the nonsexual aspects of homosexuality, exhibitionism, and other sexual deviations. The pleasureful aspects of the sexual deviations present another problem. It is no easy task to induce a person to give up what to him is exquisite pleasure. Consequently, aversive therapy is used to convert the pleasure into pain. More of this later. Systematic desensitization is preceded by the taking of a detailed history as in any good medical examination. The history is of particular importance; it is used to determine the fear elements which enter into a disorder. As an instance, a woman who feared snakes was given a realistic synthetic snake to handle. She did so without compunction. Asked why it had not disturbed her, she replied that it was not the snake itself that bothered her, but the eyes and the forked tongue. Any list of fears must include these items separately. For another example, Eysenck (1960) recorded the history of a man with impotence which was present only when attempting intercourse with his wife at home; he did not experience it anywhere else. It appeared that as a young man he had been surprised by an irate husband in the process of seducing his wife. The husband thrashed the patient within an inch of his life. It happened that the wall",

Based on the discrepancy, the somatic symptoms with medically unexplained origins maintains, prolonged chronically, and grow up to FSS owing to various factors; physiological pathways, mood disturbance such as anxiety or depression, doctor-patient relationship, psychosocial stresses, alexithymia and alexisomia, and lack of support systems. As the pathology becomes more and more complicated, the psychosocial stresses, mood disturbance, and physiological dysfunction become more significant. Thus, the pathology falls into a vicious circle. Patients with FSS have common problems or characteristics, and have several overlapped diagnoses. FSS should be treated from aspects of both the similarity and the difference.",

      "abstract": "Over one million mild traumatic brain injuries (TBI) occur annually in the United States. Most of these patients recover full function within about 3 months, but a significant minority do not. Failure to recover as expected following a diagnosed or suspected mild TBI is most commonly related to a concurrent diagnosis or alternative diagnosis or condition. Consideration during the diagnostic process must be given to alternative organic conditions (prior or unsuspected severe TBI, pain, medication side effects or dementia), pre-existing non-organic conditions (active or dormant psychiatric conditions, pre-existing personality characteristics, or social/economic factors), non-clinical conditions (compensation/litigation, malingering) or post-injury psychiatric morbidity (notably depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, panic disorder, or conversion disorder). Scrupulous care must be given during the history, physical examination, and neuropsychologic assessment of the patient to evaluate for different or contributory diagnostic possibilities; not all patients that have symptoms following a blow to the head have traumatic brain injury as the sole etiologic agent for their symptoms. Accurate diagnosis will lead to better treatment and optimal outcomes. Future research should focus on early identification of the 'slow to recover' group to allow early and appropriate treatment.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Patients commonly struggle to fit serious disease into their prior life story. They yearn for coherence and meaning and, like the Biblical Job, often ask, “Why me?” This statement can reflect anger and depression, and can also represent several different questions: (1) Why am I singled out? (why me vs. someone else); (2) What did I do to cause this, and what if I had acted differently? (3) Is this punishment? and (4) Does this fate reflect some kind of order, rather than mere randomness? Many patients wonder if they somehow deserve bad outcomes, and sometimes feel that they do, related to guilt, anger, and fear, even if recognizing, intellectually, that such emotions are unhelpful. Physical explanations of illness (e.g., genetics) often don’t feel fully satisfying. Psychotherapy can potentially ease but not necessarily eliminate these ponderings, and not everyone can afford it. Countless patients and families struggle in ways with which chaplains can assist.",

      "abstract": "The concepts of spirituality and religiosity are studied in the context of cardiac disease and prevention. In psychology, psychosomatics, psychocardiology, spirituality is studied as a feature of human experience, attributed to certain transcendental ideas. Religiosity is a part of a person's self-identification, influencing his experience of interaction with medicine, and more broadly, in general, his worldview and conceptualizations. Spirituality and religiosity are culturally specific, in particular, in Russia, where society has historically formed stereotypes of attitudes on God and other inaccessible ideas. Thus, the Russian society is characterized by lay religiosity, which includes Eastern Orthodox metaphysics along with paganism. In practical cardiology, the concepts of spirituality and religiosity can be realized explicitly (manifestation of faith by a patient and a doctor) and implicitly, without manifestation. Spirituality and religiosity can influence patient adherence, decision making, and more complex psychosomatic processes. Spirituality and religiosity can be a salutogenic factor, which promotes health, improves the psychological and physical state. But they can also mediate morbid effects if a doctor incorrectly addresses them during communication with a patient. Spirituality and religiosity are a part of complex downward system of somatic manifestation of cultural and social factors, the study and consideration of which is obvious in practice.",

However defined, the core features are interpersonal vulnerability, mistrust, and the anticipation of harm from malevolent others which, in its most severe form, can be considered delusional. There have been persisting debates about whether delusional paranoia reflects a qualitatively distinct mental state, as indicated by some phenomenological studies, or lies on a continuum with ordinary suspiciousness. Little is known about the genetics of paranoia, but there is substantial evidence that it is associated with specific social challenges such as disrupted early attachment relationships, living in deprived circumstances, and experiences of victimization. Considerable progress has also been made in developing psychological models which identify the cognitive (jumping to conclusions and bias against disconfirmatory information) and emotional factors (low self-esteem and insecure attachment styles) that contribute to paranoid beliefs.",

      "abstract": "Depression is a disease, a mood disorder which influences emotions, cognitive function and actions of an individual. It is the 4th leading health problem worldwide. More than 350 million people in the world suffer from depression. Depression causes persistent feelings of sadness and loss of interest, possibly leading to numerous emotional problems and to deterioration of physical health. The most common symptoms of depression are feelings of grief or a depressive state, outbursts of anger over minor issues, a loss of interest in previously enjoyable activities or an inability to experience pleasure from them, changes in appetite – weight loss or weight gain, sleeping disorders – insomnia or hypersomnia, lack of energy or an increased feeling of fatigue, aimless actions or sluggish movements and speech, a feeling of worthlessness or a misplaced feeling of guilt, problems reasoning or focusing properly, thoughts of death or suicide, physical pain without a clear cause. It is a known fact that it is normal to feel depressed sometimes. However, it is very important to recognize these feelings in due time. Depression is a serious public health issue because of its high morbidity and mortality rates. Fifteen percent of individuals suffering from depression commit suicide. It is important for affected individuals to seek help from a health care professional in order to rule out different causes of depression, establish an accurate differential diagnosis and provide safe and efficient treatment.\r\n The aim of this study was to establish to what extent the participants are familiar with symptoms of depression and to see to what extent they perceive them in their own emotional experience. The study population consisted of 242 individuals, 179 (74%) female and 63 (26%) male. At the completion of the study we concluded that the majority of participants are familiar with depression as a disease. One third of participants (32%) experienced symptoms of depression at some point of their life. Worldwide statistical data show that the percentage of individuals suffering from depression in the Republic of Croatia is 5,1% for men and 6,2% for women. It is quite clear that this percentage is substantially higher among individuals who participated in the study poll. Numerous studies have shown that depression is a disease with an increasing incidence rate. It is expected that depression will become the second most frequent disease in the coming years.",

      "abstract": "Pain is the most common symptom of disease, which accompanies us from an early age. It is a protective mechanism to which the body responds to harmful stimulus. The definition of pain states that it is a subjective sensory and emotional experience. It is connected to the stimulus that it invokes and is also based on the observation of psychological interpretation of the phenomena taking place. Pain is individual for each person. Pain affects both our previous experience of pain and psychosomatic conditions, depending on the relationship between the psyche and the body. Pain is always an unpleasant sensation. The feeling of pain can be caused by irritation of pain receptors, which can be found in the skin, joints and many internal organs. The cause of pain may also be damage to the nervous system, both the peripheral nerves, brain and spinal cord. Pain can also occur without damage to tissues, although the patient refers to it (psychogenic pain). The process of pain is a complex phenomenon. Experience of pain depends on the strength of the stimulus, individual susceptibility and individual resistance to pain. Pain receptors are sensitive to mechanical, thermal or chemical stimuli. The operation of noxious stimulus to these receptors results in the processing into an electrical signal. This impulse is conducted by nerve fibress into the spinal cord and then to the brain. At this point, there is the realization that something hurts us. Pain is not only somatic in nature, associated with the condition of the body, but it is a multidimensional phenomenon. Therefore, in addition to the physiological process of pain, its subjective perception is also important, which is decided by the central nervous system. It consists of the emotional aspects: suffering and attitude towards pain and pain expression. A review of pain physiology is essential to fully understand the principles of pain management.",

It has been demonstrated<sup>1</sup>that there is little or no correlation between the severity of the mental disturbance and the physical symptoms; children with slight mental disturbance may have extreme physical findings and vice versa.

      "abstract": "La depresion se caracteriza por la presencia de tristeza, perdida de interes o placer, sentimientos de culpa o falta de autoestima, trastornos del sueno o del apetito, sensacion de cansancio y falta de concentracion, es el resultado de interacciones complejas entre factores sociales, psicologicos y biologicos. Quienes han pasado por circunstancias vitales adversas (desempleo, luto, traumatismos psicologicos) tienen mas probabilidades de sufrir depresion. A su vez puede generar mas estres y disfuncion, empeorar la situacion vital de la persona afectada. (OMS, 2017). La depresion puede llegar a hacerse cronica o recurrente y dificultar sensiblemente el desempeno en el trabajo o la escuela y la capacidad para afrontar la vida diaria. La posibilidad diagnostica de un trastorno depresivo a partir de datos observacionales poco especificos: deterioro en la apariencia y aspecto personal, lentitud en los movimientos, marcha cansina, tono de voz bajo, facies tristes o poco expresivas, llanto facil o espontaneo en la consulta, escasa concentracion durante la entrevista, verbalizacion de idealizacion pesimista, quejas hipocondriacas, alteraciones en el ritmo del sueno, quejas somaticas difusas y dificiles de encuadrar. (Alberdi Sadupe, Taboada, & Vazquez , 2006).\r\nEn su forma mas grave, puede conducir al suicidio, si es leve, se puede tratar sin necesidad de tratamiento farmacologico, pero cuando tiene caracter moderado o grave se pueden necesitar farmacos y psicoterapia profesional. (OMS, 2017)\r\nEn un estudio realizado a 500 estudiantes universitarios en Lima-Peru, se encontro que la prevalencia de depresion segun los niveles de complejidad corresponde el 9.7% a depresion leve, el 2.8% a depresion moderada y el 0.05% a una depresion severa. \r\nLa presente investigacion busca determinar la prevalencia de la depresion de los estudiantes universitarios en la ciudad Bucaramanga en el ano 2017; utilizando un instrumento disenado para evaluarla clasificandola: en rango normal, ligeramente deprimido, moderadamente deprimido y severamente deprimido.

      "abstract": "Psychotic states due mainly, but not exclusively, to unusual external circumstances are well known, and are commonly exemplified by such mental disorders as are occasionally met with in persons in prison, or those morbidly homesick, or suffering under the strain and stress of advanced deafness. In the great majority of these instances, however, the external conditions represent only an additional, precipitating aetiological factor which is operating as a trigger mechanism to a mental derangement of non-specific character already present in a latent state. It may therefore be of some theoretical and practical interest to report on a group of acute and subacute psychotic states whose history, features, course and outcome characterize them as constituting a readily recognizable clinical entity of purely psychological, situational origin.",

Fifteen female teachers with functional dysphonia were studied by means of a semistructured interview and psychometric evaluations. Considering dysphonia as the principal symptom, the most frequent diagnosis, in accordance with ICD-10 was \"Other somatoform disorder\" (F-45.8)(9/15). Five patients were diagnosed as motor dissociative disorder (F-44.4). All the patients had some abnormality of personality (5 with personality disorder and 10 with exacerbation of personality traits). The criteria of ICD-10 to classify the functional dysphonia as Somatoform disorder are discussed. It is suggested that certain personality traits are facilitators for somatization.",

      "abstract": "The word \"pain\" is ambiguous, symbolic and it is understood differently by the patient and by the doctor or physiologist. It describes a kind of sensation evoked by harmful stimuli which is a physiological phenomenon indispensable for protection and also suffering caused by injury or disease. The second component of the phenomenon is usually not recognized--this is the reaction to pain. The primary component is centripetal and ascending to brain centers, the second is centrifugal, descending and they both form the reflex arc. This is the pain or nociceptive reflex. Commonly, when we speak of pain we mean only the centripetal part of the reflex which cannot be objectively assessed in medical practise. This part is blocked by anaesthesia before surgical procedures. The second part is the subject of a separate consideration which begins with psychic reaction to pain and pain tolerance, and suffering depend on it. The motor reaction to pain is more spectacular and possible for recording. Three types of this reaction are discerned: flight, defense and suffering expression. Nociceptive sensation is a physiological receptor-mediated sensation, while pathological pain can derive from receptors as well as from nerves /conduction pain, neuropathic differentiation pain/ or from centres/central pain. The pathological pain has clinical features making possible the recognition of its origin, its mechanism for undertaking of appropriate measures. Neuropathic pain is the one most difficult to treat. The receptor-mediated pain continues as long as the stimulus is active, the neuropathic pain is longer lasting.",

Although test scales measuring fatigue and depression share a significant number of items related to somatic functioning,2 most authors distinguish fatigue from depression, the latter being characterized by lack of selfesteem, despair or a feeling of hopelessness. Most authors also agree that fatigue does not depend on overall or motor disability (as measured with the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS)3). This is in line with the clinical observation that fatigue may be the presenting symptom of MS, occurring at a time where there is minimal or no neurological disability.1",

This chapter addresses strategies for the explanation of the diagnosis of PNES, compares their effectiveness, and offers recommendations for delivering the diagnosis. A “positive” diagnostic label (such as “dissociative attacks”) may have advantages over a “negative” label (stating what the problem is not). Explaining PNES as a reflex response to potentially threatening triggers may be acceptable to PNES patients, who tend to experience PNES as a “physical” problem, while providing a rationale for psychological treatment interventions. However, PNES are a heterogeneous disorder and explanations have to be adapted to fit particular patients’ circumstances. How the diagnosis is communicated may be more important than what words are used for the disorder. Additional resources such as leaflets or websites may help patients understand their problem better. The explanation to patients should be followed by clear communication of the diagnosis to other health professionals involved in the patient’s care.",

In most cases, the trauma recalled was child sexual abuse, but in some cases the trauma was ritual abuse by satanic covens. Therapists who treat such patients theorize that memories of extremely traumatic events, especially of early sexual molestation, are so painful that they are barred from awareness by repression or dissociation.1 “Repressed” memories are those that are strictly forbidden to surface, while “dissociated” memories are allowed expression only when the patient is in an alternate state of mind, as in MPD. Whether in the context of MPD or another disorder, repressed or dissociated memories are thought to cause various symptoms, both mental and physical. Patients with repressed memories of childhood rape, for example, may fear intimacy with others or have undiagnosable pelvic pain.",

      "abstract": "Perhaps because of its simplicity and its appeal to \"common sense,\" the concept that \"strain\" or \"distress\" is directly proportional to \"stress\" in the human is often regarded in medical-psychiatric investigation as an established fact. This formulation would appear to be a legacy from several different sources: from the stimulus-response model in experimental animal psychology, from traditional engineering mechanics (eg, the greater the load or \"stress\" on a spring, the greater the displacement or \"strain\" of that spring), and, finally, from what is implied by the infectious disease model in medicine itself (ie, the greater the number of infecting organisms innoculated into a host, the more serious is the ensuing infection likely to The manifestations of this reasoning are varied. Thus, importance is frequently attached to the fact that certain chronic diseases of unknown etiology (eg, diabetes, colitis, hypertension) may have appeared to begin or to become exacerbated during",

      "abstract": "The negative symptoms of schizophrenia comprise a range of deficits in communication, emotional responsiveness, socialisation, capacity for experiencing pleasure, and motivation. Negative symptoms occur alongside positive symptoms such as delusions and hallucinations in acute psychotic episodes, where they generally respond to treatment with antipsychotic medication, but for the 15-20% of patients for whom negative symptoms are enduring,1 2 current treatment strategies have modest benefits at best.\n\nA critical but often difficult clinical distinction is between primary and secondary negative symptoms,3 The former constitute an enduring deficit state within schizophrenia, whereas the latter can be manifestations of depressive features or medication side effects such as bradykinesia (as part of drug induced parkinsonism), or the consequence of positive symptoms (for example, social and emotional withdrawal may be a response to persecutory delusions or reflect a patient’s avoidance of social stimulation to minimise the provocation of intrusive psychotic experiences). Irrespective of cause, persistent negative symptoms disproportionately limit recovery4 and are associated with poorer occupational and social functioning in the community, including a reduced likelihood of living independently.5 6\n\nFindings from studies that have tested drug strategies for negative symptoms in the context of acute psychotic episodes may not be generalisable to those with persistent symptoms. Few published studies have specifically recruited patients with illness characterised by persistent symptoms.\n\nThe introduction of the second generation antipsychotics, such as clozapine, risperidone, and olanzapine, was accompanied by claims of better efficacy against negative symptoms, but whether any such effect is independent of an improvement in positive symptoms or medication …",

      "title": "Basal Ganglia Disease And Depression",
      "abstract": "Abstract Diseases of the basal ganglia are quintessential neuropsychiatric disorders, characterized by abnormal movements, cognitive impairment, and psychiatric symptoms and signs. Depression is common in these illnesses and may occur at presentation or during the course of the illness. Individuals may present to the psychiatrist before seeing a neurologist. Depression is an important target for research, as it affords a unique perspective on the pathophysiology of basal ganglia diseases as well as an alternative method of understanding the biology of mood disorders. Traditionally, basal ganglia diseases are diagnosed and treated by neurologists, who define their onset by specific motor manifestations. Psychiatric symptomatology has been considered peripheral to the understanding of the motor disorders that define basal ganglia diseases. There is growing evidence for the contrary view that mood and affect are integrally related to the evolution of these diseases. For example, in diseases such as Huntington’s disease or Wilson’s disease, where the genetic mutation has been identified, it is possible to identify presymptomatic individuals, prior to the development of motor signs, who are unaware of their genetic status, and determine whether cognitive or psychiatric manifestations occur more often in gene-positive than in genenegative individuals. Another way to examine the role of psychiatric impairment is to study individuals in the general population who have undergone psychiatric assessments and to determine if individuals with a history of affective disorder are more likely to develop specific basal ganglia diseases (e.g., Parkinson’s disease) than individuals without mood disorders. This chapter includes a review of the epidemiology, prevalence, and correlates of depression in basal ganglia diseases and their treatment.",

      "abstract": "The DSM (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders) is a nosology; this means that it is a system of classification of diseases and disorders which primarily present mental and behavioral symptoms, although not exclusively (see, for instance, somatoform disorders), with independence of their etiology, most of them unknown. The DSM has, aside from other characteristics, a double sense; it is at the same time “the classification”, that is, the list of accepted diseases included under certain categories and “the system” for diagnosing them, or what is the same, the diagnostic mechanics of such disorders, which in this case is done through diagnostic criteria and a multiaxial system. The diagnostic criteria are basically the confirmation of the presence of behaviors and mental produce such as thoughts (deliria), personality traits (impulsivity), etc. It is based on the clinical detection of these phenomena in a descriptive manner and does not include etiological or etiopathogenic criteria simply because, beyond theories and models with more or less empirical or experimental basis, for most of the disorders included in the DSM, these are unknown. Furthermore, in some of those where a clear cerebral etiology is recognized, such as Alzheimer s type dementias, the complete etiopathogenic processes are unknown. The inclusion or not of a possible disorder and/or disease into the system, or its removal is carried out by a committee of experts who periodically makes revisions but not at fixed dates. This means that when a revision of the system or new edition is decided, committees of experts for the different categories are created who, after revising the scientific literature available in the period of time between two revisions, the different proposals made by institutions, and with the collaboration of the experts deemed necessary, make proposals which will or will not be accepted by the revision committee. The organization, on which the DSM depends and, therefore becomes its endorser, is the APA (American Psychiatric Association), and hence, the DSM reflects, to a great extent, the thought and dominant positions in the APA at any given moment. This organization is not the only source of influence on the manual. Since its third version in the nineteen-eighties, increasingly more efforts are being made to coordinate with the ICD system, which is the diagnostic coding system of diseases proposed, endorsed and used by the WHO (World Health Organization) and whose Chapter V is dedicated to mental and behavioral disorders. As a result, there is a more or less explicit aim that sooner or later a sole nosology in mental disorders with unique codes for each DSM, MENTAL HEALTH AND PARENTAL ALIENATION SYNDROME",

Of course, this usage eliminates neither illnesses nor the subjective experience of being ill, but it has implications for forensic psychiatry and for the assessment of a person’s legal responsibility. Having schizophrenic delusions constitutes a categorically different state from having only wishful illusions or a vivid imagination. In the context of medicine and psychiatry, we certainly encounter stages that signal fundamental differences. These differences are easily detected when assessing psychotic disorders or similar states, but a lot of differences also arise when assessing perpetrators with personality disorders or simply antisocial behavior. Where, in these states, are the borders that demarcate full responsibility from substantially reduced social responsibility?",

      "title": "Clinical Practice Guidelines for Assessment and Management of Aggressive and Assaultive Behaviour",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION Violence and aggression are common in mental health facilities, sometimes with grave consequences[1] warrant the formation of a guideline that addresses these issues. The combination of extrinsic and intrinsic factors along with the context and setting of violence makes the task of its prevention and management a complex phenomenon. The intrinsic components mainly consisted of personality features, current serious mental stress, and difficulty in managing anger. On the other hand, extrinsic factors are more diverse and depend not only upon the physical and social context where violence and aggression happen but also on the aggressor's attitude, victim's characteristics, health professional's training and experience, and perceived risk of danger.[2] DEFINITIONS OF VIOLENCE AND AGGRESSION Violence and aggression can be defined as a set of activities that may lead to harm to other persons. It can be expressed in actions or words, but the physical damage remains and the purpose is clear.[2] EPIDEMIOLOGY Aggression by patients in psychiatric wards may be a common occurrence. Studies show that 18%-25% of hospitalized patients exhibit violent behavior while in the ward.[3] High occurrence of aggression particularly verbal aggression is also reported by Emergency staff.[4] The association of mental conditions with violence and aggression Contrary to the popular public view that recognized the link between mental health problems (especially serious mental health problems such as bipolar disorder and schizophrenia) and violence, the literature on this fact varies and shows mixed results. People with mental health problems are more likely to become victims of violence than perpetrators, and most people do not engage in violence at all.[5] However, a consensus has emerged among researchers that a small fraction of patients have a relationship between mental health issues and violence. Persons with organic brain dysfunction (post-traumatic, posthead injury, and seizure disorder particularly temporal lobe seizures) tend to exhibit violent and aggressive behaviour. The Epidemiological Catchment area study[6] reported a 7.3% of lifetime prevalence of violence within the population who is free from psychiatric issues. On the other hand, the lifetime prevalence of violence was more than double (16.1%) in persons with schizophrenia or major affective disorders and 35% and 43.6% in those with substance use disorders and substance use disorder with comorbid mental health issues, respectively. An association of violence was noticed, in different meta-analyses with Mood disorders, schizophrenia, and other psychosis.[7-9] A huge number of varieties were recognized with an odds ratio between 1 and 7 for schizophrenia in males and between 4 and 27 for females. For bipolar disorder, the odds ratio extended from 2 to 9. Be that as it may, for both disorders a comorbid substance-use disorder expanded the odds ratio up to 3-fold. In the early 20th century, researchers recognized a set of symptoms called threat/control-over-ride symptoms that seemed to be associated with the risk of violence.[10] Threat/control-over-ride symptoms are delusional symptoms that make an individual feel like he is under threat and under the control of external forces. Personal impact of violence and aggression against self and others Staff within the hospital A fraction of the injuries that happen to staff occur while trying to intervene in fights between patients, but staff may also receive injuries by unpredictable assaults made by patients who respond to their psychiatric symptoms or by confrontation while stopping patients from leaving the ward.[11] Sometimes staff also have to physically intercede to halt patients from harming themselves or attempting to take off to the ward, which may lead to aggression. Individual consequences Patients who carry on violence are likely to encounter more accommodation difficulties, diminished social relations, and social support and be more disconnected. As a result, violence can be dangerous for those involved and have a negative impact on quality of life. Relatives, Carers, and Social networks Family members, carers, and close contacts of patients are more likely to be injured when there is a risk of violence exists. On the other hand, in case the patient is living freely, relatives may pull back and stop supporting and visiting him if they frequently face aggressive and abusive behaviour. In hospitals, staff blames a person's illness as the source of hostility, while patients blame illness, interpersonal problems, and the environment equally as sources of aggression.[12] This staff awareness is critical to understanding how staff responds to incidents of violence and the postincident support needed to effectively manage the impact on themselves and patients.[13] Demographic and premorbid factors Histories of aggression, schizophrenia, and recent illicit drug use are associated with aggression while inconclusive evidence for age, gender, and h/o conduct disorder. Causes of aggressive and violent behavior listed in Table 1.Table 1: Causes of aggressive and violent behaviorRISK FACTORS FOR AGGRESSION AND VIOLENCE Risk factors are characteristics of the patient or their environment and care that make them more likely to behave aggressively. Two types of risk factors: Static risk factors:Historical and remain unchangedExample: Age, sex, family background, and childhood abuse.[14]Dynamic risk factors:Are changeable and hence there is an opportunity for intervention. Examples: Presenting symptoms, alcohol and illicit substance consumption, and compliance issue with treatment.[14] Risk assessment involves identifying risk factors and assessing the likelihood and nature of adverse outcomes. On the other hand, risk management involves methodologies to prevent these negative results from happening or to limit their effect. Some researchers believed that static factors were better suited to assess risk over the long term and dynamic factors for assessing the risk of violence in the short term.[14] VIOLENCE ANDAGGRESSION RISK ASSESSMENT AND PREDICTION Predicting events that are imminent or perceived as imminent is not a trivial task. But, in acute clinical scenarios, it is difficult to perform comprehensive assessments that comprise history and physical and mental status examination in patients with a risk of violence and aggression. Different methods of risk assessment and tool were listed in Tables 2 and 3 respectively.Table 2: Broadly there are three methods to assess riskTable 3: Various violence-related risk assessment toolsVarious places where violence risk may be present Institutional facilities: includes large and small hospitals, nursing homes, long-term care facilities, inpatient/outpatient care facilities, small clinics, and community health facilities. Fieldwork settings: healthcare or social workers who sometimes need to make home visits. Use safety measures in all settings to prevent violence and aggression.[24] MANAGEMENT OF AGGRESSION AND VIOLENCE Management of aggressive and violent behavior will depend upon the sensorium and orientation of the patient at the time of the presentation. If the patient is disoriented/delirious then the management would be as per the guidelines of a delirious patient.[25] If he/she is well oriented and has clear sensorium then management will be as follows. Verbal de-escalation Restrictive interventions Pharmacological management VERBAL DE-ESCALATION Process of verbal de-escalation describe in Table 4 RESTRICTIVE INTERVENTION Modifications as per the environment Personal and institutional alarms to be fixed in easily accessible site. Table 4: Verbal De-escalationCommon restrictive interventions include A. Physical Restraint As per section 97 of the Mental Health Care Act 2017, physical restraint should only be used when there is imminent and immediate harm to the person concerned or to others and it should be authorized by a psychiatrist in charge. Salient points to be considered as per the mental health act 2017 for physical restraint: Physical restraint should not be used longer than necessary. Treating psychiatrist or medical officer should be responsible for ensuring the method and nature of the restraint, its justification, and appropriate record. The nominated representative should be informed if restraint is prolonged beyond 24 hours. It should not be used as a punishment method or counter to staff shortage. A person should be placed under restraint at a place where he can cause no harm to him or others and be under regular supervision by medical personnel. All instances should be reported to the mental health board on monthly basis. For further reference, a reader can use specific restraint guidelines for mental health services in India by Raveesh et al.[27] Techniques used for Physical restraint Approach 1 For physical restrain, patient should be lying down on the bed. Both upper and lower extremities should be tied with soft clothes or bandages. Constant monitoring of patients during mechanical restraint is a must. If constant monitoring is not possible, the patient has to be visually observed for at least 15 minutes of restraint time and should be within eyesight. And keep watch at every 10–15 minutes for the remaining hours. Approach 2 In the prone position, both arm and legs should be joint to the bedside. It should be done with cotton bandage.[2] This will allow some free movement of patient during restrain. Physical restraint techniques should be modified as per the patient's condition and physical health.[2] B. Seclusion Seclusion is not permitted in India as per the existing Mental Health Care Act 2017. However, in western guidelines, seclusion is reported as one of the techniques. It is 'the involuntary imprisonment of an individual in a room from which the individual is physically avoided from moving out. Patients were watched each 10 to 15 minutes through a window within the door.[2] One randomized controlled trial[28] reported a low level of evidence that suggests a minimal restrictive care (seclusion) is as effective as a more prohibitive pathway (mechanical restraint). Three reviews[29-31] reported that although staff believes restrictive measures to be a necessary step, this was also associated with the feeling of regret, trauma, and concern about the therapeutic relationship. Advisable Laboratory Investigations As soon as the patient is cooperative or sedated by pharmacological management, the following investigations may be done to rule out comorbid organic conditions or for the planning of pharmacological management. Full Blood Count Liver Function Test Kidney Function Test Blood Glucose level Electrocardiogram Electrolytes Urinary drug screening Brain scan (optional, after clinical judgment) 3. PHARMACOLOGICAL MANAGEMENT Every individual with aggressive and assaultive behaviour presented with a different set of issues. There is a lack of good scientific literature in the area of medical management in the acute setting for aggressive and assaultive behaviour. Pharmacological management of aggressive and assaultive behaviour should be considered only when other methods of management failed or respond inadequately.[32] Selection of pharmacological treatment for aggressive and assaultive agitation should be based on underlying etiological issues and psychiatric diagnosis. See the overview of pharmacological management of aggression and assaultive behaviour in Figure 1.Figure 1: Outline of pharmacological management of aggressive and violent behaviourPsychiatric reasons for the presentation of acute aggressive behavior are due to psychotic illnesses like schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, schizoaffective disorder, delusional disorder, substance-related issues, conduct disorder, intermittent explosive disorder, and personality problems. Certain patient-related and medication-related factors should be kept in mind before planning an effective management plan.[33] Factors to be considered in the pharmacological management of aggressive and violent behaviour shown in Table 5.Table 5: Factors to be considered in the pharmacological management of aggressive and violent behaviour[ 33 , 35 ]A mainstay for pharmacological treatment of aggressive and assaultive behaviour lies in rapid tranquilization in the short term. Search for psychopathology and/or medical reasons and appropriate management of it should be the next step of action.[2] Presentation of such assaultive and aggressive behaviour is also varied in different settings like community, acute and emergency department, psychiatric inpatient setting, or medical setting. The definition of rapid tranquillization is subject to debate. The major goal of treatment is to archive calmness without oversedation of the patient and rapid control of acutely disturbed behaviour.[2,34] However, in the case of acute behavioural disturbance, level of sedation is required to a much deeper extent. The Recent NICE guideline defines rapid tranquilization specific to the parental route, particularly by intramuscular and in the rare case intravenous route. Although this guideline also highlights the use of oral preparations before parental.[2] The general principles of pharmacological management of aggressive and violent behaviour listed in Table 6.Table 6: Principles of pharmacological management of aggressive and violent behaviourManagement of acute aggressive and violent behaviour No agent preferred over the other. The use of medication is based on various factors as mentioned in Table 5. Use of oral medication must be encouraged before any form of parenteral medicine. But it may depend on the severity of the acute presentation, availability of resources, and patient cooperation. Also, single medication use should be always preferred over a combination of medicines. Summary of some major studies with different medication combinations and their outcome listed in Table 7. A combination of more than one agent leads to develop unnecessary side effects and negative patient experience. The patient's age and hepatic and renal function also consider before prescribing any agent.Table 7: Summary of studies with different medication combinations and their outcome[ 38 - 42 ]A stepwise approach should be considered as shown in the following path [Figure 2] for acute management of aggressive and assaultive behaviour.[2]Figure 2: Stepwise approach for acute management of aggressive and assaultive behaviourOral and inhaled treatment Research supported the early use of oral medication due to the good efficacy of medications in controlling assaultive and violent behaviour. Patients with mild to moderate levels of agitation may show cooperation in taking oral medication. Benzodiazepines and antipsychotics have been used primarily to treat aggression and violent behavior.[2,36] Benzodiazepine acts through the GABA receptors and it has anxiolytic, hypnotic, and anticonvulsant properties.[33] Oral benzodiazepine is available in various formulations like melt –in mouth, oral disintegrated molecule, and buccal preparations. Oral Lorazepam, diazepam, and midazolam were used extensively in the past for controlling violent behaviour. Oral benzodiazepine is relatively safe and less associated with respiratory depression compared to its parental preparations. Both first-generation and second-generation antipsychotics were used due to their brain-calming effect. Oral mouth-dissolving preparations of Olanzapine, Risperidone (both mouth dissolving and solution base preparation), Haloperidol, and Quetiapine have been used for a long time.[33] Sublingual Asenapine has also shown its effectiveness in managing acute behavioural changes.[33] Recently FDA approved inhaled form of Loxapine for the management of acute violent behaviour associated with schizophrenia and bipolar.[37] But the availability of bronchodilator medication should be ensured due to its serious adverse effect of bronchospasm. Commonly used medication and their adverse reactions are given in Table 8.Table 8: Various medication options available for rapid tranquilization, their dosage and maximum dose in 24 h and waiting interval[ 33 , 36 , 38 ]Parenteral treatment Intramuscular preparations of Olanzapine, Haloperidol, Aripiprazole, Lorazepam, and Diazepam have been used for a long. Research has not shown the parental route has any advantage over the oral route in treatment efficacy but the onset of action is rapid with the parental route. A large observational study shows IM Olanzapine is more effective than all other second-generation antipsychotics. The combination of IM midazolam and IM haloperidol is more effective than IM haloperidol alone.[2] NICE recommends intramuscular lorazepam should always try before haloperidol in case of insufficient information to guide the choice of medication.[2] Partial response to intramuscular lorazepam NICE recommends repeated doses of lorazepam based on considering risks and benefits. But in case of the partial response of intramuscular haloperidol addition of intramuscular promethazine should be tried.[2] Avoid the use of a combination of olanzapine intramuscular preparation with an intramuscular benzodiazepine in case of alcohol use.[38] ECG must be carried out before haloperidol because of the risk of QT prolongation.[2,38] The intravenous route is no longer advised as an initial choice for rapid tranquillization.[2,38] Intravenous midazolam is more closely associated with respiratory depression. Flumazenil should have been kept handy whenever the intravenous injection of benzodiazepine is given.[38] Medication to be consider in various psychological conditions [Table 9] and consideration in case of the special populations mention in Table 10.Table 9: The table shows various psychological conditions and medication to be considered[ 32 , 37 , 43 ]Table 10: Consideration in case of special populations[ 2 , 33 , 38 ]Management of agitation in emergency and consultation liaison specific should refer to specific guidelines by Raveesh et al.[43] Monitoring in case of rapid tranquillization Monitoring of sedation with appropriate tools and rating scales like the Ramsay scale, Richmond Agitation Sedation scale, and Sedation Assessment Tool should be carried out and postsedation documentation about the incident and trying to find out the cause for such behaviour is also an important part in the management of patients.[2] If possible, provide one-to-one nursing and eyesight observation for better management of the condition. Continuous monitoring of vital signs is as mentioned follows [Table 11].Table 11: Physical health monitoring in case of rapid tranquillizationFrequent monitoring of vitals every 15-20 min should be ideally carried out for high-risk patients.[2] One should also need to be watchful for acute side effects of antipsychotic medicines like Acute Dystonia, Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome, Acute Confusional State, Hypotension, Irregular Heart rates, and Respiratory Depression due to benzodiazepine.[38,44] Also staff should be trained in providing basic life-saving resuscitation and use of flumazenil in case of severe respiratory depression. Further investigations are required before giving a repeating dosage of medications and rule-out medical causes and medical comorbidities. If the patient is calm and cooperative for mental status examination, then an attempt should be made for the same. Uncooperative violent and aggressive patient at home For emergencies, medical treatment for mental illness may be provided by a registered medical practitioner to a person with mental illness either at a health establishment or in the community with the informed consent of a nominated representative. A nominated representative should be available at the time of evaluation. An emergency is to be considered and needs immediate intervention to prevent: Death or irreversible harm to the health of a person; Person inflicting serious harm to himself or to others; and Person causing serious damage to property belonging to himself or to others where such behavior is believed to flow directly from the person's mental illness. For the purpose of treatment, only the situations mentioned above can be considered. Emergency treatment duration is to be considered up to 72 hours from the initial evaluation by a registered medical practitioner/psychiatrist. Emergency treatment includes transportation of a person with mental illness to the nearest mental healthcare establishment for assessment and management If management at home is not possible or unaffordable relatives or caregivers of such patients should approach the nearest police station for escorting him/her to the nearest psychiatric care facility for management. Management of chronic aggressive and assaultive behaviour In some cases, aggressive and assaultive behaviour may persist for a longer duration. The use of specific medication should be required to control future behaviour. Use of a particular medication is based on consideration of clinical features and mechanism of action of the medication. Since no medication has been approved for this specific indication.[45] The clinician must have to consider other groups of medication apart from antipsychotics and benzodiazepine (i.e., mood stabilizing antiepileptics, antidepressants). The clinician should also try to diagnose underlying psychopathology in-depth and consider substance misuse and personality-related problems in the case of chronic aggressive behaviour. Prolonged use of antipsychotics in the elderly population should be considered against the risks and benefits.[45] Workplace violence in psychiatry Victims of workplace violence subsequently may develop psychological trauma, work avoidance, guilt feeling, powerlessness, and changes in relationships. A follow-up program for addressing these abovementioned responses may be needed that includes counseling, critical incident stress debriefing, an employee-assistance program, and support groups.[24] Safety and health training All staff members should be trained in de-escalation techniques. Training can improve knowledge about hazards and safety measures. Patient, client, and setting-related risk factors include Working directly and alone with a person having a history of violence, substance abuse, gang membership, and possession of arms. Faulty design of working place that may impede safe escape. A deficit in means of emergency communication. Transporting patients. Working in a criminal neighborhood.[24] Organizational risk factors Poor staff training and policies, understaffing, inadequate security, overcrowded patients, and unrestricted movement in hospitals are the organizational risk factors.[24] Training of health workers to reduce risk and violence The topics for training may include a policy for violence prevention and documentation, possible risk factors, warning signs, diffusing anger and methods of dealing with hostile patients, safety devices and safe rooms, a response action plan, and self and staff defense.[24] Appropriate training of supervisors to recognize dangerous situations so that they can avoid putting staff in such risky situations. SUMMARY Aggressive and assaultive behavior is a complex issue and is dealt with effectively with an appropriate management plan. Environmental modification and the safety of another person and the patient should be our priorities. Nonpharmacological methods should be the choice of initial response in case of such acute behavioral disturbance. A pharmacological approach should be used only in case of failure of other strategies. Extensive monitoring of physical health and trying to find out underlying psychopathological issues should be important aspects of care. Certain points like the definition of treatment end points, proper assessment instrument for response measurement, and issues related to consent and library of patients required further research in this area.

      "abstract": "The article lays out a theoretical analysis of the problem with diagnosing apathy in today's research. Apathy is a state characterized by a simultaneous decrease in the behavioral, cognitive and emotional concomitants of goal-directed behavior due to loss of motivation [15]. Behavioral changes lie in a declining everyday problem-solving effectiveness at home or work. Cognitive changes result in reduced cognitive functioning and a lack of plans and life strategies. Emotional changes manifest in a decrease in affective response to events that previously elicited either a positive or negative emotional response. Diagnostic criteria, or the 'gold standard' for apathy, identify behavioral, cognitive, emotional, and social symptoms of apathy that cause clinically significant disorders in personal, social, professional, or other important areas of life. The differential diagnosis of apathy involves its clinical distinction from syndromes such as delirium, dementia, depression, abulia, akinesia, and demoralization. The review can be useful for psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers and all practitioners who interact with people at risk of developing apathetic states.",

Although psychotic states (particularly paranoid) are the commonest shared pathologies met with in clinical practice, obsessional, hysterical, and suicidal behavior have also been reported. Putative mechanisms include imitation, induction, communication, transference, and contagion, and throughout history these terms have been used to name specific forms of the disorder. These disorders, which may be less rare than is usually believed, raise questions about the etiology of mental disorders, particularly in partner B, and reinforce the need to explore the structure of mental symptoms and develop models of mental symptom formation.",

Mental trauma or psychological injury has been underdiagnosed as a basis for litigation, and attorneys often overlook the need to screen accident victims and family members. Clinical data reveal that it is not conclusive to extrapolate findings related to grief to a particular drowning event. Grief is emotional, is often an unknown reaction, and it does not always make sense. As an individual experiences grief, dwelling on what has been lost is part of the normal process. The individual is faced with their loss on a daily basis and for some, moving through this process may be very difficult. This is an assessment conducted by a neuropsychologist or a trained skill psychometrist. Neuropsychological evaluations document patterns of strengths and weakness among cognitive and behavioral functions, behavioral alterations, and cognitive changes resulting from a central nervous system (CNS) disease or injury.",

      "title": "“This Is Not the Original Timeline”: A Case Report of an Extended Dissociative Episode in a Healthy Young Male Accompanied with Severe Decline in Mental State",
      "abstract": "Dissociation is a disconnection between a person’s thoughts, memories, feelings, actions, or sense of who he or she is. Dissociative disorders can be described and understood using the combination of five core symptoms: amnesia, depersonalisation, derealisation, identity confusion, or identity alteration. They are frequently associated with previous experience of trauma. The challenge in diagnosis and the lifetime prevalence of approximately 10% in the general population and clinical psychiatric setting ensures the relevance of this case. We write about a 21-year-old gentleman with history of autism and obsessive compulsive disorder, but no significant medical history was presented to the emergency department with increased anxiety, subsequently progressing to agitation, pacing, and becoming nonverbal. No significant findings were uncovered on laboratory blood testing (other than prolactin 737 mu/L and phosphate 0.35 mmol/L), lumbar puncture, or brain imaging. Consequently, he was admitted to a psychiatric unit for assessment. The patient continued to present with severe disorientation, limited speech, and altered state of consciousness with occasional spastic-like movements. Antipsychotic and benzodiazepine medication was initiated, with no significant change in presentation. The patient continued to be witnessed wandering and having incoherent speech. First signs of improvement came 21 days postadmission with brief conversation and lucidity. This continued to improve over the next 7 days where he was reported to be at his baseline mental state. Environmental stressors including university examinations, the COVID-19 pandemic, and recent contact with his estranged father were possible precipitants to the episode. The patient reported almost complete unawareness of the psychiatric admission. A diagnosis of dissociative disorder, unspecified, was given. This case shows the management and diagnostic challenges of patients presenting with the aforementioned symptoms. There are no formal guidelines for the management of treating dissociative episodes, and this case report suggests the possible benefits of a drug-free period of watchful waiting upon admission.",

      "title": "When disaster strikes, acute stress disorder may follow",
      "abstract": "During and immediately following a traumatic event, people may manifest a pattern of dissociative and anxiety symptoms and other reactions, referred to as Acute Stress Disorder. A review of the empirical literature on psychological reactions to trauma suggest that this pattern of symptoms has often been identified across different kinds of traumatic events. It is likely to constitute a psychological adaptation to a stressful event, limiting painful thoughts and feelings associated with the event and allowing the person to function at least minimally. Continuation of these symptoms, however, may impair the person's quality of life and disrupt social and other functioning. If symptoms last beyond a month following the traumatic event, Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) may ensue, continuing for months or even years after the precipitating event. Hence, it is important to be able to identify this pattern of reactions that may be manifested in reaction to trauma, so that appropriate intervention can be provided. Although it was not officially recognized in the 3rd edition Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM-III-R), Acute Stress Disorder is included as a separate diagnosis in the DSM-IV.",

      "abstract": "Un fenomeno frecuente y de dificil tratamiento en los pacientes psiquiatricos es el dano fisico directo e intencional causado por conductas autolesivas que no se efectuan con una finalidad suicida. La conducta se puede presentar eventualmente en padecimientos psiquiatricos como estados depresivos o psicoticos. Sin embargo, cuando se presenta de manera frecuente, constituye lo que se denomina el sindrome de autolesion deliberada que se puede observar en pacientes con retraso mental y trastornos de personalidad. Este trabajo sustenta una implicacion de las estructuras limbicas que procesan el componente cognoscitivo-afectivo del dolor en el desarrollo del comportamiento autolesivo (CAL). Proponemos que el CAL resulta de una disfuncion en la percepcion nociceptiva, particularmente en los mecanismos de alto orden de procesamiento, donde se integra el dolor como una experiencia consciente y se conceptua como sensacion desagradable. Suponemos que esta alteracion en la percepcion nociceptiva puede considerarse como una consecuencia, manifestacion o sintoma, de una anomalia en la percepcion de si mismo. La alteracion en la percepcion nociceptiva y en la percepcion de si mismo, resultaria, en algunos casos, de la incidencia de factores ambientales desfavorables en personas biologicamente vulnerables, mientras que en otros, seria la anomalia biologica la determinante de la conducta. Se ha encontrado una asociacion entre la incapacidad de reconocer estimulos nociceptivos y la presencia de fenomenos disociativos. Esto ejemplifica la forma en que una respuesta altamente especializada y adaptativa en sujetos sanos ante condiciones amenazantes podria originar, de manera paradojica, conductas poco adaptativas. Los sujetos expuestos de manera cronica a situaciones amenazantes en edades tempranas, son susceptibles de desarrollar un patron de respuesta patologico que podria poner en riesgo su vida.",

      "abstract": "Unlike acute pain that warns us of injury or disease, chronic or persistent pain serves no adaptive purpose. Though there is no agreed on definition of chronic pain, it is commonly referred to as pain that is without biological value, lasting longer than the typical healing time, not responsive to treatments based on specific remedies, and of a duration greater than 6 months. Chronic pain that is severe and intractable has detrimental consequences, including psychological distress, job loss, social isolation, and, not surprisingly, it is highly comorbid with depression and anxiety. Historically, pain without an apparent anatomical or neurophysiological origin was labelled as psychopathological. This approach is damaging to the patient and provider alike. It pollutes the therapeutic relationship by introducing an element of mutual distrust as well as implicit, if not explicit, blame. It is demoralizing to the patient who feels at fault, disbelieved, and alone. Moreover, many medically unexplained pains are now understood to involve an interplay between peripheral and central neurophysiological mechanisms that have gone awry. The new Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, somatic symptom disorder overpsychologizes people with chronic pain; it has low sensitivity and specificity, and it contributes to misdiagnosis, as well as unnecessary stigma. Adjustment disorder remains the most appropriate, accurate, and acceptable diagnosis for people who are overly concerned about their pain.",

      "title": "Motor Disorders",
      "abstract": "Abstract Motor disorders are a group of diseases and syndromes that affect the ability to produce and control movement. They can emerge due to genetic factors or abnormalities in the brain or body acquired after birth, or because of faulty or incomplete physical experiences when learning more complex behavior. Many are first identified in infancy, but onset can occur over the lifespan. Some of these disorders are progressive in nature, whereas others are nonprogressive or static. Individuals diagnosed with these disorders display various motor, perceptual, intellectual, neuropsychological, and psychosocial impairments. The general intellectual functioning level of individuals with motor disorders is variable, with some functioning in the average range and others experiencing significant impairment. Psychological outcomes are also variable. Individuals diagnosed with neurodegenerative disorders frequently experience significant mental deterioration.",

      "abstract": "Characteristic symptoms of Myalgic Encephalomyelitis (ME) are (muscle) weakness, muscle pain, cognitive deficits, neurological abnormalities, but above all post-exertional malaise: a long-lasting increase of symptoms after a minor exertion. In contrast, Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) is primarily defined by 鈥渃hronic fatigue鈥? Since 鈥渃hronic fatigue鈥?is not mandatory for the diagnosis ME, and post-exertional malaise and cognitive deficits are not obligatory for the diagnosis CFS, the case criteria for ME and CFS define two distinct, partly overlapping nosological entities. ME and CFS are considered to be enigmatic diseases, qualified by some authors as 鈥渕edically unexplained syndromes鈥?of 鈥渇unctional syndromes鈥? However, specific abnormalities consistently observed over the years and their direct and indirect sequels can plausibly explain characteristic symptoms, e.g. 鈥渆xhaustion鈥?and pain. Abnormalities established repetitively incorporate immunological aberrations (inflammation, immune activation, immunosuppression, and immune dysfunction), persistent and/or reactivating infections, gastro-intestinal dysbiosis, oxidative and nitrosative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, a (prolonged) deviant response to exertion and orthostatic stress, circulatory deficits, and neurological abnormalities.This article depicts the 4I hypothesis, an explanatory model for ME (CFS) with a central role for four types of immunological abnormalities: inflammation, (Th2-predominated) immune activation, immunosuppression, and immune dysfunction. The potential direct sequels of these abnormalities, e.g. increased oxidative and nitrosative stress, (reactivating or chronic) infections, and their possible indirect consequences, e.g. mitochondrial dysfunction, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA) axis hypofunction, and cardiovascular dysregulation, can plausibly explain various distinctive symptoms of ME/CFS, e.g. 鈥渆xhaustion鈥?

      "abstract": "Sensory deprivation speeds up the degenerative changes normally associated with aging and enhances the loss of functional cells in the central nervous system. Since it connotes reduction or absence of stimulation of the five senses, it involves the patient's physical activity, social relationships, intellectual status and overall \"value system.\" Geriatric patients with various illnesses are particularly vulnerable to sensory deprivation, which becomes increasingly pronounced as physical or mental deterioration progresses. All cells require stimulation for continued growth and activity; lack of stimulation leads to atrophy, with secondary physical or psychosocial abnormalities. Depression acts as a negative reinforcement of stimuli, and anxiety acts as a blocking mechanism. The goal of rehabilitation is to maintain and strengthen the patient's social values and to preserve mental and physical motility. The recommended procedure involves assessment of medical, psychologic and social factors, and determination of whether organic disease is present. A specific treatment plan to meet the individualized needs of each patient is then established so as to minimize sensory deprivation and maximize physical and mental functioning. Re-evaluation (physical and psychologic) at regular intervals establishes a pattern not only for individual comparison but for comparison with results in untreated control groups.",

This is why a holistic, interdisciplinary assessment of pain and suffering is required for each patient and family. The mind, body and spirit are understood in relationship to each other and, in those cases, in relationship to a deity or deities are important to understand.

      "title": "The three aspects of malady.",
      "abstract": "The English language has the luxury of having four different words that describe deficient health states: disease, illness, sickness, and malady. Malady is a term that is not used very often and it does not have a specific denotation: the other three terms do. It is customary to use the word disease in a medical sense, referring to the medical definition of a condition that negatively affects the functioning of an individual. The medical definition will include references to laboratory findings and to the (diminished) performance of different body systems. Usually, the definition of a disease will include notions about causative and risk factors, ideas about the way in which the pathological processes develop, statements about the prognosis, and reactions to different treatments.\r\n\r\nThe word illness is used to describe what persons feel about themselves. They describe their feelings in various ways, sometimes referring to a particular organ (in France, the liver is often seen as being at the bottom of things, the reason for feeling ill; the Slavs use the same word for life and the stomach and complain about its malfunction, Iranians and others refer to their heart, and so on). Sometimes, when feeling ill, patients are uncertain what words to use to describe their state and will choose words that they feel attract the attention of their doctor or their family. Thus, when seeking help from doctors, they will refer to pain in organs and when speaking to their family they will talk about functioning, complain of being tired, unable to do things, and so forth.\r\n\r\nSickness is a word describing yet another aspect of not being in good health. It refers to the societal recognition of the state of illness. Societies recognize certain states of dysfunction and disease as being sufficiently important to be given sickness benefits that include the permission to be absent from work, reimbursement for expenses incurred in the process of treatment and possibly other support.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the three terms do not cover the same territory. They overlap to an extent that will vary from country to country and from one social group to another. Some people who have a disease do not feel ill. Some of those who feel ill or even very ill do not seem to have any physical reason for it, no tissue damage, no dysfunction in the main body systems. Sometimes, sickness will cover people who are neither diseased nor feel ill: such was the case with the psychiatric treatment of dissidents. In some instances people have a disease that is not being recognized by society as being sufficiently important to receive sickness benefits.\r\n\r\nA number of questions arise from this conundrum. Should people who say that they are feeling ill without having any demonstrable tissue damage be considered as malingerers? Should we try to discover an untreatable disease in people who do not feel ill? What should be done to assess needs for care – count the numbers of people who feel ill (and will come forward to seek help), or count those who have a medically diagnosable disease regardless of how they feel? Or define needs on the basis of epidemiological studies that define a case in accordance with the official definition of sickness? And how should we evaluate the success of a health service – by establishing whether the population is satisfied (because those who feel ill have received help)? Or should we be considering that a service is successful if all the people who have a disease have been reached regardless of whether they need or want any help from the health service system?\r\n\r\nThere are conditions that would be considered a sickness by society, a disease by the medical profession and an illness by those who suffer from them. Their number, however, is not all that large as one would think and for conditions that do not fall into this group the questions listed above (and many others) will arise. There is no strict rule that could be followed to answer them nor is it possible to reject any of the three definitions. It is therefore necessary that physicians and public health decision makers remain aware of the three aspects (and territories) of maladies with which they are dealing even if that complicates their life and their actions. Such is the world in which we live.",

Ebenso ist sie gleichzeitig eine Diagnose, bei der entgegen den meisten anderen Störungen der Ätiologiebezug beibehalten wurde. So ist immer ein auslösendes Ereignis gefordert, das in einem bestimmten Zeitraum eine charakteristisch ausgestaltete Symptomatik zur Folge hat. Je nach vorherrschenden Symptomen werden Anpassungsstörungen mit depressiver Stimmung, mit Angst, mit anderen beherrschenden Gefühlszuständen, mit Störung des Sozialverhaltens und Mischformen unterschieden. Leider gibt es keine konkreten Aussagen über die Art und Stärke des auslösenden Ereignisses und über die genaue Schwere der Symptomatik, sodass die Abgrenzung der Anpassungsstörung gegenüber „normalen Reaktionen” einerseits und „höherwertigen” pathologischen Störungen – vor allem der Major Depression – andererseits sehr unscharf ist. Umso weniger verwunderlich ist es daher, dass zu dieser Störung im Vergleich zu anderen nur spärlich Studien vorhanden sind und somit auch nur wenige Aussagen, z. B. zu Prävalenz und Therapie, getroffen werden können. Therapie Verschiedene Interventionen von supportiven Gesprächen bis zur Krisenintervention / Kurzzeittherapie sowie zunehmend auch die EMDR-Technik kommen zum Einsatz. Mittlerweile wurden auch einige wenige spezifische Programme entwickelt, von denen bisher 2 spezielle Psychotherapieformen bei Anpassungsstörungen randomisiert-kontrolliert untersucht wurden. In den letzten Jahren ist die erfreuliche Entwicklung einer Hinwendung zu diesem Thema zu verzeichnen, sodass Hoffnungen auf bessere Diagnostik und Differenzialdiagnostik, vor allem aber auf spezifischere Therapien, berechtigt erscheinen.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The various forms of behavior that constitute the label “challenging behavior” are not diagnostic categories, although they are sometimes treated as such particularly by the medical profession when using psychotropics. These behaviors are usually elicited by residents when they are distressed, confused, disinhibited, misinterpreting situations, deluded, or hallucinating. The behaviors are often transient, but need to be dealt with when they place the resident or others at risk of physical, emotional, or psychological harm. Often the causes are multifactorial, although some can be directly linked to physical problems (delirium, infection, and pain). Owing to the complex nature of many of these behaviors, a comprehensive assessment of the potential causes should be undertaken. This should be done prior to the administration of medication. Once the causes have been identified, individualized approaches aimed at reducing the relevant distress (e.g. improved communication, use of aromatherapy, music, etc.) or confusion (use of memory aids, signage, environmental changes) have been shown to be helpful. However, such strategies need to take account of the needs of the individual with dementia, the staff, and the resources within the care setting. The present case illustrates an approach used by a clinical team that fulfills the above requirements, and the processes by which successful outcomes can be achieved have been illustrated.",

      "title": "Diagnostic and Therapeutic Approach to Hypothalamic Amenorrhea",
      "abstract": "Abstract: Hypothalamic amenorrhea (HA) is a secondary amenorrhea with no evidence of endocrine/systemic causal factors, mainly related to various stressors affecting neuroendocrine control of the reproductive axis. In clinical practice, HA is mainly associated with metabolic, physical, or psychological stress. Stress is the adaptive response of our body through all its homeostatic systems, to external and/or internal stimuli that activate specific and nonspecific physiological pathways. HA occurs generally after severe stressant conditions/situations such as dieting, heavy training, or intense emotional events, all situations that can induce amenorrhea with or without body weight loss and HA is a secondary amenorrhea with a diagnosis of exclusion. In fact, the diagnosis is essentially based on a good anamnestic investigation. It has to be investigated using the clinical history of the patient: occurrence of menarche, menstrual cyclicity, time and modality of amenorrhea, and it has to be exclude any endocrine disease or any metabolic (i.e., diabetes) and systemic disorders. It is necessary to identify any stressant situation induced by loss, family or working problems, weight loss or eating disorders, or physical training or agonist activity. Peculiar, though not specific, endocrine investigations might be proposed but no absolute parameter can be proposed since HA is greatly dependent from individual response to stressors and/or the adaptive response to stress. This article tries to give insights into diagnosis and putative therapeutic strategies.",

      "title": "AMA Hearing Loss/Tinnitus Guidelines",
      "abstract": "Figure.The Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment, now in its sixth edition, presents the most comprehensive system of assessing impairment, utilizing many of the application designs established by the World Health Organization (WHO). Upgrades in the current edition center on clinical expertise and methodologies that improve consistency, precision, standardization, and repeatability.Figure.: Dennis A. Colucci, AuD, MAThis system considers diagnosis, functional symptomatology, physical findings, and epidemiology and clinical studies as the bases for assessment, allowing for standardization across modalities and organ systems, and for rating decisions to be more uniform across patients. HEARING LOSS DOESN'T STAND ALONE People with hearing loss are at a disadvantage when it comes to negotiating activities of daily living, especially when patients are older and have other sensory or motor comorbidities. Each physical or mental challenge adds a layer of impairment to the whole person. For example, adding a cognitive disability or a psychological condition such as post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, anxiety, or suicidal ideation to hearing loss would increase the whole person impairment (WPI). A patient with hearing loss and tinnitus has ratings for each, with the possibility of additional ratings from the mental and behavioral domains for debilitating tinnitus, hyperacusis, or misophonia. To the clinician, hearing loss does not stand alone in the overall health of a person and should be weighed against all factors that affect engagement or isolation because auditory training and neuroplasticity maintenance are daily activities. Understanding the workings of the WPI system is useful for rating how the impairment affects quality of life and, specifically, activities of daily living. This approach is helpful from a number of standpoints, both clinical and legal. The percentage of WPI varies across systems. For example, the functional loss of an eye converts to 16 percent WPI, and the loss of one ear's function is 7 percent WPI. Bilateral profound deafness is rated at 35 percent WPI, while 95 percent vision loss is 100 percent WPI. In the last case, vision loss is considered more of an impairment because it reduces daily functionality, visual mobility, and reading, and requires significant accommodations. Deafness does not prevent mobility or the ability to take care of oneself. For binaural hearing loss WPI, the calculations, originally developed by the American Academy of Otolaryngology–Head and Neck Surgery (AAO–HNS) for a moderate hearing loss, work like this: First, calculate the monaural impairment: Pure-tone average (PTA) = [(0.5 kHz + 1 kHz + 2 kHz + 3 kHz)/4] = dB HL Then, deduct the first 25 dB of loss, and multiply the remainder by 1.5 percent: (dB HL – 25 dB) x 1.5% = impairment For example, if right-ear values are 45, 50, 50, and 55, respectively, right-ear impairment is: (45 + 50 + 50 + 55)/4 = 50 50 – 25 = 25 25 x 1.5% = 37.5% If left-ear values are 40 for all frequencies, left-ear impairment is: (40 + 40 + 40 + 40)/4 = 40 40 – 25 = 15 15 x 1.5% = 22.5% Second, calculate binaural impairment: [5(Better Ear) + Worse Ear]/6 [(5 x 22.5) + 37.5]/6 = 25% Finally, see Table 11-3 of the Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment and select the rating for 25 percent binaural impairment or 9 percent WPI. PROVIDE APPROPRIATE PRESCRIPTIONS The guide is not designed to establish work eligibility, restrict someone from performing a desired skill, or deny access, but rather as an index to set forth a diagnosis and percentage of physical or functional loss, establish permanent loss, and provide a hierarchy of classification for long-term conditions. The taxonomy of classifying impairments such as vertigo is broken into five severity classes based on history, physical examination, and diagnostic or objective findings, with Class 0 signifying minimal impairment and Class 4 the most severe. The fact that hearing loss was recently qualified as a risk factor for accelerating brain aging by reducing brain volume and cognitive abilities increases the importance of hearing loss to the medical professions. Since all advanced hearing technologies essentially have the same outcomes, providing appropriate prescriptive and verification/validation measures is mandatory for every audiologist. As hearing changes, so do communication ability, cognitive function, and psychological factors of depression and disorientation, affecting quality of life and the whole person, not just hearing.",

      "title": "Identifying the constructs to non-melancholic depression: stress",
      "abstract": "As noted in Chapter 1, the binary model of depression viewed one ‘type’ of depression (i. e. reactive or neurotic depression) as essentially being a response to a major or salient life-event stressor. By contrast, the other type of depression (endogenous or melancholic) was seen as a condition that occurred without any such trigger, with the term ‘endogenous’ emphasising that the depression came from ‘within’ rather than from stressors and the environment. We now turn to examine the role of life-event stressors in those with non-melancholic disorders. Life-event stressors may, theoretically, be all-explanatory and contribute totally to the onset of the depressive disorder. Terms such as ‘reactive depression’ and ‘adjustment disorder with depressed mood’ emphasise the contribution of a life event and do not recognise any predisposing or other factor. While life events may vary in their magnitude, one could posit that most of these ‘pure state’ reactions are likely to be in response to cataclysmic or extremely severe depressing events, and where it might be imagined that most people would develop such a depressive condition.",

La ludopatia o juego patologico se refiere al comportamiento desadaptativo, repetido y persistente de juego por dinero (American Psychiatric Association [APA], 2005) que expone a la persona a consecuencias negativas en el plano social, profesional e individual; no es una tarea ni esta impuesto por una urgencia fisica ni moral como si fuera una necesidad real (Kuten, 2006). En este trastorno, las repercusiones se hacen sentir de gran forma en la familia del jugador, la cual recibe los embates del flagelo economico y personal que esta enfermedad implica y conlleva. El DSM-IV-TR la considera como la adiccion de los anos noventa y aquella con mayor frecuencia entre los trastornos del control de impulsos. De este aspecto cabe senalar tres visiones generales formuladas sobre la base de esta enfermedad: por un lado es considerada como trastorno del control de impulsos (APA, 2005) debido la alta impulsividad asociada (Grant & Kim, 2003) la cual se refleja en esta incapacidad por mantener el control sobre el juego y su detencion; por otro lado encontramos con que se le considera como una adiccion no toxica puesto que posee caracteristicas similares a la drogodependencia (Choliz, 2006) como lo vendria siendo:",

I assume that neglect, caused, for example, by right parietal damage, results neither form simple sensory loss and nor from motor impairment. It also appears not to be a unitary disorder. Failures to orient towards salient stimuli, often labelled as “neglect”, can occur because of damage to other brain regions besides the parietal lobe, and in animals other than man. But failures to orient toward stimuli can result from several different types of difficulty. most crudely to organise a response towards the contralesional side (“output” or “intentional” neglect (Valenstein & Heilman, 1981) or from problems of detecting stimuli in contralesional space (“input” neglect).

Suicide may be the end-point of a number of different contributing factors. It is more likely to occur during crisis periods associated with divorce, alcohol and drug abuse, unemployment, clinical depression and other forms of mental illness. Because of this, suicide is often used as a proxy indicator of the mental health status of a population. However, the number of suicides in certain countries may be under-estimated because of the stigma that is associated with the act, or because of data issues associated with reporting criteria (see “Definition and deviations”).",

According to the DSM‐IV‐R, diagnostic criteria include(1) a preoccupation with an imagined or slight appearance defect; if slight defect is apparent, the person's concern is extreme; (2) the preoccupation results in significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other areas of functioning; and (3) the preoccupation is not due to another psychiatric disorder (e.g., anorexia nervosa). A diagnosis of Delusional Disorder, Somatic Type can also be applied to persons who hold their distorted beliefs with delusional intensity. BDD is currently categorized as Somatoform Disorder, although it has been argued that it is more appropriately classified as an obsessive‐compulsive spectrum disorder or an affective spectrum disorder.",

Some individuals do not find it easy to admit to, much less to express, the emotions which are disturbing them; others lack the insight and emotional vocabulary which would help them to associate their physical symptoms with an emotional problem.

In other words, these symptoms have been considered to be categorically different from other forms of human behavior and experience, whether they occur in healthy persons or patients with other psychiatric disorders. In this paper, we advocate a dimensional approach to negative symptoms, which is supported by two main arguments. First, enduring negative symptoms can even be observed in a variety of psychiatric disorders and they are not specific to schizophrenia. Second, we review evidence that negative symptoms show a continuous distribution from apparently healthy subjects to those with a fully developed clinical syndrome. Although the evidence does not allow for a definite decision concerning the dimensional distribution of negative symptoms, it certainly justifies exploring a dimensional approach with respect to its clinical and scientific utility. Understanding negative symptoms as a variation of normal mental processes will strengthen the development of neurocognitive models and treatment approaches.",

      "abstract": "Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) is a complex disease that affects children and adolescents as well as adults. The etiology has not been established. While many pediatricians and other healthcare providers are aware of ME/CFS, they often lack essential knowledge that is necessary for diagnosis and treatment. Many young patients experience symptoms for years before receiving a diagnosis. This Primer, written by the International Writing Group for Pediatric ME/CFS provides information necessary to understand, diagnose, and man-age the symptoms of ME/CFS in children and adolescents. ME/CFS is characterized by overwhelming fatigue with a substantial loss of physical and mental stamina. Cardinal features are malaise and a worsening of symptoms following minimal physical or mental exertion. These post-exertional symptoms can persist for hours, days, or weeks and are not relieved by rest or sleep. Other symptoms include cognitive problems, unrefreshing or disturbed sleep, generalized or localized pain, light-headedness and additional symptoms in multiple organ systems. While some young patients can attend school, on a full or part-time basis, many others are wheelchair dependent, housebound, or bedbound. Prevalence estimates for pediatric ME/CFS vary from 0.1%-0.5%. Because there is no diagnostic test for ME/CFS, diagnosis is purely clinical, based on the history and the exclusion of other fatiguing illnesses by physical examination and medical testing. Co-existing medical conditions including orthostatic intolerance are common. Successful management is based on determining the optimum balance of rest and activity to help prevent post-exertional symptom worsening. Medications are helpful to treat pain, insomnia, orthostatic intolerance and other symptoms. The published literature on ME/CFS and specifically that describing the diagnosis and management of pediatric ME/CFS is very limited. Where published studies are lacking, recommendations are based on the clinical observations and practices of the authors.",

      "abstract": "The term \"illness\" implies a medical disease model, namely that symptoms or syndromes indicate an underlying organic disease - in the case of psychiatry a disorder of the brain. But no brain markers could be identified until today, which would indicate a psychiatric illness or in particular a certain psychiatric illness. Furthermore organic causes of a mental disorder are an exclusion criterion for a diagnosis of a mental disorder. For all these reasons all international classifications systems use the term \"disorder\" instead of \"illness\". Beyond the question if mental disorders are disorders of the brain one might challenge the concept of psychiatric diagnoses at all. Most diagnostic thresholds are arbitrary or imposed on pragmatic grounds. For a categorical diagnosis to be scientifically valid, clear symptom boundaries should separate it from other conditions. But this is rarely the case concerning psychiatric diagnoses. In many respects a dimensional approach would be much more appropriate than a categorical view. A dimensional approach would reflect the fact that mental problems are part of the human condition, which turn into psychiatric disorders when the affected individual cannot perform his or her social roles any longer. The personal, social and environmental factors that determine mental health and mental illness may be clustered conceptually around themes like the development and maintenance of healthy communities and each person's ability to deal with the social world and manage his or her life. All this would be much more helpful than the conceptualisation of mental disorders as brain diseases.",

The DSM-5 defines brief psychotic disorder as a psychotic condition involving the sudden onset of at least one psychotic symptoms such as delusions, hallucinations, disorganized thought processes, disorganized speech and/or behaviors. This condition can also be associated with impaired memory of recent events, screaming, mutism, outlandish dressing, or behaviors. Acute psychotic symptoms can be associated with emotional lability often triggered by substance abuse or severe and acute stress such as the loss of a loved one. Patients ultimately receive the diagnosis of schizophrenia if the symptoms persist for a duration longer than six months. Brief psychotic disorder is often diagnosed in teenage patients, but it is less commonly seen in the females. Although the exact pathophysiology of brief psychotic disorder has not been determined, historically and similarly to schizophrenia it has been strongly linked to familial history. In some cases, it has been preceded by a traumatic and stressful event. Brief psychotic disorder has also been theorized to be the cause of maladaptive defense mechanism to escape a stressor. In this case report, we present a fifteen-year-old female patient who abruptly lost her mother to COVID-19, her adaptation few months following the loss and her eventual reactive psychosis as well as management challenges.",

Symptoms may not be reported in conjunction by the patient and may not be coded as ‘syndrome’. Depending on the setting of the consultation, the cultural background of the participants, and organizational characteristics of the healthcare agency, the formulation for the presented problem may vary. ‘Medically unexplained symptoms’, ‘somatization’, or ‘depression’ may be the diagnostic vignettes for a heterogeneous set of symptoms with affective, visceral, somatic, and cognitive components. Fibromyalgia is one of them. In the context of fibromyalgia, this chapter highlights the interactive ‘looping effect’ of the term.

      "abstract": "A 60-year-old, right-handed woman, with no focal brain lesions, suffered from a progressive impairment in recognising people of personal relevance and public figures familiar to her in the premorbid period. The patient did not suffer from general cognitive deterioration. There was no ecological or clear psychometric evidence of visuoperceptual or visuospatial deficits. Her defective person recognition was not overcome by extra-facial (e.g., observing animated people in their usual surroundings) or extra-visual information (e.g., listening to the voice). Moreover, presenting the correct name in the presence of an unrecognised familiar person failed to prompt her familiarity judgement, or retrieval of the relevant biographical knowledge. The patient also had some recognition difficulties with famous buildings and songs as well as with some common objects. It is argued that the patient's difficulty in identifying familiar people was the consequence of progressive loss of stored exemplars of familiar persons and perhaps also of some other \"unique items\" (famous songs and monuments) in an independent subsystem of semantics that we term \"exemplar semantics.\" We discuss the associative (semantic) nature and specificity of the deficit in person knowledge, the possible top-down negative influences of the loss of exemplars in the person recognition system, and the link between the disorders and the right/left temporal lobe.",

In this section, we summarise what is known about the aetiology and neurobiology of the anxiety disorders included in the International Classification of Diseases, 11th edition (ICD-11) classification of mental disorders: generalised anxiety disorder, panic disorder with or without agoraphobia, specific phobia, social anxiety disorder and separation anxiety disorder [1].

      "title": "Delusions in Major Depressive Disorder: Recommendations for the DSM-V",
      "abstract": "false negatives and false positives may occur. The presence of the delusions may be actively concealed by the patient (for instance, by a mother who is afraid that she will lose her children if she reveals her delusions), or the patient may be unable to fully recognize or report the presence of delusions because of perplexity, psychic retardation or agitation. On the other hand, the expressions sometimes used by patients when talking about their depressive feelings may be misleading, and some severely depressed patients may endorse the strongest terms used in structured interviews even if these terms do not apply to their particular case: this may generate false positives. Delusions are not included in the DSM-IV criteria for a major depressive episode, but their presence can be recorded using the specifier ‘severe with psychotic features’, with the possibility to further specify whether the delusions are ‘mood congruent’ or ‘mood incongruent’ [7] . Thus, the DSM-IV seems to make two assumptions: (a) that every delusional depression will also be severe (i.e. characterized by the presence of several symptoms in excess to those required to make the diagnosis, and by a marked interference with social functioning), and (b) that, in an individual depressive episode, delusions will either be all congruent or all incongruent with depressed mood. In fact, it is not possible to record the concomitant presence of both mood-congruent and mood-incongruent delusions. However, some preliminary research evidence seems to question these two assumptions. One study reported that delusions can also be present in deDelusions are a common symptom in major depressive disorder, occurring in about 25% of hospitalized patients and almost 15% of cases in the community [1, 2] . The phenomenology and prognostic significance of delusions in depressed patients are currently being discussed again within the context of the work on the DSM-V [3–6] . According to the DSM-IV [7] , depressive thoughts, in order to be classified as delusions, must fulfill two criteria: (a) the judgment has to be so extreme as to defy credibility (i.e. the belief has to be of ‘delusional proportions’), and (b) the patient must be unable to acknowledge the possibility that the belief may not be true (i.e. the belief has to be maintained with ‘delusional intensity’). However, in clinical practice, there may be problems in applying these criteria. For instance, the delusional intensity of a belief may fluctuate during a depressive episode: some clinicians and researchers will classify the belief as a delusion even if the delusional intensity is present only for most of the time during the depressive episode, whereas others will require that the delusional intensity be consistently present throughout the depressive episode. Moreover, it happens that a belief fulfills one of the two criteria above but not the other: it is of delusional proportions but not maintained with delusional intensity, or vice versa. In these cases, clinicians and researchers may reach different conclusions about whether or not the patient has a delusion. It is also useful to emphasize that, in the assessment of the presence of delusions in a depressed patient, both Received: June 22, 2007 Accepted after revision: July 30, 2007 Published online: October 18, 2007",

While it can indeed be a symptom accompanying other mental illnesses, it is also a full-blown disorder unto itself, recognized by every major diagnostic manual. Chapter 1 discusses the symptoms of depersonalization/derealization disorder through historical documentation and personal stories. The core symptoms, as outlined in the latest edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, include detachment from one’s whole self or from aspects of the self (such as feelings, thoughts, the body, and agency), as well as detachment from the outside world. Origins of the term “depersonalization” are discussed, and historical as well as current descriptions of symptoms are brought to life through personal quotes and stories. These substantiate depersonalization/derealization as an independent syndrome rather than simply a symptom of other disorders. This chapter sets the stage for a comprehensive exploration of this fascinating, multifaceted, and under-researched condition.",

      "abstract": "La posesión demoníaca, descrita por innumerables culturas a lo largo de la historia, sigue siendo actualmente un tema a discutir dentro del debate entre ciencia y religión. Este ensayo reflexivo, se ha propuesto analizar el fenómeno y abordarlo desde diversas perspectivas psicológicas que nos brinden una posible explicación lógica y coherente del suceso con el fin de esclarecerlo frente a las supersticiones de la cultura a través del método hermenéutico. Los signos de los posesos pueden deberse a otros factores, tanto neurobiológicos como psicológicos, como, por ejemplo, la aversión a los objetos religiosos y el surgimiento de una segunda personalidad, puede deberse a un cuadro de trastorno conversivo (neurosis) o presentarse en la esquizofrenia (psicosis), y la amnesia después del episodio puede deberse a la sobrecarga funcional del cerebro. Existen otros signos más complejos de explicar, como lo son el hablar en lenguas diferentes o la levitación; el primero lo trataremos descriptivamente desde el síndrome del idioma extranjero, que puede presentarse producto de factores neurológicos o en la misma psicosis, y la levitación podemos verla desde la física, con la llamada levitación magnética, a través de una hipótesis en la cual esta condición podría cumplirse en los seres humanos debido a la sobreexcitación cerebral que generaría cierto campo magnético. Finalmente, dentro de los aportes del psicoanálisis encontramos la neurosis como forma en que se manifiesta este fenómeno y damos por concluido que la posesión demoníaca se debe a dos sucesos: neurosis o psicosis, recalcando la importancia del análisis del contexto para realizar criterios diferenciadores en nuestro diagnóstico psicológico.",

These and other movement disorders may also occur as presenting or prominent features of general neurological disorders such as stroke, encephalitis, multiple sclerosis, or CNS tumors. Moreover, they may also occur in the setting of a wide spectrum of systemic diseases, including metabolic and endocrine disorders, intoxications, hematological diseases, cancer, or infection.

      "abstract": "Pain is an uncomfortable feeling that tells you something may be wrong. It can be steady, throbbing, stabbing, aching, pinching, or described in many other ways. Sometimes, it’s just a nuisance, like a mild headache. Other times it can be debilitating. Pain can bring about other physical symptoms, like nausea, dizziness, weakness or drowsiness. It can cause emotional effects like anger, depression, mood swings or irritability. Pain can change your lifestyle and impact your job, relationships and independence. Pain is classified as either acute or chronic. Acute pain is usually severe and short-lived, and is often a signal that your body has been injured. Chronic pain can range from mild to severe, is present for long periods of time, and is often the result of a disease that may require ongoing treatment. When we sense pain, we pay attention to our bodies and can take steps to fix what hurts. Pain also may prevent us from injuring a body part even more. If it didn't hurt to walk on a broken leg, a person might keep using it and cause more damage. If your throat is really sore, you'll probably go to the doctor, who can treat the infection if you have one. Pain itself often modifies the way the central nervous system processes pain, so that a patient actually becomes more sensitive and gets more pain with less provocation. This is called “central sensitization.” (And there’s peripheral sensitization too.) Sensitized patients are not only more sensitive to things that should hurt, but also to ordinary touch and pressure as well. Their pain also “echoes,” fading more slowly than in other people. This phenomenon is usually superimposed over other problems, but it can also occur acutely and be the primary issue, as in complex regional pain syndrome, or amplified pain syndrome, which disporportionately affects everyone.

      "title": "Reactive attachment disorder as an evolutionary adaptation",
      "abstract": "This paper suggests that the behaviours associated with the formal diagnosis of the “disinhibited” form of reactive attachment disorder (RAD) might be seen as a functional adaptation rather than a mental health problem, a facultative response enhancing the probability of survival that is triggered by certain conditions. Although disinhibited RAD is most commonly observed in institutionalised children, similar behaviours may also be a part of the emotional difficulties displayed by some fostered and adopted children (the latter includes those once institutionalised), and these may demonstrate not so much a discrete attachment disorder as either the need to fend for oneself following loss of dedicated caregiving or a lack of opportunity to build specific intimate relationships with dedicated caregivers. In many cases this may be inextricably mixed with the neurobiological and psychological seqelae of maltreatment. Indiscriminate attachment behaviour, from this proposed evolutionary perspective, is less a syndrome of mental ill-health than an astute survival manoeuvre following being orphaned, abandoned or fecklessly reared. Such a response, allied to the innate facility to access caregiving from different adults, could be expected to be initiated by specific events as are the other attachment configurations. Classing disinhibited RAD as an adaptation has implications for helping children brought up under extreme duress when their caregiving environment has changed for the better.",

      "title": "Grief: Aetiology, Symptoms and Management",
      "abstract": "Abstract Grief is a process provoked as a response to different losses, such as death, loss of job, relationship breakdown, some unexpected life events and changes, etc. The experiences of loss and bereavement are very individual. Even though loss is expected, the person feels traumatized, especially if death is provoked by violence, natural disasters, or war. This pandemic, like other disasters (wars, tsunami, earthquakes, floods, etc.) has provoked intensive reactions of grief, reactions that could persist for years. The core symptoms of grief are described in the ICD-11 and DSM-5 manuals. The term “complicated grief” in the medical sense refers to a superimposed process that alters grief and modifies its course for the worse. Prolonged grief disorder (PGD) is characterized by normal grief symptoms, but these are symptoms that remain too intense for too long of a period. This article is a review of the manifestations and duration of grief in different occasions, and it is based on over 50 published papers, and discoveries in the Medline and Psych-Net databases. Commonly described reactions to grief are: shock, disbelief or denial, a high level of anxiety, distress, anger, sadness, insomnia, and a loss of appetite. As predictors for a high/slow decreasing trajectory of grief process are: female gender, reported symptoms of depression before the traumatic event, and higher scores on avoidance. However, grief is transient, even as we are is in the midst of its clutches. People should expect to fluctuate between moments of sadness and mourning, and moments of acceptance, or even happiness for being alive. Researchers suppose that when a crisis passes; most people will be able to bounce back and move on with their lives.",

      "title": "Feeding and swallowing dysfunction in genetic syndromes",
      "abstract": "Abstract Children with genetic syndromes frequently have feeding problems and swallowing dysfunction as a result of the complex interactions between anatomical, medical, physiological, and behavioral factors. Feeding problems associated with genetic disorders may also cause feeding to be unpleasant, negative, or even painful because of choking, coughing, gagging, fatigue, or emesis, resulting in the child to stop eating and to develop behaviors that make it difficult, if not impossible, for a parent to feed their child. In addition, limited experiences with oral intake related to the medical or physical conditions, or other variables such as prematurity, often result in a failure of the child's oral motor skills to develop normally. For example, a child with Pierre Robin sequence may be unable to successfully feed orally, initially, due to micrognathia and glossoptosis. Oral‐motor dysfunction may develop as a result of both anatomical problems, (e.g., cleft lip/palate), lack of experience (e.g., s/p. surgery), or oral motor abnormalities (e.g., brain malformation). Neuromotor coordination impairments such as those associated with Down syndrome (e.g., hypotonia, poor tongue control, and open mouth posture) frequently interfere with the acquisition of effective oral‐motor skills and lead to feeding difficulties. Management of these phenomena is frequently possible, if an appropriate feeding plan exist that allows for three primary factors: (1) feeding program must be safe, (2) feeding program must support optimal growth, and (3) feeding program must be realistic. Researchers have demonstrated the utility of behavioral approaches in the treatment of feeding disorders, such as manipulations in the presentation of foods and drink and consequences for food refusal and acceptance (e.g., praise, extinction, contingent access to preferred foods). However, because a child's failure to eat is not frequently the result of a single cause, evaluation and treatment are typically conducted by an interdisciplinary team usually consisting of a behavioral psychologist, pediatric gastroenterologist, speech pathologist, nutrition, and sometimes other disciplines. This chapter provides an overview of some of the feeding difficulties experience by some of the more common genetic disorders including identification, interventions, and management. © 2008 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.

      "abstract": "Desafortunadamente, los trastornos de personalidad han sido excluidos habitualmente de los ensayos farmacológicos por problemas conceptuales o de medida. Esta falta de estudios, más que la existencia de evidencia negativa, ha llevado a que tradicionalmente se haya considerado que los sujetos con un trastorno de personalidad no se pudieran beneficiar de un adecuado tratamiento farmacológico. Los pacientes que sufren trastorno de personalidad (TP) muestran un funcionamiento social e interpersonal significativamente peor, consumiendo recursos socio-sanitarios con unos pobres resultados. En los TP, la farmacoterapia se utiliza para tratar aspectos específicos, como son los síntomas cognitivos perceptuales, afectivos o los derivados de la impulsividad. Debido a que es un fenómeno polimórfico, se utilizan diferentes tipos de psicofármacos, como por ejemplo, antipsicóticos, antidepresivos o estabilizadores del ánimo. Ha habido pocos intentos sistemáticos de validar los actuales algoritmos de tratamiento de los trastornos de personalidad severos. Esto ha hace que en el momento actual no haya guías en la literatura para el uso de farmacoterapia en el manejo de los TP. El objetivo de este trabajo es llevar a cabo una revisión de los estudios sobre eficacia y tolerabilidad de los psicofármacos en los TP.",

Ces reactions sont marquees par la detresse peri-traumatique et les symptomes dissociatifs. Les sujets predisposes peuvent declencher des troubles psychopathologiques nevrotiques (hysteriques, phobiques ou obsessionnels) ou des desordres psychotiques (trouble reactionnel post-traumatique, trouble psychotique bref, bouffees delirante ou autres affections psychotiques vraies). – Ces reactions disparaissent souvent au bout de quelques jours ou de quelques semaines. Cependant, certaines jeunes victimes voient leurs troubles persister et d’autres commencent a souffrir de symptomes prefigurant un syndrome psychotraumatique. D’autres encore vont inaugurer ou confirmer une psychopathologie nevrotique ou psychotique. – Generalement, chez les jeunes victimes, le syndrome post-traumatique apparait rapidement apres l’evenement critique. Il s’observe frequemment des l’âge de 3 ans. Il se caracterise par la reviviscence de l’evenement adverse sous forme de symptomes intrusifs (flash-back, souvenirs repetitifs, cauchemars, impression que l’evenement pourrait se renouveler, phenomenes moteurs elementaires, conduite de repetition et jeux repetitifs, detresse et reactivite physiologique a l’exposition d’indices rappelant l’evenement), par l’emoussement de la reactivite generale (desinteret pour l’entourage et les activites) et l’evitement des stimuli qui lui sont associes (lieux, personnes, conversations, pensees et sentiments) ainsi que par une hyper activation neurovegetative. – Les nourrissons, les enfants et les adolescents manifestent frequemment des troubles non specifiques aux syndromes post-traumatiques tels les troubles anxieux (crises d’angoisse, agitation, surveillance inquiete de l’environnement, attachement anxieux, exacerbation des peurs infantiles), des symptomes depressifs (desarroi, tristesse, sentiment de solitude, inhibition motrice et intellectuelle, repli sur soi, sentiments de culpabilite excessifs et inappropries), des desordres psychosomatiques (symptomes neurovegetatifs, asthenie, douleurs psychogenes, regain d’une maladie psychosomatique preexistante), des perturbations du comportement (auto – et hetero-agressivite, conduites a risque, instabilite motrice, troubles du sommeil, desordres alimentaires, dependances) ainsi que des comportements regressifs et des difficultes d’apprentissage. – Le DSM-IV repertorie l’Etat de Stress Aigu englobant tant les reactions de survenue immediate durant au moins deux jours que les reponses post-immediates perdurant jusqu’a quatre semaines apres l’incident.

Generally there is an increased vitality, a state of hyperæsthesia, an increase in the activity of the brain, generally of the whole brain, and we must believe that these states will not so easily end in complete resolution as the condition of merely depressed action, or rather no action, which obtains in melancholia—I mean in melancholia generally, and not those states of acute melancholia which are supposed to be closely allied to the state which in other brains and under other subjective circumstances would give rise to mania from a pathological point of view.

La ceguera, diplopia o paralisis de la mirada son los signos neuroftalmologicos mas frecuentes en el trastorno conversivo. Describimos el caso de un nino con ptosis como manifestacion de un trastorno conversivo. Metodo y resultados: Varon de 9 anos en estudio por ptosis unilateral izquierda de inicio brusco, sin antecedentes medicos relevantes. En la exploracion se aprecia ptosis de ceja y palpebral izquierda, sin alteraciones de la motilidad ocular intrinseca ni extrinseca. Dado que la exploracion no se justifica por patologia de ningun par craneal, se sospecha ptosis miogenica y se solicita estudio. Las pruebas complementarias, tales como analitica autoinmune, test de estimulacion repetitiva, etc. fueron negativas. Tras descartar patologia organica y conocer situacion emocional inestable por separacion de sus padres, es valorado por el servicio de psiquiatria con diagnostico de trastorno conversivo. Conclusion: La ptosis es una rara manifestacion del trastorno conversivo, y aun mas en la infancia. Solo hemos encontrado dos casos descritos en la literatura. Es importante descartar patologia organica, diferenciar esta patologia de la simulacion y conocerla para incluirla en el diagnostico diferencial de la ptosis. EnglishPurpose: Conversion disorder is defined by DSM-IV as a deficit of sensory or motor function that cannot be explained by a medical condition and where psychological factors are judged to be associated with the deficit because symptoms are preceded by conflicts or other stressors. Blindness, diplopia or paralysis of the gaze are the most frequent neurophthalmological signs in the conversion disorder. We describe the case of a child with ptosis as a manifestation of a conversion disorder. Method and results: A 9-year-old male with abrupt left unilateral ptosis, without relevant medical history. On exploration, present left eyebrow and palpebral ptosis, without intrinsic or extrinsic ocular motility alterations. Since the examination is not justified by pathology of any cranial nerve pair, myogenic ptosis is suspected and study. Complementary tests were negative (autoimmune analytics, repetitive stimulation test, etc.). After ruling out organic pathology and knowing unstable emotional situation by separation from their parents, it is valued by the psychiatry service with a diagnosis of conversion disorder. Conclusion: Ptosis is a rare manifestation of the conversion disorder, and even more so in childhood. We have only found two cases in the literature. It is important to rule out organic pathology, differentiate this pathology from the simulation and know it to include in the differential diagnosis of ptosis.",

      "abstract": "Here's how my version of Webster's dictionary defines these terms: * Disease: A particular distinctive process in the body with a specific cause and characteristic symptoms. * Disorder: Irregularity, disturbance, or interruption of normal functions. * Syndrome: A number of symptoms occurring together and characterizing a specific disease. Let's consider 4 facts that may be relevant for this decision. [ILLUSTRATION OMITTED] Probably not 'diseases' No objective laboratory test can differentiate 1 psychiatric malady from another, and this lack of specificity casts doubt on the disease model. However, many documented perturbations of normal brain functions are consistent with a disorder paradigm. Symptom overlap The signs and symptoms of psychiatric ailments overlap considerably. Depression and anxiety share many symptoms and frequently co-occur. Bipolar mania and schizophrenia share psychotic features, cognitive deficits, agitation, suicidality, aggressive behavior, etc. The obsessions of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) resemble and sometimes morph into the fixed false beliefs (delusions) of psychosis, and OCD's compulsions often characterize the behaviors of other psychiatric disorders, such as anorexia or bulimia nervosa. Personality disorder features essentially are attenuated but enduring forms of Axis I conditions. Nearly all psychiatric illnesses have some degree of suicidality, insomnia, and addictive behavior. Posttraumatic stress disorder's symptoms recapitulate those of numerous diagnostic categories, such as anxiety, depression, psychosis, negative symptoms, mania, OCD, impulsive behavior, and personality changes. Common neurobiology Most diagnostic categories in psychiatry share some neurobiologic features, such as: * neurotransmitter pathways (serotonin, dopamine, norepinephrine, or glutamate) * structural abnormalities on neuroimaging (cortical atrophy, ventriculomegaly, gray and/or white matter abnormalities) or * genetic predispositions. Medical and psychiatric comorbidities (migraine, chronic pain, diabetes, obesity, alcohol abuse, anxiety, eating disorders, and Axis II features) occur across all major psychiatric diagnoses. Nonspecific medications Psychotropics approved for treating 1 condition are frequently useful for others: * Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors initially were indicated for depression but soon were found to have efficacy for panic attacks, social phobia, OCD, bulimia, impulse dyscontrol, and fibromyalgia. …",

      "title": "CAUSES AND MANAGEMENT OF STRESS AT WORK",
      "abstract": "tress has been defined in different ways over the years.Originally, it was conceived of as pressure from the environment, then as strain within the person.The generally accepted definition today is one of interaction between the situation and the individual.It is the psychological and physical state that results when the resources of the individual are not sufficient to cope with the demands and pressures of the situation.Thus, stress is more likely in some situations than others and in some individuals than others.Stress can undermine the achievement of goals, both for individuals and for organisations (box 1).Signs of stress can be seen in people's behaviour, especially in changes in behaviour.Acute responses to stress may be in the areas of feelings (for example, anxiety, depression, irritability, fatigue), behaviour (for example, being withdrawn, aggressive, tearful, unmotivated), thinking (for example, difficulties of concentration and problem solving) or physical symptoms (for example, palpitations, nausea, headaches).If stress persists, there are changes in neuroendocrine, cardiovascular, autonomic and immunological functioning, leading to mental and physical ill health (for example anxiety, depression, heart disease) (box 2, fig 1). 1 Situations that are likely to cause stress are those that are unpredictable or uncontrollable, uncertain, ambiguous or unfamiliar, or involving conflict, loss or performance expectations.Stress may be caused by time limited events, such as the pressures of examinations or work deadlines, or by ongoing situations, such as family demands, job insecurity, or long commuting journeys.Resources that help meet the pressures and demands faced at work include personal characteristics such as coping skills (for example, problem solving, assertiveness, time management) and the work situation such as a good working environment and social support.These resources can be increased by investment in work infrastructure, training, good management and employment practices, and the way that work is organised.Historically, the typical response from employers to stress at work has been to blame the victim of stress, rather than its cause.Increasingly, it is being recognised that employers have a duty, in many cases in law, to ensure that employees do not become ill.It is also in their long term economic interests to prevent stress, as stress is likely to lead to high staff turnover, an increase in sickness absence and early retirement, increased stress in those staff still at work, reduced work performance and increased rate of accidents, and reduced client satisfaction.Good employment practice includes assessing the risk of stress amongst employees.This involves:c looking for pressures at work which could cause high and long lasting levels of stress c deciding who might be harmed by these c deciding whether you are doing enough to prevent that harm. c HOW STRESS IS CAUSEDThe degree of stress experienced depends on the functioning of two protective physiological mechanisms:c \"Alarm reaction\".When confronted with a threat to our safety, our first response is physiological arousal: our muscles tense and breathing and heart rate become more rapid.This serves us well when the threat is the proverbial bull in the field rushing towards us.We either fight or flee.Present day threats tend to be more psychological-for example, unjustified verbal attack by a superior at work.It is usually not socially acceptable to act by \"fight or flight\", and an alternative means of expressing the resultant emotional and physical energy is required.This falls in the arena of assertive communication.c \"Adaptation\".The second adaptive mechanism allows us to cease responding when we learn that stimuli in the environment are no longer a threat to our safety.For example, when we first spend time in a house near a railway line, our response to trains hurtling past is to be startled, as described above.Over time, our response dwindles.If this process did not function, we would eventually collapse from physical wear and tear, and mental exhaustion.",

      "abstract": "Tics describe a wide range of sudden and repetitive behaviors. Their multifaceted clinical features may resemble other explosive behaviors, including repetitive episodes of aggression toward others (allo-aggression) reported by subjects without tics. Here, we document 3 exemplary cases that help disentangle allo-aggressive behaviors from tics.We report 3 cases who presented with an array of complex repetitive behaviors, most notably allo-aggression (eg, sudden kicking, hitting, slapping and biting others, or pushing someone off a bike), which were misdiagnosed as primary tics. In all cases, additional symptoms, such as blackouts, feeling of being controlled by different personalities, or being empowered by repetitive behaviors, and examination pointed toward different neuropsychiatric diagnoses.Repetitive allo-aggressive behaviors are not part of the range of motor manifestations of tics. This observation not only has important medico-legal implications but is also relevant for the overall perception of Tourette syndrome and other primary tic disorders.",

      "title": "Post traumatic stress disorder in postpartum: when guilt delays recovery. A case report",
      "abstract": "Introduction PTSD is a mental disorder that may develop after exposure to threatening or horrifying events. PTSD is characterized by the following: 1) re-experiencing the traumatic event or events in the present in the form of vivid intrusive memories, flashbacks, or nightmares. Re-experiencing may occur via one or multiple sensory modalities and is typically accompanied by strong or overwhelming emotions, particularly fear or horror, and strong physical sensations; 2) avoidance of thoughts and memories of the event or events, activities, situations, or people reminiscent of the event(s); and 3) persistent perceptions of heightened current threat. The symptoms persist for at least several weeks and cause significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. Some reviewes found that PTSD is prevalent during pregnancy and after birth and may increase during postpartum if not identified and treated. It can affect women, their relationship and birth outcomes aswell as infant emotion regulation and development. The findings indicate that there are links between psychological, traumatic and birth-related risk factors as well as the perceived social support and the possible PTSD following childbirth in mothers and partners. Objectives A case report is presented alongside a review of the relevant literature regarding the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of PTSD. Methods We present a case report of a 34-year-old woman with no previous contact with Mental Health Services. She got pregnant unexpectedly in the context of a long stable relationship. At the beginning she was feeling uncertain about carrying on with the pregnancy but finally decided to keep it. She states she felt well throughout the pregnancy. The night after giving birth her baby suffered from a cardiorespiratory arrest, which was noticed by the nursing team but not by the mother. The baby recovered with no medical sequelae but the patient started feeling depressed and presenting anergy, apathy, irritability, flashbacks, and intrusive memories of her sick baby and insomnia, checking every hour during the night that her child was still breathing. Later she developed separation anxiety from her baby, not being able to leave her in the kindergartner nor to leave her alone with other family members (including the father). Guilty feelings were persistantly observed during the therapy sessions. Results Psychotherapeutic and pharmacological treatment was started with moderate improvement. Since breastfeeding was a rewarding experience and enforced the mother-daughter bond it was taken in consideration for the therapeutic plan. Conclusions The postpartum period is of special vulnerability and early treatment of symptoms in mothers is of great importance. Early diagnosis in maternity services should be a priority.

      "title": "Somatoform Disorders",
      "abstract": "Around the world, physical symptoms are the most common manifestation of psychological distress. This seeming contradiction presents a diagnostic challenge for health care professionals who are consulted to provide treatment and illness management. In many situations, it is difficult to clearly identify the psychological cause of physical symptoms, and, at times, it is equally difficult to exclude the possibility of an underlying biomedical process. This clinical challenge has led to the construction of the diagnostic category of somatoform disorders, a group of psychiatric disorders characterized by the presence of physical symptoms causing significant distress or functional impairment that cannot be fully explained by a general medical condition, substance use, or any other mental disorder. This category of disorders was established based on clinical utility and the need to exclude medical causes in health care settings rather than on a theoretical model of psychopathology or shared etiology. In the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV-TR, American Psychiatric Association 2000, cited under Classification), the somatoform disorders include somatization disorder, hypochondriasis, body dysmorphic disorder, conversion disorder, pain disorder, undifferentiated somatoform disorder, and somatoform disorder not otherwise specified. Some authors prefer other terminology, including use of the terms medically unexplained symptoms, emphasizing the uncertainty about diagnosis, or functional somatic syndromes, suggesting that symptoms are due to disturbances in the function of psychophysiological systems rather than structural or anatomical pathology.",

      "title": "The frailty process: update of the phenotype and preventive strategies",
      "abstract": "Frailty has long been considered synonymous with disability and co-morbidity, to be highly prevalent in old age and to confer high risk for falls, hospitalization, and mortality. However it is becoming recognized that frailty may be a distinct clinical syndrome with a biologic basis. The frailty process appears as a transitional state in the dynamic progression from robustness through to functional decline. During this process, total physiological reserves decrease, and become less likely to be sufficient to maintain and repair the ageing body. The lack of consensus on the definition of frailty is partially related to the widespread use of the expression for different aspects of the condition. Longitudinal studies have demonstrated that slow gait, fatigue, exhaustion, anorexia, unintentional weight loss and reduced muscle strength should all be considered as major symptoms of frailty. At the stage of frailty, clinicians can easily distinguish frail from non-frail older adults using factors such as appearance (consistent or not with age), nutritional status (thin, weight loss), subjective health rating (health perception), performance (cognition, fatigue), sensory/physical impairments (vision, hearing, strength), and current care (medication, hospital). The process of “becoming frail” is silent and insidious. A better understanding of these clinical changes and their underlying mechanisms, beginning with the pre-frail state, may confirm the impression held by many geriatricians, that increasing frailty is distinguishable from ageing, and in consequence is potentially reversible. We therefore provide an update of the physiopathology and clinical, and biological characteristics of the frailty process, and speculate on possible preventive approaches.",

      "abstract": "Summary Chronic pain syndrome is a major health and socioeconomic problem that is manifested by frequent asking of medical assistance, high price of health care, sick leave, work inability and disability as well as frequent compensation requests. Generally speaking, pain, especially chronic pain, significantly diminishes the patient and their family’s quality of life. Most people experience one or more pain disorders during their life. Chronic pain prevalence accounts for 15 to 22% in population. It occurs more frequently in women, in older age and persons of decreased socioeconomic status. Chronic pain can be causally linked to comorbid psychiatric disorders, such as fear of physical illness, constant worry, anxious disorders, depression and reaction to stress. Every pain, especially chronic, has psychological characteristics as well which are expressed to an extent. When the pathophysiologic factor is known, the pain is conventionally classified as “specific” and when it is unknown it is called “nonspecific”, psychogenic, idiopathic, conversive or euphemistic atypical pain. Nonspecific pain is very often a symptom of a psychiatric disorder or it is classified in the group of soma toform psychiatric disorders according to contemporary classification systems, e.g. the American Psychiatric Association’s DSM-IV and the International Classification of Di seases (ICD-10). Psychosomatic medicine studies the connection of psychological conditions and psychiatric disorders, psychosocial stress, family and occupational factors with somatic disorders. On the other hand, a painful somatic illness can cause anxiety, depression, social phobia and isolation. Treating nonspecific psychogenic pain disorder is not possible without a holistic, integrative, interdisciplinary team approach of psychiatrists, psychologists, physiologists, neurologists and sometimes even neurosurgeons.

Pathological laughter occurs when laughter is inappropriate, unrestrained (forced), uncontrollable, or dissociated from any stimulus. Pathological laughter is found in three main conditions: a) pseudobulbar palsy; b) gelastic epilepsy; and c) psychiatric illnesses. It is also found in other pathological conditions.

Seorang laki-laki bernama AY, berusia 28 tahun, dan tidak tamat sekolah dasar tidak memiliki figur ayah. Klien AY pernah bekerja secara wajar serta menyukai lawan jenis. Kemunduran fungsi psikologis kemudian terjadi. Simtom negatif dari skizofrenia pada AY sangat menonjol, yaitu sedikit berbicara, afek datar, menarik diri dari pergaulan sosial, minat dan ambisi kurang, dan dorongan vitalitas rendah. AY memiliki ide atau pikiran-pikiran bahwa dirinya bersalah, berdosa, dan memandang sesuatu tampak kotor sehingga terdapat perilaku mencuci yang berulang-ulang.

Kata kunci: skizofrenia simpleks, simtom negatif, diagnosis, ego ABSTRACT Simple Schizophrenia is an unusual type of schizophrenia characterized by slow, progressive development of negative symptoms of schizophrenia, such as inability to meet community demands, and overall performance degradation. Unlike other types of schizophrenia (hebephrenic, paranoid, and catatonic), simple schizophrenia is difficult to determine the diagnosis. Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) V cleared the diagnosis for simple schizophrenia, but in the Mental Disorder Diagnostic Classification Guidelines (MDDCG) III and International and Classification Diseases (ICD) -10 are included. This case study discusses patients diagnosed with simple schizophrenia with a comparative diagnosis of severe depressive episodes with psychotic symptoms. A man named AY, aged 28 years, and did not finish primary school has no father figure. He has worked fairly and liked the woman. The decline of psychological function then occurs. The negative symptoms of schizophrenia in AY are very prominent, ie, little speech, flat affects, withdrawal from social intercourse, lack of interest and ambition, and low vitality drive. AY has ideas or thoughts that he is guilty, sinful, and looks at something so dirty that there is repetitive washing behavior. The integration result of psychological tests shows pathological signs, such as depression, anxiety, and affective disorders. The psychological dynamics of AY shows some traumatic experiences in childhood that are repressed. Conflict that develops with the mother so as to produce a complex between alien ego with ego.

      "abstract": "Abstract: Both physical and mental health is intimately linked. People who have a significant mental illness are more prone to suffer from a variety of chronic physical diseases. People who have long-term medical issues, on the other hand are more than twice as likely to be depressed and anxiety as the general population. The goal of the research is to better understand the impact of mental illness on the body. This disease has social consequences in terms of diminished efficiency and increased health-care utilization. The first step is to comprehend the relationship between the mind and the body in devising treatments to reduce the occurrence of co-existing diseases and treat those who do have mental illnesses and chronic physical difficulties and . Depression can be accompanied by practically any other mental or physical ailment. Physical illness increases the likelihood of developing a major type of depression. At work, there are two separate processes. The one that stands out the most is based on psychological or cognitive issues. As a result, due to a life event or persistent struggle, the disease might be the spark for a depressive episode in a handicapped person. Second, there are more complicated relationships between depression and certain health disorders. In terms of etiology, they might be very intriguing. Stroke and coronary disease are perhaps the best examples. Finally, severe depression, but particularly minor depression, dysthymia, and depressive symptoms, which patients present to their physicians, merge with other signs of human distress. Such somatic manifestations put the traditional distinction between physical and mental illness to the test, and they are a perennial subject of debate.

The specific clinical frame is justified by the following considerations: 1) in a psychopathological light all the disorders imply an altered relationship with the personal experienced body; 2) in a prognostic light the \"experienced body\" involvement given specific and common features; 3) clinically a one-other manifestation change is always possible; 4) relationally the human contact (and the medical one too) with this kind of patient got very specific features that often provoke dramatic and perverse changes in the same relation, especially in a sadomasochistic sense. The personal nosological frame is stressed within the actual psychiatric diagnostic classification (ICD 10, DSM IV).",

One valuable aspect of a definition of alcoholism is that it enables us to answer by scientific enquiry the question of whether or not it is an illness. The kind of disease which those alcoholics who support the disease concept have in mind is something which would describe a condition preceding their drinking, something constitutional, that is to say, present from their earliest days, and therefore likely to be in the nature of a biochemical or psychological abnormality. Alcohol is a drug, which induces dependence when used in certain minimal quantities and with a certain frequency of ingestion.",

En más del 50% de los casos las lesiones se presentan en cabeza, cara y cuello. Es por eso que el odontólogo y especialmente el odontopediatra deben estar preparados para reconocer alguna forma de maltrato o negligencia con base en una historia clínica adecuada y una exploración intencionada ante la sospecha de síndrome de niño maltratado. Objetivo: Conocer los indicadores intraorales y extraorales que le permitan al odontopediatra reconocer los signos y contribuir en el diagnóstico como parte de un equipo multidisciplinario encargado de la atención de estos pacientes. Caso clínico: Paciente masculino de dos años cinco meses quien acude al Servicio de Urgencias del Instituto Nacional de Pediatría por presentar edema periorbitario, múltiples fracturas en extremidades e indicadores orofaciales que permitieron diagnosticar síndrome de niño maltratado. Conclusión: Considerando la frecuencia con que las estructuras orofaciales se ven involucradas en el síndrome de niño maltratado, existe un compromiso médico, ético y legal para que todos los dentistas y específicamente los odontopediatras intervengan en la prevención, detección, diagnóstico y tratamiento de este problema médico social.",

Udowodniono, że dysfunkcje seksualne występują u osób chorujących na SM często. Dysfunkcje te występują częściej niż w przypadku pacjentów cierpiących na inne przewlekłe choroby – 70% pacjentów ze stwardnieniem rozsianym dotkniętych jest problemami w sferze seksualnej. Patofizjologia tych zaburzeń jest wieloczynnikowa. Jednym z czynników są uszkodzenia w centralnym układzie nerwowym, innym współistniejące zaburzenia niezwiązane bezpośrednio z obszarami demielizacyjnymi, takie jak: zmęczenie, spastyczność, osłabienie siły mięśni czy skutki uboczne wdrożonej w procesie leczenia farmakoterapii.

      "title": "The subjective experience of negative symptoms : characteristics of emotional withdrawal",
      "abstract": "According to the diagnosis of schizophrenia in the DSM-IV-TR (American Psychiatric Association, 2000), negative symptoms are those personal characteristics that are thought to be reduced from normal functioning, while positive symptoms are aspects of functioning that exist as an excess or distortion of normal functioning. Negative symptoms are generally considered to be a core feature of people diagnosed with schizophrenia. However, negative symptoms are not always present in those diagnosed, and a diagnosis can be made with only negative or only positive symptoms, or with a combination of both.\r\n\r\nNegative symptoms include an observed loss of emotional expression (affective flattening), loss of motivation or self directedness (avolition), loss of speech (alogia), and also a loss of interests and pleasures (anhedonia). Positive symptoms include the perception of things that others do not perceive (hallucinations), and extraordinary explanations for ordinary events (delusions) (American Psychiatric Association, 2000). Both negative and positive symptoms are derived from watching the patient and thus do not consider the patient’s subjective experience.\r\n\t\r\nHowever, aspects of negative symptoms, such as observed affective flattening are highly contended. Within conventional psychiatry, the absence of emotional expression is assumed to coincide with an absence of emotional experience. Contrasting research findings suggests that patients who were observed to score low on displayed emotional expression, scored high on self ratings of emotional experience. Patients were also observed to be significantly lower on emotional expression when compared with others (Aghevli, Blanchard, & Horan, 2003; Selton, van der Bosch, & Sijben, 1998). It appears that there is little correlation between emotional experience and emotional expression in patients, and that observer ratings cannot help us to understand the subjective experience of the negative symptoms.\r\n\r\nThis chapter will focus on research into the subjective experiences of negative symptoms. A framework for these experiences will be used from the qualitative research findings of the primary author (Le Lievre, 2010). In this study, the primary author found that subjective experiences of the negative symptoms belonged to one of the two phases of the illness experience; “transitioning into emotional shutdown” or “recovering from emotional shutdown”. \r\n\r\nThis chapter will use the six themes from the phase of “transitioning into emotional shutdown”. This phase described the experience of turning the focus of attention away from the world and onto the self and the past, thus losing contact with the world and others (emotional shutdown). Transitioning into emotional shutdown involved; “not being acknowledged”, “relational confusion”, “not being expressive”, “reliving the past”, “detachment”, and “no sense of direction” (Le Lievre, 2010). Detail will be added to this framework of experience from other qualitative research in this area. We will now review the six themes that constitute a “transition into emotional shutdown” and corresponding previous research findings.",

Somatform disorders are diagnosed by the presence of body symptoms that suggest a physical disorder without a demonstrable organic cause or known physiological mechanism that fully explains them and by the reasonable presumption that these symptoms are related to psychological factors or stress. Patients with chronic, serious somatoform disorders (mainly somatisation disorder, hypochondriasis, body dysmorphic disorder, and psychogenic pain) also present with personality disorders that determine the evolution or are even the main diagnosis. In addition, these patients frequently present/display severe psycho-social stress when they go to the doctor and have social adjustment problems, which often reinforce the symptoms. The gains derived from the disease and the role the patient assumes, the anomalous cognitive-perceptive mechanisms and the doctor-patient relationship are all essential for the understanding of the configuration process of many somatoform disorders and for determining their treatment. Primary care doctors therefore should be aware of and consider somatisation disorders in their clinical practice because many of the patient's symptoms could be an expression of their emotional difficulties that summarize complex psychological, life, family and social interactions, that may jeopardize the doctor-patient relationship.",

Prolonged delirium can also affect patients with multiple predisposing and/or precipitating factors. In clinical practice, prolonged delirium is often unrecognized, and can be misdiagnosed as other psychiatric disorders. We describe a case of a 59-year-old male presenting with behavioral and cognitive symptoms that was first misdiagnosed as a mood disorder in a general hospital setting. After prolonged delirium due to multiple factors was confirmed, the patient was treated accordingly with symptomatic management. He evolved with progressive improvement of his clinical status. Early diagnosis and management of prolonged delirium are important to improve patient prognosis and avoid iatrogenic measures.Delirium pode ser conceituado como o declínio agudo na função cognitiva que geralmente dura de horas a dias. O delírio prolongado também pode afetar pacientes com múltiplos fatores predisponentes e/ou precipitantes. Na prática clínica, o delírio prolongado é muitas vezes não reconhecido, e pode ser diagnosticado como outros transtornos psiquiátricos. Aqui, descrevemos o caso de um homem de 59 anos apresentando sintomas comportamentais e cognitivos que foi diagnosticado inicialmente com transtorno de humor em um hospital geral. Após ser diagnosticado delirium prolongado devido a múltiplos fatores, o paciente foi tratado de acordo, evoluindo com melhora progressiva do seu estado clínico. O diagnóstico e o manejo precoces do delirium prolongado são importantes para melhorar o prognóstico do paciente e evitar medidas iatrogênicas.",

A escolha deste tema justifica-se pelos prejuizos causados pelas alteracoes posturais, tanto no ponto de vista fisiologico quanto mecânico, podendo gerar quadros de tensao, dor, retracoes muscular e alteracoes respiratorias. Nao foi encontrada na literatura nenhuma pesquisa que analise e trate a postura corporal de portadores desta patologia. A esquizofrenia e um transtorno de afeto inadequado ou embotado, caracterizado por distorcoes do pensamento e da percepcao. Normalmente a capacidade intelectual esta mantida e a consciencia e clara, podendo futuramente surgir deficits cognitivos. O portador desta patologia possui perturbacoes que envolvem funcoes basicas que dao a uma pessoa normal senso de individualidade, unicidade e de direcao de si mesmo, apresentando alucinacoes, usualmente auditivas, e outras formas de distorcao que afetam seu comportamento e seus pensamentos. Participarao deste estudo 20 pacientes portadores de Esquizofrenia CID F20, inscritos nos Projetos Terapeuticos do CAPS III Guarulhos. Serao incluidos pacientes de ambos os sexos com idade entre 18 e 59 anos.

Os sujeitos da pesquisa individualmente em uma sala reservada do CAPS III passarao por uma Avaliacao Postural, a fim de detectar-se o padrao postural. Apos esta avaliacao este grupo sera subdividido em quatro subgrupos de cinco sujeitos cada grupo (para melhor adequacao dos horarios as atividades por eles ja desenvolvidas) que participarao de duas sessoes semanais com duracao de trinta minutos cada, durante vinte e cinco sessoes, aproximadamente tres meses, onde realizarao exercicios terapeuticos (cinesioterapia) para correcao das alteracoes posturais.

      "title": "Some Remarks About Somato-Psychic Compared to Psychosomatic Relationships",
      "abstract": "Somato-psychic medicine refers to all those processes in which psychological phenomena are produced by alterations of the body's anatomy or physiology. It is often extremely difficult to determine the first cause of a psychic disturbance, since somatic influences may produce psychic phenomena, and these in turn may produce somatic processes, and vice versa. These relationships are graphically portrayed for a few well-known clinical pictures. At times it is possible, by analysis of the manifestations presented, to discover evidence of the various influences. Under certain conditions, however, a later process may exert such overwhelming effects in the temporal succession of events that the influence of earlier factors may not be manifest in the clinical picture. A simple classification of the various somato-psychic influences in three groups is presented for better visualization. The first group is comprised of processes taking place within the confines of the skull. The second is represented by those disease processes that are anatomically located extracranially but where changed metabolites or other agents exert influence on the brain cells with subsequent psychic signs. Drugs and other substances brought from outside into the body and exerting influence on the brain may be regarded as a subgroup of factors belonging to this second group. The third group comprises psychic processes that represent conscious or unconscious reactions by the individuals to somatic diseases or to permanent bodily conditions. The correlation of somatic abnormalities and psychological disturbance is, of course, not exhausted by psychosomatic and somato-psychic relationships, since a certain body build and a particular psychological make-up may be expressions of the same constitution.",

      "title": "Iloperidone (Fanapt): An FDA-Approved Treatment Option for Schizophrenia",
      "abstract": "Schizophrenia is a debilitating and chronic mental illness that affects approximately 24 million people of all ages around the world. The usual onset is between 15 and 35 years of age,1 and about 1% of all Americans are affected.2 Approximately 25% of all beds in psychiatric hospitals are occupied by patients with schizophrenia, and 50% of psychiatric hospital admissions are a result of schizophrenia.3,4 This mental illness can be characterized by the presentation of psychosis, cognitive impairment, social withdrawal, and apathy, all of which lead to impaired functioning in school, self-care, recreational activities, work, parenting, and interpersonal relationships. Among the psychiatric disorders, schizophrenia is considered to be the most disabling illness.5 Symptoms can broadly be classified into three groups: \r\n\r\n\r\npositive: unusual perceptions or thoughts such as hallucinations and delusions\r\n\r\n\r\nnegative: a decrease or loss in the ability to speak, to find pleasure in everyday life, to express emotions, or to initiate plans. These symptoms are often mistaken for depression or amotivation; hence they are more difficult to recognize.\r\n\r\n\r\ncognitive: difficulty in organizing or planning, with impairments in executive functioning, working memory, and attention. These are considered the most disabling of the symptoms because they affect the patient’s ability to maintain a normal life.6\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo general classes of medications are used to treat schizophrenia: first-generation (conventional) antipsychotic agents and second-generation (atypical) antipsychotic agents.\r\n\r\nThe most commonly used first-generation antipsychotic drugs are chlorpromazine (Thorazine, GlaxoSmithKline), haloperidol (Haldol, Ortho-McNeil), perphenazine (Trilafon, Schering), and fluphenazine (Prolixin, Apothecon). Although efficacious, these medications are associated with a high risk of causing extrapyramidal symptoms, including rigidity, tremors, dystonia, and restlessness.\r\n\r\nIn 1990, the first of the atypical agents, clozapine (Clozaril, Novartis), was approved in the U.S. Although clozapine is considered to have extrapyramidal symptoms as a rare side effect, it carries five black box warnings, the most serious being agranulocytosis. Many other atypical agents are known for their metabolic side effects such as weight gain and an increased risk of hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia. Other atypical antipsychotic medications include risperidone (Risperdal, Janssen), olanzapine (Zyprexa, Eli Lilly), quetiapine (Seroquel, AstraZeneca), ziprasidone (Geodon, Pfizer), aripiprazole (Abilify, Bristol-Myers Squibb/Otsuka), paliperidone (Invega, Janssen), and asenapine (Saphris, Schering-Plough).6\r\n\r\nIn May 2009, the FDA approved iloperidone (Fanapt, Vanda) as an atypical antipsychotic agent for the acute treatment of patients with schizophrenia. In clinical trials, it was shown to be efficacious and safe. In this article, we review the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, safety, and efficacy of iloperidone in alleviating both the positive and negative symptoms of this disabling disease.",

      "abstract": "Malingering is the deliberate production of false, (or gross exaggeration of), physical or psychologic symptoms for a known external reward. It is not considered a form of mental illness or psychopathology, although it can occur in the context of other mental illnesses. Even though it is easy to define, clinicians still find making the diagnosis very challenging. Although clinicians face malingered symptoms regularly in the emergency room and on the general psychiatric wards, they are most likely reluctant to diagnose it for fear of being sued or so as not to stigmatize the patient. Identifying a malingerer will help focus resources toward patients with genuine symptoms. However, there is the perception by the typical patient who exhibits symptoms suggestive of malingering that he or she is being called a liar. This review presents two case scenarios and discusses how clinicians can diagnose malingering as well as the tactical approach towards its management.",

      "title": "The Meaning of Stress, Anxiety and Collective Panic in Clinical Settings",
      "abstract": "The physician is often confronted with questions about the meaning of symptoms or diseases. One of the tasks of those practicing psychosomatic medicine is to delve into the answers to these questions. Anxiety is a common phenomenon in everyday practice, and it is evoked in the most different situations. The relationship of this kind of anxiety (i.e. when having to consider painful or life-threatening diseases or medical or surgical procedures) to both neurotic anxiety and normal anxiety (i.e. the one expressed in poetry or artistic creativity or present in the biographies of outstanding men and women who by no means could be considered as psychiatric cases) leads to define anxiety as the psychological equivalent of stress. Anxiety is the unspecific response to a threat induced by too sudden or too extreme variations in the environment (life changes, stressful situations, life events). Such mechanisms, so important for survival, can become self-destructive, paving the way for the appearance of diseases represented by unsuccessful coping mechanisms. The analogy with the diseases of the general adaptation syndrome of Selye (i.e. autoimmune diseases) and with reactions in collective panics in disasters becomes evident under this perspective. The physician has to face anxiety with the same attitude that he faces pain, that is to say, going beyond a consideration of its 'normality' (it is quite normal to feel chest pain in acute heart infarct), keeping in mind its role in survival. Most creative men and women are, as many psychohistorical studies have shown, individuals who have been able to find a solution to internal conflicts which were conflicts of the society in which they lived, leading to a solution of this same external conflict. The anxiety which is often expressed in this situation has an element of restlessness, which is lacking in anxiety and related disorders which are dominated by feelings of inability to cope expressed time and again as 'Dr., I can't' (go out in the street, in elevators, live, love, work, and so on).",

Better understanding of the potentially lethal life situations and identification of individuals at risk may lead to the development of practical prophylactic measures.",

The development of post-traumatic psychopathology depends on individual vulnerability, both genetic and acquired, the nature and severity of the traumatic event, and the quality of the post-traumatic environment. Children who are the victims of abuse or neglect may be particularly profoundly affected by their experience. Even if the stress is only relatively small, if the trauma occurs at a sensitive or critical period of psychological development, a child's cognitive or emotional functioning may not progress normally. The psychopathology of severe personality disorder may thus originate at an early age. Adults who have previously experienced such traumaticevents and who are then involved in later traumatic incidents may be particularly susceptible subsequently to manifest severe psychological disorder. However, even if there is no pre-existing vulnerability, severe trauma can lead to the development of the full range of abnormal psychological symptoms in someone who was previously healthy.",

      "abstract": "Abstract\r\nStigma is when a certain characteristic (such as weight or race) causes an individual or group to be treated negatively based on a feature that differentiates them from other members of society. Stigma can be considered in different ways; Stigma can be ‘enacted’, when the individual is directly discriminated against, and ‘perceived’, when individual believes the negative actions of others to be linked to an undesirable characteristic of their self. Stigma can have serious consequences, such as reduced quality of life, lower rates of employment and less overall life satisfaction. \r\nEpilepsy is a reasonably common neurological disorder where individuals experience seizures. Over 500,000 UK residents are estimated to be affected by Epilepsy. It can be caused by a number of different factors, such as brain lesions, but there may be no known cause for up to two-thirds of individuals with epilepsy. Historically, seizures have been associated with negative factors, such as demonic possession, and have experienced stigma. There is also evidence that stigmatising attitudes towards seizures continue to be prevalent. Non-epileptic attack disorder (NEAD) is a condition whereby an individual experiences seizures that are outwardly similar to epileptic seizures. These seizures, however, are not associated with the neurological correlates of epilepsy. NEAD is a fairly common disorder with an estimated 15 000 UK residents receiving a diagnosis. The causes of NEAD are often considered psychological rather than physical and, as such, NEAD is often considered a mental health disorder. \r\nThe causes and manifestations of stigma in NEAD are unclear. This project aimed to extend the current understanding of stigma in NEAD by first: reviewing the literature on the experiences of stigma for NEAD and second: investigating the possible underlying factors that may cause perceived stigma in NEAD compared to epilepsy.\r\nPart I describes the outcomes of a systematic narrative review that identified 22 papers investigating the experiences of stigma by individuals diagnosed with NEAD. The results indicate that individuals with NEAD experience stigma from healthcare professionals, the public, and family and friends. Some evidence suggests that individuals with NEAD experience higher rates of stigma than epilepsy. \r\nPart II presents a cross-sectional study that investigate the relationship between perceived stigma and self-efficacy, depression, anxiety and seizure symptom severity in 2 groups (epilepsy and NEAD). The study found individuals with NEAD report more perceived stigma than those with epilepsy and higher, clinical, levels of depression. The severity of symptoms was not associated with perceived stigma for NEAD but it was with epilepsy. Depression was significant predictive factor for perceived stigma in both epilepsy and NEAD.\r\nThese studies develop the current understanding of stigma in NEAD and epilepsy. The findings suggest individuals with NEAD experience more stigma than those with Epilepsy and that depression predicts perceived stigma for other groups. The findings also suggest that stigma may be a useful target for future interventions for individuals with NEAD.",

      "abstract": "1. Although psychological factors are an important etiological component in producing and perpetuating TMJ disorders a comprehensive view of the problem can be best understood through the concept of multifactorial etiology. 2. Psychological factors operative in TMJ disorders cannot be understood within any single frame of reference. It is appropriate to examine emotional, behavioral, and interpersonal relationships in parallel, not as dichotomous concepts. 3. The symptom complex defined in this review as \"TMJ disorders\" is the musculoskeletal component of a larger group of microtraumatic signs and symptoms, all of which are manifestations of a generalized injury-producing activity termed dysfunction. 4. More explicit diagnoses need to be identified if definitional problems involving TMJ disorders are to be overcome. 5. Classical psychoanalytic conceptualization of the etiology of TMJ disorders has not been systematically examined, but has been widely accepted and found clinically useful by some therapists. 6. Clinical impressions notwithstanding, there is little evidence to indicate that TMJ disorders are correlated with one specific personality trait. Perhaps more definitive assessments will reveal uniform personality characteristics in subclasses of TMJ patients. 7. Emotional factors (e.g., anxiety, fear, frustration, and anger) play a significant role in the etiology of TMJ disorders, in that they elicit muscular tension and oral habits. Although it would appear unlikely that emotionally induced muscle activity is a \"necessary\" factor, it is probable that it will be found a \"sufficient\" cause for TMJ disorders. 8. Learning principles, should not be considered as an alternative etiological position but should be viewed as a framework upon which any psychological theory of etiology must be based. 9. The presence of chronic pain in TMJ patients may be of as much clinical significance in the prognosis as the physical findings associated with the disorder itself. 10. The potential placebo effect resulting from any treatment, coupled with other nonspecific effects of the doctor's attitudes, remains a powerful tool that can be utilized in treating TMJ disorders. A vital ingredient in the placebo effect is the quality of the doctor-patient relationship. 11. Patient evaluation should not only include a) a search for the immediate organic stimulus or biomechanical disturbance, but also b) an assessment of situational or chronic anxiety and other emotional factors and c) an observation of interpersonal styles of behavior commonly associated with the chronically sick patient. 12. Unilateral etiological views of TMJ disorders and rigid treatment approaches need modification. Treatment involving simultaneous dental and psychological approaches appears to have more promise.",

      "abstract": "Medically unexplained visual loss, or functional visual loss, or nonorganic visual loss (NOVL) denotes diminished visual acuity or field without discernible ocular or neurological pathology. Variously termed in the literature, it eludes organic diagnosis following a thorough examination. Symptoms range from mild blurriness to total blindness, sometimes presenting as tunnel vision or hemianopias. Diagnosis entails comprehensive eye evaluation to exclude organic causes like refractive error or cataracts. NOVL frequently correlates with psychological conditions like depression or anxiety, implicating psychological influence in its etiology. Thus, NOVL underscores the complex interplay between physical and psychological factors in visual impairment, necessitating holistic diagnostic and therapeutic approaches. This chapter elucidates the diagnostic and therapeutic paradigms pertaining to functional visual disorder (FVD) or nonorganic vision loss (NOVL), prevalent presentations posing diagnostic challenges across diverse medical disciplines. It delineates the historical evolution of terminology denoting patients manifesting vision loss incongruous with established neurological or ophthalmic pathologies, necessitating a collaborative, interprofessional approach. Diagnostic modalities, ranging from meticulous ocular assessments to comprehensive psychological evaluations, reflect the intricate etiological spectrum underlying NOVL. This exposition serves as a pivotal reference for healthcare professionals navigating the diagnostic intricacies and therapeutic imperatives intrinsic to NOVL, advocating for a holistic, patient-centric approach underscored by scientific rigor, and compassionate care.",

      "title": "Non-verbal Cognitive Dysfunction in Children with Specific Language Impairment",
      "abstract": "Background: Language deficits occur in a series of developmental disorders and are widely recognized as characteristic symptoms of a range of developmental clinical conditions. In fact, Specific Language Impairment (hereafter SLI) is currently defined as a significant impairment of the child's linguistic abilities on several levels (phonology, morphology, lexical, syntax, narrative) by the presence of non-verbal IQ scores in the normal range; the diagnosis is based on a set of inclusionary and exclusionary criteria including performance at least one standard deviation below age expectations on a generic language assessment but 'normal' non-verbal intelligence. Of course, the term 'normal' non-verbal intelligence raises issues about what constitutes a 'normal' non-verbal IQ in a-/typical development and must be handled with care. However, according to the classical definition (ICD-10-GM version 2009; F80.- 'Umschriebene Entwicklungsstorungen des Sprechens und der Sprache') a child with SLI performs below age expectations on language measures despite having adequate cognitive and sensory skills for typical development with no obvious identifiable cause such as hearing loss, brain injuries or other neurological disorders.\r\nMorphology studies of individuals with developmental language disorders claim reversed asymmetry or symmetry of the planum temporale and the pars triangularis (Wernicke's and Broca's area), yet so far there is no clear evidence that children with SLI have marked anatomical differences from other children in either brain hemisphere. Moreover, some indication suggest a possible genetic link because SLI can be passed down from parents to children - although such a SLI-gene of course hasn't been identified thus far. Hence, the investigations of etiological factors are at a premature and inconclusive stage of inquiry and so far nothing but speculative causes can be mentioned.\r\nTo sum up, current literature on SLI hardly defines a language profile as 'typical' for SLI given that the spectrum of the disorder is very broad and yet unclear since in both, academic and clinical practice, the 'specific' characteristics of this developmental impairment have been questioned. After all, the fluidity of the diagnosis, making it difficult to border SLI, should actually be considered an important descriptive aspect, portraying the interactive nature of 'specific' cognitive systems. In fact, this study is motivated by the interest in the extensive issue whether there is a relationship between language impairments and impairments on general levels of nonverbal cognitive skills, as part of the broader question of the nature of language and cognition. \r\nThus, the aim of this study is to profile a child's performance across linguistic and cognitive domains, to determine if the domains are similar or discrepant in levels of performance.\r\nMethods: 30 typically developing children and 12 children with SLI between 5;0-9;0 years were tested on both their verbal and non-verbal abilities with respectively two standardized tests each. The children with SLI were all currently in therapy and classified as 'SLI' by their speech and language pathologists. All participants were from South Tyrol or Vienna and therefore German native speakers with dialectical colouring; some had a bilingual background, this fact was of course taken into consideration while analyzing the results. To 'measure' the child's non-verbal performances level the Raven's Coloured Progressive Matrices (parallel form) and the 'Zahlensymboltest' of the HAWIK-R was used. The Raven's Coloured Progressive Matrices were used to give an indication about the child's (4;9-12;00) non-verbal performance; in each test item, a candidate is asked to identify the missing segment required to complete a larger pattern. \r\nThe verbal abilities were assessed with the German version of the standardized TROG-D (original edition by D.V.M. Bishop,1989; German by Annette V. Fox, 2006) which is used to test a child's (3;0-10;11) general linguistic and grammatical comprehension. However, some items (Set 'R') were discarded since the linguistic construction is not common in the children's dialect and therefore not recognizable by them. As a second test, the first part (forward digit span) of the 'Zahlennachsprechen' of the HAWIK-R assessed the phonological loop of the short term memory, while the second part (backward digit span) not only demands phonological memorizing but also the ability to act upon the shortly memorized item. \r\nThe test battery was reduced to these four items in order to successfully conduct the experiment without losing the child's attentiveness and interest. Each test session lasted for 20-35 minutes circa, depending on the child's accomplishment. In case the child was unable to concentrate or to carry out the given tasks, the experiment was stopped up and the results gained so far were used.\r\nResults: The preliminary results show a slight tendency towards underage-expected performance of the children diagnosed with 'SLI' in non-verbal tests compared to the control group. So far, this research alludes to a range of non-verbal cognitive mechanisms interacting with language and having its implications in delineating the profile of SLI. \r\nConclusions: Many of the studies of children with language impairments who do or do not display cognitive impairments are motivated by the interest in the broader issue of the relationship between language and cognition. The extent to which the two domains of language and general cognitive abilities are inherently singular or modular remains unresolved and controversial. However, this work has shown that to a small but noticeable extent the domains of cognition and language can operate as orthogonal dimensions. According to these findings, the definition of SLI as specifically and exclusively linked to language must be revised, since the characteristics of this developmental disorder seem to be wider than first documented.\r\n\r\nKeywords: Specific Language Impairment, Cognition, Non-verbal IQ, Developmental Disorder;\r\n\r\nReferences: \r\n[1]\tLeonard L.

      "title": "Current Concepts in Diagnosis and Treatment of Functional Neurological Disorders",
      "abstract": "Functional neurological disorders (FND) are common sources of disability in medicine. Patients have often been misdiagnosed, correctly diagnosed after lengthy delays, and/or subjected to poorly delivered diagnoses that prevent diagnostic understanding and lead to inappropriate treatments, iatrogenic harm, unnecessary and costly evaluations, and poor outcomes. Functional Neurological Symptom Disorder/Conversion Disorder was adopted by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, replacing the term psychogenic with functional and removing the criterion of psychological stress as a prerequisite for FND. A diagnosis can now be made in an inclusionary manner by identifying neurological signs that are specific to FNDs without reliance on presence or absence of psychological stressors or suggestive historical clues. The new model highlights a wider range of past sensitizing events, such as physical trauma, medical illness, or physiological/psychophysiological events. In this model, strong ideas and expectations about these events correlate with abnormal predictions of sensory data and body-focused attention. Neurobiological abnormalities include hypoactivation of the supplementary motor area and relative disconnection with areas that select or inhibit movements and are associated with a sense of agency. Promising evidence has accumulated for the benefit of specific physical rehabilitation and psychological interventions alone or in combination, but clinical trial evidence remains limited. Functional neurological disorders are a neglected but potentially reversible source of disability. Further research is needed to determine the dose and duration of various interventions, the value of combination treatments and multidisciplinary therapy, and the therapeutic modality best suited for each patient.",

The aim of defining diagnostic criteria of hemodynamic orthostatic dizziness/vertigo is to help clinicians to understand the terminology related to orthostatic dizziness/vertigo and to distinguish orthostatic dizziness/vertigo due to global brain hypoperfusion from that caused by other etiologies. Diagnosis of hemodynamic orthostatic dizziness/vertigo requires: A) five or more episodes of dizziness, unsteadiness or vertigo triggered by arising or present during upright position, which subsides by sitting or lying down; B) orthostatic hypotension, postural tachycardia syndrome or syncope documented on standing or during head-up tilt test; and C) not better accounted for by another disease or disorder. Probable hemodynamic orthostatic dizziness/vertigo is defined as follows: A) five or more episodes of dizziness, unsteadiness or vertigo triggered by arising or present during upright position, which subsides by sitting or lying down; B) at least one of the following accompanying symptoms: generalized weakness/tiredness, difficulty in thinking/concentrating, blurred vision, and tachycardia/palpitations; and C) not better accounted for by another disease or disorder. These diagnostic criteria have been derived by expert consensus from an extensive review of 90 years of research on hemodynamic orthostatic dizziness/vertigo, postural hypotension or tachycardia, and autonomic dizziness. Measurements of orthostatic blood pressure and heart rate are important for the screening and documentation of orthostatic hypotension or postural tachycardia syndrome to establish the diagnosis of hemodynamic orthostatic dizziness/vertigo.",

      "abstract": "Patients with physical symptoms for which no medical explanation can be found are relatively common in general practice. Patients with medically unexplained symptoms are frequently frustrating to physicians both in primary and secondary care and utilize health sources disproportionately. They frequently attend both primary care units and hospitals and are usually not satisfied with the care they receive. Medically unexplained symptoms in patient populations are strongly associated with psychiatric pathology and with anxiety and depression in particular. They are also linked to personality pathology, childhood adversity, adult trauma or medically unexplained symptoms in childhood. The predictive value of alexithymia in determining these symptoms is controversial. Patients who have high negative affectivity or neuroticism tend to score high on measures of physical symptoms. These symptoms have a high degree of co-occurrence. The same person may meet the diagnostic criteria for several functional somatic syndromes simultaneously. The clinician should be aware of the cultural and social shaping of the bodily experience of these patients and hence acknowledge the somatic nature and reality of the symptoms. The clinician should make the person feel understood and establish a positive collaborative relationship. This would enable him/her to correct misconceptions about the disease and give a positive explanation of symptoms. Antidepressant therapy and cognitive-behavioural psychotherapy have been proved to be moderately effective in this group of patients. Because of the high disability that might be caused by these symptoms, psychiatrists and primary and secondary care physicians should pay careful attention to this clinical condition. These symptoms may also aid us in challenging the long-held idea of mind-body dualism which is inherent in Western biomedicine.",

      "abstract": "Unilateral neglect syndrome defined as failure to report, respond and orient to novel or meaningful stimuli presented in contralesional side of space is cognitive impairment in neurological patients, important both from diagnostic and therapeutic point of view. It occurs as a consequence of brain damage localized in various cortical and/or subcortical structures, but mainly in parietotemporal areas of the right hemisphere. Neglect syndrome is a heterogeneous cluster of modally specific deficiency signs and often coexists with changes in emotional status and poor self-awareness. According to different criteria of classification, neglect may be perceptual (visual, tactile, auditory) or motor and it may manifest itself in one or in several modalities, and concern personal, peripersonal, extrapersonal, and even imaginal space. Since neglect belongs to cognitive disorders, it cannot be attributed to basic sensory or motor deficits and it should be clearly differentiated from them. Dynamic changes over time are typical of this syndrome, which is commonly seen in the early stages of the disease and in many neglect patients remits completely over a few months. However, in chronic forms, less or more intensive neglect features may disrupt patients’ functioning for a long time and limit efficacy of rehabilitation. There are many different standardised and clinical assessment procedures of hemineglect. Clinical and functional tasks should be analysed along with behavioural observation in natural situations as well as interview data. Differential diagnostics is critical for planning an effective rehabilitation programme.",

Kelainan fundamental dari gangguan jiwa kelompok ini adalah adanya perubahan yang nyata pada suasana perasaan (mood) atau afek menuju ke arah depresi yang ditandai dengan kemurungan, kelesuan, ketidakgairahan hidup, perasaan tidak berguna, dan putus asa. Seorang wanita usia 24 tahun datang ke poliklinik Rumah Sakit Jiwa Provinsi Lampung dengan keluhan utama merasa sedih yang berlebihan sejak tiga minggu yang lalu setelah dirinya didiagnosis menderita kista folikuler oleh dokter spesialis kandungan. Pasien telah mendapatkan penjelasan bahwa kista tersebut dapat sembuh sendiri apabila pasien memiliki anak lagi, namun pasien tetap merasa khawatir dan tidak bisa melawan rasa sedihnya ketika mengingat kondisinya tersebut. Pasien juga menjadi malas bekerja dan beraktivitas, lebih sering di rumah, dan mengalami gangguan tidur, sakit kepala, serta pegal-pegal pada tubuhnya. Pada pemeriksaan fisik tidak didapatkan kelainan klinis sedangkan pada pemeriksaan psikiatri didapatkan gangguan berupa mood hipotimia dengan afek yang sempit dan serasi, tidak didapatkan gangguan isi pikir dan tidak didapatkan gangguan persepsi. Pasien didiagnosis dengan aksis I: (F.32.11) episode depresif sedang dengan gejala somatik, aksis II: tidak ada diagnosis, aksis III: tidak ada diagnosis, aksis IV: masalah dengan psikososial, dan aksis V: Global Assestment of Functioning (GAF) score 70-61 (pada saat pemeriksaan). Pasien mendapatkan terapi psikofarmaka dengan obat antidepresan golongan Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor (SSRI) Fluoxetin 1x10 mg dan obat antiansietas golongan benzoiazepine Merlopam 2x5 mg yang dikombinasikan dengan psikoterapi suportif Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT). Kombinasi pemberian obat tersebut memiliki efek samping yang minimal dan tingkat keberhasilan yang lebih baik. Episode depresif pada pasien ini disebabkan oleh kekhawatiran pasien yang berlebihan terhadap penyakit kista folikel yang dideritanya.

      "abstract": "Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), previously known as battle fatigue syndrome or shell shock, is a severe mental disturbance condition that is normally triggered by the experience of some frightening/scary events or trauma where a person undergoes some serious physical or mental harm or threatened. PTSD is a long-life effect of the continuous occurrence of traumatic conditions, leading to the production of feelings of helplessness, intense fear, and horror in the person. There are various examples of events that can cause PTSD, such as physical, mental, or sexual assault at home or working place by others, unexpected death of a loved one, an accidental event, war, or some kind of natural disaster. Treatment of PTSD includes the removal or reduction of these emotional feelings or symptoms with the aim to improve the daily life functioning of a person. Problems which are needed to be considered in case of PTSD like ongoing trauma, abusive or bad relationships. Various drugs which are used for the treatment of PTSD include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) (citalopram, fluvoxamine, fluoxetine, etc.); tricyclic antidepressants (amitriptyline and isocarboxazid); mood stabilizers (Divalproex and lamotrigine); atypical antipsychotics (aripiprazole and quetiapine), etc. In this review, we have covered the different risk factors, case studies related to various treatment options with different age group of peoples with PTSD and their effects on them. We have also covered the symptoms and associated disorders which can play a key role in the development of PTSD.",

The disorders are caused by physical and/or psycho-social circumstances. In treating the different forms of stress disorders, physical activity has been utilised with good results.

The marked changes concern not only the outern appearence, but also its intrapsychic representations, the body image. The complex integrative processes towards the identity as man or woman cannot be mastered without a certain emotional and physical instability. This is particularly the case if, in addition, nearly infantile disturbances in the socialisation or conflicts specific for this life period are, or have been, present. They can in the sense of a disposition lead to the manifestation of more or less severe crisis in adolescence. These crises interfere not only with the body image, but in many cases with the somatic functions as well. In the study three general aspects of this developmental problem are discussed as far they are relevant in the therapy of psycho-somatic disturbances in adolescents. 1. The implication of the adolescent phase in the course of psycho-somatic diseases. 2. Diseases which mainly occure in adolescence and are predominantly confined to this life period or are mainly influenced by it. 3. The influence which conflicts and phase-specific anxieties and fantasies exercise on the development and establishment of a mature body image and an adult identity.",

Present search restricts the wide range of music categories to the classical one (instrumental and vocal, opera included) and attempts to screen for such 'heavy mental' psychopathological signs beside mentioning the slighter symptoms. Phenomena of amnesia, dementia/delirium, mental retardation, biased perception, chemical/behavioural addiction, delusion, misidentification, mania, depression, suicide, anxiety, obsession-compulsion, conversion, disso - ciation, para/hyper/insomnia, sexual and personality disorders are listed as examples from the wide repertoire. The figure of the 'fool' and the topic of 'madness' (in general, and folia, tarantella) are mentioned as well as the appearance of some behavioural traits ('seven deadly sins'), feigning psychic/somatic states, pathological lying, mutism, stutterism, famous oracles, mesmerism, and employing magic or various potions. Mad scenes as psychotic conditions (often tran - sient if due to psychotrauma from romantic love) occur in many operas. However, quite a few of them have been written by Donizetti. Considering his life, behaviour and composing features, the question arises about Donizetti's ailment: was it mood disorder, Barbaja, or luetic derailment?",

      "title": "Post‐traumatic stress disorder as moderator of other mental health conditions",
      "abstract": "The comorbidity of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) with a range of other mental disorders is common. This comorbidity is often attributed to either overlapping symptoms between PTSD and other disorders or to the variety of psychiatric conditions that can arise in the wake of exposure to a traumatic experience. However, this comorbidity may also be due to the fact that PTSD can moderate the onset or severity of other psychiatric symptoms or disorders. This is an important issue, because it has implications for how patients affected by the array of symptoms that can emerge after trauma may be most efficiently managed. Our knowledge of how PTSD can impact other disorders rests on longitudinal studies that have assessed PTSD and other conditions, and have typically conducted cross-lagged or time-series analyses. This approach allows us to determine the extent to which each condition impacts other disorders at later assessments. Convergent evidence indicates that PTSD can precede or exacerbate depression, anxiety disorders, suicidality, substance abuse, eating disorders, and psychosis1. Furthermore, PTSD can precede a range of physical and behavioral indicators, including chronic pain and tobacco use. There is also evidence from network analysis indicating how symptoms of PTSD may impact other psychiatric symptoms. Network analysis conceptualizes psychopathological states as resulting from causal paths between different symptoms – rather than emerging from an underlying disease state2, 3. For example, the PTSD symptom of nightmares may play a causal role in contributing to sleep disturbance, which in turn leads to concentration deficits and irritability. Numerous studies using network analysis have shown that specific PTSD symptoms can influence problems across other conditions, including depression and anx­iety disorders4. In explaining the role of PTSD as a mediator of the relationship between trauma exposure and onset of other psychiatric disorders, there are several mechanisms that can be considered, and these arguably function in an interactive manner. One key potential mechanism is the impact of PTSD on the capacity to down-regulate emotional distress. It is well documented that PTSD involves impaired emotion regulation, and it is possible that this impairment predisposes people to develop new psychiatric disorders or worsens others5. The capacity to regulate emotions in PTSD can be related to the well-documented deficits in executive functioning6. Deficient working memory and attentional capacity can limit the extent to which one can regulate emotions, which can result in greater risk for mental health problems. Moreover, avoidance is a key symptom of PTSD, and this can trigger a cascade of strategies that can be maladaptive. Avoidance can involve situations or thoughts and memories related to the traumatic experience. This tendency can generalize to more pervasive avoidance of social networks, emotional states, and activities that promote good mental health. This can lead to a worsening of depression, anxiety and other psychiatric conditions. Another common form of avoidance for people with PTSD is self-medicating with prescription or non-prescription substances to numb the distress that is experienced along with traumatic memories. This behaviour can not only lead to substance abuse, which has been documented in longitudinal studies of PTSD, but also facilitate other psychiatric problems, because issues may not be addressed in a constructive manner. Avoidance tendencies can also result in not seeking help from mental health services, which can impede early intervention or adequate treatment for other psychiatric disorders. The DSM-5 explicitly recognizes the presence of harmful behaviors in PTSD, including such risk-taking behaviors as dangerous driving, severe alcohol use, and self-harm. These reactions are conceptualized as a result of the extreme arousal and the difficulties in impulse control that can be experienced by people with PTSD7. These behaviors can lead to a range of events and habits triggering repetitive cycles of exposure to trauma. This can compound the sensitization that has been reported in PTSD, in which the condition results in neural sensitivity to threats and stressors in one's environment, such that the person is more reactive to these events. One of the strongest transdiagnostic predictors of risk for mental health problems is represented by maladaptive or catastrophic appraisals about oneself or the environment8. A key feature of PTSD is the tendency to engage in catastrophic appraisals after the traumatic experience, and these appraisals can generalize to many aspects of a person's life, such as one's self-esteem, trust in others, fears of negative evaluations, germs, or self-blame. These cognitive tendencies are major risk factors for an array of psychiatric conditions, including anxiety, depression, eating disorders, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Relatedly, the tendency to ruminate is well documented after trauma, and this habit of repeatedly thinking about negative events is a major risk factor for many psychiatric conditions. In considering these various mechanisms for how PTSD can moderate other psychiatric problems, it is worth noting that many of the risk factors reviewed here may be present prior to trauma exposure, and in fact predispose the person to developing PTSD. These elements can be intensified as PTSD develops, and then contribute to other psychiatric conditions which have a shared vulnerability. In this context, it is especially worth recognizing the emerging evidence on shared genetic vulnerabilities to a range of psychiatric disorders9. In the wake of trauma exposure and PTSD development, gene expression can predispose an individual to develop other psychiatric disorders by means of the shared genetic vulnerability. Overall, this evidence reflects the interactive multifactorial nature of the processes explaining how PTSD can lead to the onset or worsening of other psychiatric conditions. Understanding how PTSD can impact on other psychological problems is an important area of future research, because it has important treatment implications. Targeting PTSD may have downstream benefits for many problems beyond the specific domain of that disorder.",

In both conditions, complex mental and physical health problems, as well as social issues, are common and are associated with communication difficulties that can result in maladaptive behavioural patterns (often referred to as ‘behaviour that challenges’). Ideally, all people presenting with behaviour that challenges should be assessed by a specialist multidisciplinary team (comprising psychiatrists, psychologists, speech and language therapists, occupational therapists) to develop an understanding of the behaviour and an appropriate support plan with tailored treatment strategies and specialist follow-up.2 Non-pharmacological interventions for challenging behaviour, such as positive behavioural support or cognitive–behavioural therapy and manipulation of environmental triggers, are preferred to psychotropic medication. However, antipsychotic medication is often prescribed to adults with ID and/or autism to manage behaviour that challenges in the absence of severe mental illness, despite there being little research evidence that antipsychotics are effective in this context.3 \n\nThere …",

      "abstract": "There does not appear to be a single hypothesis or theory which can adequately explain the aetiology of anxiety, although there is no shortage of contenders. Neurochemical, existential, sociogenic, familial, pathological, psychodynamic and behavioural explanations have all been offered as putative reasons for the psychological disorder, which in its various representations (panic disorder, obsessive‐compulsive disorder, phobias, post‐traumatic stress disorder, generalized anxiety disorders, etc.) can affect up to 20% of the population on a lifetime basis (1). Notwithstanding the variety of theories and the diversity of presentation of anxiety disorders, it would appear that cognitive dysfunction of one sort or another is a characteristic feature of anxiety in all its manifestations. Indeed, it is possible to argue that a cognitive impairment is the primary presenting feature of pathological anxiety, with the characteristic syndrome of somatic symptoms as secondary or necessary consequences of such cognitive disorder.",

Tak dipungkiri dengan kemajuan teknologi secara global ini, membawa dampak positif dan negatif. Tentunya dampak negatif yang kita harus hindari karena akan membawa pada ketidakstabilan kehidupan jika seseorang tidak memiliki ketahanan diri yang akan menimbulkan depresi bagi seseorang yang mengalaminya. Depresi merupakan gangguan emosional yang ditandai dengan perasaan tertekan, perasaan bersalah, kesedihan, kehilangan minat, dan menarik diri dari orang lain yang dapat berpengaruh pada hubungan interpersonal. Seseorang yang mengalami depresi pada umumnya menunjukkan gejala fisik, psikis dan gejala sosial yang khas, seperti murung, sedih, sensitif, gelisah, mudah marah atau kesal, kurang bergairah, kurang percaya diri, hilang konsentrasi, bahkan bisa kehilangan daya tahan tubuh pada seseorang yang mengalaminya. Untuk itu kajian ini disusun  guna membantu agar : (1) lebih mudah dipahami apa itu depresi, serta dapat memperluas wawasan mengenai gangguan psikologis, khusunya depresi, (2) dapat digunakan sebagai dasar pengetahuan untuk berpartisipasi dalam memberikan informasi bagi masyarakat. (3) sebagai upaya menuju kepada kesehatan fisik dan mental, karena depresi dapat memicu  munculnya penyakit fisik serta dapat memicu ke arah penyalahgunaan obat maupun zat adiktif, dan munculnya keinginan bunuh diri.

Chronic/ recurrent disorders seems to have they causes in the particular personality traits and deficits. Some of them are revealed, described and could be measured by means of Neurotic Personality Questionnaire KON 2006. In this approach, functional disorder is understood as structured systems of the particular nonverbal language (“parole”) in which symptoms play a role of words while syndromes the role of sentences, expressing the current state of mind – mainly the need of bond with other people and its frustration. They are messages of looking attention, attachment. The use of such language seems to be the result of personality deficits making difficult or even impossible to fulfil the need of bond in the psychosocial field using common for done culture verbal and nonverbal language, “normal” means of communication. While in the acute and conditioned reactions on stress different forms of helping people (e.g. CBT) seems to be adequate, in the chronic and recurrent functional disorders therapy is postulated to aiming rather at transformations of the communication, leading to the exchange of the messages’ language having the quality of disorder for common, mainly verbal one.",

From the frequency with which such histories are elicited,it appears that there is a strong congenital predisposition to the disease. Indeed, in quite a series of the cases herein reported, two, three, and even four members of a family have been afflicted with exophthalmic goiter. In the absence of an exciting cause, such a predisposition may not be recognizable nor tangibly mar the individual's physical and mental well-being throughout a normal span of existence. There are doubtless many thousands of individuals possessing a strong susceptibility to exophthalmic goiter who are going through life in an apparently normal manner, oblivious to possibilities which would likely follow the incidence of a psychic trauma.",

Catatonia has been associated with psychiatric disorders - schizophrenia and bipolar disorder for example - as well as secondary to various underlying medical conditions.It will be described a case report of a 55 years old woman with prior psychiatric history of hospitalization with an unspecified nonorganic psychosis (F29-ICD10), presenting features of catatonia - immobility with fixed posture and gaze (sometimes presenting posturing), an almost absence of spontaneous movements and speech, echophenomenon (echolalia, palilalia, coprolalia) erupting in a otherwise mute state and showing, on occasions, periods of purposelessness motor excitement and restlessness, verbigeration and screaming with a grim of terror. She was disoriented and performed poorly on the MMSE. No neurologic focal signs were disclosed other than prominent primitive reflexes. Prior to admission, her family reported a sudden mood change: she became irritable, argumentative, with delusional thought content of persecutory nature, grandiose ideas.

The variety of methods contained in these therapeutic forms can be generally found within sufism in theory, but not specifically in practice. These practical experiences is thus part of a ‘local wisdom’ (kearifan lokal) tradition deserving of study and research.Thus far, the therapies have been performed with patients who suffer from physical ailments such as heart disease, cholesterol excess, hypertension, gout, and kidney disorder, as well spiritual illnesses such as obsessive-compulsive disorder, anxiety, and phobias.From the perspective of sufism, these conditions appear because of the sinful actions committed by the sufferers. These sins disturb or trouble the sufferers’ soul, causing it to acquire negative traits, blocking its ‘link’ to God who is the Source of Peace, Happiness, and Well-being (as-Salam). The ‘further’ a person is from God, the ‘nearer’ the person is to problems and disease, and vice-versa. To attain physical and spiritual well-being is to become closer to God.In practice, to cure illnesses, the therapies take the following forms: Rasa Ruhani (Spiritual Sensation), Shalat and Thuma’ninah (Prayer with Concentration), and Terapi Nafas (Breathing Therapy).",

It is one of the most common reasons for seeking medical attention, accounting for approximately one quarter of general practice consultations and half of all outpatient attendances and hospital admissions in the UK (Royal College of Physicians, 1996). For some people, persistent pain is an unrelieved condition of daily life. Yet despite the prevalence of chronic and debilitating conditions, indices of social well-being seldom include pain as a factor affecting the quality of life. Pain is commonly seen as a symptom of other complaints rather than an adversity in itself. Although injury and disease can be detected by observation and clinical tests, pain is a peculiarly private experience that cannot be reduced to anything else; it cannot be x-rayed, or calibrated like blood pressure on a standardized scale, nor can we feel another's pain. Unlike most other states of consciousness, pain has no object or referential content: it is not of anything or for anything, nor can it be easily defined. We commonly resort to suggestive metaphors to describe what we feel in terms of something else — as a 'shooting', 'burning', 'throbbing', 'gnawing' sensation. Sometimes the sheer intensity of what we feel seems to defy language and we can only speak of 'excruciating', 'unbearable' or 'indescribable' pain.KeywordsChronic PainPersistent PainDiscursive PracticeMedical DiscourseReal BodyThese keywords were added by machine and not by the authors.

Sometimes they express these problems in term of their bodily discomfort or simply somatic complaints. Somatic complaints are increasing day by day in this complex life scenario. Some of them are caused due to physical disturbances in the body while some of them are due to psychological stress that employees get from their life events. Somatic complaints like headache, abdominal pain, backache, insomnia, dizziness, and fatigue are common among employees (Aro, Paroncn, & Aro, 1987; Goodman & McGrath, 1991). Such complaints are inversely related to well-being (Millstein, 1993).Somatic complaints are reported either as in descriptive or subjective reports. Somatic complaints are a descriptive term that does not reflect any preassumptions about etiology. Somatic symptoms are subjective reports of physical symptoms such as headaches, stomachaches, or muscle pain. The expression of somatic complaints as a manifestation of social or psychological distress is recognized cross culturally (Escobar & Gureje, 2007; Murphy, 1989) but in low- and middle income countries (LAMICs) its evaluation is complicated by the high burden of undiagnosed disease and under nutrition, as well as by limited access to health services.It is also viewed that psychosomatic complaints are important indicators of psychosocial health (Piko, 2007) and well-being (Bemtsson, Kohler, & Gustafsson, 2001). By definition, they are subjective physical complaints (headache, stomachache, back ache, and dizziness) as well as psychological complaints (feeling low, irritability, nervousness, and difficulty in getting to sleep that are not caused by an underlying physical disease (Natvig, Albrektsen, Anderssen, & Qvamtstrom, 1999, p. 362).There are multiple socioemotional factors associated with reports of somatic symptoms (Garralda, 2010), including stress and reduced coping abilities (Walker et al., 2007). Children with chronic disease may have poor coping skills that may be related to somatic symptoms (Stewart et al., 2010).Findings indicate that somatic symptoms are associated with high levels of co-morbid psychological symptoms, like anxiety and depression (Haug, Mykletun, & Dahl, 2004), as well as high levels of functional impairment (Mulvaney, Lambert, Garber, & Walker, 2006; Aromaa, Sillanpaa, Rautava, & Helenius, 2000). Different theoretical approaches have dominated the research in understanding somatic symptomatology. Empirical support has been found for the idea that life events perceived as negative or stressful for individuals have the potential to produce somatic symptoms (Murberg, 2012).A stressful or traumatic life situation is one that generates challenges on which the organisms cannot completely respond. Life stress refers to the psychological response state of disturbed affect in relation to stressors in one's life as whole (Parasuram, Greenhouse, & Granrose, 1992). Life stress can result from specific major events or the cumulative effect of daily hassles (Rowdena, Matthewsb, Watsona, & Biggs, 2011). The life events tradition focuses on the global impact of life changes. It covers a wide range of events that either be positive or negative in nature. Research has shown that stressors are detrimental not only to indicators of psychological well-being, such as mood, but also to somatic complaints (Spector & Jex, 1998). Among others, the stress response is characterized by the activation of the sympatheticadrenal medullar system, including increased heart rate, blood pressure, and catecholamine secretion. Over time, such reactions can result in the experience of somatic com-plaints, such as headache, back pain, and gastrointestinal problems.Social support is a significant feature of an individual's social environment and varying levels of support will be perceived as available to the individual in times of need (Snow, Swan, Raghavan, Connell, & Klein, 2003). …",

      "abstract": "Depression is a mental disorder with a wide range of changes in mental functions, primarily affectivity, and is manifested by dysphoric mood and reductive changes in cognitive, conative and other psychic dynamisms, with the presence of psychosomatic disorders and suicidal thoughts.There is always a triad of symptoms involved: alteration of affectivity, anhedonia and low energy with fatigue, but in it’s clinical picture there are other symptoms, such as guilt and powerlessness, obsession with “ black thoughts “ with loss of self – confidence, with hopelessness, loss of apetite, and weight loss with insomnia or hypersomnia present and more frequent thoughts of death because of worthlessness in life.Severe depressive disorder is not a homogenous mental disorder but a complex of clinical fenomena with subtypes, it is a series of special syndromes or clinical forms arranged continuously from lower to highest intensity of psychopathological clinical signs with or without psychoticisam to a high degree of risk for suicide. Severe depression also occurs as a comorbid illness with other mental illnesses and usually gets a chronic course.The Report of the World Health Organization from 2015 can be concluded that the Republic of Northern Macedonia has not submitted data on the prevalence and incidence of Severe Depressive Disorder. The presented data on a global level indicate that in the world and in the Balkan 7.5 % of patients are treated in hospital.

      "title": "OCCUPATIONAL STRESS IN COMPUTER OPERATORS",
      "abstract": "During work, a person is exposed to various types of stressors that can negatively affect an individual's health and reduce labor productivity. Irrational organization of work, poor interpersonal relations in the team, too short deadlines for the realization of the work tasks, inadequate microclimatic conditions, non-ergonomic design of equipment and tools, as well as accelerated changes and innovations in technology, which require additional education and acquisition of new knowledge and skills, are just some of the factors that negatively burden the person who works.In response to occupational stress, disorders occur on a physiological, psychological and behavioral level. Under conditions of stress, a person, as a social and emotional being eager for affirmation and proof, turns to some bad habits, such as consuming cigarettes, alcohol, psychostimulant substances or anxiolytics, which additionally have a bad effect on health. Employees who are exposed to chronic stress cannot be expected to achieve the desired professional results because they lose motivation, innovative thinking and increased absenteeism from work. Stress often worsens without the support of relatives, the environment and colleagues. Therefore, early recognition of signs of stress, identification of stressors and taking measures and procedures to combat unwanted factors, as well as providing support are of great importance for both human health and to reduce company costs.In this paper, we surveyed 120 computer operators, 72.5% female, average age 37.6 years, and 27.5% male, average age 39.2 years old. 7.8% had a high school diploma, 8.6% higher education, and 83.6% high education. Among them, 32.5% stated that they have moderate, while 29.2% state that they have a high level of stress at work. Poor working conditions and short deadlines are cited as the most common reasons. Of these, 25.6% associated stress with the current epidemiological situation of Covid-19. A significant percentage, 25.2% feel worn out or exhausted, 10% wake up tired, and 8.3% try to overcome fatigue in order to complete their work tasks.Fatigue, apathy, dissatisfaction, overtime work, „bringing work home― can negatively affect family and social relationships as well as leisure activities. There are a variety of stress management techniques at the individual and organizational levels, including group therapies, support and counseling, and breathing exercises that can help overcome the negative effects of stress. Workplace stress must be minimized, in order to ensure a favorable work environment, as well as the physical, mental and social well-being of the working man",

(2) This technique has given in a purely empirical manner eight syndromes and their constituent symptoms. (1) The Syndrome of Cognitive Defect which is positively related to præcox conditions but, negatively, to manic-depressive. (2) The Catatonic Syndrome, probably the inhibitory phase of dementia praæcox. (3) The Uninhibited or Kinetic Syndrome, probably the excited phase of dementia præcox. (4) The Non-Euphoric Manic Syndrome, which is probably also a phase or form of dementia præcox. (5) The Euphoric Manic Syndrome, which is probably the underlying condition in the manic form of manic-depressive insanity. (6) The Delusional Hallucinatory Syndrome, also a factor in dementia præcox. (7) The Syndrome of Constitutional Hereditary Depression, which indicates an hereditary factor that attacks the controlling mechanism of emotional life or heightens emotivity, but leaves the cognitive general factor untouched. (8) The Syndrome of Retarded Depression, which is not as yet clearly differentiated. (3) Reasons are given for regarding these syndromes as neurological defects of a definite nature. (4) The measures used in the determination of the general factor can now be applied to the diagnosis of the above syndromes.

Symptoms of pain, weakness, paresthesia, or palsy; physical exam findings; electromyography; and nerve conduction studies are used to make the diagnosis.

No Brasil, a deficiencia visual tem crescido, uma vez que e derivada de condicoes como deficiencia de vitamina A no sangue, ou doencas como diabetes. Acidentes graves tambem sao propiciadores da perda visual. Deficiencia em um importante sentido como a visao leva a pessoa a reconfiguracao da autoimagem, assim como a reestruturacao de seus papeis sociais, resultando em uma transicao psicossocial similar a de uma pessoa que perde um ente querido. Estudos recentes ressaltam que o luto e uma reacao esperada para diversos tipos de perda, conferindo ao luto um carater oscilatorio, no qual o enlutado transita entre ficar voltado para a perda sofrida, ou para o enfrentamento dela. Tal compreensao do carater oscilatorio confere ao luto caracteristicas peculiares a cada experiencia de enlutamento. Quando nao se confere ao enlutado o direito de expressar de sua propria maneira e em seu tempo tais singularidades, corre-se o risco de faze-lo passar por uma experiencia de luto nao reconhecido, podendo este ser um sofrimento adicional aquele ja vivido pela pessoa que enfrenta a dor de um evento estressor. O objetivo deste trabalho foi investigar o luto nao reconhecido vivido na experiencia da perda da visao. O metodo utilizado foi o Estudo de Caso clinico, aprofundando-se na historia de vida da pessoa. A coleta de dados foi feita a partir da transcricao e analise tematica da fala do participante. Encontrou-se apos a perda da visao uma experiencia de enlutamento, e pode-se estabelecer categorias que ajudaram a identificar fatores como preconceito e estigma social, barreiras ambientais e falta de compreensao acerca da deficiencia visual, que contribuem para a orientacao voltada para a perda. Fatores como apoio familiar e social, espiritualidade, rituais e a dinâmica posterior a perda contribuem para o enfrentamento e restauracao, identificando-se um processo de luto reativo a perda da visao, sem que haja um luto complicado",

Any change in symptoms could be a reason to revise the working hypothesis of MUS. The biopsychosocial model proposes illness to be viewed as a result of interacting mechanisms at the biomedical, interpersonal and environmental or contextual levels. Therefore the exploration of symptoms in patients with MUS should focus on the exact chronology of the symptoms themselves, including where and when the symptoms appear.

Rather, they fit into a third category--those with the \"tired person\" syndrome. The essential feature of this syndrome is the decrease in self-esteem that follows the real or perceived loss of the ability to work productively. The decrease in self-esteem triggers anxiety, which may be so severe as to approach a panic state. The patient then becomes increasingly disabled or has increasing physical symptoms and enters a vicious cycle culminating in debility. Treatment is aimed at the physician's accepting and legitimizing the very real loss that the patient perceives in order to help him or her become comfortably dependent.",

There is ample epidemiological and experimental evidence that chemical and/or physical factors acting during sensitive time windows of the brain development can cause mental, behavioral, emotional and/or cognitive disorders. Environmental pollutants, addictive substances, drugs, malnutrition, excessive stress and/or hypoxia-ischemia were reported to induce functional maldevelopment of the brain with consequent neurobehavioral disorders.

      "abstract": "Stress is the body’s automatic response to any physical or mental demand placed on it. It is subjective and unpleasant felling of distress. Every one of us irrespective of our age, sex, education, occupation, socio-economic status, whether live in rural or urban area face stress.Stress effect body, mind, behavior in many ways and everyone experiences stress differently. It adversely effect a wide range of health condition and yoga is the most comprehensive approach to fighting stress. When we are in stress our nervous system respond by releasing a flood of stress hormone. This hormone stimulates the body for emergency action by “fight-flight or freeze” reaction also known as stress response. The agent which causes stress is known as ‘stressors’. Stress causes many harmful effect on the body such as , Physical impact - Weight gain/loss, Unexpected hair loss, Heart palpitations, High blood pressure, Digestive symptoms (such as dryness of mouth, flatulence, nausea, butterfly stomach)etc. Emotional negative effect includes Mood swing, Anxiety, Can lead to depression & unhealthy coping strategies (i.e. alcohol, drugs).",

      "title": "Antipsychiatry Against Psychiatry: Remonstrations vs. Responsibilities",
      "abstract": "Psychiatry is, indeed, basically similar to the rest of medicine. it is based upon making reliable diagnoses and applying evidence - based treatments that have success rates comparable with those used in other specialties. Psychiatric syndromes may be defined as disorders that are conventionally treated with treatments used by psychiatrists. The illnesses in which psychiatrists have developed proficiency have tended to be those that either manifest with disordered psychological functioning (thinking, perception, emotion, and memory) or those which have no obviously established organic basis. However, scientific developments are showing us that these so - called psychological ailments are linked with abnormalities of the brain, just as so - called medical illnesses are deeply affected by psychological factors. Modern psychiatry is an evolving field that is becoming less hospital based, more evidence based, and more neuroscience based. Nonetheless, during the last decades, random antipsychiatry attitudes have amalgamated and turned into a conjectural effort, which has a humanistic appearance, too. On the other hand, publicized criticisms by some associates, including known psychiatrists or psychotherapists, have, radically, stirred and reinforced the movement. Anyway, though various criticisms or worries about psychiatry, either as a subdivision in science or as a clinical practice in medicine are understandable due to existing scientific or diagnostic deficits, anti-psychiatry stance, which comprises many historical exaggerations based on happenings and primitive conditions from a century ago, may help to keep us rigorous and honest about what we do and inspiring us to insistently seek better diagnostic prototypes and management standards. In the present article, the said antagonism, in addition to the existing facts and expected responsibilities of psychiatry has been discussed concisely.",

      "title": "Exercise Intolerance: How Do We Know and Test?",
      "abstract": "Exercise intolerance is defined as the reduced ability to perform activities involving movement of skeletal muscles due to symptoms of dyspnea or fatigue. Patients can be suffered during exercise or later. Dogs presented to veterinarians for perceived exercise intolerance may have decreased strength, speed, or stamina. Signs can sometimes be subtle, with suboptimal performance detected by the owner but it is difficult to detect by inexperienced observers. Alternatively, the signs may include profound exercise-induced weakness, episodes of collapse, or even death following exercise. Exercise intolerance can result from cardiovascular, orthopedic, respiratory, hematologic, metabolic/endocrine, neuromuscular, muscular and neurologic disorders. Therefore, a veterinarian has to utilize information received from history taking, physical examination, and some particular diagnostic tools/tests in order to find the etiology. A complete history investigating abnormalities of all body system is essential. It is important to clarify nature of clinical signs and to determine whether clinical signs are associated with physical activity. If possible, a veterinarian should observe the dog during an episode that the owner perceives as exercise intolerance directly or from a videotape. Clinical signs of coughing, dyspnea, collapse, or cyanosis may suggest cardiovascular, respiratory or neurologic dysfunction. Physical examination at rest should be performed since many dogs with exercise intolerance have abnormal physical examination findings at rest. Complete examination of respiratory, cardiovascular, musculoskeletal, and nervous system are advised. It is important to systematically rule out of each previously mentioned system. Cardiovascular disorder: Dogs with congestive heart failure (CHF) regardless the cause will eventually have exercise intolerance due to pumping failure and poor tissue perfusion. Consequently, tissues do not receive adequate oxygen and the muscles fatigue more easily. These dogs will typically display clinical evidence of cardiac failure at rest, including tachycardia, cough, weak femoral pulses, crackles on lung auscultation from pulmonary congestion or edema, and perhaps cyanosis and a murmur, arrhythmia, pulse deficits, and prolonged capillary refill time may be observed. Standard diagnostic methods for CVS disorder including auscultation, thoracic radiographs, ECG and Echocardiography should be all performed. Abnormal serum lactate may be found in dogs with muscle fatigue. The sixminute walk test (6-MWT) has been a gold standard method in human medicine to predict morbidity and mortality of patient with heart failure. The 6-MWT directly measures a patient’s ability to carry out daily activities instead of a patient’s ability to performed laboratory exercise such as on treadmill. The 6-MWT in dogs is also evidenced and demonstrated a significant decreased in the distance walked in 6 minutes when a dog has CHF. This method is simple and may be a valuable tool when assessing quality of life in CHF dogs. Respiratory disorder: Defects of the pharynx, larynx, trachea, airways, pulmonary parenchyma, or pleural space can impair a dog's ability to breathe normally. When these dogs exercise, they are unable to maintain tissue oxygenation resulting in weakness, exercise intolerance, or collapse. Cyanosis, abnormal lung sounds, abnormal upper airway sounds, or dyspnea may be recognized. Observation of breathing pattern and auscultation at rest, during and after exercise are helpful in identifying a problem within the respiratory tract. Thoracic radiographs should be done in all dogs with exercise intolerance. In addition, heartworm testing, laryngoscopy, tracheal wash for cytology and culture, thoracocentesis or bronchoscopy and arterial blood gas should be performed to evaluate the respiratory system as necessary to reach a diagnosis. Hematologic disorder: Regardless of any cause resulting in bleeding, dogs usually will not exhibit exercise intolerance due to anemia unless their hematocrit fall below 20%. Dogs may exhibit a sudden collapse or profound weakness rather than repeated episodes of inability to exercise. Chronic anemia can be tolerated but, if severe, can result in classic signs of exercise intolerance. Chronic anemia is most often seen in urinary bleeding, bone marrow disease or cancer. All dogs with exercise intolerance should be tested for a complete blood count. Abnormality of metabolic/endocrine system: Hypoglycemia is an important cause of weakness and exercise intolerance in dogs. Most often causes of hypoglycemia in dogs include tumors of pancreases, liver failure, sepsis, hypoadrenocorticism. Hypoglycemia should be documented by collecting a blood sample at the time of collapse. However, intense hypoglycemia is most likely to be verified after a 24or 48-hour fast. If hypoglycemia is confirmed, affected dogs should be tested for hypoadrenocorticism, liver dysfunction, and neoplasia. Thoracic radiographs and abdominal Proceedings of the 14 Chulalongkorn University Veterinary Conference CUVC 2015: Responsible for Lives April 20-22, 2015, Bangkok, Thailand 6 ultrasonography are recommended to confirm metastasis. Neuromuscular abnormalities: Myasthenia Gravis is an immune-mediated disorder in which selfantibodies attack acetylcholine receptors of skeletal muscle. The clinical signs of affected dogs include weakness of limbs muscle that become worsen when dogs exercise. Dogs with MG usually exhibit severe exercise intolerant, developing weakness and collapse even after walking only a few steps. Response to edrophonium chloride may help to establish a clinical diagnosis of myasthenia gravis while the results of confirmative antibody against are also required. Serum antibodies to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors are detected in most dogs with MG. Orthopedic disorders: Pain from abnormalities of the bones or joints causes reluctance to exercise in affected dog. Besides reluctance to walk or exercise, other clinical signs include, fever, and lethargy. Lameness, joint swelling, and joint pain can be inconsistent, so best diagnosis is to perform arthrocentesis with cytology and bacterial culture. There are many etiologies of orthopedics disorder. Therefore, a veterinarian must differential diagnosis based on history and physical examination. For instance, hypertrophic osteodystrophy, or osteochondritis dissecans often found in young dogs. Whereas, aged dogs may have problems with ligamentous injuries or degenerative joint disease. Polyarthritis is another most common causes of joint pain and reluctance to exercise in dogs. Immunemediated nonerosive polyarthritis (IMPA) is the most common cause of polyarthritis in dogs. In conclusion, Diagnostic evaluation of dogs with exercise intolerance will vary based on determination historical features, physical exam findings at rest and also laboratory results. If there are no abnormalities at rest, a veterinarian may let dogs to perform exercise. It is important to further investigate the underlying problem systematically to rule out metabolic, orthopedic, respiratory and/or cardiac causes of exercise intolerance as well as muscular, neuromuscular and neurologic disorders. Once the cause of exercise intolerance has been identified, plans for treatment or management can be initiated. References 1. Boddy KN et al 2004. Am J Vet Res. 65(3): 311- 313. 2. Chan DL. 2008.

      "title": "The Development of Illness Anxiety Disorder in a Patient After Partial Thyroidectomy",
      "abstract": "The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5), characterises illness anxiety disorder (IAD) as the preoccupation with having or acquiring a serious illness in the absence of somatic symptoms (or, if present, symptoms that are only mild in severity). DSM-5 includes illness anxiety disorder in the category called somatic symptom and related disorders, characterised by prominent somatic concerns, distress, and impaired functioning. More often than in psychiatric settings, individuals with illness anxiety disorder are encountered in primary care and specialist medical settings. Despite negative laboratory results, the benign course of the alleged disease over time, and adequate reassurances from specialists, their conviction of being ill persists. Illness anxiety preoccupations are heterogeneous, and the degree of insight is variable. Their illness-related preoccupation interferes with their relationships with family, friends, and coworkers. They are frequently addicted to internet searches about their feared illness, inferring the worst from the information (or false information) they uncover. Patients with illness anxiety disorder often have comorbid psychopathology, especially anxiety and depressive disorders. Typically, illness anxiety disorder is chronic. Physical symptoms are absent or mild and frequently represent a misinterpretation of normal bodily sensations. This case report presents the case of a patient diagnosed with IAD by a psychiatrist. The patient had been seen by his primary care physician and therapist for three years without any improvement in his symptoms before he was referred to a psychiatrist. After undergoing a partial thyroidectomy in 2018, this patient has been experiencing increasing symptoms of recurrent anxiety/fear consistent with IAD, despite extensive medical examinations that have consistently revealed normal results.",

      "abstract": "The mental state of terror is a dysphoric emotion, feeling of dread and sudden realisation that the outcomes of one’s life events can take an extremely negative turn. The state represents the acute stage of fear, anxiety and trauma and generally occurs in mental disorders, such as trauma- and stress-related disorders, but it can also manifest in healthy individuals as the initial trigger response, the point of mental dysregulation. The mental state of terror can be specified with the following parameters: (1) perceived loss of safety, (2) unpredictability and uncertainty, (3) intense consequent emotional reaction, (4) hypersensitivity to the trigger stimuli, and consequentially, (5) the outcome that can be either negative, such as resulting in developing a mental disorder, or positive, such as developing post-traumatic growth and resilience. Behavioural biases are also a for factor the development of the mental state of terror. The aim of this theoretical contribution is to define the mental state of terror in terms of cognitive factors, such as exposure to traumatic events and uncertainty of the environment for understanding the development of mental disorders within stress and trauma domains; highlight the importance of psychological resilience and social support.",

Supportive clinical features include a positive family history, response to dopaminergic therapy, and periodic limb movements during wakefulness or sleep. The International Restless Legs Syndrome Study Group (IRLSSG) rating scale for severity10 rates symptoms over 10 items with a score ranging from 0 (none) to 4 (very severe symptom) experienced by the patient for the most recent 2-week period; RLS symptoms are defined as moderate to severe when a score of at least 15 is reached. Recently, diagnostic criteria for thePLMS have also been made available.13 These efforts have brought about previously lacking clinical instruments useful for epidemiological studies and clinical trials, at least for the adult population with RLS, and facilitated the recognition and assessment of the significant effects of RLS upon sleep, cognitive function, and memory and psychomotor performance. Here, the clinical features of RLS will not be tackled, and the reader is directed to more general works;5,14 we shall instead deal first with the consequences of RLS on the function of sleep, and the attendant mood disruption. We shall afterwards summarize the effects of RLS upon cognitive performance and more generally upon QoL. Such a way of dealing with the subject at hand is not meant to imply definite causal relationships between pain, disturbed sleep, mood depression, and finally cognitive defects and poor QoL. All of these clinical features associated with RLS could indeed represent intrinsic properties of the RLS brain or mind.",

      "abstract": "Abnormalities of mental state are frequently treated in psychiatry merely as symptoms that act as sign-posts pointing towards particular diagnostic conclusions. This chapter describes the mental phenomena prior to their becoming part of the formulation of particular disorders, but for convenience and coherence some common syndromes, such as mania, are used to draw together the associated phenomena. A hierarchy moving from feelings through emotions, moods, and affective state to temperament involves increasing complexity in terms of state of mind and usually to an increasing duration of that state. Delusion involves abnormal beliefs that arise in the context of disturbed judgements and an altered experience of reality. Depersonalisation and derealisation are assumed to arise from a disruption in the functions of consciousness to create amnesia, dissociative identity disorder and depersonalisation disorder. Speech disorder is usually separated from language and thought disorder.",

      "title": "Seizures And Epilepsy",
      "abstract": "Abstract Seizures occur in 10% of people at some time during their lives. Seizures are sudden, discrete episodes of abnormal behavior caused by abnormal hypersynchronous firing of neurons in the cerebral cortex. They are classified as generalized when both hemispheres are involved or partial ( focal) when limited to an area in one hemisphere. Commonly recognized generalized seizure types are generalized tonic-clonic seizures (formerly called grand mal) and absence seizures (formerly called petit mal). Other types of generalized seizures are tonic, atonic, and myoclonic seizures as well as most infantile spasms. Under the right (or wrong) metabolic conditions, anyone can have a seizure. Relevant conditions include numerous metabolic and nutritional abnormalities. About 0.5%–1% of people have epilepsy. This is the underlying chronic condition that predisposes the individual to have seizures. Epilepsy can be either symptomatic (secondary) when there is a known underlying brain abnormality (such as a stroke or a brain tumor) or idiopathic (primary) when it occurs in an otherwise normal individual without other symptoms or signs of a brain disorder. The most common time for epilepsy to develop is in the first year of life; over half of epilepsy cases develop before 21 years of age. Another peak in epilepsy onset occurs in older age due to the accumulation of brain insults from such conditions as stroke, trauma, and tumors. Potential causes of epilepsy in infants and children include acute brain-injuring insults like perinatal asphyxia, sepsis, and hypoglycemia, as well as chronic causes like brain malformations and genetic disorders.",

      "title": "Cytochrome p4502D6 and Serotonin Transporter Polymorphism in Patient with Bipolar Disorder Type II",
      "abstract": "IntroductionBipolar disorder (BD) is a complex psychiatric entity, which represents a diagnostic as well as a therapeutic challenge in clinical practice. The very definition and classification of BD is determined by a range of possible clinical presentations, which are sometimes difficult to distinguish from other psychiatric entities by means of a differential diagnosis, for example acute schizophrenic episode, schizoaffective disorder or psychotic depression. Furthermore, BD is frequently comorbid with other psychiatric disorders, especially substance abuse disorders, but also personality disorders or eating disorders, [1-4] which complicate the diagnosis and treatment further.BD can manifest itself for years with recurring depressive episodes before the first manic, hypomanic or mixed episode occurs. The depressive episode of the BD thus frequently remains unrecognised and misdiagnosed as a major depressive disorder (MDD), and therefore inadequately treated with antidepressant monotherapy. According to the current psychiatric classification DSM-V, BD is not diagnosed before an occurrence of a manic or hypomanic episode, while ICD-10 describes, besides a manic and hypomanic episode, a mixed episode in BD as well. [5,6] However, a clinician can consider bipolar depression based on clinical characteristic of depressive episodes. Disease onset before the age of 20, recurrent depressive episodes, which cause the person to be ill most of the time, failure to respond to antidepressants, severe psychomotor retardation, hypersomnia, increased appetite, presence of psychotic symptoms or suicidal ideations are frequently present in patients with bipolar depression. [7,8]Data on prevalence of mood disorders is significantly changing in the last decade. According to past epidemiological data, BD I is responsible for about 2% of prevalence among mood disorders, in the same percentage as BD II. MDD has been diagnosed in 86% of all patients with mood disorders, and non-specific mood disorder in 10% of the patients. Today, we believe that MDD represents 50 % of all mood disorders, BD I about 2%, BD II 15%, while 33% of mood disorders belong to a heterogeneous group of disorders from the bipolar spectrum. [9] Accordingly, it is necessary to adjust the pharmaco-therapeutic approach and introduce mood stabilizers to the treatment if BD or a disorder from the bipolar spectrum is suspected. Special attention should be paid to symptoms of the depressive episode, and all medical history data on patients with depression should be carefully analyzed for evidence of possible episodes of elevated mood in the past.Clinical research has shown that the individual therapeutic response to psychotropic drugs considerably varies, from tendency to develop side effects to therapeutic resistance. In the treatment of a depressive episode, about one third of the patients show no therapeutic response after an adequate therapeutic trial. [8] It is a well known fact the therapeutic response can be affected by different factors, such as the age of the patient, liver or kidney dysfunction, diet, smoking or excessive alcohol use. Recent research shows the lack of response to antidepressant treatment is associated with bipolar disorder, [10] and the association of other psychopathological phenomena with the lack of therapeutic response is also being investigated. However, it is believed that the genetic basis is of key importance for the variability of response to antidepressants. [11,12] Pharmacogenetics studies the influence of specific gene polymorphisms, which are responsible for the function of enzymes important in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics.Biotransformation of most psychotropic drugs in the liver occurs via cytochrome P450 (CYP P450) superfamily, which consists of more than 50 different enzymes. CYP2D6 has an important role in biotransformation of a large number of antidepressants. [13,14] The gene that encodes the CYP2D6 is located at the locus 22q13. …",

This leads to absence of sensation and neuronal coordination. The impairment may be caused by ageing and other physiological changes, accident or injuries or can be found in some cases of mental retardation (MR) also referred to as intellectual disability. Known cases of MR involving inability to accurately interpret an outside source or stimuli are: Fragile-X syndrome; Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) with associated autism spectrum disorder (ASD); Rett syndrome; Autism and ASD with or without MR; Chromosome 22q13.3 deletion syndrome; familial dysautonomia, Prader-Willi's syndrome, Williams syndrome. In this review we will discuss in particular form of ASD and altered sensory sensitivity. The role of NGF in causing pronociceptive activity and its role in peripheral sensitisation is discussed under the light of its involvement in forms of MR where loss of pain perception is a main feature due to mutations to NGF receptors or NGF genes during development. Other forms of MR with altered sensory impairment will be considered as well as additional potential mechanisms involved.",

      "title": "Mood and affect",
      "abstract": "Readers are grateful to Macpherson and Hikida1 for helping us understand the role of the basal ganglia in various mental disorders. In listing the symptoms of major depressive disorder, they mention, ‘low mood (also known as “flat affect”).’ This is a common mistake. Low mood refers to the feeling/internal emotional state of the individual – it is a symptom. It is a subjective matter and if the individual states that his/her mood is low, we are obliged to accept that assessment (we might, of course, comment that the signs are or are not consistent with the statement). The term ‘affect,’ when used in the assessment of the mental state, refers to the external manifestations of an internal feeling state – here, affect is a sign. (The term ‘affect’ is also sometimes used as an alternative to ‘mood,’ as is ‘affective disorders,’ but this is archaic and not much used currently.) The term ‘flat affect’ was coined to describe a sign of chronic schizophrenia. This largely refers to the unvarying immobile face and slow-moving body often associated with a loss (or absence) of emotional experience/life. It is a negative symptom. But ‘flat’ here is not interchangeable with ‘low’ – the important additional aspect is that the external manifestation does not vary. Where there is flat affect it is usually difficult to get an emotional response (reciprocal emotional response) from the patient. The face and behavior of the individual with a low mood may be similar, at times, to that of the person with schizophrenia with negative symptoms. However, the underlying processes are different. In one there is low mood, in the other there is absence of emotion. The external features (affect) associated with low mood revert to normal when the mood disorder resolves. The flat affect of schizophrenia changes little in response to treatment. Low mood and flat affect are distinct entities – ‘mood’ refers to subjective experience and ‘affect’ refers to objective evidence. Low mood is not always accompanied by psychomotor retardation (which limits facial and bodily movement) and the flat affect of schizophrenia may not be accompanied by low mood. The author has no conflicts of interest to declare.",

More specifically, déjà vu may result from (a) a brief change in normal neural transmission speed causing a slightly longer separation between identical messages received from two separate pathways, (b) a brief split in a continuous perceptual experience that is caused by distractions (external or internal) and gives the impression of two separate perceptual events, and (c) the activation of implicit familiarity for some portion (or all) of the present experience without an accompanying conscious recollection of the prior encounter. Procedures that involve degraded or occluded stimulus presentation, divided attention, subliminal mere exposure, and hypnosis may prove especially useful in elucidating this enigmatic cognitive illusion.",

Many proposed diagnostic workups trying to avoid the challenge of considering all possible etiologies by early commitment to a specific area of the spine (i.e., neck or lower back). Others limit the differential diagnoses by pursuing a rational but limited goal, like ruling out conditions that may result in disability or death in the setting of an emergency department. We have briefly described a long list of medical conditions, each of which may present as back or neck pain, and whose prevalence ranges from common to very rare. We then showed that they all can be assigned to one of 7 groups according to judicious history taking, physical examination and simple imaging and laboratory tests: (1) pain that radiates from the cranium, chest or abdomen; (2) pain with signs of infection; (3) pain with signs of nerve root compression; (4) pain with signs of cord or cauda compression; (5) mechanical pain; (6) rheumatic pain; (7) pain with other characteristics, with or without local tenderness. Further referral to diagnostic tests and specialist consultations after initial assignment to one of these seven categories would save the patient time and unnecessary tests. We believe that this review and the proposed diagnostic algorithm may be valuable for medical education and for application in the primary care setting for the purpose of conducting a diagnostic workup of any type of back or neck pain in all patient groups and may be possibly used for development of diagnostic software and machine learning.",

      "abstract": "Introduction: Mental disorders are defined as syndromes characterized by a clinically significant disturbance in an individual's cognition, emotional regulation or behavior, which reflect a dysfunction in the psychological, biological or developmental processes underlying mental functioning. These are often associated with suffering or disabilities. It is known that one of the striking characteristics of certain disorders is related to their chronicity, which reduces the possibility of a cure and raises the discussion about controlling their symptoms to maintain the quality of life of individuals who suffer from them. A little associated but relevant intervention, if the state of chronic users in mental health is analyzed, is palliative care and its palliative actions that do not seek a cure, but to offer the maximum possible comfort to the user from diagnosis until their last day of life. Objective: Gather and analyze information regarding palliative psychiatry and its benefits for patients with mental disorders. Methodology: Articles published in indexed journals in the Scientific Electronic Library Online (SCIELO), National Library of Medicine/NLM (MEDLINE), and National Library of Medicine/NLM (PUBMED) databases were evaluated, in addition to official sites such as the Ministry of Health of Brazil and the World Health Organization, covering the period from 2014 to 2024. Results and Discussion: After completing the data collection phase, 33 relevant articles were identified for analysis of the proposed theme. It has been noted that palliative psychiatry encompasses a wide range of issues, including widely known mental health conditions such as anxiety or depression, severe mental illnesses refractory to treatment, neuropalliative care, and symptom burden at various levels. Furthermore, it addresses ethical and psychosocial problems, psychological suffering, personality, desire and desire to die, dignity, loneliness, social isolation, as well as psychopharmacology. And that this care would be advantageous and of fundamental importance to patients with serious mental illnesses. Conclusion: Given the new perspectives for mental health care in an increasingly humanized way, the articles highlighted the benefits of palliative psychiatry and its importance in improving the quality of life of patients with serious mental disorders. However, it was also observed that many barriers need to be overcome to guarantee quality care for the group in question.",

Insomnia is commonly classified according to different criteria including the time of onset during the night (beginning, middle or end), its course of evolution (occasional, short term or chronic) and the severity of the complaint. The presence of associated signs is a decisive feature in characterising insomnia: it may be isolated or associated with other symptoms. Thus insomnia may evolve in its own right or be part of the framework of a somatic disorder (algic or dyspnoeic, for example) or psychiatric (anxiety disorder, mood disorder, psychose, state of confusion or dementia).",

      "abstract": "Cannabis use disorder is diagnosed when a problematic pattern of cannabis use results in significant impairment. Problematic and significant impairment is defined as meeting at least two of 11 Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (5th ed.; DSM-5; American Psychiatric Association [APA], 2013) criteria within a 12-month period. The DSM-5 (APA, 2013) criteria include: 1) more use than intended; 2) desire or unsuccessful attempts to cut down; 3) significant time spent acquiring, using, or recovering from cannabis; 4) cravings; 5) failure to fulfill major obligations; 6) continued use despite related social and interpersonal problems; 7) reduction or elimination of important activities due to use; 8) use in physically hazardous situations; 9) continued use despite knowledge of experiencing physical or psychological consequences; 10) tolerance; and 11) withdrawal. The severity of the disorder may be classified as mild (i.e., 2-3 symptoms), moderate (i.e., 4-5 symptoms), or severe (i.e., 6 or more symptoms). Further specifiers include: in early or sustained remission, and the use occurs in a controlled environment.",

ME describes a syndrome where there is general muscle pain associated with evidence of a disturbed nervous system [2]. ME, commonly referred to as Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS), or post-viral fatigue syndrome is a condition in which mental and physical fatigue predominate. It is characterized by gross abnormal muscle fatigue which occurs after relatively mild activity. Other symptoms regularly complained of include sleep disturbance, headaches, cognitive dysfunction, feeling depressed, bouts of low grade fever (not exceeding 38-6°C), increased sensitivity to light, back and neck pain, sore throat, irritable bowel and bladder [3]. The symptoms of ME typically become apparent following a viral infection [4], although other trigger factors have been noted. Vaccinations against cholera, tetanus, typhoid and influenza have been associated with the onset of ME [5]. It has also been observed that any psychological disturbances in ME occur secondary to, or share a common pathophysiology with an immunological dysfunction [6]. In many cases there appears to be no apparent triggering factor [7].",

      "title": "Making sense of the role of sense organs in trichotillomania",
      "abstract": "Hallopeau, a French dermatologist, coined the term trichotillomania to describe alopecia (baldness) caused by self-traction of the hair, but the term now encompasses the entire syndrome of pathological hair pulling.[1] In Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Fifth Edition (DSM-5),[2] the major change for trichotillomania (hair pulling disorder) is the fact that it and related disorders now have their own chapter in the obsessive–compulsive disorder section. Trichotillomania (hair pulling disorder) includes recurrent pulling out of one's hair, resulting in hair loss, repeated attempts to decrease or stop hair pulling, and the hair pulling causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. Furthermore, the hair pulling or hair loss is not attributable to another medical condition (e.g., a dermatological condition), and the hair pulling is not better explained by the symptoms of another mental disorder (e.g., attempts to improve a perceived defect or flaw in appearance in body dysmorphic disorder). There has been lot of debates and discussion if trichotillomania is an impulse control disorder, obsessive–compulsive spectrum disorder, or should be classified as a category of body-focused repetitive behavioral disorder.[3] Trichotillomania (hair pulling disorder) has been moved to obsessive–compulsive and related disorders in DSM 5; however, in International Classification of Diseases-10, it is classified under habit and impulse control disorders.[4] Lifetime prevalence rates of trichotillomania have been estimated to vary from 0.6% to 3.6%. Trichotillomania often begins or is recognized in late childhood or early adolescence with an average age of onset around 13 years and displays a chronic but fluctuating course.[5] It involves an individual recurrently pulling hair, generally one hair at a time from any part of his/her body, the head, eyelashes, eyebrows, beard, genital area, underarms, chest, legs, or other area. The scalp is the most common area. Pulling typically is done with the fingers, but tools such as tweezers, brushes, or combs may also be used.[6] Trichotillomania is associated with a significant functional impairment and psychiatric comorbidity across the developmental spectrum. As trichotillomania usually strikes during the sensitive developmental years, it can be especially disabling. Young adults with trichotillomania report impaired school, work, and social functioning, lowered career aspirations, and missed work days. Pulling can also negatively impact family functioning, contributing to family arguments, and secrecy, which in turn can increase stress and exacerbate trichotillomania symptoms. Adults also report that spending considerable financial resources on concealment methods and on treatments.[7] POINT OF VIEW The majority of literature and definitions focus on the act of pulling the hair, the preceding tension, and the relief of anxiety following the act. A variety of factors such as a sensation of itch, boredom, mood changes, stress, and negative emotions serve as triggers to pull the hairs.[8] Pre- and post-pulling activities are documented in literature but are mentioned just as activities surrounding the hair pulling. They receive little or no attention in the whole diagnosis, understanding and management of the disorder. There are lack of satisfactory explanations provided for majority of the postpulling activities and behaviors. An article by Woods and Houghton[5] mentions \"Rituals and behavioral patterns often precede pulling, such as combing through the hair, feeling individual hairs, tugging at hairs, and visually searching the scalp and the hairline. Pre- and post-pulling behavior are also clinically relevant. Although some individuals simply discard pulled hairs, others may play with the hair between their fingers, inspect the hair, bite the hair between the teeth, or ingest all or parts of the hair\". Activities surrounding the hair pulling provide pleasure to the persons with trichotillomania which probably acts a positive reinforcement to pull the hair. The pleasure may come through various sensory modalities which may vary from person to person. If hair pulling is only the primary goal, the patients should just pull the hair one by one and throw which hardly happens. They are involved in varied activities seeking pleasure involving all the sense organs which may vary from person to person. Antecedent activities such as feeling the texture of the hair, twirling, curling, grooming, combing, desire to have an even hairline, identifying the right hair, and then, the particular hair is pulled, all involve the touch sensation. The pulled hair is actually visualized for its characteristics such as length and color which involves the visual modality. The hairs are rubbed against each other, the snap pulling sound involves the hearing modality; at times, patients do even smell the hairs mixed with sweat to experience pleasure (Olfaction). Swallowing, tasting, the whole hair or a part of the hair is widely reported in literature which may be a way of experiencing the hair or else why should a person interested in only pulling the hairs swallow it. Oral behavior using pulled hair is present in half the patients and 5%–18% ingest their hair.[9] Trichophagia is a condition where persons swallow hair. Few patients swallow only the root of the hair called trichorhizophagia. Trichobezoar is a condition wherein swallowed hair starts accumulating in the stomach over a period to form a concretion which presents later with features of malnutrition and intestinal obstruction.[10] In a study by Grant et al.,[11] the rate of trichophagia in 68 individuals with DSM-IV-TR trichotillomania was approximately 1 in 5 (20.6%). CONCLUSION All the sense organs are involved in the varied pre-/post-pulling activities which vary from person to person and serve to maintain the behavior by reinforcements. It is also possible that in a subset of people, the pleasure-providing behaviors are these surrounding acts and hair pulling is just the modality of fulfilling it. Our diagnostic guidelines focus only on the hair pulling act. The behaviors surrounding the hair pulling problem will further help in the psychological management and also bring new insights into this poorly understood illness.",

      "abstract": "The term NOMOPHOBIA or NO MObile PHone PhoBIA is used to describe a psychological condition when people have a fear of being detached from mobile phone connectivity. The term NOMOPHOBIA is constructed on definitions described in the DSM-IV, it has been labelled as a “phobia for a particular/specific things”. Various psychological factors are involved when a person overuses the mobile phone, e.g., low self-esteem, extrovert personality. The burden of this problem is now increasing globally. Other mental disorders like, social phobia or social anxiety, and panic disorder may also precipitate NOMOPHOBIC symptoms. It is very difficult to differentiate whether the patient become NOMOPHOBIC due to mobile phone addiction or existing anxiety disorders manifest as NOMOPHOBIC symptoms. The signs and symptoms are observed in NOMOPHOBIA cases include- anxiety, respiratory alterations, trembling, perspiration, agitation, disorientation and tachycardia. NOMOPHOBIA may also act as a proxy to other disorders. So, we have to be very judicious regarding its diagnosis. Some mental disorders can precipitate NOMOPHOBIA also and vice versa. The complexity of this condition is very challenging to the patients’ family members as well as for the physicians as NOMOPHOBIA shares common clinical symptoms with other disorders. That's why NOMOPHOBIA should be diagnosed by exclusion. We have to stay in the real world more than virtual world. We have to re-establish the human-human interactions, face to face connections. So, we need to limit our use of mobile phones rather than banning it because we cannot escape the force of technological advancement.",

Describimos el caso de un nino con ptosis como manifestacion de un trastorno conversivo. Metodo y resultados: Varon de 9 anos en estudio por ptosis unilateral izquierda de inicio brusco, sin antecedentes medicos relevantes. En la exploracion se aprecia ptosis de ceja y palpebral izquierda, sin alteraciones de la motilidad ocular intrinseca ni extrinseca. Dado que la exploracion no se justifica por patologia de ningun par craneal, se sospecha ptosis miogenica y se solicita estudio. Las pruebas complementarias, tales como analitica autoinmune, test de estimulacion repetitiva, etc. fueron negativas. Tras descartar patologia organica y conocer situacion emocional inestable por separacion de sus padres, es valorado por el servicio de psiquiatria con diagnostico de trastorno conversivo. Conclusion: La ptosis es una rara manifestacion del trastorno conversivo, y aun mas en la infancia. Solo hemos encontrado dos casos descritos en la literatura. Es importante descartar patologia organica, diferenciar esta patologia de la simulacion y conocerla para incluirla en el diagnostico diferencial de la ptosis.

      "abstract": "Delirium Delirium is a disturbance of consciousness (awareness of the person' s environment) characterized by altered or shifting mental status and inattention (reduced ability to focus, sustain, or shift attention).There are also changes in cognition (basic mental functions) such as memory impairment, disorientation to time or place, and language disturbance.There also may be disturbances of perception (accurate appreciation of the environment) such as hallucinations (seeing or hearing things that are not actually there), abnormal speech, abnormal movements (including tremors or picking at clothing), disruptive or violent behavior, and sudden shifts in emotions.To qualify for a diagnosis of delirium, the signs and symptoms must have a short onset (over a period of hours or days) and change over the course of the day.It is important to make a clear distinction between delirium and dementia (such as Alzheimer disease).Dementia is a disturbance in intellectual (thinking) functions that is usually gradually progressive over a long period.Having delirium along with another medical illness can significantly increase a person' s chance of dying from that illness.It is important for doctors to identify delirium so that it can be treated to improve the person' s overall prognosis.The December 24/31, 2008, issue of JAMA includes an article about agitation and delirium at the end of life.This Patient Page is based on one previously published in the April 14, 2004, issue of JAMA.",

      "title": "PROTOCOL: Personal assistance for children and adolescents (0‐18) with intellectual impairments",
      "abstract": "The International Classification of Impairments, Activities, and Participation (ICIDH-2) refers to impairment as loss or abnormalities at the level of body, body part or organ. People may have difficulty performing particular activities as a result of impairments, and a person's participation in education, social life, work, and other areas may be limited as a result of interactions among impairments, activities, and environment (WHO 2003). Though the ICIDH-2 refers to adults, except with reference to studies using specific definitions of other terms, this review follows the classification in ICIDH-2, which does not include the terms disability or handicap. This review will include children and adolescents with intellectual impairments, which include learning impairments (e.g., Down's syndrome, global developmental delay, or pervasive developmental disorder), learning disability (also called ‘intellectual disability’ or ‘mental retardation’) and acquired brain injuries. Intellectual impairments and physical impairments affect activities and participation differently; interventions would aim to achieve different outcomes. Therefore, young people with physical impairments or both physical impairments and intellectual impairments will be considered in other Cochrane and Campbell reviews, as will working-age adults and older adults. Around the world, about six hundred million people have impairments (UN 1990), most of whom live in the developing world. Previous reviews have identified inconsistencies in the measurement of impairments and activity limitations (UN 1990) and cross-national estimates of impairments and activity limitations in childhood and adolescence are even more variable than national estimates. The prevalence of intellectual impairments is difficult to quantify due to problems in diagnosis and classification. Most children and adolescents with intellectual impairments have mild to moderate impairments. Relatively few have ‘profound’ impairments (DSM-IV R). Over five million (10.6%) American children and adolescents experience a limitation in learning ability; respectively, about 4.0% and 3.2% have moderate and severe limitations (Hogan 1997). Gross rates of impairments in the United States (U.S.) have increased substantially in recent decades as a result of an aging population that is living longer and, more recently, as a result of higher reported levels of impairments among children and young adults (Kaye 1996). Recent increases in the prevalence of impairments among children and adolescents may be a result of changes in medical care. For example, very low birthweight babies are more likely than ever to survive (Alberman 1991; Allen 1993; Doyle 1995). These children are at high risk of both physical impairments and intellectual impairments (Middle 1996; Williamson 1983; Wilson-Costello 2005). Over six million (12.3%) American children and adolescents experience some type of functional limitation (as defined by (Hogan 1997)). Of the four million American children and adolescents who experience one serious functional limitation, about half experience one or more other functional limitations. About one million American children and adolescents experience serious limitations in two or more areas (Hogan 1997). Impairments are more prevalent in boys than in girls (Newacheck 2004) and more prevalent in low-income families than in high-income families (Newacheck 2004; UN 1990). Of non-institutionalised children and adolescents aged 5-17, 1.3% experience limitations in mobility and about .2% experience a moderate or severe limitation in mobility. Respectively, .9% and .5% experience limitations in self care; 5.5% and 1.2% experience limitations in communication (Hogan 1997). About 3.2% of American children attend special schools or classes (Wenger 1995). As far as possible, this review uses internationally accepted definitions of impairments and refers to impacts that are likely to occur across cultures. However, many epidemiological studies have been conducted in the United States and Western Europe. Readers should consider the applicability of epidemiological data to other settings. A discourse of disability ethics has evolved to discuss concepts of independence, defined not as people with disabilities “doing everything” for themselves, but as having maximum control over how help is provided (Morris 2001). Proponents of the social model of disability regard activity restrictions as caused by societal and structural barriers and stress the need for their removal (Abberley 1987; Oliver 1990). In addition to structural and environmental changes (e.g., allowing sufficient time between activities for children with impairments to toilet), the social model emphasises changes in public attitudes towards impairments to encourage increased participation and improved self-esteem. Participation in age-appropriate activities may be limited for children and adolescents with impairments when social and attitudinal environments restrict their involvement (Hammal 2004; Mihaylov 2004). Impairments in children are related to societal limitation, and different types of impairments contribute uniquely to societal limitations (Hogan 1997). Impairments may affect the quality of life, health, development, and family functioning of children and adolescents (Neely-Barnes 2004; Pit-Ten 2002; Varni 2005). Limited participation in activities may have negative impacts on the mental and physical functioning of children and adolescents and may lead to emotional and behavioural problems. Children and adolescents with intellectual impairments are at increased risk for mental health problems; however, most children and adolescents who might benefit from psychological services do not receive them (Witt 2001). Comorbid problems can also impact carers. For example, challenging behaviour often occurs in the context of learning impairments and mental health problems (Moss 2000). Parents and siblings of children with impairments are at risk for psychological problems (Rossiter 2001; Sharpe 2002; Thyen 1998). Total healthcare costs for children and adolescents with impairments may be four times greater than for those without impairments (Newacheck 2004). However, children and adolescents with impairments require varying degrees of support. For example, in one large study, ‘those in the upper decile of the expenditure distribution accounted for 65% of all charges’. Costs born by families of children and adolescents with the most severe impairments were similarly high; out-of-pocket healthcare expenses (i.e. those not reimbursed by insurance or a health service) for the top 10% of the distribution accounted for 85% of all out of pocket expenses (Newacheck 2004). All children and adolescents require some level of care. However, children and adolescents with severe impairments may require many hours of assistance every day in addition to the normal assistance required by their peers. Consequently, family members (notably mothers) may withdraw from work and social life. Caring for a child with severe impairments can put great financial and emotional stress on parents and families (Neely-Barnes 2004; Witt 2001). In the U.S., parents of children with impairments are less likely to have attended college and more likely to be single and poor (Hogan 1997). The stress of caring for children with impairments may have negative impacts on parents, but some problems associated with impairments may increase the risk of impairment. For example, poor children are less likely than their peers to receive preventive healthcare (Newacheck 1988) and depressed mothers are less likely than other mothers to use injury prevention strategies like car seats and electrical plug covers (McLennan 2000). Furthermore, some evidence suggests that the development of intellectual impairments is affected by sociodemographic factors (Resnick 1998). Low birthweight black babies are more likely than white babies to survive (Morse 2006), which might affect the relative prevalence of impairments in different racial groups; however, ‘controlling for socioeconomic differences and family structure, black children are no more at risk of functional limitation than whites’ (Hogan 1997). Since the causes and consequences of impairments are often difficult to disentangle, retrospective studies are difficult to interpret. Increased participation (inclusion in activities of daily life) may have positive effects on the social functioning, development, and health of children and adolescents. There are many ways to increase participation by children and adolescents with intellectual impairments. For example, social activities may be designed such that children and adolescents with intellectual impairments can engage in age-appropriate activities with their peers. Clinicians and policymakers can work together to influence policy, discourse, and planning and to apply the social model in support of children and their families (Colver 2005). However, broad interventions may not be sufficient to meet all needs. People with severe impairments require interventions tailored to their unique impairments, lifestyles, living arrangements, etc. Skills training, education, and human support help young people control their lives appropriately and engage in normal activities. Personal assistance is support given to children and adolescents with impairments living in normal housing (e.g. family homes or school accommodation) to enable them to participate in mainstream activities in various settings. Personal assistance is directed by users and their representatives and is designed to promote independence and to reduce strain on families. Assistants might help with bathing, dressing, moving around during the day, shopping, etc. Personal assistance is provided by non-professionals; it may aim to improve health, but it differs from services by professional healthcare providers (e.g., nurses) with whom users have very different relationships. Personal assistance may be purchased by governments, insurance providers, or individuals. It may be provided directly or indirectly through payments or vouchers. Personal assistance differs from voluntary or charitable services over which users do not have the same control. It also differs from respite care, which is temporary and aims to help carers rather than individuals with impairments. Personal assistance is designed for people whose participation in many normal activities would be impossible without help. While user needs should be assessed periodically, personal assistance is designed for people with permanent impairments. For example, the needs of a person with a recently acquired impairment might be different from the needs of a person who has had an impairment from birth and the needs of both might change; personal assistance would be designed to meet their unique needs and would develop with them. In this way, it differs from rehabilitative services and from services provided for fixed periods of time. Receipt of personal assistance is dependent on the amount of help required by an individual. For example, personal assistance in Nordic countries is generally provided to people requiring at least 20 hours of help per week, though most users have severe impairments and both require and receive substantially more assistance. Some form of personal assistance is now available (often by statutory right) in all Nordic countries, most Western European countries, Australia, parts of Asia, Canada, and the U.S. Services in different countries for different users are called by different names, which often relate to legislative categories rather than types of interventions. Eligibility varies around the world. For example, countries that see services for adults as a ‘right’ may not be able or willing to provide comprehensive services for children and older adults. Services for people of different ages may be provided through different mechanisms. Rules about who may be a personal assistant also vary. For example, some countries allow users to employ family members (e.g., parents) while others do not. Differences in eligibility affect the number and types of people who receive support and these differences affect the amount and types of support individuals and their families receive. That is, the relative number of people receiving personal assistance and their characteristics vary across countries, insurance schemes, etc. Advocates of personal assistance argue that personal assistants should be chosen, trained and managed by users or their representatives. However, the organisation of services and the degree of user control varies around the world and may be affected by the administration of payments, employment laws, etc. Compared to other interventions, personal assistance may have unique benefits and potential drawbacks. Assistants may increase social participation for many people, but having a personal assistant could be stigmatising. Parents of children with impairments might be relieved to have assistants help care for their children, but assistants might interfere with family life and with users’ need for privacy, or with parents’ own needs to see themselves as adequate carers for their children. Even if personal assistance is clearly preferred over other services by working adults with physical impairments, groups that are underrepresented in the public discourse about the rights of people with impairments (e.g., children, older adults, people with intellectual impairments, and people in rural areas) may prefer other services, particularly since these groups may be more susceptible to abuse and less able to manage employees. Direct payments for personal assistance may not be ideal for children and families who have difficulty finding an assistant, administering services, negotiating or giving instructions (Pijl 2000). While many personal assistants are managed by users or their representatives, the nature of personal assistance can make it difficult to separate the roles that individuals play in supporting people with impairments. For example, Askheim identified one mother of a child with intellectual impairments in Norway who acted both as the manager of her child's payments and as a full-time personal assistant (Askheim 2003). Policies that permit different care arrangements may have substantially different impacts. As the personal assistance movement gained strength, Ratzka noted that ‘there has been surprisingly little in the way of policy evaluation. The work that has been done in this area is restricted to gathering descriptive statistics on number of hours provided by one type of service, number of consumers, staff, and expenditures’ (Ratzka 1986). Some research now suggests that personal assistance may meet otherwise unmet needs of people with impairments. Shortly after its introduction, a survey of direct payment recipients in the UK found that 40% had a need for additional hours of personal service while 80% of people receiving other services had a similar need (Zarb 1994). However, traditional reviews have failed to locate many evaluation studies and have not offered a definitive account of international research on personal assistance. A recent report by the Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare (Socialstyrelsen) highlighted the need for a sensitive and exhaustive search for trials and a systematic synthesis of existing studies (Socialstyrelsen 2005). To assess the effectiveness of personal assistance for children and adolescents (0-18) with intellectual impairments, and the impacts of personal assistance on families and carers, compared to other interventions. Randomised controlled trials, quasi-randomised controlled trials and nonrandomised controlled studies of personal assistance compared to other forms of support or to ‘no-intervention’ (which may include unpaid care) in which participants were prospectively assigned to study groups and in which control group outcomes were measured concurrently with intervention group outcomes. Children and adolescents (0-18) living in the community who require assistance to perform tasks of daily living (bathing, eating, getting around, etc.) and participate in normal activities due to permanent intellectual impairments. Young people living outside their own homes (e.g., in private or public institutions for people with impairments) will be excluded. Children and adolescents with physical impairments will be excluded because these impairments affect activities and participation differently. Personal assistance is paid individualised human support that is designed to promote participation of people with permanent impairments. In consultation with experts and the reference group, the reviewers sought to determine what minimal amount of assistance would could be offered and still follow the personal assistance model for this population. For inclusion in this review, personal assistance must have been delivered for at least 20 hours per week. Comparisons might include, either singly or in combination, family care, institutionalisation, on-demand services, escort services and other alternatives to personal assistance. ‘No-treatment’ and ‘waiting list’ groups will be included even if other services received are no described. These will be treated as separate comparisons. Studies examining different forms of personal assistance (e.g., assistance organised by users compared to assistance organised by others) will be included in the review, though these comparisons will be discussed separately as the outcomes from such studies would not indicate the effectiveness of personal assistance relative to other interventions. Primary outcomes will include: 1) Global quality of life, both (a) generic measures (e.g., the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory; [Varni 2005]) and (b) specific measures designed for children with particular impairments. Though well-validated measures for the general population will be considered, a review of global health measures found that ‘very few measures have been validated specifically for cognitively impaired respondents’ (Riemsma 2001). 2) User satisfaction. Direct reports will be preferred, though proxies might be used if users are unable to communicate. 3) Participation, including social activities, ability to participate in spontaneous activities, time outside the home, and mobility. Secondary outcomes will include: 1) Unmet needs, particularly the inability to perform activities of daily living. 2) Developmental outcomes, including cognitive milestones and acquisition of skills. 3) Health outcomes, including direct measures of muscle strength, disease, injuries, abuse or pain and indirect measures such as nutrition, emergency room visits or need for hospitalisation or institutionalisation. 4) Psychiatric outcomes, including self-harm, pica (eating non-food substances), and outwardly directed challenging behaviour. Measures might include items from the externalising scale of the Behavior Problem Inventory (Sturmey 1993). 5) Impact on others, including parental (maternal) employment, satisfaction, and quality of family life. For example, measures might include the Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36; (Ware 1992) or General Health Questionnaire (GHQ; (Counsell 1994). 6) Direct and indirect costs, both immediate and long-term. To account for normal development and the changing impacts of impairments, outcomes will be grouped by length of follow-up (e.g., 1-3 years, 4-6 years, 6+ years). The organisation of services is often a complicated task and new users or their representatives must train personal assistants. Outcomes measured during the first year of receiving personal assistance will be considered apart from outcomes measured after one or more years to account for this adjustment period, which may not be representative of personal assistance as a whole. As we anticipate many relevant documents will be unpublished, a three-part search strategy will be undertaken in order to maximise chances of capturing all relevant literature. Databases will be searched for published and unpublished studies. All electronic searches will be limited to research reported since 1980 because scoping for this project, including a review of relevant laws and policy documents and contacts with international experts, found that widespread personal assistance programmes began in the mid 1990s. Experts have noted that personal assistance was available in some form before the introduction of programmes in the 1990s, but they and the reviewers believe it is extremely unlikely that any relevant trials were conducted before 1980. No language restrictions will be imposed on any results from any search attempts, although most databases will be searched in English. Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACs) will be searched using Spanish and Portuguese terms and Scandinavian databases will be searched in appropriate languages. No filters based on methodology will be applied because test searches indicated that such filters might eliminate relevant studies. The authors worked with a reference group of users, clinicians, policymakers, and analysts (Jackson 2005) to develop this protocol and search strategy. The group recommended a highly sensitive search (one that will likely to capture all relevant reports) rather than a more specific one (a search that would identify fewer irrelevant papers). The following databases will be searched electronically: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) MEDLINE CINAHL (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature) EMBASE LILACs (Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature) ASSIA (Applied Social Science Index & Abstracts) BIDS (International Bibliography of the Social Sciences [IBSS] on Bath Information and Data Services [BIDS]) C2-SPECTR (The Campbell Collaboration's Social, Psychological, Educational and Criminological Trials Register) Dissertations Abstracts A (Dissertation Abstracts International A: The Humanities and Social Sciences) EconLit ERIC (Educational Resources Information Center) PsycINFO Sociological Abstracts SIGLE search (System for Information on Grey Literature in Europe) Artikelsök DIVA Handicat Hicat LIBRIS LIBRIS Uppsök SveMed+ Danbib Medline will be searched using the following terms: 1 Home Care Services/ 2 Activities of Daily Living/ 3 Personal Health Services/ 4 (personal adj2 assist$).mp.

These approaches and any replies will be documented by the authors. Additionally, impairment-oriented email lists (list-servs) will be sent a letter requesting assistance in locating studies. The reviewers will contact authors of all included and excluded studies to request details of ongoing and unpublished studies. Reference lists from previous reviews and from all included and excluded studies will be searched. Relevant websites, including those maintained by users, governments, other agencies, and academics will be searched. From the resultant list of articles, outcome evaluations about people with impairments will be identified through electronic and hand searches. Two authors (EMW and PM) will check titles for relevance. When a title appears potentially relevant, both authors will examine the abstract. If one author feels an abstract might be relevant, the full article will be obtained. Two authors will examine the remaining papers to determine eligibility. Study authors will be contacted if further information could resolve initial disagreements about inclusion. Remaining disagreements will be discussed with the third reviewer (JD). If a consensus cannot be reached, the Coordinating Editor of the CDPLPG will be consulted. A flowchart of the process of trial selection will be made in accordance with the QUORUM statement (Moher 1999). Data extraction will be conducted independently by two authors (EMW and PM) using a specially developed data extraction form. When more than two treatment arms are included in the same trial, all arms will be described. The following data will be collected for all trial arms: 1) Descriptive data, including participant demographics (age, gender, types and extent of impairments, social and economic status); 2) Intervention characteristics (including delivery, duration, and within-intervention variability); 3) Other interventions received; 4) Outcome measures listed above. The following data will be collected for all studies: 1) Programme differentiation (Dane 1998; MRC 2000), including crossover between groups and the differences between the interventions received; and 2) Context. Two reviewers (EMW and PM) will independently assign each included study to a quality category described in the Cochrane Handbook (Higgins 2005) where: (A) indicates adequate concealment of the allocation (for example, by telephone randomisation, or use of consecutively numbered, sealed, opaque envelopes); (B) indicates uncertainty about whether the allocation was adequately concealed (for example, where the method of concealment is not known); (C) indicates that the allocation was definitely not adequately concealed (for example, open random number lists or quasi-randomisation such as alternate days, odd/even date of birth, or hospital number) (D) random allocation not used. Studies in all quality categories will be considered for inclusion in the review and meta-analyses. Though well-designed nonrandomised studies sometimes come to the same conclusions as randomised trials, nonrandomised studies are most likely to arrive at different conclusions about an intervention's effects when groups are different at the outset (Deeks 2003). Therefore, the pre-treatment assessment and the allocation of participants will be described in the description of studies to identify differences between intervention and control groups that may have existed at baseline. Existing scales for measuring the quality of controlled trials have not been properly developed, are not well-validated and are known to give differing (even opposing) ratings of trial quality in systematic reviews (Moher 1995). At present, evidence indicates that ‘scales should generally not be used to identify trials of apparent low quality or high quality in a given systematic review. Rather, the relevant methodological aspects should be identified a priori and assessed individually’ (Juni 2001). The following components will be considered in the description of studies: 1) Allocation bias (Was group assignment determined randomly or might it have been related to outcomes or the interventions received?); 2) Performance bias (Could the services provided have been influenced by something other than the interventions being compared?); 3) Detection bias (Were outcomes influenced by anything other than the constructs of interest, including biased assessment or the influence of exposure on detection?); 4) Report bias (Were the outcomes, measures and analyses selected a priori and reported completely? Were participants biased in their recall or response?); 5) Attrition bias (Could deviations from protocol, including missing data and dropout, have influenced the results?) (Delgado 2004; Juni 2001); and 6) Outcome validity (Were the outcome measures objective, validated for the population, reported directly by the user or obtained through official records, etc.?). All eligible outcome measures for all trial arms will be reported in the review. If two or more eligible intervention groups are compared to an eligible control, thus requiring that the reviewers choose a single intervention group for comparison or inclusion in a meta-analysis, the most intense service or the service that best follows the goals of personal assistance (e.g., services that give users more control) will be included in the meta-analysis. If a single eligible intervention group is compared to multiple eligible control groups, ‘no-treatment’ controls will be chosen over other groups for comparison and inclusion in meta-analyses. For studies that do not have no-treatment condition, the most common intervention in clinical practice will be chosen to maximise the external validity of the results. When a single study provides multiple measures of the same outcome, we will report all measures. For example, if a study includes two measures of quality of life (either measures completed by the same respondent or measures completed by different respondents), we will report both of them. If measures of an outcome are combined for meta-analysis, we will conduct multiple meta-analyses if multiple studies report multiple measures that can be combined in this way. If we conduct meta-analyses in which only one effect estimate can be used from each study, we will select one measure if it is more valid or reliable than the others. For example, if a single respondent completes both a validated scale assessing multiple domains of quality of life and an unvalidated visual analogue scale, we will select the validated scale. If a study includes several equally valid measures and only one effect estimate can be used for meta-analysis, we will calculate the average effect for this purpose (e.g. the average SMD or RR weighted by variance). When necessary, the corresponding author will be contacted to supply any unreported data (e.g., group means and standard deviations (SDs), details of dropouts, and details of interventions received by the control group). Other authors will be contacted if necessary. If a study reports outcomes only for participants completing the trial or only for participants who followed the protocol, authors will be contacted and asked to provide additional information to permit an intention-to-treat analyses. RevMan 4.2 will be used to perform the following calculations. Within studies, relative risks (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) will be calculated for comparisons of dichotomous outcome measures. Mean differences, standardised mean differences (SMDs) and 95% CIs will be calculated for comparisons of continuous outcome measures. Meta-analyses may be conducted to combine comparable outcome measures across studies. All overall effects will be calculated using inverse variance methods. Random-effects models will be used because studies may include somewhat different treatments or populations. Dichotomous outcome measures may be combined by calculating an overall RR and 95% CI. Continuous outcome measures may be combined when means and standard deviations or complete significance testing statistics are available, unless statistical tests assuming normality would be inappropriate. For example, for scales beginning with a finite number (such as 0), effect estimates will not be combined unless a mean is greater than its standard deviation (otherwise the mean would be very unlikely to be an appropriate measure of the centre of the distribution). If continuous outcomes are measured identically across studies, an overall weighted mean difference (WMD) and 95% CI may be calculated. If the same continuous outcome is measured differently across studies, an overall standardised mean difference (SMD) and 95% CI may be calculated (Higgins 2005). SMDs will be calculated using Hedges g. Studies in which participants are analysed as members of the groups to which they were originally assigned (intention-to-treat analysis), studies that include only those participants who were willing or able to provide data (available-case analysis), and studies that analyse participants who adhered to the study's design (per-protocol analysis; (Higgins 2005) will be analysed separately. Studies in which the reasons for excluding participants from analyses can not be determined from relevant reports or through contact with the authors will be considered with per-protocol analyses. The consistency of results will be assessed using the I2 statistic (Higgins 2002; Higgins 2003). If there is evidence of heterogeneity (Q-statistic p less than or equal to 0.1 coupled with an I2 value of 25% or greater), the authors will consider sources according to pre-specified subgroup analyses and sensitivity analyses (below) but will not report an overall estimate of effect size. If heterogeneity remains within these subgroups, the review will report the results on a trial-by-trial basis, in a narrative summary. Large numbers of subgroups may lead to misleading conclusions and are best kept to a minimum (Counsell 1994; Oxman 1992; Yusuf 1991). If possible, this review will include separate effect estimates for the following subgroups: 1) Organisation of services Personal assistance organised by user representatives (e.g., through direct payment schemes) will be considered apart from personal assistance organised and managed by others (e.g., social workers or government agencies). 2) Acquisition of impairment Separate effects will be reported for children and adolescents who had impairments from birth, who have long-standing impairments, and who recently acquired impairments. 3) Amount of assistance The number of hours of assistance received per week is related to user needs, which are determined by social context, the availability of other services, severity of impairments, etc. Separate effect estimates will be reported for users receiving different levels of assistance (e.g., 20-50 hours, 51-80 hours, more than 80 hours). Sensitivity analyses will investigate the influence of lower quality studies (i.e., those rated C and D on allocation concealment) on the results of the review. To investigate the possibility of bias, including publication bias, funnel plots will be drawn (Deeks 2005; Egger 1997; Sterne 2001). In the event of asymmetry, the reviewers will seek input from methodologists, including the Cochrane and Campbell Collaboration Methods Groups, on appropriate analyses. When meta-analyses are performed, data will be entered into RevMan in such a way that the area to the left of the line of no effect indicates a favourable outcome for personal assistance.

      "title": "Hallucinations and Delusions",
      "abstract": "Defining terms is an appropriate introduction to this chapter. Hallucinations imply seeing things that are not truly present, or hearing illusory voices or music. In DLB and PDD, hallucinations are nearly always visual and manifest as seeing nonexistent people or objects, such as strangers in the house or yard. The affected individual may realize that he or she is experiencing a hallucination, but some people may not recognize that these are not real. In other disorders auditory hallucinations may be present, such as hearing voices. However, such auditory hallucinations are rare in Lewy disorders. Delusions are defined as false, often irrational beliefs. Frequently, these will have a theme, such as the conviction that someone is spying, or paranoia about friends or neighbors. A common theme is spousal infidelity, sometimes nonsensical, such as an older adult’s accusations of their mate starting an extramarital affair after 50 years of marriage. Capgras syndrome is an uncommon but striking example of delusional thinking in which the spouse or other immediate family member is accused of being an impostor. Hallucinations or delusions may occur in Parkinson’s disease in the absence of frank dementia. However, dementia is the usual setting for these problems. Hallucinations are much more common than delusions. Sometimes they are very limited, perhaps only present at night. Hallucinations are a contraindication to driving a motor vehicle, for obvious reasons. The fundamental cause of hallucinations and delusions in DLB and PDD is the Lewy neurodegenerative process. The precise region of the brain that is responsible is not known, however. These often occur in the absence of any external provocative factors. However, medications are notorious for inciting such problems in susceptible people. Chapter 7 focused on simplifying medications especially for this reason. Drugs for parkinsonism are well-known culprits, in particular two classes: (1) the dopamine agonists: pramipexole (Mirapex), ropinirole (Requip) and rotigotine (Neupro patch); and (2) anticholinergic drugs: trihexyphenidyl (Artane) and benztropine (Cogentin). Carbidopa/levodopa by itself may provoke hallucinations, but that is not very common unless combined with other drugs for parkinsonism.",

      "title": "SINTOMAS DEPRESSIVOS EM ACADÊMICOS DE UMA UNIVERSIDADE PÚBLICA NO OESTE DO ESTADO DO PARÁ, RELATO DE EXPERIÊNCIA",
      "abstract": "Apresentacao : A depressao e um disturbio do afeto e/ou do humor, que e caracterizado por sintomas como, piora do sono, do apetite, da auto-estima, pela tristeza, sentimento de culpa, entre outros. O individuo depressivo tem dificuldade em descrever experiencias emocionais positivas, sendo pouco aberto a sentimentos otimistas. Alem disso, na depressao nao existe apenas queixa de tristeza, mas tambem ha mudancas de humor que culminam em crises frequentes de explosao de raiva, que levam ao desgaste da saude fisica e emocional, prejuizos no convivio social, na aprendizagem e ideias e/ou tentativas frequentes de suicidio. Esse transtorno e considerado uma pandemia e a terceira maior causa a nivel global de doencas. Sao inumeros os fatores que podem contribuir para o desenvolvimento da depressao, como por exemplo, o baixo suporte social, a presenca de eventos estressantes, pensamentos negativos, problemas financeiros, entre outros. Alguns dados encontrados nos universitarios nesta pesquisa, sao considerados elevados, no que tange ao processo depressivo, e ganham maior destaque ainda quando comparados com a populacao em geral. Isso e possivel, pois e nessa fase academica que se exige muito esforco do adolescente ou jovem adulto, onde o mesmo deve aprender a lidar com uma gama de responsabilidades que estarao presentes em sua vida futura, tanto como academico, quanto como profissional. Estes incluem a adaptacao de cumprimento de prazos e horarios, a distância dos pais e demais familiares, a falta de motivacao para os estudos, dentre outros conflitos internos e/ou externos. Diante dessas informacoes, o objetivo deste trabalho consiste em relatar a presenca de sinais e sintomas depressivos encontrados em academicos de uma instituicao de ensino superior em Santarem- PA, atraves de uma escuta qualificada. Desenvolvimento : Este estudo trata-se de um relato de experiencia acerca das vivencias durante uma acao em saude que ocorreu no dia 24 de abril de 2017 desenvolvida por academicos de enfermagem da Universidade do Estado do Para (UEPA) Campus XII-Santarem, a acao foi baseada na metodologia ativa da problematizacao segundo o Projeto Politico Pedagogico (PPP) do curso de enfermagem da UEPA para a Atividade Integrada em Saude que e um momento em que o academico de enfermagem integra todos os eixos da grade curricular do semestre, escolhendo assim um tema a ser abordado, assim como o publico, que foi composto de academicos dos cursos contemplados na universidade: enfermagem, musica, educacao fisica, medicina e fisioterapia. A tematica foi abordada atraves de acao educativa em saude, organizada pelos academicos do curso de enfermagem com diversos topicos como: alimentacao, avaliacao de risco para o desenvolvimento de doencas cronicas, avaliacao de medidas antropometricas e, nesta atividade, avaliacao da saude mental com a investigacao da existencia de sintomas depressivos. Durante a acao os academicos de enfermagem, em um primeiro momento, distribuiram folders contendo informacoes sobre a depressao e, posteriormente conversaram individualmente com cada academico que, de forma voluntaria, concordaram discutir sobre sintomas que, de acordo com o CID-10, poderiam estar sentindo. Durante a conversa os sintomas investigados foram: fadiga aumentada ou perda de energia fisica e mental, perda de interesse e prazer, classificados como sintomas fundamentais; apetite diminuido, atividade diminuida, auto-estima e autoconfianca diminuida, concentracao e atencao diminuida, sentimento de culpa e inutilidade, pensamentos e/ou atos lesivos ou suicidas, sono perturbado, visao pessimista do futuro, classificados como sintomas episodicos. Alem disso, a acao contou com a ajuda de um psicologo que atendeu os participantes que apresentaram sintomas graves da depressao. Os participantes que apresentaram maior necessidade foram orientados a buscar tratamento efetivo com intervencao de psicologo. Resultados : A maioria dos entrevistados mostraram-se bastante interessados no assunto e nao demonstravam muita timidez, apresentaram-se bem a vontade e com disposicao para dialogar, o que de certa forma surpreendeu a equipe, que esperava uma resistencia por parte dos academicos, com isso observou-se facilitacao do trabalho para a equipe dos entrevistadores. Apos a entrevista, os academicos de enfermagem, organizadores da acao, detectaram uma alta incidencia de sintomas fundamentais e episodicos em um numero significativos dos universitarios, o que pode ser considerado uma situacao preocupante. No decorrer da acao, muitos academicos participantes, relataram o quanto consideravam acoes desse genero, importantes na universidade, por sentirem-se sobrecarregados pelas atividades academicas, desorientados, desanimados e com pensamentos pessimistas. Podem ser classificados como poucas as acoes voltadas para os academicos, sobretudo, os academicos da area da saude, ja que eles sao os principais responsaveis por promoverem esse tipo de acoes e que acabam deixando de se cuidar, nao lembrando-se que tambem precisam de cuidado e atencao. Deste modo, e inegavel a grande satisfacao de poder contribuir de alguma forma para esta comunidade e acredita-se que, todos os academicos tiveram uma boa oportunidade de serem ouvidos de forma mais qualificada por um profissional apto a lhe dar orientacoes essenciais que visem a prevencao diagnostica, alem de recuperacao e promocao da saude mental. Consideracoes Finais : Apos a acao em saude, alguns academicos que se ausentaram no dia em que a acao ocorreu procuraram a equipe afim de, saberem se haveria outra acao semelhante, alegando que gostariam de serem ouvidos ou ate mesmo referindo interesse de um amigo (a) na consulta psicologica. Essa experiencia aponta para a necessidade de que academicos na area da saude devem cuidar da saude mental de forma frequente sem negligenciar as tensoes e o estresse advindos da propria universidade, antes de serem lancados no mercado de trabalho. Alem da necessidade de acompanhamento psicologico para os academicos nas proprias universidades, sejam elas publicas ou privadas, no decorrer da formacao afim de manter a saude mental e de prevenir, diagnosticar ou ainda tratar quadros depressivos e outras doencas mentais que podem comprometer seu rendimento academico e a sua saude geral, visando reduzir dados crescentes relacionados a sintomatologia da depressao em universitarios. Essa experiencia mostrou que mesmo em cursos da area da saude, a saude mental ainda e pouco debatida, precisando assim, de uma atencao tanto dos academicos com sua propria saude, como da instituicao de ensino, promovendo um espaco e profissionais capacitados que possam auxiliar enquanto o academico estiver em formacao.",

      "abstract": "Work stress is defined as the emotional and/or physical reaction that the human being has in situations that surround him; in addition it can also be defined as a physiological and psychological response of the worker. Studies on job stress have revealed that lately this problem or condition has greatly affected people who work as workers; since the consequences of suffering stress from work are sufficient, they are also serious and in some cases difficult to manage. Currently stress is a fairly important factor at the social level, since it manifests itself in people when it comes to having excessive or controlled loads that go beyond the capacities they suffer. Occupational stress can be the cause of many diseases, from physical health problems such as cardiovascular disorders, digestive system problems, and dermatological disorders, among others; to mental health problems, anxiety, depression, insomnia, Burnout syndrome and many more. All these pathologies experience that work stress is not an issue that should be ignored, overlooked, or even judged, since as was specifically the consequences of this situation that currently occurs in almost all people who carry out child labor. Be very careful, because if it can be avoided they can cause fatal damage to humans or even cause death.",

The sociological plane introduces further complications. Impairment of cardiovascular function may not necessarily be equated with \"disability.\" Satisfactory and productive activity really expresses a state of relativity, as the ability (or disability) of an individual is a resultant of several intrinsic and extrinsic factors. These are, on the one hand, the physiological capacity and the emotional integration of the individual; and on the other hand, the degree of family involvement, the nature of job requirements, and even the particular community attitudes and legal (compensation laws) outlook in regard to employment of the handicapped. Nevertheless, some estimate of a patient recovering from a cardiovascular breakdown is desirable for several reasons. In view of the lack of any information,",

In addition to the operation of the above psychological factors, which constitute a psychosomatic sequence of events, there are also mood changes which may accompany an attack of migraine associated with alterations in energy, concentration, and ability to work.

Disorientation indicates that some physical process is affecting the brain, but this finding may be associated with many different medical problems. During a clinical interview, it is important to ask a patient specific questions about orientation to time and place.

      "abstract": "La discapacidad intelectual (DI) o trastorno del desarrollo intelectual (TDI) es uno de los principales trastornos del neurodesarrollo y afecta al 2% de la poblacion, es decir, a mas de un millon de personas en Francia. Se caracteriza por una capacidad reducida para razonar y comprender informacion abstracta o compleja, que tiene un fuerte impacto en el aprendizaje escolar y limita la capacidad de adaptacion en la vida diaria, incluso en la edad adulta. La discapacidad intelectual, o discapacidad mental, es el resultado de una interaccion de la vulnerabilidad individual de una persona que tiene DI con su ecosistema, es decir, el entorno familiar, cultural o institucional que puede ser un obstaculo o un facilitador. La deteccion de un nino con una trayectoria de desarrollo inusual requiere un buen conocimiento del desarrollo psicomotor por parte de los profesionales. La DI puede estar aislada, pero tambien es muy frecuente que aparezca asociada a otros trastornos del neurodesarrollo, como autismo, trastornos motores o sensoriales (audicion, vision), trastornos graves del sueno, de la alimentacion, o patologias medicas como la epilepsia, o una amplia variedad de trastornos psicopatologicos como ansiedad, depresion y trastornos de la regulacion emocional. Las causas de la DI son multiples, y mas de una de cada dos veces son de origen genetico, existiendo varios centenares de enfermedades raras que pueden estar detras de su origen, pero es frecuente aun que sus causas sean desconocidas. La difusion de las nuevas tecnicas geneticas (secuenciacion de alto rendimiento) deberia reducir el numero de personas sin diagnosticar y devolver su lugar a un enfoque diagnostico razonado basado en la clinica. La evaluacion periodica y multidimensional de las competencias cognitivas, escolares, socioemocionales y adaptativas a lo largo de la vida permite comprender mejor el funcionamiento de las personas con una DI y prever estrategias adecuadas de aprendizaje, tratamiento, acompanamiento y apoyo para una mejor calidad de vida y participacion en la vida de la sociedad.",

Stressful experiences may affect both physical/psychological well being and immune functioning of humans and animals; the ongoing immune reaction may affect other physiological functions and psychological comfort. The molecular basis of these effects involves a network of multidirectional signalling and feedback regulations of neuroendocrine- and immunocyte-derived mediators. The consecutive stages of the multistep immune reactions might be either inhibited or enhanced owing to the previous and/or parallel stress experiences, depending on the kind of stressor and the animal species, strain, gender, or age. Therefore, the final results of stress-induced alteration of immune reactions are difficult to predict. The effect of a particular stressor on immune functions varies according to the previous stress experience of the individual (e.g. social confrontation, sterile saline injection) while various stressors may act in the same or in opposite ways on the same immune parameter. In general, the efficacy of immune response depends on the neuroendocrine environment on which it is superimposed. Conversely, neural and endocrine responses depend on the concurrent immune events upon which they are superimposed. It seems that the consequences of stress on the immune functioning are generally adaptive in the short run but can be damaging when stress is chronic.",

Although not being recognised as an independent disorder in the DSM-5, the disorder is manifested in different areas of the individual’s personality and subsequently became subject of consideration as syndromal, not a simple disorder. This condition is usually stable and long-lasting, its onset usually traced back to childhood or adolescence, often being undiagnosed and/or successfully masked by the psychopath. Some psychopaths are quite successful in their profession, others are commonly related to the violence or crime.",

      "title": "Psychological Responses to Sport Injury",
      "abstract": "In addition to the disruptive impact of sport injury on physical functioning, injury can have psychological effects on athletes. Consistent with contemporary models of psychological response to sport injury, aspects of psychological functioning that can be affected by sport injury include pain, cognition, emotion, and behavior. Part of the fabric of sport and ubiquitous even among “healthy” athletes, pain is a common consequence of sport injury. Postinjury pain is typically of the acute variety and can be exacerbated, at least temporarily, by surgery and some rehabilitation activities. Cognitive responses to sport injury include appraising the implications of the injury for one’s well-being and ability to manage the injury, making attributions for injury occurrence, using cognitive coping strategies, perceiving benefits of injury, and experiencing intrusive injury-related thoughts and images, increased perception of injury risk, reduced self-esteem and self-confidence, and diminished neurocognitive performance. Emotional responses to sport injury tend to progress from a preponderance of negative emotions (e.g., anger, confusion, depression, disappointment, fear, frustration) shortly after injury occurrence to a more positive emotional profile over the course of rehabilitation. A wide variety of personal and situational factors have been found to predict postinjury emotions. In terms of postinjury behavior, athletes have reported initiating coping strategies such as living their lives as normally as possible, distracting themselves, seeking social support, isolating themselves from others, learning about their injuries, adhering to the rehabilitation program, pursuing interests outside sport, consuming alcohol, taking recreational and/or performance-enhancing substances, and, in rare cases, attempting suicide. Psychological readiness to return to sport after injury is an emerging concept that cuts across cognitive, emotional, and behavioral responses to sport injury.",

[1], est souvent associée à une souffrance psychique et notamment aux symptômes dépressifs ou même à la dépression. S’agit-il d’une co-occurrence ou bien existe-t-il des liens physiopathologiques plus ténus ? De nombreuses études ont rapporté une association positive entre dépression et risque de morbidité et de mortalité [2]. La présence de symptômes dépressifs chez les fragiles aggrave-t-elle le risque de morbidité et de mortalité de ces patients ? Les maladies mentales sont des facteurs de handicap et de vulnérabilité. Il n’existe, à ce jour, aucune étude s’étant intéressée aux populations psychiatriques vieillies au regard du concept de fragilité utilisé en gériatrie. Il existe dans ce domaine un vaste champ de recherche encore inexploré. Il est des situations au cours desquelles apparaissent des syndromes démentiels et la question de la co-occurrence d’une maladie neurodégénérative ou celle d’une évolution vésanique de la maladie psychiatrique se pose [3]. Il n’existe que peu, voire pas, d’études prospectives au long cours permettant de répondre à cette question. Les personnes âgées sont surexposées aux traitements psychotropes. Il s’agit de molécules qui auront de façon quasi-obligatoire des effets délétères, les personnes âgées étant beaucoup plus vulnérables aux effets secondaires de ces traitements alors que leur efficacité dans cette population est souvent difficile à démontrer. Une personne sur deux de plus de 70 ans fait usage de psychotropes en France. La iatrogénie est bien sûr importante avec des risques de chutes et de confusion ou de sédation excessive [4]. Il s’agit de molécules à fort potentiel cognitif. Dans une situation de fragilité gériatrique et lorsque coexiste une symptomatologie psychiatrique, la prescription des psychotropes viendra nécessairement aggraver le pronostic fonctionnel des patients notamment lorsque cette prescription n’est pas maîtrisée et répond à des critères de mésusage.",

Unfortunately for psychology, those who gave subject this attention approached it with a bias resulting from preoccupation with system of psychotherapeutics known as psycho-analysis. Owing to this bias these investigators found in these lapses confirmation of their theories about mental and they have used these lapses and their interpretations of them as a means of introducing uninitiated into mysteries of so-called new psychology. According to this new such lapses are not explainable by principles of orthodox psychology, are due to operation of mental processes of which individual is not and cannot be aware at time of lapse, are manifestation of activity within the of desires of a painful or disgusting or unthinkable nature, and betray something which individual does not want to know or have known about himself. In following analyses of such lapses (slips of tongue, etc.) as have recently come under my notice or have been studied by me, I shall show that such psychic mishaps or accidents can be satisfactorily explained by principles of orthodox psychology, do not involve unknown or unknowable mental processes, are not manifestations of repressed desires, are not unconscious betrayals of individual's secret self, and that they furnish not slightest basis on which to construct a psychology of unconscious. The careful scrutiny of circumstances surrounding lapses (slips, forgettings, accidental breakages, etc.) proves that these mistakes are results of verifiable psychophysiological processes, that known laws of orthodox psychology are adequate to explain them, that they are psychologically determined (not psychically determined), that they are not valid psychic acts and do not give expression to repressed, unknown, and unknowable motives of an undesirable, discreditable, or disgusting nature.

The following disorders can be distinguished: --psychogenic amnesia: partial or complete loss of memory --psychogenic trance: temporary loss of habitual identity with more or less full awareness of surroundings --psychogenic fugue: apparently purposeful journey away from home with psychogenic amnesia --psychogenic stupor: profound diminuation or absence of voluntary movement and no responsiveness to external stimuli.",

      "title": "Hallucinations: Common Features and Causes: Awareness of Manifestations, Nonpsychiatric Etiologies Can Help Pinpoint a Diagnosis",
      "abstract": "Not all patients who experience hallucinations have a psychotic disorder. Many physical and psychiatric disorders can manifest with hallucinations, and some patients have > 1 disorder that could cause different types of hallucinations. To avoid providing unnecessary or ineffective treatments--and to ensure that patients receive proper care for nonpsychiatric conditions--it is important to accurately diagnose the disorder causing a patient's hallucinations. In this article we describe common features and psychiatnc and nonpsychiatric causes of auditory, visual, olfactory, gustatory, tactile, and somatic hallucinations. Awareness of typical presentations of hallucinations associated with specific disorders can help narrow the diagnosis and provide appropriate treatment. Auditory hallucinations Also known as paracusia, auditory hallucinations are perceptions of sounds without identifiable external stimuli. This type of hallucination has various causes (Table 1). (1) A frequent symptom of schizophrenia, auditory hallucinations can cause substantial distress and functional disability. (2) Approximately 60% to 90% of patients with schizophrenia and up to 80% of those with affective psychoses experience auditory hallucinations. (1) Table 1 Common causes of auditory hallucinations Peripheral lesions Middle ear disease Inner ear disease Auditory nerve disease CNS disorders Temporal lobe epilepsy Pontine lesions Stroke Arteriovenous malformations Syncope Toxic metabolic disturbances Alcoholic hallucinosis Delirium Hallucinogens Schizophrenia Mania Psychotic depression Dissociative identity disorder Posttraumatic stress disorder Source: Reference 1 Clinical Point Auditory perceptions of music have been associated with partial seizures Auditory hallucinations in psychosis usually are formed and complex. (3) A common manifestation is [greater than or equal to] 1 voices. A patient might experience 2 talking about him in the third person. The may be perceived as coming from inside or outside the patient's head. Some might hear their own thoughts spoken aloud. According to DSM-IV-TR, hearing voices is sufficient to diagnose schizophrenia if the hallucinations consist of a voice keeping up a running commentary on the person's behavior or [greater than or equal to] 2 conversing with each other. (4) Auditory hallucinations also are seen in mood disorders but tend to be milder than their psychosis-induced counterparts. Simple (unformed) auditory hallucinations--referred to as tinnitus--can be caused by disease of the middle ear (otosclerosis) or inner ear. These unformed hallucinations consist of buzzing or tones of varying pitch and timbre. (1) Partial seizures may cause auditory hallucinations. Perceptions of music have been associated with partial seizures. (5) Curie and colleagues found that 17% of 514 patients with temporal lobe epilepsy had auditory hallucinations as a component of their seizures. (6) These hallucinations typically are brief, stereotyped sensory impressions and, if formed, may be trivial sentences, previously heard phrases, or commands. Alcoholic hallucinosis is a hallucinatory syndrome caused by alcohol withdrawal. These hallucinations usually are vocal and typically consist of accusatory, threatening, and/or critical directed at the patient. (1) Patients with alcohol hallucinosis also may experience musical auditory hallucinations. (7), (8) CNS neoplasms can produce auditory hallucinations in 3% to 10% of patients. (9) Hemorrhages and arteriovenous malformations in the pontine tegmentum and lower midbrain have been associated with acute onset of auditory hallucinations. …",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: - Fatigue can be defined as an overwhelming, debilitating, and sustained exhaustion that makes it harder to carry out activities and function Fatigue describes a state of tiredness or exhaustion. Fatigue is an important symptom in academics due to its association with physical, psychological and social problems and the employee health, performance, safety and general workability continues to grow. Research has shown that fatigue may result from some health and work-related factors, particularly a poor health status, long work hours and extended-duration work shifts. INTRODUCTION: - Fatigue is a state of physical or mental weariness, often accompanied by a reduced capacity to perform tasks effectively. It is characterized by a sensation of tiredness, exhaustion, and a lack of energy, which can result from various factors, including prolonged physical or mental exertion, insufficient rest or sleep, illness, stress, and other physical or psychological conditions. The need for a study aimed to investigate the prevalence of fatigue in female academicians by using a reliable self-completion tool that can measure subjective condition, either in extreme clinical cases or in routine day-to-day functioning, has never been greater. METHODOLOGY: - An observational study was conducted in Ahmadabad city. This study was approved by the Ethical Committee. The Chalder Fatigue Scale was used to assess symptoms of fatigue. Questioner method was used to collect data. Each question was scored by female academicians. Sample size of hundred participants including the female academicians. RESULT: - The result was carried out by using Microsoft excel 2016. Out of hundred sample size 38% middle aged female academicians had fatigue. The mean age was 34.43 years. CONCLUSION: - This study concludes that there is need to reduce fatigue among the female academicians. Clinical implementation: - There is a need to plan a proper treatment protocol and advice for female academicians to reduce the fatigue.

These problem behaviors are a major feature in developmental neuropsychiatric disorders, particularly in severe intellectual developmental disorder and autism spectrum disorder. Aggression toward others and self-injurious behavior are of particular concern for psychiatrists and other health professionals because of their severity, frequency, and resistance to treatment. Aggression/destructive behavior and self-injury have adverse effects on family life and can result in failure of community placement for children and adolescents with neurodevelopmental disorders. This chapter reviews the epidemiology, classification, differential diagnosis, assessment, predisposing factors, etiologic models, treatment, and medicolegal issues of challenging behavior.",

      "title": "Poor insight in psychosis and meta-representation models",
      "abstract": "Historically, poor insight and self-awareness deficits in schizophrenia have typically been understood as stemming from psychological defenses or adaptive coping strategies. Perhaps both psychological process and neuropsychological deficit account for the phenomenon of poor insight. Different models of insight exist for different broad categories of mental disorders, like psychotic, neurotic, and neurological, but investigators have increasingly turned their attention to poor insight, as an important feature in schizophrenia. A variety of phenomena might be considered as reflecting impaired insight in psychosis, like failure to recognize signs, symptoms or disease, failure to derive appropriate cognitive representations, despite recognition of the disease, and misattribution of the source or cause of the disease. The unawareness of tardive dyskinesia symptoms in schizophrenic patients points that self-awareness deficits in schizophrenia may be domain specific. Poor insight is an independent phenomenological and a prevalent feature in psychotic disorders in general, and in schizophrenia in particular, but we don’t know yet if delusions in schizophrenia are the result of an entirely normal attempt to account for abnormal perceptual experiences or a product of abnormal experience but of normal reasoning. The theoretical approaches regarding impaired insight include the disturbed perceptual input, the impaired linkage between thought and emotion and the breakdown of the process of self-monitoring and error checking. The inability to distinguish between internally and externally generated mental events has been described by the meta- representation theory.",

These physical complaints are not consistent with the clinical picture of known, verifiable, conventionally defined diseases, and are unsupported by clinical or paraclinical findings. The phenomenon of medically unexplained symptoms cannot simply be classified into one or a few diagnostic categories, but must be regarded as an expression of a basic mechanism by which people may respond to stressors as in the cases of depression and anxiety. Somatization disorder and related disorders must thus be considered to possess a spectrum of severity. In this chapter, the focus will be on the chronic and multisymptomatic forms.",

MUS are found across all specialties, can cause similar levels of disability to symptoms caused by disease, and may utilize high levels of healthcare resource due to frequent attendance and repeated investigation. These conditions include conversion disorder, illness anxiety disorder (hypochondriasis), somatic symptom disorder, and factitious disorder. While the term MUS recognizes the uncertainty around causation, it is less helpful clinically. The cornerstone of management is to assist the patient in finding an explanation that is helpful, enabling collaborative management of symptoms and ultimately allowing for a reduction in utilization of healthcare. We also describe cacosmia, a person's delusional belief that an unpleasant odour can be smelt, versus olfactory reference syndrome, where the person believes he/she emits the unpleasant odour. This can develop for a variety of medical, psychiatric, or psychological causes, but for some a cause may never be identified. We describe an approach to management for clinicians encountering patients with this distressing symptom.",

[2]Also, types of abuse are related to specific psychiatric comorbidity.Sexual abuse is more associated with posttraumatic stress disorder than other kinds of abuse. [3,4]otional intelligence is the ability to recognize the meanings of emotions and their relationships and to use them as a basis for reasoning, problem-solving, and enhancing cognitive activities.Emotional intelligence is comprised of four skills: emotion regulation, emotion recognition in self and others (e.g.reading mind and alexithymia), understanding of emotion, and utilization of emotion to facilitate thinking. [5]Evidence in studies suggests that traumatic experience can rapidly alter brain activation associated with emotional intelligence such as emotion processing. [6]Children with early-life trauma exposure show altered connectivity in brain systems relevant for detecting and processing emotional information and early-life adversity is associated with reorganization of neural circuits in ways that enhance processing of salient emotional stimuli.Altered processing of emotional Objectives: The aim was to investigate the effects of child sexual abuse on emotional intelligence in children with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).Also, there is no study assessing the effects of incest on emotional intelligence in children with PTSD after sexual abuse.The current study aimed to assess the effects of incest on emotional intelligence.Methods: This study included 30 female children with sexual abuse, 20 female traffic accident victims with PTSD, and 25 female healthy volunteers as controls.All participants in the study were assessed with the Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20) and the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS) and the reading mind from eyes test (RMET) for children.Results: It was found that the TAS-20 total score was significantly higher in the CSA victims than in controls.Difficulty identifying feelings and difficulty describing feelings subscales scores were higher in the incest group.When the groups were compared regarding total DERS scores, it was found that it was found that the DERS total scale was significantly higher in the CSA victims than in controls while no difference was detected between the CSA victims without incest and the incest group.RMET score was significantly lower in the incest group than in the CSA victims without incest.Conclusion: Sexual abuse disrupts emotional processing in female children.It is important to consider the clinical features of emotion processing that could contribute to PTSD treatment in children with sexual abuse.",

      "title": "Fibromyalgia and abnormal illness behavior: A catch-22",
      "abstract": "Sir, Thanks to the editor for publishing such an interesting article on fibromyalgia - an under recognized, undertreated condition, and an often misdiagnosed and missed diagnosis condition! This article by Prasanna[1] highlights the important diagnostic aspects of fibromyalgia and alludes to the etiological aspects of this condition. Fibromyalgia patients are often silent sufferers as the pain they experience is poorly localized and widespread associated with poor sleep and fatigue. When the doctors are unable to find any positive findings on routine investigation they may label it as being psychological (which often may be a comorbid condition rather than the primary diagnosis), malingering and may just not be considered worthy of pain relief and be referred to mental health professionals. The patient often ends up visiting many health professionals and 'doctor shopping' for relief of symptoms. They exhibit features of abnormal illness behavior (AIB). AIB[2] is an important issue in fibromyalgia. Illness behavior is defined as 'the ways in which given symptoms may be differentially perceived, evaluated, and acted (or not acted) upon';[3] whereas, AIB is a maladaptive ways of perceiving one's health status.[2] Another related concept is the 'sick role' which may be of relevance in fibromyalgia.[4] In fibromyalgia, patients experience pain, fatigue, and poor sleep and consider themselves ill; however, the health professionals may not find any objective evidence of illness and resulting in discrepancy in patient's illness behavior and the health professional's assessment. Thus, it appears that fibromyalgia patients may have AIB or a sick role. In a study on patients presenting with predominant AIBs with chronic pain or fatigue as presenting complaint were examined for fibromyalgia and nearly 33% of these patients fulfilled criteria for fibromyalgia as per American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria.[5] In fact, majority had one or more tender points and 33 patients had more than 10 tender points. The tender points were more common in patients who are diagnosed as somatoform disorder, on left side than on right side and were higher in females. The study emphasized that the features of fibromyalgia need to be looked for in somatizers in order to diagnose and treat them appropriately.[6] This is a catch-22 situation in pain practice! On one hand, it appears that patients with fibromyalgia perceive symptoms in the absence of any positive laboratory tests, but seek consultations for symptom relief and a diagnostic label for the symptoms. In this way, they fulfill criteria for AIB.[2] On the other hand, patients with fibromyalgia receive a diagnosis after many consultations and may be dubbed as having AIB while they actually are suffering and need treatment for the same!!! Pain practitioners need to be aware about AIB in their patients reporting chronic pain (especially non-organic) or multiple sites of pain, as in fibromyalgia. Studies on AIB in chronic pain patients in Indian settings have been already reported,[7] and the authors are involved in an ongoing study on AIB in chronic pain patients. Source of Support: None. Conflict of Interest: None declared.",

A number of other psychiatric disorders e.g. bipolar disorder, ADHD, PTSD, and some other anxiety disorders, antisocial and borderline personality, co-occur with substance-use disorders and may account for some of the association between depression and substance abuse.

Pathological gamblers fail to resist the impulse to gamble, with the resulting loss of control in their gambling behavior. 2. Pathological gambling is a primary mental health disorder of impulse control. 3. Treatment for pathological gamblers should be individualized, and interventions should address both the gambling disorder and any comorbid disorders.",

In the history of DSM, it first appeared as 'isolated explosive disorder' in DSM-III. However, with some changes in the diagnostic criteria, it is included under the title of 'destructive, impulse control and conduct disorders' in DSM-5. Although previous studies have shown it is a rare disorder, recent epidemiological studies suggest it may be more common than thought. For this reason, it is essential to master the clinical features and learn the treatment methods in order to recognize people with this disorder and apply the appropriate treatment.",

It is defined as a\r\ncondition typically characterized by symptoms of mental and physical tension or strain as depression or\r\nhypertension, which can result from a reaction to a situation in which a person feels threatened or pressured or\r\nboth .The stress which enhances function (physical or mental, such as through strength training or challenging\r\nwork) is called eustress, while persistent stress that is not resolved through coping or adaptation and may lead\r\nto anxiety or withdrawal (depression) behavior is known as distress . Medical training is identified as full of stress\r\nand it is also observed that students undergo tremendous stress during various years of medical training. In\r\nmany medical schools, the environment itself is an all prevailing pressure situation, providing an authoritarian\r\nand rigid system, one that encourages competition rather than cooperation between learners . It is not just the\r\nundergraduate study period which brings stress but it may continue during the internship, postgraduate study\r\nperiod, and later into physician's practical life . The stress may also reach burnout levels",

      "title": "Myofascial Pain, Fibromyalgia or Fibrositis?",
      "abstract": "The terms myofascial pain, fibromyalgia and fibrositis are critically examined. They constitute diagnostic labels for non-specific musculoskeletal aches and pains. Analysis of the evidence shows that none of these labels is substantiated by hard physical signs or by laboratory evidence of consistent pathological or biochemical abnormality. What is the objective evidence for disorder(s) of muscle, fascia or fibrous tissues, so clearly indicated by these diagnostic names? Alternative terms such as ‘regional pain syndrome’ or ‘chronic pain syndrome’ merely redefine the clinical problem without providing a mechanism or basis for diagnosis. Despite different diagnostic criteria, these conditions, along with chronic fatigue syndrome, have many demographic and clinical similarities, most notably tender trigger points. Indeed, the terms are often used interchangeably. There are few differences in the symptoms, physical findings, laboratory tests, functional status, psychosocial features and psychiatric disorders. This paper seeks not to deny the existence of aches and pains, but to critically examine the utility of these terms. The only claimed physical sign is the presence of tender trigger points over muscles or muscle attachments. Research suggests that tender points are a measure of general distress related to pain complaints but separately associated with fatigue and depression. They are present in some normal subjects and are variable in occurrence in time in the same individual. They reflect no demonstrable pathology. It is therefore argued that none of these commonly used diagnoses represent distinct disease entities. A possible but unproven alternative hypothesis is that such symptoms relate to neural pain with both peripheral and central components, and in some instances psychological or wilful embellishment.",

However, the physiotherapist often detects physical signs in these patients: changes in posture, holding breath, tense and hard musculature, and poor balance. The findings are dependent on what is being sought. The view of the body as ambiguous, as something a person has and is, can shed light on the way life has left its traces in the body, such as changes in posture and poor balance. In this article it will be argued that combining a physiotherapeutic, a phenomenological, and a biological perspective can make chronic muscular pain more comprehensible. Chronic muscular pain can be perceived not as a sign representing a symbol of underlying factors but rather as a sign understood as an expression of the bodily state.",

In obsessive compulsive disorder, patient is compelled to think the opposite of what is said (Contrast thinking). Whether same type phenomenon can occur in affective domain- compulsion to express an opposite emotion to the existing situation has not been described in literature. This case report addresses the dilemma about phenomena and nomenclature regarding above experience. Aims and methods This case report is about a 28 year old unmarried male patient who reported experiencing emotions opposite to the prevailing external circumstances i.e, uncontrollable urge to laugh in sad situations, which occurred episodically since 15 years. It was very distressing to the patient and made him anxious & sad. There were no other obsessive compulsive phenomenon. He did not have any psychotic features like delusions, hallucinations, or thought disorder. There was no decline in functioning in any spheres of his life. Differentiating this experience from inappropriate affect occurring in schizophrenia can be difficult but is essential. A provisional diagnosis of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder with features of ‘Contrast emotion’ was made and patient was advised Cap. Fluoxetine 20mg OD. Results Patient did not adhere to the pharmacological regimen advised. He came for follow up once, when he reported one more similar episode. Conclusions Abnormalities in experience and expression of emotions have to be closely analysed to delineate the phenomenon as it can have diagnostic and therapeutic implications.",

      "title": "BURNOUT SYNDROME AS A MANIFESTATION OF TEACHER'S PROFESSIONAL DEFORMATION",
      "abstract": "Professional deformation is the destruction that occurs during work activity and negatively affects its performance. In addition, the destructions generate professionally undesirable qualities changing both professional and personal behaviour. Furthermore, professional deformation has the greatest impact on the personal characteristics of representatives of those professions whose work relates to people (teachers, psychologists, social and medical workers, officials, leaders, police officers, etc.). One of the significant signs related to professional deformation of teachers is the emotional burnout syndrome. Burnout syndrome is viewed as a process of gradual loss of emotional, cognitive and physical energy, which is characterized by the symptoms of emotional and mental exhaustion, as well as physical fatigue, personal isolation, depersonalization, and reduced satisfaction in performance. It is mainly regarded as the result of stress which has not been successfully dealt with at the workplace. Above all, there are three main symptoms of emotional burnout syndrome: extreme exhaustion, detachment from clients (patients, pupils, students) and from work, a sense of inefficiency and lack of achieving high-performance goals. Recent research suggests five key groups of symptoms regarding burnout syndrome. These include both physical, emotional, behavioural, social symptoms and intellectual state. As a result, scientists came to the conclusion that personal, role and organizational factors play an essential role in professional burnout. This paper gives an overview of diagnostic criteria and methods of prevention for burnout syndrome, which are of primary importance for representatives of all professions, especially those who are at risk.",

The psychological consequences of having a wound may include stress, sleep disturbances, negative mood and social isolation. These outcomes may be a result of the physical effects of the wound, such as pain or high levels of exudate. Wound management problems, mobility issues and malodour will also have an impact on the patient’s psychological well-being. These consequences may, in turn, have a profound impact on the healing of a chronic wound and therefore affect an individual’s quality of life.",

Zu beurteilen sind die körperlichen Voraussetzungen, nämlich die Gebrauchsfähigkeit von Armen und Beinen, das Sehvermögen und das Gleichgewicht sowie geistige (psychische) Voraussetzungen, nämlich die (visuelle) Wahrnehmungsfähigkeit, die Aufmerksamkeit und die Belastbarkeit. Zu deren Überprüfung werden in der Regel geeignete, objektivierbare psychologische Testverfahren verlangt. Festgestellte Eignungsmängel können unter Umständen durch entsprechende Hilfsmittel, Kfz-Umbauten oder durch eine besonders erfahrene, vorausschauende und sicherheitsbewusste Fahrweise kompensiert werden. Nicht kompensiert werden können homonyme Hemianopsie, persistierende Doppelbilder bei Geradeausblick, unvorhersehbar attackenförmig auftretender Schwindel, visuelles Hemineglektsyndrom sowie charakterliche Mängel. In der Beurteilung bei speziellen Krankheitsbildern ist immer vom Einzelfall auszugehen. Von einer Einschränkung der FE ist auszugehen, wenn eine Verkehrsgefährdung durch die Erkrankung/Symptomatik in konkreten Fahrsituationen anzunehmen ist, sodass ein Unfall mit hoher Wahrscheinlichkeit eintreten kann. Derartige Gefährdungssituationen entstehen durch Einschränkungen der körperlichen oder geistigen Leistungsfähigkeit, unvorhersehbar auftretende Störungen der Leistungsfähigkeit oder mangelnde Einsicht in Gefahren und Risiken. Die Bedingungen bei verschiedenen Krankheitsbildern/Syndromen werden diskutiert. Für das praktische Vorgehen werden neben der aktuellen klinischen Untersuchung ggf. ein EEG, Doppler-Sonographie der hirnversorgenden Gefäße und eine neuropsychologische Untersuchung empfohlen.",

Suicide may be the end-point of a number of different contributing factors. It is more likely to occur during crisis periods associated with upheavals in personal relationships, through alcohol and drug abuse, unemployment, clinical depression and other forms of mental illness. Because of this, suicide is often used as a proxy indicator of the mental health status of a population. However, the number of suicides in certain countries may be under-reported because of the stigma that is associated with the act, or because of data issues associated with reporting criteria (see Definition and comparability).",

They include dissociative amnesia, dissociative fugue (combined with dissociative amnesia in the DSM‐5), dissociative identity disorder, other specified dissociative disorder, and unspecified dissociative disorder. Excluding depersonalization disorder, they are increasingly understood as defensive adaptations made by individuals who have experienced severe (often recurrent) psychosocial stress, commonly beginning with overwhelming childhood experiences. Exploring and understanding the dissociative disorders has been hampered by attempts to apply models and theories derived from the study of other populations and phenomena, often leading to their mischaracterization. Sensationalism put aside, the circumspect study of their history, phenomenology, diagnosis, and treatment demonstrates that those who suffer these conditions are suffering severe distress, even if their pain is well concealed, and are usually amenable to psychotherapy.",

Patients with Sjögren’s often look better than they feel, so other people may not believe they are “really” sick. A chronic illness generates stress and uncertainty. Patients do not know what will happen next and can’t predict how they will feel. Anxiety, confusion, frustration, and depression are all common emotions. Challenges brought on by the disease can lead to changes in relationships with family and friends. People may cope well at times, not well at others. Physicians can help validate the changes in patients’ lives and encourage them to maximize a sense of well-being. Despite the challenges, people with Sjögren’s can still lead meaningful, productive lives.",

      "abstract": "Any symptom represents a perception of an abnormal internal body state. The threshold for perceiving the internal body state as abnormal varies and depends particularly on psychological influences. As a result, a symptom can either reflect pathology, whether serious or not, or be generated wholly psychologically. Intuition allowing discrimination between these possibilities is central to the physician9s art. Particular difficulty arises in differentiating between those psychologically generated symptoms which are produced unconsciously, often as a result of anxiety or depression, and those that constitute deliberate deception. Such malingering has the unstated intent of accessing a secondary gain, such as welfare benefit. The art of diagnosis includes estimation of whether symptoms resonate with known pathophysiological processes, using history-taking as a story which unfolds logically towards a diagnosis, assessing how a patient reacts to their symptoms compared to neutral matters, detecting exaggeration or falsification, and documenting evidence of psychologically generated abnormalities during examination. Scientific ability is only one of the attributes of a good diagnostician; equally important are abilities to notice things, to weigh up human nature and to recognise dilemmas. Our procedures for selecting medical students and physicians need to assess these skills as well as scientific qualifications.",

      "abstract": "Parmi les problématiques psychiques susceptibles d’entraver ou de soutenir le traitement des conflits engagés par l’expérience du vieillissement et/ou du handicap, la question des identifications sexuelles se révèle nodale. En effet, outre la question identitaire, des assises narcissiques et de la différenciation moi/non moi, la question des identifications secondaires mobilisées par les différences des sexes et des générations se révèle être une dynamique majeure du rapport que toute personne peut entretenir avec son corps. Le vécu des limitations liées à l’expérience du handicap, et de celles, plus communes, liées à la traversée du vieillissement et de la vieillesse – qu’elles soient brutales ou insidieuses, aiguës ou chroniques –, entretient des rapports complexes avec les fantasmes de castration et de passivité. L’expérience de psychothérapies analytiques d’hommes qui, pour cause accidentelle traumatique (chute, accident de la voie publique), ou pour cause de fragilité somatique (accident vasculaire cérébral), se retrouvent en situation de handicap (avec des séquelles plus ou moins invalidantes) et vieillissent ainsi, permet de discerner combien la question des identifications féminines joue un rôle capital dans l’élaboration des conflits psychiques inhérents à cette rencontre entre vieillissement et handicap. L’auteur propose d’illustrer cette question clinique par l’exposé des grandes étapes de la psychothérapie d’un homme de 75 ans qui permet de saisir comment la rigidité puis la souplesse des identifications sexuelles, de la revendication de la puissance à la possibilité d’y renoncer au profit de l’acceptation d’une certaine passivité-jouissance, organisent, gênent ou élaborent le conflit psychique et, partant, les relations aux proches, aux enfants, aux femmes et aux hommes.",

      "abstract": "A neuropsychiatric and -psychological update of the crime \"profile\" and \"signature\" is a necessary addition to the traditional sociopsychological model likely to miss limbic system dysfunctioning. Thus, occurrence of a brief (c. 20 minutes) limbic seizure has been proposed based on behaviors of 12 white male homicidal loners, who showed a dozen symptoms and signs: Limbic Psychotic Trigger Reaction. Readily overlooked can be (a) a transient psychosis (hallucinations and/or delusions), (b) autonomic hyperactivation (e.g., loss of bladder control, nausea, ejaculation), (c) motiveless, out-of-character, unplanned, and well-remembered homicidal acts, (d) committed with a flat affect (not emotionally or impulsively provoked), (e) typically involving a stranger who happened to provide an objectively harmless and only subjectively important stimulus. (f) Such an individualized stimulus triggered the memory revival of mild to moderate but repeatedly experienced hurts. Such a specific sequence of events implicates the specific mechanism of limbic seizure, \"kindling,\" which does not necessarily involve motor convulsions. Repetition of such limbic episodes with \"criminal acts\" is conceivable under specific circumstances including cases in which the triggering stimulus is associated with pleasurable delusions (e.g., of grandiose power or wealth) or constitutes a specific aspect of a basic drive motive. For example, eating or sexual activities might be planned but degenerate into a limbic episode with a specific core symptomatology.",

Yet it would be wrong to dismiss without further examination an occasion so important in the life of the mother as childbirth as of no aetiological consequence. In the types of psychosis under consideration the clinical onset had often been a sudden and disturbing event, just at that particular time in the patient's life when she was confronted with the responsibility of motherhood. Further examination of the patient's history however often revealed previous evidence of emotional disturbance, or of instability in other members of her family.",

      "title": "Adjustment disorders: the state of the art",
      "abstract": "The diagnostic category of adjustment disorder was introduced in the DSM-III-R 1. Prior to that, it was called transient situational disturbance. The DSM-IV 2 and ICD-10 3 descriptions of adjustment disorder are broadly similar. The main features are the following: a) the symptoms arise in response to a stressful event; b) the onset of symptoms is within 3 months (DSM-IV) or 1 month (ICD-10) of exposure to the stressor; c) the symptoms must be clinically significant, in that they are distressing and in excess of what would be expected by exposure to the stressor and/or there is significant impairment in social or occupational functioning (the latter is mandatory in ICD-10); d) the symptoms are not due to another axis I disorder (or bereavement in DSM-IV); e) the symptoms resolve within 6 months once the stressor or its consequences are removed. Adjustment disorders are divided into subgroups based on the dominant symptoms of anxiety, depression or behaviour. Since its introduction, the category of adjustment disorder has been the subject of criticism on three fronts. The first was that it constituted an attempt to medicalize problems of living and did not conform to the criteria for traditional disorders such as having a specific symptom profile 4. The second was that it was a \"wastebasket diagnosis\" which was assigned to those who failed to meet the criteria for other disorders 5. The third was on its diagnostic instability 6 and that its main utility was to serve as a \"justification\" for diagnosis-based reimbursement operating in the healthcare system of the US. Despite this, the category has been retained in the further classifications, in large measure due to its clinical utility. Adjustment disorder continues to be diagnosed in a range of clinical settings. Consultation-liaison psychiatry is the context in which the diagnosis is most likely to be made. Around 12% of referrals are so diagnosed in university hospitals in the US 7, a figure that resembles that in European hospitals 8. Nevertheless, the frequency with which adjustment disorder is now diagnosed seems to be declining, in parallel with an increase in the diagnosis of major depression 9, possibly due to the availability of psychotropic drugs, especially selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), that are safer in those who are medically ill than the older agents. So, changes in the prevalence of adjustment disorders may reflect a change in the \"culture of prescribing\", stimulating changes in the \"culture of diagnosis\" 10. Adjustment disorder has been reported to be almost three times as common as major depression (13.7 vs. 5.1%) in acutely ill medical in-patients 11 and to be diagnosed in up to one third of cancer patients experiencing a recurrence 12. In obstetric/gynaecology consultation-liaison 13, adjustment disorders predominated over other mood disorders. Among those assessed in an emergency department following self harm, a diagnosis of adjustment disorder was made in 31.8% of those interviewed, while a diagnosis of major depression was made in 19.5% of cases 14. None of the major epidemiological studies carried out in the community, such as the Epidemiological Catchment Area Study 15, the National Comorbidity Survey Replication 16 or the National Psychiatric Morbidity Surveys 17 included adjustment disorder among the conditions examined. An exception was the Outcome of Depression International Network (ODIN) study 18, which found a prevalence of only 1% for adjustment disorder in five European countries. A possible reason for this was that mild depression was included in the depressive episode category, inflating that category at the expense of adjustment disorder. By contrast, a study of elderly people from the general population 19 found the prevalence of adjustment disorder to be 2.3%, similar to that of major depression. Adjustment disorder is reported to be very common in primary care, but relevant epidemiological studies in this setting are rare and report rates of the disorder range from 1 to 18% 20,21 among consulters with mental health problems. Concerning psychiatric settings, a study of intake diagnoses into outpatient clinics 22, combining clinical evaluation and the use of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID, 23), found that adjustment disorder was the most common clinical diagnosis, made in 36% of patients, whereas the diagnosis was made in about 11% of cases using SCID. Among psychiatric inpatients, 9% of consecutive admissions to an acute public sector unit were diagnosed with adjustment disorder 24. Quantifying the prevalence of adjustment disorder in child and adolescent populations is difficult, due to changes in the diagnostic criteria over time 25. In the younger age groups, unlike adults, adjustment disorder carries with it significant morbidity and a poor outcome, frequently developing into major psychiatric illness 25,26. A general population study in Puerto Rico 27 found a rate of 4.2% among 14–16 year old people, while the total psychiatric morbidity was 17.8%. A similar rate was found in children aged 8–9 in Finland 28. Among outpatients, figures of 5.9–7% have been reported 29,30. In child liaison psychiatry, over one third of those with recent onset diabetes were so diagnosed 31, making it the most common psychiatric disorder to follow this well defined stressor. The current diagnosis of adjustment disorder assumes that there is a stressor which acts as a trigger and that the condition is self-limiting. So, adjustment disorder is closer to the definition of a discrete disorder as proposed by Kendell 32 than most other disorders in psychiatry, since its etiology and course are encapsulated within the diagnosis, while the definition of many other mental disorders is cross-sectional and based on symptoms alone. Yet, the current classifications impose a hierarchical model that assumes equivalence in how adjustment disorder and other diagnoses are construed. As currently classified, adjustment disorder is a sub-threshold diagnosis, that is trumped once the symptom threshold for another diagnosis is met. There is an inherent belief that a sub-threshold condition is less severe than a full-blown disorder such as major depression, the diagnosis by which adjustment disorder is most often superseded. Yet, the evidence for this is lacking, and there is empirical data 33 that, when measures of symptom severity or social functioning are examined, there is no difference between those with mood disorders and adjustment disorder. Furthermore, up to 25% of adolescents with a diagnosis of adjustment disorder engage in suicidal behaviour 34, while among adults with this disorder the figure is 60% 35. Adjustment disorder is the diagnosis in up to one third of young people who die by suicide 36, while among all suicide deaths in the developing world it is the most common diagnosis 37. These data show that, far from being a mild condition, adjustment disorder has a significant impact on behaviour. On the other hand, the current classifications fail to distinguish between adaptive and maladaptive reactions to stress. The DSM-IV tries to address this problem by stating that a diagnosis of adjustment disorder is only made when the distress is of clinical significance 38. There are two components to this: the distress must be in excess of what would normally be expected and/or there is an impairment in social or occupational function. In relation to the first of these, one of the most insightful critics of the DSM-IV, J. Wakefield 39, points out that it would allow the top third in the normal distribution of mood reactivity to be classified as disordered, and that it does not take into account the contextual factors that might cause this excess in distress. For example, the loss of a job for one person might be manageable while for another it could heap poverty on a family resulting in distress that might not be inappropriate under the circumstances. Cultural differences in the expression of emotion also need to be considered. In liaison psychiatry, where the diagnosis of adjustment disorder is most frequently made, a knowledge of \"normal\" coping with illness in that specific culture is essential and the diagnostic process will be guided by the extent to which an individual's symptoms are in excess of this. Some might argue that the fact of visiting a doctor indicates abnormal distress, yet the tendency to consult is also determined by factors additional to illness, including cultural and personal attitudes to symptoms. So, the mere fact of a consultation should not of itself be taken as a proxy measure of excessive distress. Neither should the decision to refer to psychiatric services, since this too is governed by factors that are not always related to symptom severity (e.g., a wish \"to do something\" under pressure from a patient in the face of continuing distress). Because adjustment disorder is a diagnosis made in the context of a stressor, there is a danger that any distress following such an event might be labelled as a disorder 40. Clinical judgement, therefore, plays a large part in making the diagnosis of adjustment disorder in the current criterion vacuum and future classifications should accord weight to culture, context and personal circumstances in differentiating normal from pathological distress. The second criterion, requiring impairment in functioning, is arguably a more robust indicator of disorder, since it is this which leads to treatment seeking. For example, the inability to work is potentially a significant indicator of impairment. However, there may be situations where functioning is reduced in the presence of non-pathological reactions. For instance, if the circumstances are especially traumatic, such as the loss of a child, the period of impaired function may be longer than anticipated in those with non-pathological responses. The evaluation of functioning in children places special demands on the assessor, since it has to be set against the demands of the developmental stage, and the degree of dependency and autonomy in key relationships. The presence of pre-existing impairment and extant vulnerabilities, such as learning disability and developmental disorders, must also be considered when making the evaluation. The ICD-10, contrary to the DSM-IV, requires the presence of both excessive symptoms and functional impairment for the diagnosis of adjustment disorder, thus narrowing the application of this category. Because of the hierarchical nature of ICD-10 and DSM-IV, adjustment disorder cannot be diagnosed once the criteria for another condition are met. The condition that most frequently trumps adjustment disorder is major depression/depressive episode. This is evident from studies that compare the clinical with the research approach. For example, in a study of those presenting because of self-harm, a clinical diagnosis of adjustment disorder was made in 31.8% and one of major depression in 19.5% of cases, but using SCID the proportions changed to 7.8% and 36.4% respectively 14. However, there is a point of departure between the two conditions when other variables are considered. Suicidal behaviour occurs earlier in the course of adjustment disorder as compared to major depression 41 and the interval from suicidal communication to completion of suicide is shorter 42. The socio-demographic profile and childhood risk variables differ between the two groups 41. Among adolescents dying by suicide, there is much less evidence of prior emotional or behavioural problems 42. In addition, the readmission rates for those with adjustment disorder are significantly lower than for those with major depression, generalized anxiety or dysthymia 43 and hospitalization is also shorter 6. This highlights the need for the clearer operationalization of adjustment disorder in future classifications. A further but lesser area of potential overlap is with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The conflation is not so much related to the symptoms of these disorders but to the stressors themselves. There has been an expansion in the stressors that are deemed to trigger PTSD, from those that are potentially life threatening, as originally described, to events that are less traumatic, such as financial problems or watching distressing images on television – a phenomenon called \"criterion creep\" 44. In clinical practice, a diagnosis of PTSD is often made reflexively 45 once such an event is identified, although adjustment disorder might be a more appropriate diagnosis. Overall, it is clear from the data available that adjustment disorder is sufficiently severe and distinct from other disorders, especially major depression, to warrant upgrading from its sub-syndromal status to that of a full-blown and independent mental disorder. Criteria for the DSM-IV revision have already been suggested 46. The Clinical Interview Schedule (CIS, 47) and the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI, 48) do not incorporate adjustment disorder at all. The Schedules for Clinical Assessment in Neuropsychiatry (SCAN, 49) do include adjustment disorder, but only at the end of the interview, in section 13, which deals with \"inferences and attributions\". This comes after the criteria for all other disorders have been completed, and there are no specific questions with regard to adjustment disorder to assist the interviewer, relying instead on clinical judgement. The SCID 23 also includes a section dealing with adjustment disorder, but the instructions to interviewers specify that this diagnosis is not made if the criteria for any other mental disorder are met, with the de facto effect of relegating it to a sub-syndromal status. In light of the very low threshold for diagnosing major depression, even in studies using SCID and purporting to be inclusive of adjustment disorder, major depression will often supersede adjustment disorder, irrespective of the context in which the symptoms have arisen. The Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI, 50) also incorporates a section on adjustment disorder but, as in SCID, that disorder is trumped when any other diagnosis is made. So, while structured interviews have greatly facilitated epidemiological research in psychiatry, the possibility that they are overly rigid, having been designed for use by lay interviewers, cannot be excluded. This is especially pertinent for a diagnosis such as adjustment disorder, which relies heavily on clinical judgement, context and presumptive longitudinal course rather than symptoms alone. As a result of the problems with the current crop of structured diagnostic instruments, attempts have been made to identify suitable screening instruments for adjustment disorder. Because there is symptom overlap with major depression, there is a possibility that instruments which screen for depression might identify people with adjustment disorder. A number of scales have been used for this purpose, including the Zung Depression Scale 51, which has been shown to be an adequate screen for adjustment disorder and major depression combined 52, but when compared to SCID has inadequate sensitivity and specificity 53. A study of health care workers with \"reactive depression\", an old-fashioned diagnosis but one which encapsulates the concept of adjustment disorder most closely, found little correlation with the Zung scale score 54. Efforts to develop a screening instrument using a coping measure have also been unsuccessful 55. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS, 56) has been used for screening purposes in cancer patients, but it does not distinguish between major depression and adjustment disorder 57. Similar problems arose when the 1-Question Interview and the Impact Thermometer 58 were tested for their ability to screen for adjustment disorder. The Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology 59 might have a role in distinguishing adjustment disorder from major depression and has been used in one study reporting that non-environmentally induced disorder had more melancholic symptoms and a different quality to the mood changes compared to environmentally triggered disorder 59. Further investigation of this is clearly required. Adjustment disorder cannot be diagnosed in the absence of a stressor. The event must be external and occur in close time proximity to the onset of symptoms. The longer the time period between the triggering event and the onset of symptoms, the less likely is the diagnosis to be adjustment disorder. For this reason, a period between the event and symptom onset of 3 months in DSM-IV and 1 month in ICD-10 is required. Caution must be exercised when this gap is relatively long, for two reasons: firstly, those who are depressed often attach significance to particular events, that in themselves were neutral in effect at the time, in an \"effort at meaning\"; secondly, recall bias may lead to an unreliable date of the event. The 3 month upper limit may prove to be excessively long and it is difficult to ascertain the empirical data on which this is based. Concerning the type of event, there is little to assist the clinician in distinguishing adjustment disorder from major depression. While 100% of those with a diagnosis of adjustment disorder have recent life events, 83% of those with major depression also report such events, with more related to marital problems and fewer to occupational or family stressors in the adjustment disorder group 60. Such differences, while statistically significant, are unlikely to be clinically meaningful in an individual patient, since they are not exclusive as precipitants to either major depression or adjustment disorder. And the events can range in severity from those that are generally regarded as mild, such as a row with a boyfriend, to those that are more serious. This will be mediated by individual vulnerability. In the preamble to the section on adjustment disorder, the ICD-10 states that \"individual vulnerability and risk plays a greater role than in other disorders\" such as PTSD or acute stress reactions. However, it is unclear on what evidence this is based. By contrast, the DSM-IV is silent on this issue. The possibility that a diathesis-stress model operates is worthy of consideration and personality is arguably the most obvious predisposing factor. There have been few studies directly comparing adjustment disorder against other disorders to allow definitive claims about the role of personality, and caution is advisable in the current state of knowledge. The relevant studies can be classified in two broad groups: those directly examining adjustment disorder and those examining diagnoses akin to adjustment disorder. The prevalence of personality disorder among those with adjustment disorder in comparison to those with other depressive disorders seems to be not different 20, although studies are few and numbers small. Among personality dimensions, neuroticism emerged as a factor predisposing to adjustment disorder in a military sample 61. Attachment style has also been examined, and maternal overprotection was found to be a risk factor for later adjustment disorder 62,63, while paternal abuse was associated with the severity of the disorder 63. Studies using terminologies that imply a diagnosis of adjustment disorder, such as \"reactive\", \"non-endogenous\" or \"situational\" depression, are also of interest, although there is a caveat that these conditions may not be identical to adjustment disorder due to differences in the definitions in the earlier classifications. One such study 64 found that the strongest relationship was between premorbid neuroticism and a non-endogenous symptom pattern and evidence of \"oral dependent\" personality. The findings in relation to neuroticism and a non-endogenous pattern of symptoms were replicated by others 65 in studies of subjects and their relatives 66. The absence of clear symptomatological criteria for adjustment disorder in either DSM-IV or ICD-10 means that greater weight is attached to clinical judgement than in most other current conditions. Symptoms of low mood, sadness, worry, anxiety, insomnia, poor concentration, having their onset following a recent stressful event are likely indicators of a diagnosis of adjustment disorder, although it must be borne in mind that major depression can also present similarly. Mood disturbance is often more noticeable when the person is cognitively engaged with the event, such as when speaking about it, while at other times mood is normal and reactive. The removal of the person from the stressful situation is associated with a general improvement in symptoms. In the case of those who develop adjustment disorder in response to serious illness, changes in mood are related to changes in the illness itself. The more typically \"melancholic\" the symptoms are — e.g., diurnal change, early morning wakening, loss of mood reactivity — the less likely is the diagnosis of adjustment disorder. A family history of depression might also suggest a depressive episode. Due to the low symptom threshold for diagnosing major depression, it is easy to make a diagnosis of this condition rather than adjustment disorder. While the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidelines on depression recommend a period of \"watchful waiting\" 67, so as to allow for the possibility of spontaneous resolution, under pressure from the patient and his/her family, or the doctor's own desire \"to do something\", a diagnosis of major depression (or generalized anxiety) may be made and antidepressants prescribed. Difficulties also arise when the stressor, and hence the symptoms, is persistent and has little likelihood of resolving. Antidepressants may be prescribed on pragmatic grounds, as there is no way of establishing if the symptoms are likely to spontaneously remit or if they are now independent of the initial trigger and constitute major depression. The absence of a response to antidepressants should raise the possibility that this is an adjustment disorder, so that psychological therapies are offered rather than engaging in protracted trails of multiple medications. A further consideration is that what appears to be a single stressor (e.g., a diagnosis of a serious physical illness) may be associated with ongoing symptoms as different facets of the diagnosis impinge upon the patient (e.g., the initiation of painful treatments, treatment failures, etc.). Failure to appreciate that rolling stressors prolong symptoms might lead to an erroneous diagnosis of major depression. The role of the consequences of the initial stressor in prolonging symptoms is recognized in the DSM-IV definition of adjustment disorder. Based on the predominant symptoms, several subtypes of adjustment disorder are recognised by DSM-IV and ICD-10 (Table 1). The subtypes are broadly similar in the two classifications but, apart from adjustment disorder with depressed mood, they have received little attention. The depressed subtype is the most common in adults, while the subtypes with predominant disturbance of conduct or of conduct and emotions are more commonly diagnosed among children and adolescents. The distinction between adjustment disorder and a normal stress response is based on the severity of symptoms and their duration; the impact on functioning taking into account the nature of the stressor; the personal and interpersonal context in which it has occurred; cultural norms with regard to such responses. PTSD and acute stress disorder require the presence of a stressor of a magnitude that would be traumatic for almost everybody and the symptom constellation is also specific, although both of these have recently been challenged 40. Moreover, not everybody exposed to such traumatic events responds by developing PTSD and the possibility that other disorders can follow instead needs to be considered. For those not meeting the PTSD diagnostic criteria, but with significant symptoms and/or functional impairment, adjustment disorder should be considered a possible alternative. What may appear to be an adjustment disorder, because of the sub-threshold level of the symptoms or the lack of functional impairment, might be an axis I disorder in evolution that only emerges as a recognizable syndrome after a period of watchful waiting. Thus, the revision of an index diagnosis of adjustment disorder may be necessary at times, especially if there are persisting symptoms in spite of termination of the stressor. Few studies have examined the disorders that are comorbid with adjustment disorder, an exercise that is hampered by the fact that the criteria for this disorder preclude axis I comorbidity. Yet, a recent study 19 found that almost half of patients exhibited comorbidity with major depression or PTSD. Surprisingly, complicated grief and adjustment disorder were not significantly comorbid. The relationship between substance abuse and adjustment disorder is also deserving of mention, since it may explain the seeming instability of the adjustment disorder diagnosis. Firstly, substances may be misused for relief of symptoms such as anxiety and depression, which are prominent in adjustment disorder. Substances such as alcohol are themselves depressogenic and may present with mood changes leading to misdiagnosis. This may explain why in one study 6 several patients with an admission diagnosis of adjustment disorder were relabelled on discharge as having a primary diagnosis of substance misuse. The evidence base for the treatment of adjustment disorder is limited, due to the paucity of studies. A further problem is that these are self-remitting conditions, so that trials of interventions may fail to identify any benefits due to spontaneous resolution. In general, brief therapies are regarded as being the most appropriate, with the exception that, when stressors are ongoing, prolonged supportive measures may be necessary. However, there is a caveat for children and adolescents diagnosed with adjustment disorder, since there is evidence 26 that a majority of adolescents eventually develop major mental disorders. Practical measures may be useful to assist the person in managing the stressful situation. A person being bullied at work might decide to invoke an internal redress system or may seek the support of the trade union. A person in an abusive relationship might seek a barring order. A vulnerable person taking on too much work may benefit from simple, directive advice. Harnessing family members' input, involving supportive agencies such as social services or encouraging involvement in a support or self-help group may alleviate distress. Psychological therapies, delivered individually or in groups, span the range including supportive, psychoeducational, cognitive and psychodynamic approaches. Relaxation techniques can reduce symptoms of anxiety. Facilitating the verbalization of fears and emotions and exploring the meaning that the stressor has for the individual might also ameliorate symptoms. In persons who engage in deliberate self-harm, assistance in finding alternative responses that do not involve self-destruction may be of benefit and to date dialectical behaviour therapy (DBT) has the best evidence base 68. Ego enhancing therapy was found to be useful during periods of transition in older patients 69. \"Mirror therapy\", a therapy including psychocorporeal, cognitive, and neurolinguistic components, was effective in patients with adjustment disorder secondary to myocardial infarction 70. Cognitive therapy was helpful when administered to patients with adjustment disorder who experienced work-related stress 71 and among army conscripts with adjustment disorder 72. In a study of terminally cancer patients 73, similar improvements were found in those with adjustment disorder and other psychiatric diagnoses. Some of these psychological interventions have been tested in specific medically ill groups, such as those with cancer, heart disease or HIV. While improvements in coping have been demonstrated, it is unclear if subjects had adjustment disorder, some were open pilot studies (e.g., 74) and survival and quality of life rather than symptoms were the outcome measures in others (e.g., 75). The basic pharmacological management of adjustment disorder consists of symptomatic treatment of insomnia, anxiety and panic attacks. The use of benzodiazepines to relieve these is common 76. While antidepressants are advocated by some 77, especially if there has been no benefit from psychotherapy, there is little solid evidence to support their use. Nevertheless, those with sedative properties targeting sleep and anxiety may have a role when benzodiazepines are contraindicated 78, such as in those with a history of substance dependence. There are few trials specifically directed to the pharmacological treatment of adjustment disorder and these are mainly on subjects with the anxiety subtype 79,80,81,82,83,84,85. A study 79 comparing a benzodiazepine with a non-benzodiazepine found that the anxiolytic effects of each were similar, although more responded to the non-benzodiazepine. Two randomized placebo-controlled trials examined herbal remedies, including extracts from kava-kava 80 and valerian plus other extracts 81, and demonstrated a positive effect on symptoms. A study found that tianeptine, alprazolam and mianserine were equally effective 82, while a pilot study of cancer patients with anxious and depressed mood found trazodone superior to a benzodiazepine 83. One study in primary care 84 examined the response of patients with major depression and with adjustment disorder to antidepressants, using reported changes in functional disability based on case note information. Overall, the adjustment disorder group was twice as likely to respond to antidepressants. However, as this was a retrospective case note study, the relevance of the findings is questionable. One study compared pharmacological and psychological interventions in subjects with adjustment disorder randomly assigned to supportive psychotherapy, an antidepressant, a benzodiazepine or placebo, and found that all improved significantly 85. Overall, these studies lend little support for the superiority of antidepressants, and arguably for any specific treatment, in the management of adjustment disorder, but further studies are clearly required. Adjustment disorders are common mental disorders, especially in consultation-liaison psychiatry. Their prevalence seems to be higher in children and adolescents, in whom they are associated with significant morbidity and a poorer outcome than in adults. Suicidal behaviour is common in both adolescents and adults with these disorders, and adjustment disorder is the diagnosis in up to one third of young people who die by suicide. There are major problems with the diagnostic criteria for adjustment disorder in both ICD-10 and DSM-IV. The most prominent of these is the status as sub-syndromal conditions. This has resulted in their being the subject of little research. Furthermore, current classifications fail to provide guidance on distinguishing these disorders from normal adaptive reactions to stress, and encourage the diagnosis of major depression in people with self-limiting reactions to stressors. Treatments for adjustment disorders are underinvestigated, although brief psychological interventions are likely to be the preferred option.",

      "abstract": "Dystonia is a neurological syndrome with sustained muscle contractions producing an abnormal posture, and is usually secondary to central nervous system dysfunction. Dystonia is often classified by etiology, and may be primary (sporadic or familial) or secondary. Secondary causes of dystonia have accompanying neurological deficits or an identifiable structural or metabolic lesion. Classification of dystonia based on etiology has undergone extensive modifications as new genetic bases for some forms of dystonia and other primary neurological diseases have been identified. (Chapters 3 and 8). Secondary dystonia can be further classified into symptomatic dystonia and the dystonia plus syndromes. Symptomatic dystonia is due to an identifiable brain disease, an obvious brain or peripheral insult, or a hereditary or sporadic degeneration of the brain. The dystonia plus syndromes (1) have accompanying neurological signs and/or clinical and laboratory findings suggestive of neurochemical disorders, without evidence of an underlying neurodegenerative process (Table 1).",

      "title": "Desarrollo y validación de un serious game para sensibilizar a los jóvenes sobre los problemas de salud mental.",
      "abstract": "La acuciante problematica social que supone el estigma relativo a la Salud Mental, y las negativas repercusiones directas e indirectas que se derivan del mismo demandan el desarrollo de intervenciones eficaces que consigan minimizar en la medida de lo posible las devastadoras consecuencias a todos los niveles para quienes lo padecen. De entre todos los trastornos psicologicos, la esquizofrenia es el que presenta una mayor carga estigmatizante, por diversos factores, como las representaciones distorsionadas de la cultura popular cercanas a la imagen tradicional de locura, el sensacionalismo de la prensa que presenta una imagen dramatizada o violenta de las personas que la padecen, o lo llamativo y aparatoso de la sintomatologia, asi como, los efectos secundarios de la medicacion. Todo esto se traduce en diferentes manifestaciones como miedo, rechazo o verguenza, que desembocan en condiciones de desigualdad para estas personas que ademas de hacer frente a la sintomatologia, deben padecer los efectos que se derivan del estigma, de caracter refractario a la intervencion.\n En el caso de la poblacion adolescente o joven, la investigacion sobre el estigma no es muy abundante, esta llena de contradicciones y ademas no esta exenta de carencias metodologicas. En este sentido, es por tanto conveniente ahondar en este tipo de estudios dado que en estas edades comienzan a manifestarse muchos trastornos psicologicos, ademas de ser el periodo de formacion y consolidacion de las creencias, por lo que son particularmente susceptibles a las actividades de sensibilizacion y lucha antiestigma.\n Asimismo, una vez conocidos los multiples beneficios que supone la integracion de las nuevas tecnologias como herramienta de intervencion y mas concretamente el uso de videojuegos en este tipo de poblacion, se desarrollo un “Serious Game”, esto es, un videojuego que ademas de entretener pretende educar sobre algun aspecto tematico, con el objetivo de sensibilizar contra el estigma en Salud Mental. Disenado por un equipo interdisciplinar de psicologos, educadores e informaticos, Stigma-Stop, presenta cuatro personajes con diferentes trastornos psicologicos (trastorno de panico con agorafobia, depresion, trastorno bipolar y esquizofrenia). El jugador debera interactuar con los cuatro para conseguir un objetivo comun, como es disenar un videojuego con las aportaciones de estos personajes. A medida que va progresando el juego, se van conociendo las caracteristicas de los personajes, asi como diferentes estrategias de actuacion, rompiendo de este modo con mitos y creencias erroneas. El objetivo de la tesis es comprobar la validez del mismo en la disminucion del estigma, concretamente en el caso de la esquizofrenia, evaluada esta a traves del Cuestionario de Actitudes de los Estudiantes hacia la Esquizofrenia (CAEE, Schulze et al., 2003).\n En un primer estudio se comprobo la idoneidad de adaptar este cuestionario al castellano aplicandose en poblacion espanola, encontrandose tras examinar los resultados que las propiedades psicometricas eran adecuadas y que se mantenia la estructura original bifactorial (prejuicios y distancia social), aunque con ligeras variaciones en cuanto al contenido de los mismos. Asi, en la version castellana el primer factor haria referencia al miedo o temor hacia las personas con esquizofrenia, mientras que el segundo de los factores se refiere a estereotipos. En estudios posteriores se utilizo esta herramienta para cuantificar el estigma en la linea base y tras una intervencion basada en la aplicacion de Stigma-Stop en estudiantes universitarios de diferentes titulaciones con una clara orientacion social (Magisterio de Educacion Infantil, Trabajo Social, Psicologia, Educacion Especial y Educacion Social). De este modo, se genero un perfil del estigma para estos estudiantes que podria esclarecer los efectos de la formacion academica en la tematica en el estigma.\n Dado que en todos los casos los resultados fueron favorables, se decidio aplicarlo a la poblacion diana para la que se diseno el videojuego, en este caso, 412 alumnos de ensenanzas medias y universitarias, pertenecientes a diferentes centros educativos de la provincia de Almeria, asi como de la Universidad de Almeria. Los resultados se compararon con un grupo control equivalente de 118 participantes. Se decidio que los dos grupos no tuvieran el mismo numero de participantes con la intencion de que se beneficiaran de los supuestos posibles efectos positivos de la intervencion el mayor numero de participantes posible.\n Del mismo modo, en un estudio posterior se comparo la eficacia de Stigma-Stop con otras intervenciones de corte clasico como una charla impartida por un profesional o el contacto con usuarios de los servicios de Salud Mental, asi como, con respecto a un grupo control (en este caso como medida de estigma, se aplico el Attribution Questionnaire 27-Espanol; AQ-27-E; Munoz, Guillen, Perez-Santos y Corrigan, 2015). Stigma-Stop mostro una eficacia similar o incluso superior en algunos de los siete factores que finalmente fueron tenidos en cuenta en comparacion con el resto de intervenciones.\n En definitiva, estariamos en disposicion de concluir que Stigma-Stop es una herramienta util para concienciar y sensibilizar a adolescentes y jovenes en lo relativo al estigma en Salud Mental. Los resultados hallados en todos los estudios apoyarian la bondad de este Serious Game como herramienta de utilidad en la lucha antiestigma, por lo que se concluye apuntando hacia futuras lineas de investigacion entre ellas, la integracion de este tipo de recursos en las intervenciones antiestigma, la adaptacion de Stigma-Stop para permitir su aplicacion en otros paises, asi como, contar con un papel mas activo de los usuarios de los servicios de Salud Mental para el diseno de futuros softwares en esta linea.\n Palabras clave: Serious Game, Estigma, Salud Mental, esquizofrenia.",

      "abstract": "The word “depression” has come to be used in psychiatry to denote both a syndrome (or symptom:sign cluster) and one or more of the symptoms commonly occurring in this cluster. This attribution of two meanings to one term has led to considerable confusion. Thus it is often claimed that depression may be present in almost any mental illness. This statement may be true in the sense that the mood of depression may occur in almost any mental illness; but it cannot be true in the sense that the depressive syndrome may enter into almost any mental illness, since the term depressive syndrome has already, at least by implication, been used to denote a particular symptom:sign cluster which differentiates it from all other symptom:sign clusters. To deny this would be to deny the original principles of division.",

      "abstract": "Madness has traditionally been seen as an illness of the mind, or even, more romantically, sickness of the soul. Contemporary biomedical approach views it as a brain disease caused by chemical imbalance of neurotransmitters. Its symptoms are also associated with mental activity such as perceptions, cognition, emotions and moods. Nevertheless, much of the impact of the so-called mental illness is voiced through the body. First of all, mental distress is often communicated in a myriad of bodily pains. Most common psychosomatic complaints include dizziness, headaches, backaches, skin problems, indigestion and fatigue. Then, many mentally ill have problems accepting and respecting their body functions, especially problematic are sexual needs, menstruation and eating. It is manifested either in fear of sexuality or, its opposite, compulsive promiscuity. A similar black-and- white attitude concerns food, which is either completely denied to the body in anorexia or abused in bulimic binging. The 'sick' attitude to the body parodies the paradoxes innate in Western culture, which splits the human being into binary opposites of flesh and soul. The aim of my chapter is to look at bodily manifestations of mental illness as recorded in women's madness narratives. I analyse the body image presented in them as well as the body-mind dichotomy the authors often experience. The texts I focus on include Sylvia Plath's The Bell Jar, Elizabeth Wurtzel's Prozac Nation, Marya Hornbacher's Wasted and Kate Grenville's Lilian's Story.",

      "title": "COVID-19 related Delusional Beliefs: A Case Report",
      "abstract": "Introduction A delusion is a fixed false belief based on an inaccurate interpretation of an external reality despite evidence to the contrary. The diagnosis of a delusional disorder is made when a person has one or more non-bizarre (situations that are not real but also not impossible) delusional thoughts for one month or more that cannot be explained by any other condition. In patients with delusional disorder, delusions(s) do not impact the functionality and the patient’s behavior is not overtly bizarre. Although delusional core themes tend to be the same throughout different epochs (i.e., persecution, grandiosity, guilt, religion, hypochondria, love, or jealous), clinicians commonly notice how delusions tend to rapidly incorporate popular hot topical issues. Hence, delusions are dynamic and often represent a combination of psychopathology and external events. Objectives The COVID-19 outbreak has affected millions of people globally and it also has a huge psychological impact. The objective of this case report is to outline the possible effect of the COVID-19 pandemic to delusional disorder in patients with healthy person. Methods The 40-year-old gentleman, a drum major (field commander), married, living with his wife and daughter (4,5 years old). He’s current complaints started when he did not want to have the Covid vaccine in April 2021 and therefore was exposed to mobbing at work. It is understood that the patient had irrevocable ideas about vaccine and PCR testing (radioactive lights were coming out from the PCR rod in a video he watched). For this reason, it is understood during the clinical interview that the patient was exposed to social restrictions at work and in his social life (he could not travel by public transport, plane, bus, and enter social facilities because he did not have a vaccination card or did not have a PCR test).He was admitted to our ward for the purpose of arranging his diagnosis and treatment. Results On our ward, the patient showed poor insight with persistence of delusions. The impression was delusinal disorder. He was treated with olanzapine up to 5 mg/day and sertraline up to 100 mg/day, with a progressive resolution of symptoms. Conclusions There are other case reports on COVID-19 delusional themes in patients with schizophrenia and patients with no history of mental illness, which means that this phenomenon is not exclusive to affective disorders. In this case, different from the literature, the patient has never had covid. An area of clinical concern is the potential of the pandemic’s psychological context to trigger psychotic disorders and influence their symptomatology. A review of contemporary epidemics and pandemics psychosis research found no evidence of changes in the form and content of psychotic symptoms. Further research should examine those biopsychosocial COVID-related factors that predispose to, precipitate, and perpetuate psychosis. Disclosure of Interest None Declared",

      "abstract": "Mild head injury is a quiet disorder. It is common, typically bloodless and without call for significant medical intervention. It seems even more quiet because the noise it does make (its symptoms) is often attributed to other causes. Nevertheless the disruption in coping capacity and attendent breakdown in usual behavioral patterns causes more psychosocial and academic‐economic hardship than have begun to be appreciated. Cognitive mental changes such as impairment in attention, memory, and information processing even when mild and apparently transient can produce altered patterns of achievement and self confidence with long lived reverberations. Emotional irritability and lethargy also produce a chain of reactions likely to outlive the primary source of the disruption. Add to this decreased frustration tolerance, increased fatigability, lowered resilence to stress and uncertainty as to the origin of these difficulties and one has recipe for prolonged impairment. Place these ingredients into the person of a child, with all a child's limits on autonomy and verbal self report and the result is a myriad of reported and unreported social, academic and even familial disruptions exacerbated by the common clinical failure of identification of their correct underlying etiology.",

This can also be the case for general medical conditions for both aetiology and differences in structure or process and sometimes lack of useful biomarkers but this occurs to a lesser extent. There are also occasions when medical conditions cause mental health problems directly. For this reason doctors will always be involved in mental health to some degree and will use diagnostic constructs to describe these conditions as they are familiar with diagnosis in their medical practice. There are examples of clear biological abnormalities that are often detected accidentally that do not require treatment. Medically unexplained or functional symptoms/syndromes are commonly seen in general medicine, although the term ‘medically unexplained’ is contentious.

      "abstract": "The article considers the impact of anxiety on the qualitative characteristics of man and the problems of his theoretical research in the field of psychology.Theconcept of anxiety in psychology is the ability of a person to feel different discomforts depending on the experience in different situations. Everyone has a level of anxiety called temporary and normal. If a person wants, he can overcome it. And if anxiety persists for a long time, it will not be able to cope on its own, and this will have a negative impact on human health and disrupt normalcy. Increased levels of anxiety, along with the emergence of various diseases, lead to a significant decline in quality of life. There are psychological and physiological manifestations of anxiety, which are determined by certain methods in science. The most obvious of the psychological symptoms -obscure problems -unjustified tense experiences.In psychology, anxiety is an emotional state with a negative connotation. Anxiety is characterized by the expectation of something negative, such as an adverse outcome or adverse outcome. Anxiety is a person's experience in different situations (joy, sorrow, shame, anger, fear, etc.). Anxiety is associated with a mental state, which is a person's emotional state and various feelings that indicate anxiety. Anxiety is associated with a mental state, which is a person's emotional state and various feelings that indicate anxiety. Forexample: confusion, anxiety, excitement, indifference, impatience, delay, etc. There are other meanings of the mental state of anxiety, which are: depression -a shameful mental state accompanied by anxiety; Propaganda is a phenomenon that takes place notonly in a state of anxiety, but also in a state of anger and rage; grief is a state of mind accompanied by anxiety, worry, grief, mental state is a state of mind, violence is a state of mind, grief accompanied by long-term anxiety, etc., so anxiety is a double state of mind.",

      "abstract": "The brain reciprocally communicates with the rest of the body via neural, endocrine, immune, and other systems. This is crucial for coordinating the complex behavioral and physiological responses needed to cope with the many challenges of life. The Anterior Cingulate Cortex (ACC) is a key brain structure involved in assessing rewards and threats, as well as activating appropriate responses. This is a dynamic process that depends on evolving needs and challenges. Important challenges include illness or injury. These typically involve inflammation and pain, which evoke neuroinflammatory processes in the brain to drive sickness behaviours. In the short term, sickness behaviours are considered adaptive, as they promote convalescence (e.g. low mood; lethargy, fatigue, social withdrawal), and enhanced threat appraisal (e.g. anxiety) to combat increased risk/vulnerability associated with sickness. Chronic inflammation, however, appears to remodel the system to inappropriately activate threat-coping responses, resulting in depressive and/or anxious phenotypes. These mood disorders are particularly pronounced in diseases and disorders associated with gut dysfunction, which feature chronic inflammation and altered ACC function. We propose that chronic inflammation remodels ACC physiology such that it errantly predicts heightened danger based on a mental model (a.k.a &amp;lsquo;schema&amp;rsquo;) of the world. This evokes chronic activation of threat-coping systems, including endocrine signaling (e.g. adrenaline), and anxiety. Inflammation can be driven by brain systems involving ACC, leading to a feedback-cycle that self-reinforces pathological states. This theory accounts for a wealth of clinical and preclinical data that implicate the ACC in disorders of mood and gastrointestinal function, and reveals a key player in the gut-brain axis that may represent a novel therapeutic target.",

      "title": "Factores Asociados a la Carga Mental en Docentes de Instituciones Educativas Ecuatorianas",
      "abstract": "Introducción: Ciertos sectores económicos en pandemia establecieron el decremento de la carga física de los trabajadores, relacionadas con sus tareas de carácter manual; éstas a la vez, fueron reemplazadas por el incremento permanente de actividades vinculadas a funciones cognitivas y psicosociales que se corresponden íntimamente a la carga mental, que se constituye en uno de los factores de mayor influencia para el riesgo laboral y adquiere gran interés, esencialmente por las nuevas formas de organización del trabajo; así como también, los avances tecnológicos e informáticos, que demandan de mayores esfuerzos cognoscitivos e intelectuales. La carga mental genera tensiones en el trabajador, provocadas por distintas variables concernientes a los requerimientos laborales; dada la relación que se produce entre éstas y las capacidades mentales o recursos propios de la persona para afrontarlas, junto con los procesos cognitivos y aspectos afectivos del individuo.Se han descrito efectos en la salud y ciertos componentes de riesgo mental se expresan como síntomas depresivos y estrés, afines con otros elementos específicos de las profesiones como: agotamiento, cansancio físico y fatiga generalizada, lesiones musculares, perturbación del sueño y exposición a situaciones y comportamientos de violencia en el contexto laboral. La Organización Mundial de la Salud (OMS), ha reconocido que el bienestar de los trabajadores, no solo se condiciona por peligros en el lugar de trabajo, sino también por factores sociales e individuales. Las consecuencias que surgen a raíz de los intentos por superar las condiciones precarias que enfrenta el trabajador, llevan a una connotación negativa de las cargas físicas, psíquicas y fisiológicas, que a futuro se manifiestan en cargas mentales excesivas difíciles de manejar lo que genera un decrecimiento en la productividad. En Ecuador, las políticas públicas, no han considerado aún la salud mental como parte de la salud pública; de ahí, la necesidad de iniciar su discusión, análisis y propuesta.Objetivo: El estudio tiene como propósito fundamental determinar los factores asociados a la carga mental de los docentes de diferentes niveles educativos: básico, medio, superior universitario y superior técnico, conforme a la normativa vigente ecuatoriana.Materiales y Métodos: Se aplicó una metodología con enfoque cuantitativo. Fue aplicado el cuestionario CarMen-Q que evalúa cuatro dimensiones de carga mental: dimensión cognitiva, temporales, requisitos de desempeño y aspectos emocionales. Consta de 29 ítems, con un formato de respuesta mediante Escala Likert. El instrumento se aplicó en línea a 111 docentes de Ecuador de niveles educativos: básico, medio, superior universitario y superior técnico. Para analizar los resultados se recurrió a técnicas estadísticas multivariantes como Análisis de Componentes Principales y estadística descriptiva para análisis de los datos socio demográficos.Resultados: Los resultados sugieren que los factores asociados a la carga mental, se relacionan con la gestión de información, la dimensión emocional, carga laboral y la presión por rendimiento, al que deben responder en este caso los docentes de las instituciones educativas investigados.Conclusiones: Los docentes enfrentan dificultades para responder a las demandas de las tareas. Estas, están directamente relacionadas con las dimensiones cognitivas, de rendimiento y temporales, sin dejar de lado, aquellas vinculadas con la subjetividad humana como corresponde a las emociones, sentimientos y vivencias, más aún cuando el ejercicio de la docencia involucra la interacción directa entre seres humanos.",

      "abstract": "Endogeneity and reactivity have long been considered polar opposites of a major dimension of depression. The present factor analytic study examines 35 distinct depressive symptoms in three depressed samples and supports the conceptualization of D. F. Klein (Endomorphic depression. Arch. Gen. Psychiatry, 31: 447–454, 1974) that endogeneity and reactivity can be construed as orthogonal, independent dimensions. Symptoms consistently loading on an endogeneity factor are: 1) lacking in reactivity to environmental changes; 2) showing no interest in life; 3) retarded (slow, feeling tired, etc.); 4) feeling unable to act; 5) considering self lazy; 6) feeling helpless and powerless; and 7) perceiving depression as qualitatively different from ordinary sadness. Symptoms consistently loading on a reactivity factor are: 1) feeling that he or she is bearing troubles; 2) presence of precipitating stress; 3) crediting problems to excessive family and/or job responsibilities; 4) expressing concern for welfare of family and friends; 5) visceral symptoms; 6) feeling at \"end of rope\"; 7) having middle-of-the-night insomnia; and 8) showing self-pity. The results suggest a methodology for identifying depressives who are high-high, low-high, high-low, and low-low on the endogeneity and reactivity factors.",

A chronic illness has a lengthy duration, uncertain outcome, and unpredictable episodes, often with intrusive symptoms and intermittent or progressive disability. Having a chronic illness poses life problems such as following a medical regimen, managing ordinary responsibilities, and experiencing stigma and discrimination. A disease, in contrast, may remain silent for years without eliciting a diagnosis or causing noticeable symptoms and life disruptions. Experiencing chronic illness makes disease real. Sociological definitions of chronic illness start with the experience of disruption and impairment. Social definitions of disability start from the lack of societal accommodation to certain individuals’ needs, thereby disadvantaging them and discriminating against them. Such definitions of disability tend to presuppose that the people involved have static, visible conditions with predictable and sustained needs.",

Chronic pain is unremitting and carries significant physical, emotional, social, and economic burdens for individuals, their families, and society. The development and persistence of chronic pain is best understood in the context of a biopsychosocial framework. Following a historical overview of pain theories, we present the leading theory of chronic pain, which is a biopsychosocial theory incorporating psychological, affective, cognitive, and physiological factors as key contributors to the development and maintenance of chronic pain symptoms. We summarize evidence supporting the important contribution of each of these factors and how they interact to culminate in the chronic pain experience. We present methods for assessing these constructs in pain patients and discuss how the cognitive-behavioral treatment perspective may be utilized either independently or as part of an intensive rehabilitation approach to decrease pain severity and improve physical and emotional functioning.\r\n\r\n\r\nKeywords:\r\n\r\nchronic;\r\npain;\r\npsychology;\r\ncognitive;\r\nbehavioral",

Based on definitions from the DSM-IV, the term \"nomophobia\" refers to a \"phobia for a particular or specific things.\" When someone uses their phone excessively, there are a number of psychological issues at play, such as low self-esteem and an outgoing personality. The weight of this issue is currently growing on a global scale. NOMOPHOBIC symptoms may also be triggered by other mental illnesses, such as panic disorder, social anxiety, or social phobia. It is very difficult to tell if a patient develops NOMOPHOBIC symptoms as a result of an addiction to cell phones or if their anxiety issues are present [1]. Instances of nomophobia include the following signs and symptoms: tachycardia, anxiety, shaking, sweating, agitation, and altered breathing patterns. Nomophobia can also serve as a stand-in for other mental illnesses. As such, we must exercise extreme caution while diagnosing it. Nomophobia can also be triggered by certain mental illnesses, and vice versa. Because nomophobia shares clinical symptoms with other diseases, it can be extremely tough for clinicians to diagnose and treat patients due to its complexity [2].",

Any case of decline can be explained on one of four bases. 1. A tree may decline primarily as the result of chronic irritation by a single agent. 2. A tree may decline because of damage by secondary agents after an injurious event such as defoliation or major wounding. The same agents would not cause decline in an uninjured tree, and the injury alone would not cause decline. 3. Chronic irritation by one or more agents may diminish the tolerance or resistance of a tree to another agent that then incites decline. Various factors including those that predisposed the tree and incited decline may then contribute to further decline. 4.

Body dysmorphic disorder is an increasingly recognized somatoform disorder, clinically distinct from obsessive-compulsive disorder, eating disorders, and depression. Patients with body dysmorphic disorder are preoccupied with an imagined deficit in the appearance of one or more body parts, causing clinically significant stress, impairment, and dysfunction. The preoccupation is not explained by any other psychiatric disorder. Patients present to family physicians for primary care reasons and aesthetic or cosmetic procedures. Cosmetic correction of perceived physical deficits is rarely an effective treatment. Pharmacologic treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and non-pharmacologic treatment with cognitive behavior therapy are effective. Body dysmorphic disorder is not uncommon, but is often misdiagnosed. Recognition and treatment are important because this disorder can lead to disability, depression, and suicide. Psychiatric social work assessment and intervention was provided to the person with Body dysmorphic disorder, focusing on to building for change in misbelieve and strengthening commitment to change. The psycho social intervention was provided to the patients and his family members. Sessions on Admission counseling, Family intervention, Supportive therapy, Psycho education, role play, reminiscence, Pre discharge counseling, Discharge Counseling and Social Group Work was conducted. At the end of the therapy, the client knowledge about the illness and coping skills has improved.",

Estas lesiones desencadenan la liberacion de endorfinas o neurotransmisores como la serotonina que producen sensacion de bienestar. La etiologia esta asociada a multiples factores, entre ellos los desordenes geneticos donde la deficiencia mental es caracteristica, como el trastorno de Lesch Nyhan, el sindrome de Cornelia de Lange, el sindrome de Rett, el sindrome de Rubeola Congenita y el sindrome del Cromosoma X Fragil.

In this chapter Pavlov makes a deep physiological analysis of all the most characteristic symptoms of hysteria, the acute hysterical reactions, as well as the hysterical traits of the personality. He offers a physiological explanation of hysterical nosophilia, the so-called \"escape into disease\" of the hysteriacs not infrequently superficially interpreted as manifestation of simulation.

Unlike most other psychiatric illnesses, these disorders are associated with precipitating events that are a necessary precondition for diagnosis. For an event to be defined as traumatic in this context, it may be directly or indirectly experienced (e.g., witnessed), but it must involve \"actual or threatened death or serious injury,\" and result in a subjective response of \"intense fear, helplessness, or horror\" (DSM-IV, 1994, pp. 427-428).",

      "title": "Behavioral Changes Associated with Epilepsy",
      "abstract": "Epilepsy can be accompanied by changes in cognition, personality, affect, and other elements of behavior. There is no single epileptic constitution or personality complex. A unifying theme to the behavior in epilepsy is diversity. As one looks at the behavioral traits reported in epilepsy, a specific and consistent pattern is lacking. Rather, extremes of behavior are accentuated: sometimes in one direction, often in both directions. Changes in emotional state are prominent among behavioral features in epilepsy. Some authors describe a prominent deepening or increase in emotionality, whereas others identify a global decrease in emotional life and content. Emotional lability is also reported. Sexuality and libido are typically decreased, but fetishism, transvestism, exhibitionism, and hypersexual episodes also occur. Concerns over morality may be lacking or exaggerated. Patients may be irritable and aggressive or timid and apathetic. The impressive list of people with epilepsy in politics, religion, arts, and sciences suggests a positive expression of this behavioral spectrum. Psychosis, depression, paranoia, and personality disorders may represent a negative pole of epilepsy-related behavioral changes. The most important aspect of behavioral changes in epilepsy for physicians is to recognize and treat dysfunctional behavior. Depression is a common problem that is often unrecognized and untreated. Other treatable problems include impotence, anxiety, panic attacks, and psychosis. Identifying risk factors will, it is hoped, assist in developing methods to prevent these disorders.",

      "abstract": "Objective: The definition of “hikikomori” evokes dysfunctional personality pictures already known in the literature and medical practice. The aim is to refute the hypothesis of the need to identify this clinical condition in a new descriptive framework. Materials and methods: Pubmed checklist, clinical interview, and psychometric tests. Results: In the entirety of the selected population, it emerges that the primary disorder is schizoid personality disorder; this is followed by depressive disorder, narcissistic covert disorder, bipolar disorder with depressive prevalence, obsessive disorder, avoidant disorder, and somatic disorder as secondary dysfunctional personality traits. Childhood and/or family trauma, capable of impacting the sexual and affective sphere, is present in almost the entire population. Conclusion: The syndrome should be framed as a specific phenomenon and not as a new psychopathological disorder, as the symptomatological descriptions are similar to the already known schizoid personality disorder; the symptomatological differences among patients should be framed according to a logic of correctives determined by the presence of one or more secondary psychopathological traits that draw a more complex personality picture than the simple nosographic diagnosis of the DSM-V.",

      "abstract": "There are different possible temporal associations between epileptic seizures and headache attacks which have given rise to unclear or controversial terminologies. The classification of the International League Against Epilepsy does not refer to this type of disorder, while the International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD-2) defines three kinds of association: (1) migraine-triggered seizure (\"migralepsy\"), (2) hemicrania epileptica, and (3) post-ictal headache.We performed an extensive review of the literature, not including \"post-ictal\" and \"inter-ictal\" headaches.On the basis of well-documented reports, the following clinical entities may be identified: (A) \"epileptic headache (EH)\" or \"ictal epileptic headache (IEH)\": in this condition headache (with or without migrainous features) is an epileptic manifestation per se, with onset, and cessation if isolated, coinciding with the scalp or deep EEG pattern of an epileptic seizure. EH maybe followed by other epileptic manifestations (motor/sensory/autonomic); this condition should be differentiated from \"pure\" or \"isolated\" EH, in which headache/migraine is the sole epileptic manifestation (requiring differential diagnosis from other headache forms). \"Hemicrania epileptica\" (if confirmed) is a very rare variant of EH, characterized by ipsilateral location of headache and ictal EEG paroxysms. (B) \"Pre-ictal migraine\" and \"pre-ictal headache\": when a headache attack is followed during, or shortly after, by a typical epileptic seizure. The migraine attack may be with or without aura, and its seizure-triggering role (\"migraine-triggered seizure\") is still a subject of debate. A differentiation from occipital epilepsy is mandatory. The term \"migralepsy\" has not been used uniformly, and may therefore led to misinterpretation.On the basis of this review we suggest definitions and a terminology which may become the basis of a forthcoming classification of headaches associated with epileptic seizures.",

      "abstract": "Abstract During maternal separation, some primate and nonprimate species show a biphasic (active/passive) response. The second stage is characterized by reduced activity, a hunched body posture, and other behaviors. Traditionally, the second stage has been referred to as “despair” and is considered an animal model for human depression. Recent research in psychoneuroimmunology suggests an alternative hypothesis—that behaviors occurring during the second passive phase represent stress‐induced “sickness behaviors.” This perspective more readily accounts for findings in widely divergent species, does not require assumptions regarding the ability to express complex emotional states, is empirically testable, and aligns the separation model with recent hypotheses regarding the nature and ontogeny of depressive illness. © 2001 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.

A condition that causes excruciating pain in one person may be completely tolerable to another. Even if the cause is removed, suffering may continue. Pain is entirely subjective, but we know it exists when we see the distressed patient.

      "title": "ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS IN THE INTEGRATED CARE FOR PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC PAIN",
      "abstract": "In the holistic approach in medicine а person is viewed through the bio-psycho-social model. Human health is a trinity of “soma” (body), “psyche” (soul) and social role (position) that are constantly interacting with each other and with the environment. Any action on one of the dimensions inevitably affects the others. Chronic non-communicable diseases are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in developed countries. They cause social, economic and psychological burden for individuals, their families and the whole society. Much of the socially significant diseases (especially cancer and degenerative diseases) are associated with chronic pain. Epidemiological data shows that between 10.1% and 55.2% of people in different countries suffer from chronic pain. Pain has been shown to affect all dimensions of health related to quality of life. Patients with chronic pain also suffer from depression, anxiety and sleep disorders. Limitation of physical activity leads to overweight and all additional health risks related to this condition. Depression, inability to work, impaired social contacts and suicidal thoughts make chronic pain a public health problem. Drug medication along with psychological support and social commitment are important elements of holistic integrated care for patients with chronic pain.The purpose of this article is to analyze the ethical considerations of integrative care for patients with chronic pain.In modern medical ethics autonomy is basic principle. In bioethics autonomy means “the capacity to make an informed, uncoerced decision for your health”. To participate in the decision-making process patients, need sufficient and comprehensive information. The right to information is a basic patient’s right and obligation of the physician. The partnership model is of great importance in the treatment of chronic diseases. The patient is engaged as part of the therapeutic team, actively participates in the healing process and implements self-management of the disease. Numerous studies have proven that patient involvement improves medical outcomes and cost-effectiveness in healthcare. The communication between the doctor and the patient is a cornerstone and a premise for quality medical care.In conclusion, in the age of high-tech medicine, the human factor and patient-centered care have remained intact. Good awareness of patients is of key importance for their participation in the treatment. Easily available, true and relevant information is a prerequisite for understanding the pain control options.",

      "title": "Descriptive Psychopathology",
      "abstract": "Psychopathology is ‘the systematic study of abnormal experience, cog­nition and behaviour; the study of the products of a disordered mind’ (Sims, 2002). Descriptive psychopathology refers to a particular approach to the assessment and understanding of the signs and symptoms of men­tal disorder and forms the basis of clinical psychiatry. The term descriptive in this context refers to a necessarily value- and theory-free interpreta­tion of the mental and behavioural phenomena a patient presents with. For students of medicine and psychiatry, it is essential to understand the significance of this and the rationale behind it. Psychiatry is unique among the medical specialties in that there are few objective clinical signs and no biomarkers (at least in vivo) which indicate the presence or otherwise of specific mental disorders. Contrast this with bodily disorders whose features are physical and objective; they lend themselves to being measurable, quantifiable, and therefore reliable to assess. Features of mental disorders present through behaviour and experience (thoughts, feelings, perceptions); they are internal and essen­tially subjective. This renders psychopathological phenomena elusive to clinical assessment in the way physical disorders are, leaving psychiatry in somewhat of a quandary; how to establish a reliable and valid system of assessing subjective phenomena? Furthermore, there needs to be a safeguard against the undue influence of bias caused by personal value judgements when interpreting subjective phenomenon. A chest X-ray showing a lobe consolidation or a blood test showing anaemia is open to far less interpretation than a person complaining of low mood or hearing voices. A further challenge in addition to that posed by the subjective nature of psychopathological phenomena is that of the absence of established aetiological mechanisms of mental disorders. Whether they are caused by physical changes in the brain or are social phenomena caused by experience (or some combination) remains contentious. Indeed, this debate continues to strike at the very concept of mental disorder. Therefore, clinical assessment of a person presenting with mental disorder must enable accessing and understanding the patient’s inner world; it must be based on a system that is value-free so as to avoid the undue influence of the personal beliefs of the clinician; and it obvi­ously cannot be reliant on thus-far absent aetiology.",

      "title": "Theoretical Perspectives on Mental Health and Illness: Introduction to Part I",
      "abstract": "Mental health and mental disorder represent two different areas of theory, research, and policy implications, reflecting our common tendency to dichotomize healthy and sick, normal and abnormal, sane and insane. David Mechanic (2006) argues that the term “mental health” has no clear or consistent meaning, and in terms of the sociological literature, this is generally true. Mental health is not merely the absence of disease or disorder; it involves self-esteem, mastery, and the ability to maintain meaningful relationships with others. While most of us fall short of optimal well-being (or happiness), those who experience mental health problems or psychological distress have been the focus of most sociological research. However, definitions of mental health problems, illnesses, or disorders are also not so straightforward. Following Horwitz (2002b), “mental diseases” reflect underlying internal dysfunctions that have universal features (i.e. schizophrenia and to a lesser degree bipolar disorder). A valid “mental disorder” reflects some internal psychological system that is unable to function as it should, and this dysfunction is socially inappropriate. For most disorders, symptoms are not specific indicators of discrete, underlying diseases (such as schizophrenia), instead many conditions arise from stressful social conditions (such as depression, anxiety, eating disorders). Cultural processes shape the symptoms associated with mental disorders, and it is important to distinguish mental disorders from normal reactions to social stressors. Horwitz (2002b) uses the terminology of “mental illness” to refer to those conditions which a particular group has defined as a mental illness (and often point to behaviors that are deemed deviant, for example homosexuality in previous psychiatric classifications). For simplicity, we will use the term mental health problem or disorder in this introduction – but students should keep in mind the implications of using the term mental illness. In Chapter 1, Horwitz argues that sociological approaches regard mental health and mental health problems as aspects of social circumstances. He provides a very thorough overview of how various social conditions affect levels of mental health and mental health problems, and in turn how social contexts shape the definition as well as the response to mental health problems. Chapter 1 develops a framework for a sociological understanding of mental disorder and mental health problems and also directs the reader to other chapters in the volume that illustrate Horwitz's arguments.",

Relatively common after unilateral lesions are anosognosia and anosodiaphoria—that is, the denial of, or unconcern about, a sensorimotor hemisyndrome. Less familiar forms of altered limb perception include asomatognosia (lack of awareness of a part of the body), somatoparaphrenia (lack of ownership of a paralysed limb), the experience of supernumerary phantom limbs (reduplication of limbs on the affected side of the body), personification (nicknaming a limb and giving it an identity of its own) and misoplegia. The term misoplegia was coined by Critchley1,2 and refers to the morbid dislike or hatred of paralysed limbs in patients with hemiplegia. Minor manifestations of this condition may be restricted to verbal aggression towards a limb, but commonly misoplegia includes physical acts such as striking and beating the hemiplegic extremity.1–3 Although these verbal or physical acts of self-directed aggression are impressive, detailed case reports are rare. Apart from the anecdotal communications by Critchley1,2 and some passing notes by others, we are aware of only six published accounts.

The third consideration is the one that is least established, but nevertheless the most discussed recently.

Dementia refers to a collection of symptoms stemming from a broad array of etiologies precipitating in functionally impairing cognitive decline. While the presence of cognitive impairment is necessary and sufficient for a diagnosis of dementia, associated neuropsychiatric symptoms -known collectively as behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia, or BPSD - are prevalent and can significantly impact the prognosis and management of dementia. For this reason, DSM 5 requires clinicians to specify whether BPSD is present and to specify the degree of severity; for example, a diagnosis of Alzheimer's dementia might be coded as “major neurocognitive disorder due to Alzheimer's disease, with behavioral disturbances, severe.” BPSD includes emotional, perceptual, and behavioral disturbances that are similar to those seen in psychiatric disorders. It may be clinically useful to classify them into five domains: cognitive/perceptual (delusions, hallucinations), motor (e.g., pacing, wandering, repetitive movements, physical aggression), verbal (e.g., yelling, calling out, repetitive speech, verbal aggression), emotional (e.g., euphoria, depression, apathy, anxiety, irritability), and vegetative (disturbances in sleep and appetite).",

With respect to the distinction between psychological and somatoform manifestations of dissociation current data suggest a hypothesis to which extent mild manifestations of 'pseudoneurological' symptoms in healthy young population may be linked to stress-related psychopathological symptoms or whether these symptoms more likely could be attributed to unexplained somatic factors. With this aim we have assessed the relationship between somatoform dissociation and stress-related psychopathology (i.e. anxiety, depression, symptoms of traumatic stress, alexithymia) in a group of 250 healthy non-psychiatric and non-clinical young adults. Results of this study show that the symptoms of somatoform dissociation are significantly linked to stress-related psychopathology. Findings of this study show that the 'pseudoneurological' symptoms may be linked to stress-related psychopathological processes which indicate that also mild levels of stress may influence somatic feelings and may lead to various somatoform dissociative symptoms.",

      "title": "Somatic Symptom Disorder",
      "abstract": "Psychiatry is often consulted in the general hospital to assess for underlying psychiatric contributions to a patient's physical symptoms. Such questions are typically prompted after a medical or neurological evaluation has not identified the etiology of the physical symptoms, if the symptoms are incompatible with or disproportionate to existing medical or neurological pathology, or if the patient is engaging in maladaptive health-related or interpersonal behaviors in the hospital. Provider countertransference in response to patients presenting with psychiatric disorders that feature somatic symptoms—as well as the maladaptive behaviors that may accompany these symptoms—can lead to provider distress or impact patient care and is a critical area for liaison interventions from the consulting psychiatrist. This chapter demonstrates the approach to the hospitalized patient whose physical symptoms may arise secondary to psychological processes or whose psychological response to medical symptoms gives rise to pathological distress, behaviors, and impairment. It highlights some of the psychological factors that may contribute to the experience of and response to somatic symptoms, as well as some of the challenging interpersonal dynamics that occur in the hospital setting. Clinical cases involving somatic symptom disorder, conversion disorder, and factitious disorder present strategies for making complex diagnoses, therapeutic interventions, and effectively engaging these patients in psychiatric evaluation and treatment.",

      "abstract": "As it is well known, all living humans are subject to daily effects of stress; the stress response varies among individuals depending on the experience that has endowed each person to learn how to deal with stress. Stress relief may be obtained by procedures that lead the subject to “forget” the bad situation or to relax, for instance physical exercise, talking the problem to someone else, drinking alcoholic beverages or using drugs of abuse. Drug addiction develops in persons voluntarily seeking relief from a depressive situation, usually linked to personal catastrophic event, death of a dear family member or a valuable loss of personal belonging, or else also voluntarily aiming to a novel mood enhancing experience, in spite of being conscious of the unwanted effects – dependence – arising from repetitive drug taking, the most serious being addiction, a persistent state in which compulsive drug use escapes control. Addictive drugs besides providing a pleasant rewarding experience also generate reinforcing behaviors of the drug effects leading to tolerance, dependency compulsion, persistence, chronicity with multiple relapses and withdrawal syndrome. The compulsion and persistence are based on pathological molecular mechanisms similar to those involved in memory. Studies done both in humans and rodent models of addiction indicate that key behavior abnormalities associated with addiction are related to changes in the brain, both at molecular and cellular levels. The plastic changes in the dopaminergic VTA NAc pathway and the interconnected structures, also include changes in the gene transcription, RNA and protein processing and in synaptic structure. All the specific changes so far identified are not sufficiently long lasting to account for the behaviors associated with addiction.",

      "title": "Mouse Models of Depression",
      "abstract": "Depression-associated endophenotypes in miceMimicking any human behavioural trait in a mouse is extremely difficult, which makes the undertaking to try and model a multifactorial disease such as depression nearly impossible.How do we recapitulate all aspects of depression in an animal, when the criteria used to classify a major depression are of extreme heterogeneous and sometimes even of opposite nature (e.g., substantial weight gain or loss, insomnia or hypersomnia)?On top of that, animals not only lack consciousness of self, self-reflection and consideration of others but also aspects of the disorder such as depressed mood, low self-esteem or suicidality (Deussing JM, 2006).This does not mean that it is impossible to develop useful animal models, but rather highlights the unlikelihood of generating a model that will mirror the full extent of a given human neuropsychiatric disorder (Nestler and Hyman, 2010).Nonetheless, in depression, as well as other mood disorders, certain endophenotypes can be reproduced independently and evaluated in animals (Table 1).As mentioned above, these include physiological, endocrinological, neuroanatomical and behavioural alterations, many of which can be measured in mice.So far a variety of different mouse models have been established to improve our understanding of the pathophysiology of a wide spectrum of psychiatric diseases.However, a full consensus regarding the prerequisites of a valid animal model is still lacking in the scientific community.Up to now, the three criteria set up by McKinney and Bunney (McKinney and Bunney, 1969) are still widely accepted; they include construct validity, face validity, and predictive validity.Construct (or etiologic) validity, the most complex of the three terms, requires that the symptoms produced in the animal model are based on the same underlying neurobiological mechanisms as in humans.Thus, one tries to recreate mechanisms/processes in the animal which would also initiate the disease in humans (Nestler and Hyman, 2010).The ideal way would be to introduce a known human disease-causing gene variant into a mouse and thereby alter intracellular mechanisms, which in the end lead to the disease (Chadman et al., 2009).Unfortunately this is currently far from being realistic, since most disease-causing genetic alterations have not been established with certainty and the probability that a single gene is solely responsible for the disease is highly unlikely.In addition, an animal model does not have to be based on a genetic change, but can also be subject to an environmental challenge or a combination of both.Face validity is achieved when the animal exhibits specific symptoms of the disease which are similar in the human condition.These can be of biochemical, anatomical, neuropathological or behavioural nature.Thus the concept of face validity can also be regarded as the attempt to reproduce certain endophenotypes which can be accurately measured in the animal.Finally, predictive validity refers to the ability of the animal to correctly respond to pharmacological treatment, which should correlate with results from clinical trials.In this context, it is important to note that the more criteria the proposed model meets, the more compelling it will be (Malkesman et al., 2010).Simply put, researchers are faced with the challenge of 1) constructing a model with similarity in disease progression and symptomatology to humans, 2) detecting these phenotypes with the appropriate behavioural tests and 3) reverting them with treatment modalities that are also effective in humans.www.intechopen.comPsychiatric Disorders -Trends and Developments 188 DSM-IV symptoms Endopenotypes in mice Appropriate test/analysis Depressed or irritable mood Cannot be modeled Decreased interest or loss of pleasure Anhedonia Sucrose preference Intracranial self-stimulation Conditioned place-preferance Female urine sniffing Weight gain or loss Can easily be measured Abnormal loss or gain of weight after stress Insomnia or hypersomnia Abnormal sleep architecture Assessed by electroencephalogram recordings How to referenceIn order to correctly reference this scholarly work, feel free to copy and paste the following:",

      "title": "Functional neuroimaging of schizophrenia: from a genetic predisposition to the emergence of symptoms",
      "abstract": "Schizophrenia is common, chronic and disabling. While psychotic features, i.e. delusions, hallucinations and disordered thinking, are critical to diagnosis, accompanying cognitive deficits are receiving increasing attention. Such deficits, occurring early in the course of the disease, are incapacitating, perhaps more so than the psychotic features (Harvey et al ., 2003), and have prognostic significance (Fujii and Wylie, 2003). They may be seen in apparently unaffected relatives of people with schizophrenia (Faraone et al ., 1995). In this issue of Brain , Whalley et al . (2004) demonstrate changes in brain responses to cognitive demands in a group of people who are at risk of developing schizophrenia (having two or more first‐ or second‐degree relatives with the disease). Furthermore, a distinctive pattern of brain activation characterizes those in whom the disease may be emerging.\n\nAt‐risk subjects and matched controls underwent functional MRI (fMRI) while silently completing sentences that varied from strongly constrained (e.g. ‘He mailed the letter without a ………’) to weakly constrained (e.g. ‘Rushing out, he forgot to take his………’). Four levels of constraint were used to manipulate task difficulty (higher constraint = easier sentence completion). At‐risk subjects showed abnormal responses to increasing task difficulty in frontal, thalamic and cerebellar regions. None of the subjects met diagnostic criteria for a psychotic illness. Moreover, none were on any medication and none sought treatment or even considered themselves unwell. In a subgroup (40%), detailed questioning elicited evidence of psychotic features, and this was associated with an additional change in parietal cortex.\n\nThese observations, made in individuals at an age when the onset …",

      "abstract": "To the Editor,Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) is a complex, multisystem and often debilitating disorder of unknown etiology. (1) It is a complicated disease characterized by at least six months (in pediatrics 3 months) of extreme fatigue that is not alleviated by rest and a group of other symptoms that are constant for a period of time. (1)Post-exertional malaise (PEM) and delayed recovery are core symptoms and the most useful when making a diagnosis. (2) PEM involves a constellation of substantially disabling signs and symptoms that occur in response to physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual over-exertion. (2) The diagnosis of CFS/ME relies on the typical clinical presentation and the exclusion of other causes of fatigue. Up until now there was no test to confirm the diagnosis of CFS/ME. The two-day cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) is becoming a new diagnostic method that can be used in case of suspicion of CFS/ME in attempt to evaluate presence of PEM. (4) This test, used in centres for patients with CFS/ME, has not yet published any data in pediatrics to support its use.We present a case of a 13-year-old patient with chronic debilitating fatigue who meets the criteria for CFS/ME. The patient was examined in detail by a pediatrician (anamnestic unclear cause, resting tachycardia in the physical examination, laboratory tests within normal limits), endocrinologist (normal hormonal profile for a given age, Tanner stage 3), infectologist (serology for typical viruses negative), psychologist (normal cognitive functions). For a history of resting tachycardia, the patient was examined by a cardiologist where no cardiogenic cause of fatigue was demonstrated, sinus tachycardia was present, and the patient was recommended head-up-tilt test, which showed the presence of postural orthostatic tachycardia. Due to the idiopathic nature of the difficulties and the excluded secondary cause, a two-day protocol examination by cardiopulmonary exercise testing was indicated. Written consent was taken and documented. Before the examination, we performed resting spirometry (physiological findings), resting ECG (sinus tachycardia) and a shortened Schellong test with a tachycardic response to orthostasis immediately after standing up and after 3 minutes of standing. Subsequently, standard CPET using treadmill (Itam, Poland) with individualized protocol with progressive increase in workload until exhaustion and breath-by-breath analysis of exhaled gases (Geratherm, Germany) was performed. On the first day, basal values were determined, the patient subjectively tolerated the examination well, the exercise ended prematurely due to subjective fatigue and a feeling of lack of air. On the second day, under the same conditions, the CPET was repeated, during which the patient also terminated the exercise prematurely but a half minute later than on the first day (exercise duration 6:32 min vs. 7:00 min; peak work rate 3,26W/kg vs. 3,68W/kg; peak VO2 34,5 ml/kg/min vs. 36,5 ml/kg/min). Using this methodology, patient did not meet diagnostic criteria for PEM and subsequently CFS/ME (decrease in monitored values on the second day of the examinations). In both days, during exercise, a bizarre pattern of respiration with malposition of the respiratory act to the large airways was observed by observing the flow-volume loop. Analysis of the respiratory pattern identified an erratic respiratory pattern (figure 1A) with low resting ETCO2 (26mmHg) and tachypnoea at maximal workload with dominant ventilation of dead space (figure 1B, 1C, 1G). The consequence of this pattern of respiration is a chronic state of hypocapnia and respiratory alkalosis, which is metabolically compensated in the patient. Fatigue and increased heart rate are expected clinical manifestations. Respiratory rehabilitation was recommended to the patient in order to fixate the correct breathing patterns (diaphragmatic breathing) and psychological guidance. The patient was subsequently retested 3 months after the start of physiotherapy and psychotherapy at the request of the parents. Retesting showed significant improvements in the monitored parameters (figure 1G) as well as in the clinical condition of the patient. The patient’s overall fitness increased, an adequate resting respiratory pattern was present (figure 1D), normal resting ETCO2 (36mmHg), ventilatory efficiency was adjusted (figure 1F, 1G), and the patient reported a subjective increase in energy. Prior to the examination, we performed a Schellong test on the patient, in which there were no signs of postural orthostatic tachycardia.Dysfunctional breathing (DB) is a condition of the airways characterized by an irregular breathing pattern and changes in the airways that cannot be attributed to a specific diagnosis and that causes respiratory and non-respiratory problems. (3) It is not a disease process, but rather changes in respiratory patterns that disrupt normal respiratory processes. However, DB can coexist with diseases such as bronchial asthma or heart disease. The main symptom is shortness of breath or air hunger, associated with non-respiratory symptoms such as dizziness, palpitations, cervical spine pain or fatigue. (5) It also plays a role in chronic fatigue, neck and back pain, fibromyalgia, and some aspects of anxiety and depression. (5)The most common type of DB is hyperventilation syndrome, which is defined as respiration exceeding metabolic requirements, reducing blood carbon dioxide concentrations below normal values. (3) This changes the pH of the blood, increases the alkalinity and thus triggers a number of adaptive changes that cause symptoms. These conditions are non-somatic in nature and their treatment consists of respiratory rehabilitation by various techniques (diaphragmatic breathing, Feldenkrais method, Buteyko method, Pilates) and psychotherapy in order to control impulsive changes in the respiratory pattern in various situations. (5)CPET confirmed the presence of DB in the patient based on the low resting value of ETCO2, the presence of a chaotic pattern of respiration during resting and exercise with the presence of tachypnoea (with very low ventilatory efficiency) in maximal exertion. Diagnosis of DB using CPET is one of the methods of DB diagnostics. Proper respiratory rehabilitation and psychological guidance resulted in the patient fixing the respiratory pattern and subsequently eliminating the primary cause of the examination - chronic fatigue. Patients with CFS/ME are a common pediatric problem. The current possibilities of diagnostics are enriched by the possibility of performing CPET which can be a benefit in differential diagnostics as well as in confirming the diagnosis.",

CFS is defined by primary and secondary criteria, which are however largely subjective. There are no objective signs. It is unknown if this syndrome represents a disease entity of its own. The explanation is either exclusive organic based on immunological and virological findings or exclusive psychogenic as a special form of anxiety psychosis.

      "title": "Reframing chronic pain as a disease, not a symptom: rationale and implications for pain management",
      "abstract": "Chronic pain is a common public health problem that has a detrimental impact on patient health, quality of life (QoL), and function, and poses a substantial socioeconomic burden. Evidence supports the redefinition of chronic pain as a distinct disease entity, not simply a symptom of injury or illness. Chronic pain conditions are characterized by three types of pain pathophysiology (i.e. nociceptive, neuropathic, and centralized pain/central sensitization) influenced by a cluster of coexisting psychosocial factors. Negative risk/vulnerability factors (e.g. mood or sleep disturbances) and positive resilience/protective factors (e.g. social/interpersonal relationships and active coping) interact with pain neurobiology to determine patients' unique pain experience. Viewing chronic pain through a biopsychosocial lens, instead of a purely biomedical one, clinicians need to adopt a practical integrated management approach. Thorough assessment focuses on the whole patient (not just the pain), including comorbidities, cognitive/emotional/behavioral characteristics, social environment, and QoL/functional impairment. As for other complex chronic illnesses, the treatment plan for chronic pain can be developed based on pain subtype and psychosocial profile, incorporating pharmacotherapy and self-management modalities. Preferred pharmacologic treatment of conditions primarily associated with nociception (e.g. osteoarthritis) includes acetaminophen and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, whereas preferred pharmacologic treatment of conditions primarily associated with neuropathy or central sensitization (e.g. fibromyalgia) includes tricyclic compounds, serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, and α2δ ligands. Education, exercise, cognitive behavioral therapy, and many other non-pharmacological approaches, alone or combined with pharmacotherapy, have been shown to be effective for any type of pain, although they remain underutilized due to lack of awareness of their benefits and reimbursement obstacles.",

      "title": "Psychodeontological prerogatives related to the stigma of patients affected by mental disorders",
      "abstract": "The American Psychiatric Association defines mental illnesses as alterations in the cognitive, emotional or behavioral sphere (or a combination of these domains), which lead to suffering and/or problems in the person's social, professional or relational interaction skills. Given the range of possible symptoms, when talking about mental illnesses, reference should always be made to a standardized classification system, i.e. a list of disorders recognized to date, accompanied by their description and lists of symptoms and essential criteria for diagnosis. Currently, the most widely used manual in the world is the DSM (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders), published by the American Psychiatric Association, whose structure follows a multiaxial system. Other international norms or classification systems include the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD), which is often referred to by the WHO in mental health action plans, defining \"mental disorders\" as the range of disorders that falls under the ICD-10 classification. Within the given classifications, we can find disorders of different severities, with significant differences both in terms of the degree of suffering and in terms of the effects on the person's capacity for social interaction. However, the present paper does not aim to analyze clinical problems related to mental illnesses, but to address the state of care of people suffering from such illnesses in our country. In particular, we are motivated by the need to examine, from a bioethical point of view, critical issues arising from various studies of the current state of psychiatric care, critical issues affecting the lives of people with mental illness and their families, and which are strongly denounced to the institutions by the scientific societies.",

      "title": "Dysphoria from a Transnosological Perspective",
      "abstract": "The objective of our psychopathological analyses is to shed light on the position of irritable mood (dysphoria) in psychiatric diagnostics and nosology. In today's most commonly applied classification systems, the ICD-10 and the DSM-IV, dysphoria is mentioned mostly in the context of diagnostic criteria of personality and affective disorders. Other authors have emphasized the importance of dysphoric states in organic psychoses and delusional disorders. Summarizing the various publications on the nosological position, dysphoria is a nosological nonspecific syndrome which may occur in the course of all psychiatric disorders and illnesses. According to the results of our psychopathological analyses, the pathogenesis of dysphoria has to be considered as a multidimensional circular process in which various mental, physical and social factors act as predisposing, triggering and disorder-maintaining factors. Stressors induced by particular experiences and perceptions and by impaired health may lead to a dysphoric state if adequate coping mechanisms are missing. Dysphoria itself usually leads to a deterioration in the mental and physical state of the patient, and shows a clear impact on the patient's social network. The reactions of people close to the patient combined with the impaired mental and physical conditions of the patient cause the circle to restart. As contemporary diagnostic entities do not refer to pathogenesis, classical categorical diagnostics cannot provide the basis for effective pathogenesis-oriented therapy. A change of paradigm in diagnostics from a categorical to a dimensional approach thus becomes necessary. Following a dimensional diagnostic approach based on a dynamic model of vulnerability, a precise differential diagnosis of the complex constellation of conditions and their interactions becomes necessary in order to develop effective treatment strategies. Disorder-maintaining factors determine the treatment of the acute symptomatology, whereas predisposing and triggering factors serve as the basis for the prophylactic treatment.",

      "title": "Juvenile fibromyalgia: A call for diagnostic refinement, a case report",
      "abstract": "<title>Abstract</title> BackgroundFibromyalgia is a clinical syndrome consisting of widespread musculoskeletal tenderness and various somatic complaints including nonrestorative sleep, mood disorders such as anxiety or depression, abdominal pain, and/or headaches. There is a great deal of heterogeneity in its expression which leads to difficulty in identifying predisposing factors. A singular review of patients in an academic pediatric pain clinic reveal immune system dysfunction, mood disorders, infection, postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome, complex regional pain syndrome, and hypermobility are premorbid conditions. It is unclear if these premorbid conditions confer a distinct fibromyalgia clinical phenotype that can provide insight into targeted therapies. Current diagnostic measures for fibromyalgia do not allow for this level of discrimination and are not validated in children.Case Presentation20 children who demonstrated widespread musculoskeletal pain, tenderness to pressure on exam and multiple somatic complaints were diagnosed with fibromyalgia. Average time from start of pain to diagnosis is 2 years. Over half the patients have psychopathology, a third have an immune system dysfunction related to autoimmunity or an infectious exposure, a third with orthostatic intolerance or postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome, a quarter relating to hypermobility, and a quarter of the cohort with dysmenorrhea were pre or comorbid conditions. Effective therapeutic regimens among patients varied widely from responding to medical monotherapy to multimodal treatment. Trigger point injections worsened pain in one fibromyalgia patient but decreased pain in another. Patients with comorbid autoimmunity report appreciating a difference between a flare in their arthritis as opposed to a flare in their fibromyalgia. Such varying responses within the same clinical syndrome suggest distinct phenotypes within fibromyalgia which is difficult to distinguish using our current diagnostic tools.ConclusionThere is a need for clear diagnostic criteria for both the recognition of juvenile fibromyalgia and tools to distinguish phenotypes within fibromyalgia. Currently, the recognition of clinical symptoms renders it an often-overlooked neuropathic pain condition. This case series suggest there are different phenotypes within fibromyalgia. Some patients respond remarkably to serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors alone whereas others require multidisciplinary therapy. A diagnostic tool refined to capture these nuances can facilitate targeted treatment recommendations.",

      "abstract": "The \"delusional misidentification syndromes\" are a group of uncommon and varied disorders in which, in typical form, the patient thinks that a particular familiar person is someone else or a certain familiar place is a duplicate. Although first identified and considered a memory disorder by Pick, evidence in support of this has been difficult to identify. They have been most often seen in various psychotic and organic brain diseases but lesions have been generally diffuse although the right temporal lobe has been implicated. A patient was investigated who abruptly developed a disorder wherein she misidentified her husband as her deceased sister and claimed that her home was a duplicate of her real home that were typical of Frégoli syndrome and Pick9s reduplicative paramnesia, respectively. A discrete area of brain damage, probably ischaemic, in this patient was seen on MRI in the anterior part of the right fusiform gyrus and a smaller area in the nearby anterior middle and inferior temporal gyri with associated parahippocampal and hippocampal atrophy. A high order nervous system function that is devoted to the identification of faces is located in the adjacent midportion of the fusiform gyrus and a similar locus for environmental scenes, termed the parahippocampal place area, is present in the bordering parahippocampal gyrus. The misidentification phenomena in this case can be explained by disruption of the connections of these highly specialised areas with the most anterior inferior and medial part of the right temporal lobe where long term memory and mechanisms for the retrieval of information that are required for the visual recognition of faces and scenes are stored.",

      "abstract": "A great many, perhaps the majority, of those who see a doctor present subjective suffering and behaviour disorders that are problematic to classify as illness. This is because no pathobiological foundation for such classification is demonstrated--no matter how thoroughly the patients are examined, or how long they are followed up. Symptomatologically too, organic and non-organic conditions are distinctive. While organic illnesses are characterized by physical and biochemical signs, non-organic disorders manifest only distressing experiences (as pains or anxiety) or undesirable behaviour (as abuse of alcohol)--phenomena that are inseparable from normal sensation, emotion, intentions and actions. As for treatment, the main methods applied in organic illnesses are of a physical and biochemical nature. In cases of subjective suffering or behavioural deviances therapy consists of general relief, correction and sedation--all of the kind we make use of in our everyday lives. If the majority of those who consult a doctor are not really ill, what then, is the alternative? Individual and collective misery? The sole alternative to illness is normal psycho-physiological and behavioural variations. A widely held opinion, however, is that non-organic disorders fulfill the criteria for illness. This means that some kind of pathological substrate is postulated even when we fail to demonstrate its existence. The crucial point, however, is not to solve the problem of whether a person is ill or not, but to underline that we are dealing with two separate categories of phenomena - bio-pathologically and psycho-physiologically founded suffering and dysfunctioning.",

      "title": "A Review of the Etiology Delirium",
      "abstract": "Delirium, also called as organic brain syndrome, acute brain syndrome, acute brain failure, acute confusional episode and reversible or masked dementia, as a concept, stretches back to the age of Hypocrates (Burns et al., 2004).Delirium is described as a condition characterized by a disturbance of consciousness with reduced ability to focus, sustain, or shift attention according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Classification of M e n t a l D i s o r d e r s , F o u r t h E d i t i o n , T e x t R e v i s i o n ( D S M -I V -T R ) c r i t e r i a ( A m e r i c a n Psychiatric Association, 2000).Also, delirium involves a change in cognition (such as memory deficit, disorientation, language disturbance) or the development of a perceptual disturbance that is not better accounted for by a preexisting, established, or evolving dementia (American Psychiatric Association, 2000).In addition to these, impairment in the brain's ability to integrate perceptions correctly, coupled with memory deficits and confusion may result in psychotic symptoms in delirium.Hallucinations (especially visual and tactile), delusions, paranoia, illusions, and bizarre behavior are the commonly encountered psychotic symptoms in delirium (Leigh, 2008).Delirium is associated with longer hospital stay, poorer functional outcome, and cognitive decline in addition to an elevated morbidity and mortality.Despite these adverse outcomes, delirium recognition rates are low (12-43%) and its management remains inadequate in up to 80% of patients (Morrison et al., 2003).These findings suggest lack of preventive and screening activities, missed diagnoses, and inappropriate management of diagnosed delirium (Michaud et al., 2007). Epidemiology PrevalenceThe prevalence of delirium varies with the population that is being studied (Fong et al., 2009).Delirium is a relatively common disorder, especially in older people with physical illness (Saxena & Lawley, 2009).Community rates of delirium are reported to vary from 0.4% to 2% (Saxena & Lawley, 2009, Fong et al., 2009).In general hospital setting prevalence of delirium has been reported to range from 11% to 33% on admission (Lindesay et al.,",

      "abstract": "Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (AD/HD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder present from childhood and often following individuals into adulthood. It is the most frequent reason for referring children to mental health services. Core symptoms of AD/HD (inattention, impulsivity, hyperactivity) present behaviors that parents may rate in standardized questionnaires (e.g., does not study, memory problems, cannot concentrate, cannot stay still, has no motives, etc.), are also present in other developmental or psychiatric disorders (e.g., specific learning difficulties, sensory modulation disorder, mood or anxiety disorders, autistic spectrum disorders). This may cause errors in the differential diagnosis if clinicians do not add objective measures of cognitive deficits associated with each disorder. AD/HD presents neuropsychological deficits (compared to non-clinical populations) that are also present in other disorders, like deficient working memory, whereas other neuropsychological deficits are unique characteristics of AD/HD, such as sustained attention, response inhibition, and variability of response time. Likewise, anxiety disorders present neuropsychological deficits in autobiographical memory, mood disorders present neuropsychological deficits in processing speed and verbal memory. Neuropsychological tests such as the Continuous Performance Test, tests of reading phonetic decoding, and others, may improve the accuracy of differential diagnosis, differentiating AD/HD from other disorders, or revealing the comorbidity of AD/HD with other disorders.",

Somatic comorbidity in depressed persons may be explained by mediating mechanisms such as unhealthy lifestyle and unfavorable pathophysiological disturbances. There are alternative explanations for somatic comorbidity in depressed persons: genetic pleiotropy, iatrogenic effects, and the phenomenon 'somatic depression'. In the latter, the symptoms of depression are a consequence of clinical or subclinical somatic conditions. When treating a depressed patient, their somatic health should also be monitored. Further research is needed to examine whether specific interventions may prevent somatic comorbidity in depression.",

This condition can arise due to various factors, including neurological disorders, systemic illnesses, medications, or substance abuse. Secondary mania often presents diagnostic and therapeutic challenges as a comprehensive evaluation is required to identify the underlying cause. Understanding the pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, and treatment strategies for secondary mania is crucial for effective management. This chapter explores the etiology, diagnostic criteria, differential diagnosis, and evidence-based treatment approaches for secondary mania, highlighting the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration in managing this complex disorder.",

A toxic effect is an adverse effect that arises through an exaggeration of the same pharmacological effect that is responsible for the therapeutic effect of the drug, for example hypokalaemia due to diuretic therapy, and is therefore dose related. A side effect is an adverse effect that arises through some pharmacological action other than that which produces the therapeutic effect; such effects may be dose related (for example anticholinergic effects of tricyclic antidepressants) or not dose related (for example a rash associated with an antibiotic). Because dose-related side effects can also be regarded as toxic effects, it is better to avoid the terms ‘toxic effects’ and ‘side effects’ and to use instead the term ‘adverse effects’, which covers all types of unwanted effects.",

      "title": "DIAGNOSIS OF FIBROMYALGIA IN HEALTH PRACTICE",
      "abstract": "Fibromyalgia is a chronic non inﬂammatory, non-autoimmune central aﬀerent processing disorder leading to a diﬀuse pain syndrome. It aﬀects individuals of diﬀerent age groups, sex and sociocultural background. It is estimated to aﬀect 2-5% of western population. The symptoms include widespread pain, fatigue, stiﬀness and sleep disturbance, cognitive problems and mood disorders (anxiety, depression or both) 1. The etiology of Fibromyalgia (FM) is unknown; however several factors may contribute to development as well as severity of symptoms of FM. Genetic polymorphisms have been reported in serotonin transporter and receptors, as well as in dopamine, beta2 adrenergic and glutamate receptor genes. 2 Middle aged women and young are more aﬀected. Sleep abnormalities, autonomic dysregulation, and psychological variables like perfectionist personality, negative beliefs, low self-esteem, depression and anxiety are the contributory factors.3 Physical examination and pathological investigations reveal no evidence of articular, osseous or soft tissue inﬂammation or degeneration. Patients may have tender points both above and below the waist. The previously followed criteria, depending on presence of tender points, are no more followed. In 2010, a new diagnostic criterion was adopted by American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 4. It has three points: - 1. Widespread pain index (WPI)&gt;7 &amp; a symptom severity (SS) score &gt;5 or widespread pain index 3-6 &amp; (SS) score &gt;9. 2. Symptoms present for at least 3.No other disorder to explain In diﬀerential diagnosis, many diseases need to be ruled out making the diagnosis of FM. These are systemic lupus erythematosis, systemic sclerosis, polymyositis, ankylosing spondylitis, osteomalacia, rheumatoid arthritis, polymyalgia rheumatic hypothyroidism, chronic hepatitis, HIV, hemo- chromatosis, celiac disease, myasthenia gravis, hyperthyroidism, myopathies, Sjogren`s, adrenal insufficiency, lymphoma and chronic fatigue syndrome.5 Although the exact pathophysiology of FM is unknown, most of the researchers believe that the pathophysiology of FM is due to the central sensitization within the CNS, manifesting as amplified pain perception. The specific abnormalities that have been observed in the aﬀerent pain procession areas of the CNS in FM patients, who exhibit the following symptoms: increased excitability of dorsal horn nuclei due to abnormal windup; increased levels of substance P, nerve growth factor, glutamate and aspartate measured in CSF of patients with FM 6expanded receptive fields for central pain perception (central sensitization); MRI shows expanded fields in the insula, anterior cingulate cortex and somatosensory area.7 The abnormalities within the descending analgesia system are also observed i.e decreased levels of pain inhibitory neurotransmitters including nor epinephrine, serotonin, dopamine and suppression of normal activity of dopamine releasing neurons in limbic system.1 The management of FM is very challenging. It has many components i.e patient education, physical exercises, analgesia, treatment of associated condition like anxiety, depression, and mood disorders. Counseling about the disease and CBT are also helpful. Medication approved for the treatment of FM are: Serotonin-noreprenphine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs); Duloxetine ,venlaxafine, Milnacipran. Anticonvulsants; Pregabalin. Tri cyclic antidepressants: Amitriptyline, imipramine. Analgesia; Tramadol. Paracetamol and NSAIDS are not aﬀective for analgesia.8,9 The diagnosis of FM is quiet challenging in the developed world with good evaluation and referral system. In underdeveloped country with poor medical education and no referral system FM patients are the mostly go un-diagnosed and hence are under treated. It is high time to highlight the importance of diagnosis of FM by the general practitioner and other specialties doctors for proper management of these patients. The disease impact of FM is not less than any other chronic inﬂammatory disease like Rheumatoid Arthritis. On an average the FM patients visit doctor 3-4 times more often than the general population (17 versus 4 visits/year). The frequent visits of patients with FM, is one of the factors of increasing burden on health system as well as having socio-economic impact on patients.",

The usual environmental and psychological factors that influence maturation are modified by the attitudes of other persons toward the disabled one and by his own attitudes toward his defects and the limitations which they impose upon him. During the first few formative years, the normal child develops increasing physical independence as his motility and equilibrium patterns mature, enabling him to erect himself against gravity and to locomote independently. This growing capability is paralleled by the ego development and the appreciation of body image concept. The development of speech is a major step in communication and greatly facilitates the child's contact with his environment. The alteration of these patterns of maturation by central or peripheral neuromuscular disorders may influence profoundly the individual's personality. This results from the anxiety",

      "title": "Hallucinogen-Related Disorders",
      "abstract": "The hallucinogens are a class of psychoactive drugs, either synthetic or plant products, that produce auditory and/or visual hallucinations as well as thought, mood, and perceptual changes. Depending on dosage, expectation (set), and environment (setting), they also can induce euphoria and a state similar to a transcendental experience. These hallucinations can be present as part of a delirium (e.g., from jimsonweed [ Datura stramonium ]) when accompanied by disturbances in judgment, orientation, intellect, memory, and emotion. Delirium also can result from drug withdrawal (e.g., associated with sedative-hypnotic and/or alcohol withdrawal). When used in the context of substance abuse, the term hallucinogen generally refers to a compound that alters consciousness without producing delirium, sedation, excessive stimulation, or impairment of intellect or memory. Hallucinogens that are abused include the prototype hallucinogen d -lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD); other indolealkylamines such as psilocybin (\"magic mushrooms\") and dimethyltryptamine (DMT, also contained in the South American beverage ayahuasca); and the phenalkylamines, including mescaline and dimethoxymethylamphetamine (DOM, also called STP). LSD, DMT, DOM, psilocybin, and mescaline are sometimes characterized as serotonergic hallucinogens on account of their predominant effect on that receptor system. Other plant products with hallucinogenic activity that are abused include the seeds of the morning glory ( Ipomoea ), which contain lysergic acid derivatives, and seeds of the Hawaiian baby woodrose ( Argyreia nervosa ), which contain lysergic acid amide. Cannabinoid agonists; ≡ agonists; antimuscarinic agents; dissociative anesthetics such as phencyclidine (PCP); and designer drugs such as methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA or ecstasy), which are sometimes classified as hallucinogens, are covered elsewhere in this volume.",

Traumatic events include physical or sexual abuse or maltreatment, road traffic injuries, violence, war-related trauma, severe burns, and natural disasters, among others.(1) These events are considered trauma-tic because they overwhelm a child or adolescent's perceived ability to cope. During the traumatic event, there is recruitment of adaptive, stressmediating neural systems (e.g., hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and sympathetic nervous system) that, in turn, produces adaptive physiological, behavioral, emotional, and cognitive responses necessary for survival.(2) By definition and according to the DSM-IV-TR, traumatic events should evoke acute subjective reactions of intense fear, horror, or helplessness.(1, 3)However, the DSM-IV-TR includes a qualifier for children and adolescents who may instead show responses of disorganized or agitated behavior.(3) The DSM-IV-TR requirement of a subjective response acknowledges that individual traumatic reactions play a crucial role in determining the development of PTSD.",

      "title": "Clinical Holistic Medicine: Chronic Pain in the Locomotor System",
      "abstract": "Most pains from the locomotor system arise due to involuntary, chronic tensions in the muscles or other tissues. When the patient is motivated, the pain is easily cured in most of the cases by using the tools of consciousness-based medicine, primarily therapeutic touch, conversation, and coaching the patient in a positive philosophy of life. The pains are often caused by “blockages” that may cause problems other than just pain. Often it turns out that the blocked areas develop actual physical damage over time: a slipped disk in the back, articular degeneration, or osteoarthritis when the cartilage is affected, can often be explained in this way. Apparently, the exact areas where the blockage is situated cause cellular problems, disrupting cellular order. The holistic process theory of healing and the related quality of life theories state that return to the natural state of being is possible, whenever the person gets the resources needed for existential healing. The resources needed are “holding” in the dimensions of awareness, respect, care, acknowledgment, and acceptance with support and processing in the dimensions of feeling, understanding, and letting go of negative attitudes and beliefs. The preconditions for holistic healing are trust and the intention for the healing to take place. Case stories of holistic treatment of patients with chronic back pain, low back pain, muscle problems, knee pain, and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis are discussed with exercises relevant for patients with these conditions in the holistic clinic.",

Postpartum psychosis is much less common than postpartum depression, commonly assumed to affect about 0.1–0.2% of women in the general population. The strongest risk factor for depression during pregnancy is a history of major depressive disorder. Women with a history of anxiety disorder, postpartum depression, or other previous psychiatric disorders are also at an increased risk for postpartum depression. Untreated maternal depression during pregnancy has been associated with poorer maternal physical and psychological health and with a worse quality of life. Bipolar disorder is a psychiatric illness characterized by episodes of depression alternating with sustained episodes of elevated mood and/or irritability, which are classified as either \"mania\" or \"hypomania.\" Hypomania is an attenuated form of mania with no associated functional impairment.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Currently, psychodermatological disorders are classified under different criteria exhibiting several limitations, and no single universal classification system exists. Herein, we discuss previous suggested classifications in psychodermatology, highlighting their limitations, and we propose a new classification system, without redundant information and with accurate terminology, incorporating the relevance of the terms “disorder,” “disease,” and “illness” in psychodermatology. In this new classification, the following three groups are then suggested: “primary psychodermatological disease,” to include primary dermatoses, where psychological stress, a psychological mechanism, and/or psychopathology are some of the main elements that are recognized in the etiopathogenesis (which may induce and/or worsen a primary dermatosis); “primary psychodermatological illness,” to include skin symptoms, with or without secondary self‐induced skin lesions (such as excoriations), without a primary dermatosis, and where psychopathology, psychological characteristics, and/or a neuropathic mechanism, where stress plays a relevant role, are key features responsible for the skin symptoms and the secondary skin lesions; and “secondary psychodermatological disorder,” to include medications prescribed in dermatology with psychiatric consequences and medications prescribed in psychiatry with dermatologic consequences. Our goal with this system is to broaden the recognition of psychodermatology and improve patient management, with practical and scientific relevance for dermatologists, psychiatrists, and psychologists working in psychodermatology, but also for general practitioners, physicians from other medical and surgical specialties as well as specialists in esthetic dermatology, who frequently encounter patients with psychodermatological disorders.",

Normal development involves the early establishment of a secure attached relationship. From this solid base, the child can develop a sense of self whilst psychologically separating and individuating. Problems developing a secure attachment, or with separation and individuation, can lead to insecure ambivalent attachments and problems with development of identity and sense of self. If these problems progress into adulthood, there will be a poor sense of self, poorly formed identity and associated problems with self-esteem. Relationships may be associated with avoidance, intense ambivalence, or with loss of identity and individuality.",

A growing body of evidence suggests this is a biologically distinct subtype of depression. This assertion is supported by genetic epidemiologic studies and by a preferential response of the subtype to monoamine oxidase inhibitors compared with tricyclic antidepressants. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) includes atypical features as a parenthetical modifier for depressive illness. According to DSM-IV diagnostic criteria (\"atypical features\" specifier), the disorder is primarily characterized by 2 or more of the following symptoms as predominant features in patients with major depression or dysthymic disorder: overeating, oversleeping, \"leaden paralysis,\" and interpersonal rejection sensitivity. Patients also show mood reactivity in response to actual or potential positive events. Despite aspects of the disorder resembling a maladaptive, persistent mode of behavior, patients diagnosed with depression with atypical features demonstrate a good response to antidepressant treatment.",

Solitary confinement and prolonged sleep deprivation are just two examples of these psychological torture methods. Even psychological methods which do not amount to ill-treatment when considered in isolation, amount to inhuman or degrading treatment or torture, when applied in conjunction with other techniques, cumulatively and/or over a long time. Often they are part and parcel of the whole torture process and constitute a “background environment” of harassment and duress. The “cumulation over time” factor must thus be considered as part of a system of psychological torture.",

The medical profession becomes itself maltreating by scheduling more and more invasive additional examinations and the mortality would be 5%. The disease by proxy questions the clinicians in front of its unusual form and its absence of anatomo-clinical parallelism: the symptoms most frequently presented are sleep apneas and convulsions. If all somatic symptoms were described, forms of artificial disorder by proxy with psychiatric expression are underestimated. After a review of the literature on the syndrome of Münchhausen by proxy on one hand and its psychiatric expression on the other hand, we shall explain a clinical case illustrating this atypical presentation. The diagnostic of factitious disorder by proxy and its psychiatric expression is very complex. The child can present an authentic psychiatric disorder establishing a differential or tangled diagnosis. This victim can develop psychological aftereffects of this child abuse like behavioural problems. The child can even secondly participate to the presentation of the symptoms in a morbid alliance with the simulated parent. We shall return on diagnostic and therapeutic measures of care to offer to the maltreated child but also to the parent too, whose psychopathological determiners will be useful to clarify.",

      "title": "Non‐ulcer dyspepsia: myths and realities",
      "abstract": "SUMMARY Dyspepsia can be defined as the presence of upper abdominal pain or discomfort; other symptoms referable to the proximal gastrointestinal tract, such as nausea, early satiety, and bloating, may also be present. Symptoms may or may not be meal related. To be termed chronic, dyspepsia should have been present for three months or longer. Over half the patients who present with chronic dyspepsia have no evidence of peptic ulceration, other focal lesions, or systemic disease and are diagnosed as having non‐ulcer (or functional) dyspepsia. Non‐ulcer dyspepsia is a heterogeneous syndrome. It has been proposed that this entity can be subdivided into a number of symptomatic clusters or groupings that suggest possible underlying pathogenetic mechanisms. These groupings include ulcer‐like dyspepsia (typical symptoms of peptic ulcer are present), dysmotility (stasis)‐like dyspepsia (symptoms include nausea, early satiety, bloating, and belching that suggest gastric stasis or small intestinal dysmotility), and reflux‐like dyspepsia (heartburn or acid regurgitation accompanies upper abdominal pain or discomfort). The aetiology of non‐ulcer dyspepsia is not established, although it is likely a multifactorial disorder. Motility abnormalities may be important in a subset of dyspepsia patients but probably do not explain the symptoms in the majority. Epidemiological studies have not convincingly demonstrated an association between Helicobacter pylori and non‐ulcer dyspepsia. Other potential aetiological mechanisms, such as increased gastric acid secretion, psychological factors, life‐event stress, and dietary factors, have not been established as causes of non‐ulcer dyspepsia. Management of non‐ulcer dyspepsia is difficult because its pathogenesis is poorly understood and is confounded because of a high placebo response rate. Until more data are available, it seems reasonable that treatment regimens target the clinical groupings described above. Antacids are no more effective than placebo in non‐ulcer dyspepsia, although a subgroup of non‐ulcer dyspepsia patients with reflux‐like or ulcer‐like symptoms may respond to H 2 ‐receptor antagonists. However, there is no significant benefit of these agents over placebo in many cases. Bismuth has been shown to be superior to placebo in patients with H. pylori in a number of studies, but these trials had several shortcomings and others have reported conflicting findings. Sucralfate was demonstrated in one study to be superior to placebo, but this finding was not confirmed by another group of investigators. Prokinetic drugs appear to be efficacious, and may be most useful in patients with dysmotility‐like and reflux‐like dyspepsia.",

In addition to this, there are groups of psychiatric disorders that are heavily related to and influenced by cultural factors, and therefore addressed as culture-related specific psychiatric syndromes. Even though the encounter of culture-related specific psychiatric disorder in our daily psychiatric practice is relatively rare, the purpose of examining such specific syndromes has its significant purpose and implications. Through such unique examples, it helps us to appreciate the cultural attribution to the stress formation, reaction pattern, symptom manifestation, occurrence of frequency of disorders, and reaction to the disorders. It also concerns how to work on therapy for the disorder by complying patient’s cultural background.",

Un alto porcentaje de casos se asocia a un trastorno orgánico cerebral de base, especialmente demencias neurodegenerativas, pero también puede ocurrir en enfermedades psiquiátricas primarias, tales como esquizofrenia y trastornos esquizoafectivos o afectivos. La exploración neurobiológica plantea diferentes hipótesis explicativas del síndrome, entre ellas los modelos de desconexión visuoanatómico de Ellis y Young, de lateralización de Gainotti y de distribución de redes neuronales de Gobbini y Haxby. El falso reconocimiento puede dar lugar a conductas violentas del paciente contra las personas implicadas como supuestos “dobles”, especialmente en casos de pacientes varones, con enfermedad psiquiátrica de fondo (i.e., esquizofrenia paranoide), con antecedentes de consumo de sustancias psicoactivas o presencia concomitante de alucinaciones auditivas imperativas.

      "abstract": "This chapter presents a practical description of the psychological effects of chronic pain, a description that is intended to be technically useful, for clinical applications, treatment development, and research. Naturally, chronic pain can present occasions when patients feel misunderstood or mistreated, feel threatened by poor health, experience interference with normal daily functioning, take medications that can produce side effects, and experience depression and anxiety. When chronic pain leads to painful emotions, memories, and other unwanted experiences, the pain sufferer will naturally attempt to avoid these as well. On the level of human experience, chronic pain brings loss, threats, uncertainty, restraint, apparent mistreatment, and failure into the lives of those who suffer with it. Chronic pain is possibly not best understood as a symptom or condition of the body that results in effects on the person and their functioning. The behavior of the individual pain sufferer, interacting with and in a broader psychological context, is an indivisible whole.",

      "title": "The subjective experience of negative symptoms: Characteristics of emotional withdrawal",
      "abstract": "According to the diagnosis of schizophrenia in the DSM-IV-TR (American Psychiatric Association, 2000), negative symptoms are those personal characteristics that are thought to be reduced from normal functioning, while positive symptoms are aspects of functioning that exist as an excess or distortion of normal functioning. Negative symptoms are generally considered to be a core feature of people diagnosed with schizophrenia. However, negative symptoms are not always present in those diagnosed, and a diagnosis can be made with only negative or only positive symptoms, or with a combination of both. Negative symptoms include an observed loss of emotional expression (affective flattening), loss of motivation or self directedness (avolition), loss of speech (alogia), and also a loss of interests and pleasures (anhedonia). Positive symptoms include the perception of things that others do not perceive (hallucinations), and extraordinary explanations for ordinary events (delusions) (American Psychiatric Association, 2000). Both negative and positive symptoms are derived from watching the patient and thus do not consider the patient’s subjective experience. However, aspects of negative symptoms, such as observed affective flattening are highly contended. Within conventional psychiatry, the absence of emotional expression is assumed to coincide with an absence of emotional experience. Contrasting research findings suggests that patients who were observed to score low on displayed emotional expression, scored high on self ratings of emotional experience. Patients were also observed to be significantly lower on emotional expression when compared with others (Aghevli, Blanchard, & Horan, 2003; Selton, van der Bosch, & Sijben, 1998). It appears that there is little correlation between emotional experience and emotional expression in patients, and that observer ratings cannot help us to understand the subjective experience of the negative symptoms. This chapter will focus on research into the subjective experiences of negative symptoms. A framework for these experiences will be used from the qualitative research findings of the primary author (Le Lievre, 2010). In this study, the primary author found that subjective experiences of the negative symptoms belonged to one of the two phases of the illness experience; “transitioning into emotional shutdown” or “recovering from emotional shutdown”. This chapter will use the six themes from the phase of “transitioning into emotional shutdown”. This phase described the experience of turning the focus of attention away from the world and onto the self and the past, thus losing contact with the world and others (emotional shutdown). Transitioning into emotional shutdown involved; “not being acknowledged”, “relational confusion”, “not being expressive”, “reliving the past”, “detachment”, and “no sense of direction” (Le Lievre, 2010). Detail will be added to this framework of experience from other qualitative research in this area. We will now review the six themes that constitute a “transition into emotional shutdown” and corresponding previous research findings.",

Are anxiety and depression entirely separate disorders which may co-exist in the same patient? Does anxiety give rise to the depression? Does depression give rise to the anxiety? Are anxiety and depression manifestations of a single underlying disorders, dysphoria? Therapeutic responsivity to specific drugs suggest: relief of anxiety may reveal an underlying depression; anxiety syndromes which fail to respond to anxiolytics may respond to antidepressants; short-term relief of depression may occur at times with anxiolytics. Proposed mechanisms of action of depression and anxiety also involve overlap of the elements and systems involved. The basic sensations of pain, anticipation, depression and euphoria alone or in combination are sufficient to account for the dysphoric feelings and emotions when these sensations are associated with specific mental content. These may be related in turn to biogenic amines, beta-endorphins, diazepam receptors and possibly cocaine receptors.",

Withdrawal symptoms can act as a protection against oneself and the child, entailing disorders of the mother-child relationship. Three clinical situations are exposed, exemplary of these problems. Impulsion phobia can be contained within representation and psychic defense, especially in the neurotic organizations. But patients presenting narcissistic troubles present risks of acting out toward the child or themselves. The therapeutic work allows solving traumas and identical failures.",

Haar feature-based cascade is used to extract the features from the detected faces from FER+ dataset. VGG model classifies if the user is normal or abnormal. Then in the case of abnormal, the model predicts if he has depression, anxiety, or other disorder according to the detected facial expression. The required assistance and support can be provided in a timely manner with this prediction. The system has achieved a 95% of overall prediction accuracy.",

      "title": "RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SLEEP QUALITY, BODY PERCEPTION AND MOTOR AND SENSORY SYMPTOMS IN PEOPLE WITH RELAPSING-REMITTING MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS",
      "abstract": "Relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) is an autoimmune neurological disease, where the immune system attacks the myelin sheath of the central nervous system, causing inflammation that impairs the transmission of nerve impulses. It is characterized by episodes of flare-ups with exacerbation of symptoms, such as fatigue, weakness in the lower and upper limbs, tremors and balance, difficulty walking, loss of vision, among others, followed by remissions with partial or complete recovery, which can last for months or years, during which the progression of the disease is minimal or absent. Insomnia or poor sleep quality can occur indirectly as a consequence of RRMS. That is, a secondary symptom that is caused by the presence of the specific symptoms of the disease and pseudo-outbreaks. Body Perception (PC) can be defined in two ways, such as Body Image (CI) and Body Schema (CE). HF is related to the psychic, emotional, cognitive, sociocultural, evolutionary, genetic and neuroscientific aspects, in relation to the expectation of the image of their body. The CS is the perspective that enables, through kinesthetic and proprioceptive mechanisms, the recognition of the anatomical body and the relationship it establishes with the environment and with the objects around it. In view of these definitions, the opportunity arose to relate sleep quality with body perception and symptomatological conditions. Thus, the objective of the study was to analyze the relationship between sleep quality and body perception, by the aspect of body schema and the symptomatological conditions of multiple sclerosis. Participants were 18 people, aged between 21 and 67 years, who were evaluated for sleep quality using the Pittsburgh questionnaire, body perception using the Askevold test, and symptoms through a structured interview. The results indicated that all participants with adequate sleep were classified as hyperschematic, while 67% of those who had inadequate sleep were classified as hyposchematic. In addition, individuals with inadequate sleep showed a balanced distribution between motor and sensory symptoms, while those with adequate sleep predominantly reported sensory symptoms. Fatigue was a relevant symptom in 67% of individuals with inadequate sleep. These findings suggest that sleep quality may be associated with body perception and symptom manifestation in RRMS, highlighting the importance of sleep-enhancing interventions for the management of this condition.",

An important clinical consideration for IEED is that of distinguishing mood from affect. IEED describes a syndrome of relatively stereotypical episodes of uncontrollable crying and/or laughing, resulting from lesions of multiple types, in multiple brain regions, without an apparent stimulus to trigger such responses. This syndrome is common among a number of neurological diseases like patients with a stroke or traumatic brain injury (TBI), patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), multiple sclerosis (MS), as well as dementias such as Alzheimer;s disease (AD), and motor disorders such as Parkinson;s disease (PD). The neuropathological cause and neurochemistry of the disorder remains unclear. There is general agreement that IEED is the result of an injury to the neurological pathways that control the expression of emotions. Adequate treatment can reduce the frequency and improve the quality of life of patients and caregivers.",

So far, this well-established psychopathological knowledge has been appreciated only insufficiently by the official diagnostic systerms of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV TR) and the ICD-10 Classification of Mental and Behavioral Disorders. Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Guidelines (ICD-10). From a perspective of primary care services, this unmet diagnostic need is deplorable, as the main mode of presenting a depression is by reporting somatic symptoms. This somatic form of presentation, however, significantly contributes to low rates of recognition in primary care. A diagnostic challenge may be seen in the differentiation of a depression with prevailing somatic symptoms from anxiety, somatoform disorders, and medical conditions. When somatic symptoms, particularly painful physical conditions, accompany the already debilitating psychiatric and behavioral symptoms of depression, the course of the illness may be more severe, implying a higher risk of early relapse, chronicity, suicide, or mortality due to other natural causes, the economic burden increases considerably the functional status may be hampered heavily, and health-related quality of life may be lowered dramatically. The neurobiological underpinnings of somatic symptoms in depression may guide more promising treatment approaches.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The fatigue that arises from work manifests itself as a feeling of constant fatigue or weakness. It can be physical, mental, or a combination of both. The occurrence of fatigue is influenced by physical, mental and sensory loads, night work, psychological and physical factors of the working environment, personality characteristics of the worker. In order to speak with certainty about the impact of work on humans, one must determine precisely in each particular case what type of work it is. In this sense, the difference is made whether it is static or dynamic work. If the factors such as physical and psychological load act longer than the worker can tolerate, there is a psychophysiological overstretchand a state between normal physiological and pathological with a tendency to pass into the pathological form, i.e. disease. Acute and chronic fatigue of health care workers is very common. Given that every healthcare professional during his working life meets with numerous hazards and dangers, it is very important that they are recognized in a certain way, evaluated / ranked in order to pay special attention to these hazards and dangers that represent a potential threat to the safety and health of health workers. In this context, a study of health workers currently employed in the Kotor Health Center, Emergency Medical Service and Kotor General Hospital was conducted with the aim of establishing the connection between acute and chronic fatigue among medical workers with sociodemographic work and life characteristics of respondents. As for the methods in the process of collecting data from the respondents, two questionnaires were used, which the respondents themselves completed the OFER15 questionnaire and the general questionnaire. Based on the analysis of the data, it can be concluded that recovery, acute and chronic fatigue are significantly higher among the hospital medical workers, which corresponds to the number of working hours that is higher compared to the other population that was examined.",

      "abstract": "Secure attachments with caregivers play a critical role in helping children develop a capacity to modulate physiological arousal. Loss of ability to regulate the intensity of feelings and impulses is possibly the most far-reaching effect of trauma and neglect. It has been shown that most abused and neglected children develop disorganized attachment patterns. The inability to modulate emotions gives rise to a range of behaviors that are best understood as attempts at self-regulation. These include aggression against others, self-destructive behavior, eating disorders, and substance abuse. The capacity to regulate internal states affects both self-definition and one's attitude toward one's surroundings. Abused children often fail to develop the capacity to express specific and differentiated emotions: Their difficulty putting feelings into words interferes with flexible response strategies and promotes acting out. Usually, these behaviors coexist, which further complicates diagnosis and treatment. Affective dysregulation can be mitigated by safe attachments, secure meaning schemes, and pharmacological interventions that enhance the predictability of somatic responses to stress. The ability to create symbolic representations of terrifying experiences promotes taming of terror and desomatization of traumatic memories.",

In an alternative paradigm, voices are understood as trauma-driven dissociated, disowned, or disavowed aspects of self; the goal is not to suppress them but to integrate them during psychotherapy. Auditory hallucinations are common in dissociative identity disorder, borderline personality disorder, and complex posttraumatic stress disorder and are not specific to psychosis. The features that differentiate psychotic from dissociative voices include the qualities of the voices themselves, as well as other symptoms: for example, compared with dissociative voices, psychotic voices are accompanied by less sociability, more formal thought disorder, more negative symptoms including blunted affect, and more delusions. The author proposes that the psychotherapy of dissociative voices can be indicated trans-diagnostically, including in a subgroup of individuals with diagnoses of schizophrenia. Psychotherapeutic strategies are illustrated with a case example.",

      "title": "Chronic Pain as a Hypothetical Construct: A Practical and Philosophical Consideration",
      "abstract": "Pain has been defined by the International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP) as \"an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage, or described in terms of such damage.\" Chronic pain is usually described as pain that has persisted for 3-6 months and/or beyond the expected time of healing. The numerical pain rating (NPR) is the customary metric and often considered as a proxy for the subjective experience of chronic pain. This definition of pain (chronic) has been of significant heuristic value. However, the definition and the models it has spawned tend to encourage the interpretation of pain as a measurable entity and implies that the patient's experience of pain can be fully comprehended by someone other than the person in pain. Several major models of pain have been scrutinized and found to propagate the notion of pain as a 'thing' and fall prey to biomedical reductionism and Cartesian (mind-body) dualism. Furthermore, the NPR does not appear to capture the complexity of chronic pain and correlates poorly with other clinically meaningful outcomes. It, and other aspects of the current notion of chronic pain, appear to be an extension of our reliance on the philosophical principles of reductionism and materialism. These and other shortcomings identified in the IASP definition have resulted in an increased interest in a reexamination and possible updating of our view of pain (chronic) and its definition. The present paper describes an alternative view of pain, in particular chronic pain. It argues that chronic pain should be understood as a separate phenomenon from, rather than an extension of, acute pain and interpreted as a hypothetical construct (HC). HCs are contrasted to intervening variables (IV) and the use of HCs in science is illustrated. The acceptance of the principles of nonlinearity and emergence are seen as important characteristics. The practical implications and barriers of this philosophical shift for assessment, treatment, and education are explored. The patient's narrative is presented as a potential source of important phenomenological data relating to their 'experience' of pain. It is further proposed that educational and academic endeavors incorporate a discussion of the process of chronification and the role of complexity theory.",

Pain is an essential “alarm bell” that tells us that something is wrong, and a “teacher” that reminds us not to do that same thing again. Usually, pain is felt when a stimulus, such as a pinch or an injury, causes electrical pulses to run along one of the cables of nerve fibers in our body and into the brain where they generate an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience. Sometimes pain occurs without any actual stimulus, such as when nerve fibers have been damaged. An example is the phantom pain that amputees sometimes feel in their missing limb. Certain drugs can stop pain by blocking the electrical pulses before they reach the brain. Other drugs stop pain in a different way, by preventing the brain from reading the pain message carried by the electrical pulses. This article explains what happens in the body when we are hurt, how the brain causes this to be felt as pain and how certain drugs can stop pain.",

      "title": "Mental health disorders: prevalent but widely ignored in academia?",
      "abstract": "Considering that up to one in six persons worldwide has experienced a mental disorder within the past 12 months, and bearing in mind that about one-third of adults suffer from a clinically manifest mental disorder during their lifetime (Steel et al. 2014), every one of us is likely to regularly be in contact with people who have mental health problems. Does the same hold true for the academic population? Is it possible that mental disorders such as anxiety, depressive or substance use related disorders are even more common among scientists than in the general population, but still widely ignored? And if the answer to these questions is ‘Yes’, what implications should be taken into consideration? A mental disorder is a behavioural or psychological syndrome or pattern that occurs in an individual, characterized by the following facts: it causes clinically significant distress and/or impairments in one or more important areas of functioning; is not merely an expectable response to common stressors and losses; reflects an underlying psychobiological dysfunction; is not solely a result of social deviance or conflicts with society; has diagnostic validity using one or more sets of diagnostic validators; and has clinical utility (Stein et al. 2010; APA, 2013; WHO, 2019). World Mental Health (WMH) representative community surveys provide information regarding the prevalence of common mental disorders. Those surveys are carried out by the World Health Organization (WHO) in many countries throughout the world, using the same fully-structured research diagnostic interview to generate diagnoses of mental disorders based on the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) (WHO, 2019) and the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) (APA, 2013). According to those surveys, in the general population the most frequent mental disorders are anxiety and mood disorders (such as depression), with lifetime prevalence rates averaging approximately 16% (12-months prevalence 11%) for anxiety disorders, and 12% (12-months prevalence 6%) for mood disorders (Kessler et al. 2009). A meta-analysis suggests population-based lifetime and 12-month prevalence estimates for having at least one mental disorder of 29% and 18%, respectively (Steel et al. 2014). Some authors argue that mental health problems in academia are widespread and constitute an ‘invisible crisis’ (Price et al. 2017; Bira et al. 2019). This point of view may reflect anecdotal evidence of life experiences, but to our knowledge there is limited systematic empirical research concerning mental health issues in postdoctoral researchers, research and teaching fellows, or professors. However, studies involving college, university or graduate students have brought heightened awareness of and attention to the topic (Rosenthal & Okie, 2005). Findings from large-scale WMH surveys with 1572 college students across 21 countries indicated that one-fifth of the sample suffered from at least one mental disorder during the year prior to assessment (assessed were mood disorders, anxiety disorders, posttraumatic stress disorder, disruptive behaviour disorders such as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and substance use disorders) (Auerbach et al. 2016). It is noteworthy that these prevalence rates did not exceed those reported in two control groups of non-students in the same age range, specifically in participants who recently left college without graduating (n = 702; prevalence 25.0%) and in other non-students (n = 3476; prevalence 21.4%) (Auerbach et al. 2016). Across all groups, anxiety disorders were the most prevalent mental illnesses, followed by mood and substance use disorders. Findings from the WMH International College Student project indicate somewhat higher prevalence estimates among first year students (n = 13,984) from 19 colleges across eight countries. One-third screened positive for at least one 12-month mental disorder, most commonly depression, which was found in 18.5% of participants (Auerbach et al. 2018). Depression is characterized by a variety of symptoms that reduce the ability to meet study or work commitments, involving feelings of sadness, guilt, hopelessness, or worthlessness; lack of interest in activities once enjoyed; fatigue; diminished ability to think or concentrate; and/or indecisiveness (APA, 2013). According to the WMH College Student project, only one in three students with depression received mental health treatment (Bruffaerts et al. 2019). This is worrisome, given that – apart from the symptoms mentioned above – thoughts of death (not just fear of dying), self-harm, suicidal ideation, and suicide attempts are common during episodes of depression (APA, 2013). In terms of university students and junior researchers, there is accumulating evidence for a relatively high prevalence of mental disorders in this population, including medical students (Rosenthal & Okie, 2005; Levecque et al. 2017; Pacheco et al. 2017; Zeng et al. 2019). A Flemish study investigated 3659 graduate students enrolled in a PhD programme, using validated self-rating questionnaires. Roughly one-third of participants were identified as being at risk of having or developing a mental disorder, especially depression (Levecque et al. 2017). This estimate was 2.4 times higher in PhD students compared to highly educated individuals in the general population, 2.8 times higher compared to highly educated employees, and 1.8 times higher compared to higher education students (Levecque et al. 2017). A recent questionnaire-based online survey of 2279 graduate students (90% PhD students, 10% Master's students) from 26 countries and 234 institutions suggests an increased propensity towards anxiety (41%) and depressive disorders (39%) in the graduate trainee community that would be higher than in the general population (Evans et al. 2018). The study further showed that those participants who scored above the questionnaire thresholds for anxiety and/or depressive disorder more often disagreed with such statements as ‘I have a good work–life balance’ or evaluated their relationship with and support by their principal investigators or supervisors more harshly than participants with low anxiety/depression scores (Evans et al. 2018). It is worth noting that the findings should be interpreted with caution because of the convenience (non-representative) sample, the potential selection bias, the lack of a control group, and the use of self-ratings instead of structured clinical interviews conducted by mental health experts (Duffy et al. 2019). The findings reported above point to the need for a better understanding of mental health problems among academics. The usually high workload, often associated with externally prescribed deadlines, competition for research resources, and uncertain job prospects can have an adverse impact on mental health. Problems may be aggravated by poor management practice as well as insufficient recognition and reward (Gillespie et al. 2001). Besides possibly disadvantageous academic conditions, other variables might contribute to mental health problems among certain sub-populations. For example, we cannot exclude the possibility that people who seek an academic career are particularly vulnerable to developing mental health problems. Vice versa, scientists may possess certain personality features (e.g. openness, self-directedness) that may increase their resilience and protect them from mental health conditions (Sato, 2016). Unfortunately, there is a relative dearth of research on mental health among senior researchers. Knowing that graduate students appear to be at increased risk for poor mental health, one could assume that senior researchers are affected in a similar manner. However, it could also be that scientists at later career stages are less affected than junior researchers, due to the benefits of their positions such as a higher level of independence, job security, etc. Maybe the more resilient one is, the more likely one is to reach the level of senior researcher. However, such reasoning remains speculative, due to the lack of empirical data. The relationships between mental health and both favourable and unfavourable academic conditions are still understudied. A major problem is that most people with mental disorders suffer in silence. They may conceal or hide their mental health problems from others because of anticipated stigma, discrimination, potential damage of their careers, and concerns about confidentiality. This is a consequence of persisting negative attitudes towards persons with mental disorders, including inappropriate beliefs about the causes of mental illnesses (Wynaden et al. 2014). Negative attitudes are often related to insufficient literacy in a topic. Thanks to greater public awareness, the stigma surrounding mental disorders such as depression has been gradually decreasing in recent decades. Despite that progress, mental health problems are still frequently seen as a ‘weakness’ or ‘lack of willpower’, rather than as what they are: an illness. It is odd that mental disorders are not regarded in the same manner as somatic disorders, and that it would appear to be easier to openly talk about cancer than about depression. For the person afflicted, self-stigma hampers early diagnosis and appropriate treatment, which can result in terrible consequences. It is essential that we become more open and reflect more honestly about ourselves, regardless of whether we self-identify as being affected by mental health problems, or not. We should combat the stigma around psychiatric disorders in academic settings by paying more attention to possible mental health problems. There might be several reasons for the uncharacteristically poor work performance of a student or colleague, his or her cyclic lack in responses to emails, unexplained non-attendance, sudden indecisiveness and unreliability, etc. Mental health problems may constitute a potential reason, and while they should not be overestimated, they should be taken into account. Perpetuating negative attitudes towards poor mental health by making derogatory comments, spreading rumours about suspected mental issues of a colleague, or by maintaining a ‘don't ask, don't tell’ culture, are not appropriate. Instead, we should raise awareness, increase our mental health literacy, listen, speak out, seek or offer/point out help, and reduce attitudinal barriers on campus to better recognize and deal with mental health problems in academics.",

For resolution, one must diagnose the cause of the impasse, and apply the appropriate treatment measure, which may be clarification, confrontation, interpretation, transfer, or some form of splitting the transference. Splitting of the transference is useful in the treatment of severely regressive transference reactions and allows for expression of the hostile feelings which were previously acted out or defended against by regression. Some impasse situations require consultation, ongoing supervision, or therapy for the therapist.",

Salah satunya adalah penyakit demam berdarah (DB) atau demam berdarah dangue (DBD), yang merupakan salah satu penyakit menular yang berbahaya dapat menimbulkan kematian dalam waktu singkat dan sering menimbulkan wabah. Penyakit DBD sering salah didiagnosis dengan penyakit lain seperti Common cold, Typhoid Fever, atau Morbili. Hal ini disebabkan karena infeksi virus dengue yang menyebabkan DBD bisa bersifat asimtomatik atau tidak jelas gejalanya. Timbulnya ketidakpastian ini dapat disebabkan oleh kurangnya informasi yang diberikan oleh pasien atau dapat juga disebabkan oleh sulitnya seorang dokter dalam memberikan preferensinya secara tegas. Ketidakpastian ini bisa terletak pada data atau informasi fisik baik yang terdapat pada alternatif maupun atribut, dan dapat juga terletak pada penyampaian preferensi yang diberikan oleh dokter. Logika fuzzy yang berperan mengakomodasi adanya ketidakpastian yang seringkali muncul pada saat pengambilan keputusan dapat digunakan dalam menentukan penyakit yang diderita oleh pasien.

      "abstract": "The author discusses the experience of ‘being invaded’ that is sometimes communicated by certain severely disturbed patients. The complaint can sometimes be couched in terms of bodily suffering and such patients may state that they have the experience of a ‘foreign body’ inside. It is suggested that these patients have suffered severe early failure of containment of their projections, while at the same time they have incorporated primitive characteristics of the object that have been powerfully projected into them. An object that invades in this way, it is suggested, experiences a compulsive need to expel unbearable states of mind using others as a repository. The infant incorporates these violent projections as part of his own mental representational system, and normal identifi cation processes are disrupted. There follows impairment of the development of the sense of self. Clinical examples of how the invasive experience manifests itself in the analytic setting and in the transference and countertransference are presented. It is argued that this highly complex form of early subject‐object interaction (prior to the differentiation of psyche‐soma) is more likely to be found in severely narcissistically disturbed individuals. Some refl ections on the origins of invasive phenomena are given.",

      "title": "The pathology of torture",
      "abstract": "Detainees may be subjected to torture and extra-judicial execution by State actors and terrorists. But, the pathology of torture has not been well-described. This is due to the lack of autopsies performed on victims of torture, mostly due to the disposal of the bodies of the victims by their torturers. On this basis, the cause of death of detainees subjected to torture is often a matter of speculation or remains obscure. This paper provides an overview of the pathology of torture based on the authour's experience with the autopsies of torture victims. At autopsy, many different types of inflicted injuries may be observed, often ranging in severity. However, three recurrent patterns of trauma that are the hallmarks of torture were recognized by the authour: (1) blunt impact trauma characterized by bruises, patterned injuries, and internal injuries; (2) electrical and thermal injuries; and (3) injuries from stress positions that occur from prolonged suspension. The most under-recognized form of fatal torture are the complications of stress positions related to suspension of the victim's body by the upper, or lower extremities. For example, prolonged suspension by reverse hanging (suspension of the victim's body by the wrists or forearms with the arms extended backward at the shoulder joint) can cause over-stretching and necrosis of the muscles of the shoulder, resulting in fatal myoglobinuric renal failure. It is essential that autopsies be performed on all detainees who die in custody, to determine if torture played a role in death. Furthermore, the true nature of the injuries sustained often remains obscure unless a musculocutaneous dissection is performed. Specifically, dissection of the back, limbs and the soles of the feet, as well as the shoulders and knees is essential to determine if specific forms of torture have been applied. This is especially true for fatal complications of stress positions. Seeking the truth about the medical consequences of fatal torture will raise awareness about torture-related injuries, assist in rehabilitation of torture survivors, and strengthen forensic humanitarian action.",

      "title": "Victims' Psychological Damage Assessment and Rescue Plan",
      "abstract": "According to different sources of pain that victims feel,damage can be divided into three categories:body damage,property damage and psychological damage.Body damage and property damage are valued by judicial system,while victims' psychological damage assessment is always ignored.Psychological damage means psychopathic changes in the environment caused by psychological mechanisms,which is like clinical psychiatry post-traumatic stress disorder and acute stress disorder.In psychological view,it only refers to mental agony,psychological disorders and mental illness after personal crimes.It contains pain and suffering,mental shock,loss of enjoyment of life,loss of a shortened life expectancy and bereavement.Psychological damage can be divided into the short-term psychological damage and the long-term psychological damage.Based on the existing research,we can help victims rescue from the short-term psychological damage following five elements or principles;Promote a sense of safety,promote calming,promote a sense of self and collective efficacy,promote connectedness,and promote hope These are very similar to the psychological first aid approach,which emphasize the reduction of immediate distress and the promotion of the individuals' own coping abilities.The long-term psychological damage and relief needs help from professional psychiatrists or psychotherapists,and trauma-focused cognitive-behavioral therapy is shown to be effective and should be offered.The psychological damage can be evaluated from four aspects;crime type and severity,victims' personal characteristics,social support systems and social awareness and victims' attitudes.Therefore,a comprehensive rescue package can be made from information,practical help and emotional support When victims obtain information from judicial system about how to do judicial investigation,whether the perpetrator confessed,how the judge makes decision and why the offender can be released on parole or commutation,their sense of justice will be highly improved and they believe the procedure is fair so that their pain can be reduced.Practical help contains legal protection and economic aid.Emotional support comes from relatives and friends,the judiciary,the media and the public Relatives and friends,who play the most important role in helping victims to rescue,need to understand,tolerate victims and provide unconditional support;judicial officials need to avoid being indifferent to victims,which may cause second injury;media needs to respect victims and avoid overexposure case details;the public needs to treat victims equally and avoid discrimination,isolation and alienation.In conclusion,scientifically classifying and assessing victims' psychological damage can help establish a more equitable compensation system to help victims return to normal social life.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Psychopathy is a developmental disorder (Lynam et al., 2007) marked by emotional dysfunction (reduced guilt and empathy) and antisocial behaviour (Harpur et al., 1988; Hare, 1991; Frick, 1995). The disorder is not equivalent to the psychiatric diagnoses of Conduct Disorder (CD) or Antisocial Personality Disorder (ASPD) (DSM-IV) or Conduct Disorder and Dissocial Personality Disorder (ICD 10) (for full details on the assessment of psychopathy, see Patrick, 2006). These psychiatric diagnoses concentrate on the antisocial behaviour shown by the individual rather than any putative cause such as the emotion dysfunction seen in psychopathy. A distinctive feature of psychopathy is that it confers an increased risk of both reactive and instrumental aggression (Cornell et al., 1996; Frick et al., 2003). Reactive aggression is triggered by a frustrating or threatening event and involves unplanned, enraged attacks on the object perceived to be the source of the threat or frustration. This aggression type is often accompanied by anger and can be considered ‘hot’. Importantly, it is initiated without regard for any potential goal. This is in direct contrast with instrumental aggression, which is purposeful and goal directed (e.g., to obtain the victim’s possessions). Furthermore, instrumental aggression need not be accompanied by an emotional state, such as anger, and can be considered ‘cold’. Many emotional disorders (e.g., childhood bipolar disorder and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder) confer an increased risk of reactive aggression (Blair et al., 2005). However, psychopathy is the only psychiatric condition to also confer an increased risk of instrumental aggression.",

According to it, anxiety is conceptualized as a negative or unpleasant emotion characterized by subjective distress, high physiological activation, unadapted motor responses; at the same time, anxiety is linked to individual differences in certain situational areas (specific traits). Anxiety reactions appear due to subject perceives that a certain situation seems threating (situation's appraisal), with no apparent solution due to a lack of resources (coping abilities). For somebody, certain consummatory behaviors such as eating, alcohol consumption, smoking, or drug abuse could relieve distress symptoms or reduce physiological activation producing by anxiety. However, such consumption behaviors could become more and more necessary in order to alleviate anxiety symptoms or avoiding the withdrawal, which is a clinical syndrome including intense anxiety manifestations. The possibility to stop the consumption is interpreted as a threatening situation which provokes more anxiety; the only coping response available is to maintain consumption. Regarding addiction treatments, there are significant interactions between type of treatment x type of patient. Anxiety is on of the variables evaluated in order to design more effective treatments matched with the characteristics of the patient.",

The mental state deterioration started ten days ago he mentioned several criminal charges, debts, having no sense of life, fear of hurting himself and/or others. The patient was treated at another hospital for addiction to alcohol and cocaine a few years ago. He underwent EEG and brain MSCT which resulted in normal findings. Symptomatic pharmacotherapy (Seroquel a' 200 mg 0,0,1 tablets) was prescribed and the psychotherapeutic support led to partial improvement in mental state in terms of the reduction of tension and better functioning.

Type 2 or complex trauma results from multiple or repeated traumatic events occurring over extended periods. Complex trauma is often associated with other adversity and stressors such as neglect, loss or deprivation. For many individuals these traumas occur at a developmentally vulnerable time with the perpetrator often in a caregiving role; thus the trauma incorporates a betrayal of trust. Disclosure can be a problem particularly with complex trauma such as sexual abuse or domestic violence, and is often incremental as trust with the clinician is formed. Patients who have experienced complex trauma should be assessed for the core symptoms of PTSD. In addition, patients should be assessed for disturbances in the three domains of emotional dysregulation, negative self-concept and interpersonal disturbances.",

      "abstract": "Postconcussion syndrome is a poorly defined term that refers to the temporary symptoms that can follow a minor head injury. In the vast majority of cases, symptoms resolve within days or weeks. The most common symptoms include: difficulty with concentration and attention, slowed speed of mental processing, anxiety, emotional lability, sensitivity to noise, fatigue, dizziness, and/or headache. The statistics regarding postconcussion syndrome vary considerably with the population studied. Some individuals continue to have symptoms for 3 to 6 months; a subset experience problems even after 1 year. It is hypothesized that subtle diffuse axonal injury may contribute to persistent symptoms in some individuals. In all cases, the trauma experience has personal meaning for the person affected, and significant psychological reactions are common. Adaptive biological reactions occur in the postinjury period. These biological changes interact with the numerous psychological factors that come into play during the same time.",

However, the importance of diet, alcohol, activity, and other concurrent disease also was noted. Perforation usually occurred as a climax to a period of emotional turbulence when the patient faced situations which, consciously or unconsciously, he felt to be grossly damaging to his self-esteem and to which he reacted, predominantly, with impotent rage. The perfection prodrome is described and interpreted as a depressive equivalent. The ulcer patient's ordinal position in his family as the youngest or middle child and his difficulties in relation to his father are emphasized. Particularly where no other serious disease coexists, perforation should be taken as presumptive evidence that the patient has tried unsuccessfully to resolve an emotional crisis and that appropriate psychiatric help probably is indicated as part of the total treatment.",

It is characterized by disturbances in perception, emotional regulation and thought processes, including symptoms like hallucinations and delusions, leading to a disconnection from reality. Patients often suffer when trying to meet the demands of ordinary life. Genetic predisposition plays a significant role in development of psychosis. Besides these, there are also environmental influences, which contribute as a trigger and later progression of psychotic disorders. These external determinants could possibly be managed in attempts to contain the problem of increased mental health conditions with the main psychotic component. This article reviews the literature reports of current environmental risk factors of psychosis.

The existence of a psychosomatic relationship, i.e. of evidence which connects, at least in part, a somatic disorder to the psychological context in which it occurs, and the characteristics of the psychosomatic mechanism, i.e. of the various modalities through which psychological distress is converted into physical suffering (physical behaviour and attitudes, conversion hysteria, functional disorders, so-called psychosomatic diseases) are the two questions to be addressed as soon as diagnosis is considered. The difficulties and pitfalls are mostly met during management; the role of the physical practitioner is underscored; some utilizations of psychotropic agents as well as some of the physicians' attitudes and phrases are discussed; the value of methods involving the body (relaxation, etc.) is recalled.",

      "title": "Application of the PRECEDE Model to Understanding Postnatal Depression.",
      "abstract": "Dear Editor-in-ChiefIn the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual - Fourth Edition (SM-IV-TR) postnatal depression (PND) is not currently recognized as a separate diagnosis. Instead, the DSM-IV-TR recognizes mood problems during the postnatal period using a postnatal onset specifier to several mood disorders including, major depressive, manic or mixed episode of major depressive disorder, bipolar i disorder, bipolar ii disorder and brief psychotic disorder (1).Postnatal depression, that is depression occurs in a mother within 6 weeks of her giving birth, can have profound effects upon the health and wellbeing of the mother, her baby and the family (2) characterized by a number of symptoms including core symptoms of depressed mood and/or loss of pleasure, together with additional symptoms, including changes in weight or sleep, fatigue or loss of energy, feelings of worth lessens or guiltiness, concentration difficulties, and suicidal ideation (3). Therefore, PND is a multifactorial disorder with biological, psychological, and sociological aspects interacting with woman's risk individually. In addition to the considerable negative personal impact that PND has on women, PND also negatively affects marital relationships (1). Mothers are fully active in their role, when they feel healthy, and the society considers them healthy. While, PND can be explained by clinical criteria and physical symptoms, social recognition is also effective in this area.PND may also detrimentally affect mother-infant attachment, and infant social and cognitive development. Depressed mothers are less emotionally sensitive and less attuned to their infant's emotional state. These serious implications make PND an important mental illness to study because of the tremendous impact it has on the mother and support system, including child's development and familial relationships (1). The ability of a woman to adjust to these changes affects herself, her infant, other children she may have, and her partner (3). Healthy People 2010 listed improve-ement of the health and well-being of women, infants, children, and families as goal (3).The first step in designing an educational program is selecting a health education model which starts the program on the right way and guides it to the evaluation phase. One of the frequently used models in health education and promotion is the PRECEDE model. We assessed the effectiveness of application of PRECEDE model on pregnant women for preventing PND. We hypothesized that predisposing, enabling and reinforcing would serve as antecedents to postnatal depression. Identifying preventive factors is considered an important step in treatment of PND. Predisposing factors, enabling and reinforcing factors are presented as underlying factors in PRECEDE model and addressing each of these factors by the individual and society plays an important role in prevention of this disorder.Therefore, this study investigated predisposing, enabling and reinforcing as factors that can prevent postnatal depression.The PRECEDE model has been widely applied in health promotion settings. Its main goals are to explain health-related behaviors and to guide the design of interventions that aim to change healthrelated behaviors, their antecedents, and their sequelae (4). The PRECEDE framework attempts to identify a type of education which results in certain changes and eventually leads to Prevented PND. The PRECEDE portion of the model (Phases 1-4) includes social, epidemiological, behavioral, environmental, educational, adminis-trative, and policy assessments. Predisposing, Reinforcing, Enabling, Constructs in Educational Diagnosis and Evaluation (PRECEDE) model has been developed by Green and Kreuter as a theoretical model to identify the needs of educational programs and health promotion (5). …",

The presence of psychotic features has a profound influence on the course and treatment response of mood disorders, and psychotic disorders in turn are influenced by coexisting dysregulation of mood. Psychosis and mood, along with other features such as severity, a high rate of recurrence, psychomotor changes, dissociation, and mental states reflecting a history of trauma, appear to interact to alter each other's expression. The treatment of psychotic mood disorders, regardless of coexisting conditions, requires pharmacotherapy--usually a combination of an antipsychotic drug and a medication for mood--or electroconvulsive therapy. The results of treatment are usually positive.",

Yet the diagnosis of psychiatric disorders in the medical setting can be complicated by the symptoms of disease or the side effects of treatment. Somatic symptoms from cancer obfuscate the diagnosis of mood disorders and other psychiatric disorders. Valuable tools such as opioid analgesics, steroids, and anticholinergic medications may produce undesirable psychiatric side effects. Adverse effects (including delirium, mania, and depression) as well as milder effects (such as irritability, insomnia, and weight gain) may impair quality of life. One major challenge to psychiatric diagnosis presents itself during end-of-life care. In this case, it may be difficult to distinguish between primary psychiatric disorders and end-of-life distress. Psychosocial stressors, unrelated to disease or treatment, can occur and sometimes complicate management. Patients' reactions to recommended treatments may be related to other issues, such as grief, frustration, or need for control. As a result, the diagnosis of mood disorders may require input by mental health professionals.",

Whereas the first dimension is closely related to symptoms, such as impulsivity, suicidal behaviours or inappropriate anger, the latter can be associated with dissociative experiences and chronic feeling of emptiness. Although both dimensions have been related to negative experiences during childhood, however, little is known about the specific developmental pathways leading to emotional instability or emotional awareness in borderline adolescents.

A systematic approach is recommended when physicians encounter patients who primarily present with abnormal movements. This chapter illustrates a clinical-based approach that consists of main questions that need to be addressed consecutively in order to determine the correct diagnosis. These questions are: Are the movements involuntary? What is the dominant phenomenology? Where does the abnormal movement disorder originate? What are the associated features? What is the syndrome? What is the differential diagnosis? The identification of the clinical characteristics of abnormal movements and of the associated features defines the syndromic pattern.",

The development of anxiety or depressive disorders are common with demoralization, another psychological syndrome, a topic of interest in psychiatry. To feel demoralized is to lose hope, courage, or confidence, which upsets normal functioning. While depression may co-exist with demoralization, they are 2 distinct entities, with the former characterized by an inability to experience pleasure and the latter characterized by helplessness and avoidance coping. In an effort to more adequately address the psychological stress in organ transplant patients, it is important to distinguish between demoralization and depression. Demoralization has prognostic implications such as negative disease outcomes such as treatment nonadherence and an increase risk of suicide. Medication for depression is not effective for demoralization syndrome. Therapeutic interventions include cognitive behavioral techniques that focus on exploration of attitudes toward hope and meaning in life.",

However, social science and social psychology in particular fall short in the analysis of autistic behavior, the real-life manifestations of the disorder. In this address, I suggest that unless we tackle behavior in interaction, rather than as emanating from individuals, we cannot analytically comprehend behavior as a socially real and holistic entity. The particular phenomena under investigation is transpositioning, or how a neurotypical (NT) professional initiates a sequence of action (first position) involving a recipient who has ASD. Then, the person with ASD fashions a response (second position) that is resistive or noncooperative. However, the NT professional subsequently fashions an action that portrays the ASD person’s second position or responsive behavior as an initiation or feature independent of what may have prompted it. Moreover, in reporting on the event in police, clinical, or other records, there is an elision of the prior initiations or first position actions such that the person with ASD is shown to have manifested ostensibly autonomous and anomalous behavior requiring interventions or remediation.",

These three factors are closely interrelated in a complex system of reciprocal influences and mutual dependence. Thus, the performance of monotonous, routine operations results not only in emotional indifference but also in a reduction in the level of alertness, in drowsiness, apathy, loss of attention, slowed reactions, missing of important signals, and rapidly increasing fatigue. Excessive emotional tension, which can arise in any type of unforeseen, out-of-the-ordinary situation or in performing familiar operations when time is at a premium, is characterized by disorganization of activity, overhasty reactions, an increase in the number of errors (mainly false alarms), and, of course, increasing fatigue because of an excess consumption of energy.",

Personality patterns are termed traits because they are longstanding and consistent, just like other traits such as eye color, hair texture, and height. State behavior refers to behaviors that come and go, such as a mood state and many DSM axis I conditions. Abnormal behavioral states are assumed to represent illness and underlying brain dysfunction or disease. Abnormal behavioral traits are assumed not to reflect brain dysfunction or disease, but rather a deviance that has developed during a person’s formative years.",

      "title": "Overreaching/Overtraining",
      "abstract": "Are you struggling with your exercise/conditioning routine or feeling a bit washed out, stale, and drained? Perhaps your muscles are persistently feeling heavy, stiff, a bit sore, and your exercise program has ceased to be enjoyable. If so, you may be suffering from a condition referred to as \"overreaching\" or, in more severe cases, \"overtraining syndrome.\" Overreaching is broken into functional and nonfunctional states, both of which respond to extra rest. Nonfunctional overreaching leads to a more extended period of decreased performance than functional overreaching and is accompanied by neuroendocrine and/or psychological symptoms. Overtraining is considered severe nonfunctional overreaching that results in a prolonged performance decrement (>2 months) and more severe symptoms. Effective conditioning requires a balance between intense training sessions and periods of rest/recovery. Too much overload and/or not enough recovery can result in both physiological and psychological symptoms that limit performance and may cause one to cease participation in a previously enjoyable activity. In many noncompetitive exercisers, the condition is often the result of inadequate rest/recovery because of busy work lives, family, work and health stressors, meal skipping, and poor sleep. Exercise can become addictive because of the effects of endorphins, dopamine, and other exercise-generated factors on the brain. This addiction can easily result in frequent intense training sessions that are not interspersed with adequate recovery periods. This phenomenon, especially when combined with the increasing popularity of intense multievent endurance competitions and intense group training programs, places individuals at increased risk for developing a nonfunctional state and, in more severe cases, overtraining syndrome. SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS More than 125 signs and symptoms have been identified in published literature, making a definitive diagnosis challenging. The most common symptoms include: • Persistent heavy, stiff, and sore muscles • Persistent fatigue, washed-out feeling • Decreased performance and ability to maintain the training regimen • Increased susceptibility to infections, colds, headaches • Nagging and somewhat chronic injuries • Sleep disturbances • Decreased mental concentration and restlessness • Increased irritability • Depression • Tachycardia and, in some cases, bradycardia • Loss of appetite and weight loss • Bowel movement changes • Absence of menstruation TREATMENT AND PREVENTION The primary treatment is rest and, with more severe cases, an extended break from training. Improved quality of sleep, appropriate nutrition and hydration, and addressing nonexercise stressors are essential for full recovery. In some cases, your physician may choose to rule out other potential organic causes related to a variety of illnesses and health conditions. Prevention of nonfunctional overreaching and overtraining is critical to continued enjoyment of and benefit from your exercise training program. Following are a few key tips: • Listen to your body and take extra recovery time as indicated. • Follow the 10% rule; don't increase training volume and/or intensity by more than 10% at a time. • Follow a periodization format; intersperse periods of intense/high-volume training with extended periods of rest/recovery and/or cross-training. • Recovery/rest between intense workouts is critical because this is when muscle tissue repair and growth occur; usually 24 to 72 hours depending on the intensity and volume of the session. • You shouldn't feel wiped out following a hard workout; you should feel like you could do more; if not, you are doing too much. • Proper nutrition and hydration are important; consulting a sports dietician may be helpful. • Quality sleep is essential. • Variety in your training is healthy; don't do the same thing all the time. Maintaining a training log can be helpful in identifying periods of overreaching and the need for extra recovery. Include variables such as your resting heart rate, sleep, weight (for weight loss), mood, workout intensity/duration, and how muscles and joints respond. With appropriate recovery and using a periodization plan for your long-term training, you will be able to minimize the risk of overtraining and keep your exercise and competitions fun and enjoyable.",

If an occupational health physician is aware of them, it is much easier for him to organize activities with the aim to prevent stress in the work environment. The determination of physiological reactions to chronic stressors may be useful in assessing stressogenic traits of various jobs, understanding morbid effect of stress and recognising persons oversensitive to occupational stress. Physiological examinations of traumatic stress render it possible to identify the mechanism responsible for the development of disorders resulting from traumatic stress, provide indicators for an objective diagnosis of this disorders and help to distinguish and assess their long-term effects which may persist after a subsidence of acute symptoms.",

      "title": "Post-traumatic Stress Disorder Unmasked through Recurrent Psychogenic Cough",
      "abstract": "Dear Editor, Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a psychiatric condition that develops following exposure to traumatic events such as actual or threatened death, serious injury, or sexual violence, which one experiences, witnesses, or listens to.[1] Although the research into the concept and diagnosis of PTSD remains debatable, it typically manifests through reliving experiences, avoidance behavior toward trauma reminders, and hyperarousal. However, the new description of trauma itself has become fluid, with atypical and low magnitude experiences like watching an animation series or eating spoiled food are also equated to trauma.[2] Further, dissociation and somatization are reported in as much as 70% of cases of PTSD.[3] Furthermore, there are atypical manifestations of PTSD, especially in children, such as repetitive play involving traumatic events, sleep disturbances, self-blame, behavioral regression, and somatization.[4] This case highlights an unusual manifestation of PTSD, where a recurrent non-productive cough emerged as the predominant symptom in the absence of any identifiable organic pathology, a symptom currently not reported as a part of PTSD in the literature. While standard management includes selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy (TF-CBT), this report also supports the existing evidence for repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) in refractory PTSD,[5] which has not been useful in dissociative disorders. Written informed consent was obtained from the patient. This is the case of a 19-year-old male, currently studying for a diploma, who was first seen at the age of 13 (in 2019) in this hospital with complaints of abrupt episodes of fearfulness and palpitation with eventual loss of consciousness lasting for approximately half an hour. This was triggered by thoughts of traumatic events, of being beaten by his father's employer on one occasion, and bullying in school. It was accompanied by academic underperformance, disturbed sleep, and intermittent absenteeism from school. There were no obvious reliving experiences. His developmental milestones were reportedly normal. He was given a diagnosis of dissociative disorder and a differential diagnosis of PTSD. He was started on 2.5 mg of escitalopram per day. Subsequently, he was lost to follow-up. In August 2024, he was once again referred to our hospital with complaints of intense, non-productive coughing spells lasting about 1 h, associated at times with chest pain, palpitations, and anxiety. He was first evaluated by emergency medicine, cleared of organicity, and then referred to psychiatry. Further exploration revealed a history of repeated physical abuse by his father's employer using a belt or stick, that lasted for more than a year during 2021–2022. Both families stayed in the same compound, and the employer and his son would do this when his parents were away at work. This was because he was not good at studies. It was stopped later when his father reprimanded his employer. However, the patient started to get episodes of coughing as explained above. The local physician referred him to a psychiatrist who again started him on escitalopram 10 mg/day, but it was not effective this time. The patient was taken to another psychiatrist who gave him dothiepin 50 mg/day. As it was also ineffective, even after several months, he was referred to us. He was provisionally diagnosed as having a dissociative disorder. However, on serial mental status examination, it was revealed that whenever his class teacher yelled at or punished any student, this would remind him of the abuse that had happened to him at home, and he would start coughing for hours. It was as if he was being beaten up then and there. He would avoid any situation that involved yelling or any kind of abuse, as it would trigger such episodes. At school, he would remain vigilant of such events happening and used to have frequent absences. His diagnosis of PTSD as per International Classification of Diseases 11th Revision (ICD-11) was confirmed, based on the history of trauma, reliving experiences expressed as cough, avoidance of the school environment that reminds him of trauma, and being vigilant when at school or wherever he perceives threats. He was started on desvenlafaxine, propranolol, and clonazepam, and the dose was built up to 150 mg, 40 mg, and 1 mg, in that order. Both the patient and his family were educated regarding the nature and course of the illness as well as the importance of adherence to treatment. The grounding techniques and relaxation techniques were taught to the patient. He was partially better and was discharged after 10 days. However, the patient reported with worsening of cough despite medication, in October 2024. Further increase in the dose of desvenlafaxine to 200 mg did not help, prompting consideration of rTMS. He underwent 20 sessions of intermittent theta-burst stimulation (iTBS) targeting the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, over 5 days, as per the evidence.[6] Following this, he showed rapid improvement in cough frequency, with alleviation of anxiety symptoms. He was discharged on 200 mg desvenlafaxine, 10 mg buspirone, 0.75 mg clonazepam, and 1 mg risperidone was added for the excessive fear as a trauma response. He was maintaining well during follow-ups in November and December. However, due to significant improvement, he abruptly stopped medication in January 2025 and reported back in February 2025, following the trigger of witnessing a road traffic accident, presenting again with cough episodes. Given prior good response, rTMS was re-initiated, and desvenlafaxine 100 mg and clonazepam 0.5 mg were reintroduced. The patient showed significant clinical improvement by the end of 20 sessions of rTMS. Grounding techniques and breathing exercises were reinforced, and the patient was discharged on the same medication. He has been coming ever since for follow-up and psychotherapy sessions on stress management and relaxation. This case highlights a rare and strikingly atypical presentation of PTSD, in which psychogenic cough emerged as the predominant symptom, overshadowing the usual features such as reliving experiences, avoidance, and hyperarousal, but triggered by trauma reminders. It brings attention to the complex and often underappreciated interplay between psychological trauma, dissociative responses, and somatic symptomatology. Such presentations challenge conventional diagnostic frameworks and underscore the need for clinical vigilance in identifying non-traditional manifestations of trauma-related disorders. Although superficially it appears to be a dissociative disorder, the trauma and demonstrable reliving, avoidance, and hypervigilance established the diagnosis of PTSD. There are published atypical presentations of PTSD. A child perceived an animation series as traumatic and was later diagnosed with PTSD.[2] An African refugee in America presented with chronic abdominal and back pain, which was later found to be a trauma response to stabbing and hence was diagnosed with PTSD.[7] A 12-year-old girl with a history of ankle sprain after a road traffic accident persisted to have chronic ankle pain and PTSD, was diagnosed.[8] A Turkish soldier presented with spontaneous ejaculations, and it was his presentation of PTSD.[9] Our patient reported a recurrent cough. The case further exemplifies the importance of a comprehensive, mu ltimodal treatment, incorporating pharmacotherapy, neuromodulation (rTMS), and psychotherapy. The patient's significant clinical improvement following rTMS reinforces its therapeutic value among poor responders to conventional treatment of PTSD. Despite growing evidence supporting its efficacy,[10] rTMS remains underutilised, possibly due to limited accessibility and high costs. All in all, PTSD can have diverse presentations, and clinicians' careful assessment is the key.

      "abstract": "Stigmatisation is a well known social phenomenon based on the discrimination of an individual or a sub-group of individuals by a dominant or majority group. Often discussed in the frame of psychiatry, it is also observed in other domains of medicine. It impacts not only patients, but their relatives and their children, as well as the health professionals taking care of them. Moreover, it is detrimental to the implementation of preventive strategies and induces depressive reactions, loss of self esteem and reduction of patients' quality of life. Finally, it keeps researchers away from certain domains of medicine and has a negative impact on funding for research and treatment. It is therefore important to understand its underlying mechanisms in order to fight it more efficiently.La stigmatisation est un phénomène social très commun, basé sur la discrimination d’un individu ou d’un sous-groupe d’individus par un groupe dominant ou majoritaire. Discuté habituellement dans le contexte spécifique de la psychiatrie, ce phénomène existe aussi dans d’autres domaines de la médecine. Il touche non seulement les patients mais également leurs proches, leurs enfants, et parfois les soignants qui s’en occupent. De plus, il nuit à l’implantation de stratégies de prévention, induit des réactions dépressives, une perte d’estime de soi et une détérioration de la qualité de vie chez les patients. Enfin, il freine l’intérêt des scientifiques et restreint les fonds qui sont alloués à la recherche dans les domaines qui en font l’objet.

The concept of anxiety refers to relatively stable individual differences in anxiety proneness as a personality trait. Anxiety states can be distinguished from other unpleasant emotions such as anger, sorrow or grief, by their unique combination of experiential, physiological and behavioural manifestations. An anxiety state is characterized by subjective feelings of tension, apprehension, nervousness and worry, and by activation (arousal) and discharge of the autonomic nervous system. Calmness and serenity indicate the absence of anxiety; tension, apprehension and nervousness accompany moderate levels of anxiety; intense feelings of fear, fright and panic are indicative of very high levels of anxiety. But even individuals have coping skills and defences against anxiety that occasionally leave them relatively free of it.",

      "title": "When disaster strikes, acute stress disorder may follow",
      "abstract": "Abstract During and immediately following a traumatic event, people may manifest a pattern of dissociative and anxiety symptoms and other reactions, referred to as Acute Stress Disorder. A review of the empirical literature on psychological reactions to trauma suggest that this pattern of symptoms has often been identified across different kinds of traumatic events. It is likely to constitute a psychological adaptation to a stressful event, limiting painful thoughts and feelings associated with the event and allowing the person to function at least minimally. Continuation of these symptoms, however, may impair the person's quality of life and disrupt social and other functioning. If symptoms last beyond a month following the traumatic event, Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) may ensue, continuing for months or even years after the precipitating event. Hence, it is important to be able to identify this pattern of reactions that may be manifested in reaction to trauma, so that appropriate intervention can be provided. Although it was not officially recognized in the 3rd edition Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM‐III‐R), Acute Stress Disorder is included as a separate diagnosis in the DSM‐IV.",

Failure of one component can compromise the whole.

      "abstract": "In Italy, as in other countries, an apparently increasing number of subjects is reporting a variety of subjective symptoms that the subjects themselves refer to the exposure to electric, magnetic or electromagnetic fields (EMF) from nearby electric appliances, cellular phones, antennas, etc. Terms like electricity hypersensitivity (EHS), EMF hypersensitivity, or other similar, are frequently adopted to describe such symptoms; nevertheless, up to now, these terms are not entered the medical terminology. No accepted diagnostic criteria or procedures for the diagnosis of EHS are currently available. Furthermore, apart from the subject's self-attribution of the symptoms to EMFs, no direct cause-effect relationship between EHS symptoms and electromagnetic fields has been proved; additionally, evidence of a possible pathogenetic mechanism is lacking. In this paper, two cases developing symptoms of EHS ascribed to overhead power line in the proximity of their house are discussed. Nervous system (asthenia, depression, paraesthesias etc.), cardiovascular system (cardiac palpitations) and the skin (tingling, itching, etc.), are mostly (but not exclusively) involved. Based on available scientific knowledge, the rationale for an approach to subjects claiming for EHS is discussed. The establishment of a National archive for the collection of cases is communicated.",

      "abstract": "The proposed changes to DSM-5 will create new categories of mental disorder (referred to here generically as Prolonged Grief Disorder'' [PGD]) to diagnose individuals experiencing prolonged intense grief reactions to the loss of a loved one. Individuals could be diagnosed even if they have no depressive or anxiety symptoms but only symptoms typical of grief (e.g., yearning, avoidance of reminders, disbelief, feelings of emptiness). The main challenge for such proposals is to establish that the proposed diagnostic criteria validly discriminate a genuine psychiatric disorder of grief from intense normal grief. With this test in mind, I evaluate the soundness of four empirical arguments and one conceptual argument that have been put forward to support such proposals: (1) PGD has discriminant validity because distinctive, pathognomonic symptoms distinguish it from normal grief; (2) PGD has discriminant validity because it identifies grief symptoms that are of greater absolute severity than in normal grief; (3) PGD has predictive validity because it implies a chronic, interminable process of grieving, thus a derailment of the normal process of grief resolution; (4) PGD has predictive validity because it predicts negative mental and physical health outcomes unlikely in normal grief; and (5) PGD has conceptual validity because grief is analogous to a wound or, alternatively, lengthy grief is analogous to a wound that does not heal. Upon close examination, each of these arguments turns out to have serious empirical or conceptual deficiencies. I conclude that the proposed diagnostic criteria for PGD fail to discriminate disorder from intense normal grief and are likely to yield massive false-positive diagnoses. Consequently, the proposal to add pathological grief categories to DSM-5 should be withdrawn pending further research to identify more valid criteria for diagnosing PGD.",

      "title": "Meaning making and psychological well being of persons living with human ammunodeficiency virus",
      "abstract": "Being diagnosed with a life-threatening illness such as HIV or cancer can be often traumatic. It can also have other devastating impact on a personâ€™s life. Earlier researches\r\non Persons Living with HIV (PLHIV) have found that HIV infection is a medical and existential crisis. PLHIV go through psychological trauma as well as social problems\r\nsuch as depression, stigma, poverty and marginalization in India and elsewhere. In India there has always been report of prejudice, exclusion and stigmatization of PLHIV. As a\r\nconsequence PLHIV tend to isolate themselves, or go into a hiding. It is already known that both in India and in other parts of the world HIV infection has a wide range of\r\npsychological, physical and social consequences which the infected individuals and their families may have to face. Stigmatization worsens this impact. Due to all these it has\r\nbeen found that PLHIV and their families have to cope with a multitude of stressors. It is also known that when individuals experience tragedies or setbacks in their\r\nlife, they respond to it in an adaptive way by ascribing positive meaning to their experience that may enable them to restore their psychological functioning or even\r\nexceed it. This is known as meaning based coping. It means that when people go through an illness such as cancer or AIDS, that threaten their integrity they are found to forma\r\ncoping strategy or plan to deal with the consequences of illnessâ€™ threat to oneâ€™s health and thereby oneâ€™s life. Search for meaning and finding positive meanings are important themes around which such adaptations occur. This has already been established in health psychology and positive psychology. The meaning-based psychological growth and wellbeing among PLHIV, however, has not been adequately explored in this country. This sets the background for an exploration of the different ways in which PLHIV ascribe\r\nmeaning to and make sense of the experience of living with HIV. Therefore the current study was undertaken with the aim of exploring the idiosyncratic meaning-making themes of PLHIV in Kerala and how they perceive their illness and its influence on their psychological wellbeing and cognitive coping. The current study has adopted a Mixed Method Convergent Parallel Design to explore the meaning that the participants attribute to their experience. The participants\r\ncomprised of 37 persons for the qualitative strand and 232 persons for the quantitative who were recruited using purposive sampling method. They were between the ages of 18 and 70 years, who have known their HIV status for at least a year and all residing in Kerala State at the time of the study. Apart from the demographic data sheet and a semistructured interview schedule, standardized tools such as the Meaning in Life Questionnaire, the Illness Perception Questionnaire-Revised, the Cognitive Emotion\r\nRegulation Questionnaire-Short Form and The Psychological Wellbeing Scale were used to collect data. Analysis of the interviews with the participants identified 12 representations of HIV which were the ways in which HIV is perceived and the life with HIV is lived by the\r\nparticipants. In the analysis of the quantitative data it has been found that majority of the participants find no meaning in their present life. On Illness Perception Questionnaire (IPQ) majority fell under the normal category while a quarter of participants scored high on all domains. It was also found that majority of the participants did not have a sense of control over their illness. An average of 25% of the participants scored high on all the domains of the psychological wellbeing scale. Majority of the participants ruminated about their illness while 28% viewed their illness as catastrophe. The results have also\r\nidentified a few important association between gender, marriage, counselling with illness perception, coping and psychological wellbeing. The significance of the current study lies mainly on the fact that there has not been an in-depth exploration of the lived-experiences of PLHIV in India. Some of the learning of this study, such as pre-test counselling is associated with the rumination in PLHIV, can be made use of by the counsellors providing HIV/AIDS counselling to shift from focusing on the dangers of the infection to positive living with HIV diagnosis. The\r\nqualitative findings such as â€˜HIV as the spoiled identityâ€™ and â€˜HIV as isolationâ€™ highlights that stigma is the worst experience in being infected with HIV. Measures could be taken to increase the awareness of HIV so as to reduce stigma even by including discussion on HIV infection as part of the school curriculum in India. The results also\r\nindicate to the fact that there is a need for more facilities that would provide psychological care for PLHIV together with ART centers to ensure PLHIVâ€™s psychological wellbeing in this country.",

      "title": "PAIN AND ITS MANAGEMENT",
      "abstract": "The traditional stimulus-response model of physiologic pain is conceptually appealing and has laid the foundation for a more comprehensive understanding of nociceptive pathways. However, physiologic pain alone is a rare entity in the clinical setting. In most situations, the noxious stimulus is not transient and may be associated with significant tissue inflammation and nerve injury. Under such circumstances, the classic “hard-wired” system becomes less relevant and dynamic changes in the processing of noxious input are evident in both peripheral and central nervous systems. This type of pain is called pathologic pain (because it implies that the tissue damage has already occurred) or clinical pain, as ongoing discomfort and abnormal sensitivity are features of the patient’s clinical symptomatology. Pathologic pain may manifest itself in several ways: spontaneous pain which may be dull, burning or stabbing (causalgia), exaggerated pain in response to a noxious stimulus (hyperalgesia), and pain produced by a stimulus which is not normally noxious (allodynia) (1). Pathologic pain may arise from injury to a variety of tissue types invoking distinct neural mechanisms, and it is often further classified into inflammatory pain (involving somatic or visceral structures) or neuropathic pain (involving lesions of the nervous system). In addition, it is useful to characterize clinical pain from a temporal perspective and make the distinction between recently occurring (acute) and long lasting (chronic) pain(1,2).",

In a significant minority of cases the symptoms persist longer, thereby comprising a symptom complex commonly referred to as the “post concussion syndrome”, that is, one or more somatic (for example, headaches, dizziness), cognitive (for example, poor concentration, memory), or behavioural/affective (for example, irritability, mood swings) symptoms. Unfortunately, the referral of a patient with the possibility of post concussion syndrome to a busy neurology outpatient clinic can precipitate an inward sigh of reluctant resignation in even the most diligent neurologist or neurosurgeon. We know we are in for a potentially lengthy consultation—long on symptoms and short on signs. Moreover, the process can be convoluted and meandering, as unrewarding for the patient as it is unsatisfying for the clinician.\n\nIt is important to acknowledge at the outset that there is a dearth of evidence-based knowledge of the underlying pathogenesis, and even less of the best management of post concussive symptoms. Thus, much of the information and advice in this article is empirical and based on expert and personal experience.\n\nThe terminology surrounding trauma to the head confuses patients, doctors, and lay commentators alike. Terms such as concussion, mild head injury, mild TBI (traumatic brain injury), cerebral concussion, and post concussion syndrome are often used interchangeably to describe the physical injury itself as well as its immediate and later symptomatic consequences. There is in fact no commonly agreed definition of concussion, or whether it even differs from the term mild TBI. Our own working definition is that concussion is an acute trauma-induced change of mental function which generally lasts less than 24 hours (with or without preceding loss of consciousness) and associated with other symptoms (such as headaches and dizziness) which …",

A textbook knowledge of the physiology and pathology of hearing does not prepare the clinician to cope with a hearing-impaired family member, friend, or colleague, with whom we feel embarrassed, lest our raised voices attract too much attention. We are even less prepared to evaluate or treat hearing-impaired persons in the course of our professional activities. Yet hearing impairment is common, and the profoundly deaf probably suffer mental disorders at a rate in excess of that of their hearing peers. Profound deafness, the absence of functional or remediable hearing, is extremely disabling. Profound deafness that occurs prior to complete acquisition of verbal language is socially and psychiatrically devastating. , · Such deafness, also known as prelingual deafness, is believed to result in uneven, incomplete, or arrested personality developmentl· 4 and behavioral disturbances, S the understanding of which is complicated by the natural language barrier.

      "abstract": "The label \"sick building syndrome\" is often used to imply the absence of a physiologic basis for symptoms in the built environment. Although building-related illness is widely recognized but considered rare, several well-studied mechanisms may be responsible for many symptoms in buildings. These mechanisms do not explain why some individuals perceive disability. Until researchers distinguish physiologic mechanisms from other aspects of disease and study them systematically, poorly defined symptoms will remain poorly understood. The disability associated with such symptoms and syndromes, not the physiology, is the primary interest and generates controversy.",

      "abstract": "When a child is often scolded or threatened by his parents (emotional abuse) and /or when a child is structurally ignored or isolated by his parents (emotional neglect) we call this childhood emotional maltreatment (CEM). CEM is the most common form of child abuse, however, CEM is also the most hidden, underreported and least studied form of child abuse. An important reason for this may be because that the consequences of CEM are underestimated (e.g. ‘Sticks and Stones may break bones, but words will never hurt me’). However, this thesis shows that CEM is related with a persistent negative impact on cognition and the brain.\nWe discovered that individuals that report CEM show differential structure and function of a brain area (the medial prefrontal cortex) that is crucial for role in responding to stress and thinking about yourself. Individuals with CEM also showed more activity in an area that signals threat (the amygdala) which may represent a persistent vigilance towards the detection of threat from others. These brain changes may underlie our other findings that individuals with CEM think more negatively about themselves and others. Negative thoughts can evoke negative thoughts and in new situations, which reinforces more negative memories. Due to this process, emotionally abused individuals may be more vulnerable to develop a depressive and/or anxiety disorder.\nOur findings warrant scientific and policital investments to increase societal awareness about the detrimental impact of CEM on cognition and the brain. Increased societal knowledge will hopefully lead to better awareness, reports, and subsequent interventions for individuals with CEM.",

      "abstract": "The nervous system is commonly impacted by chemicals found in nature, elaborated by organisms, or synthesized by chemists. The peculiar architecture of neural cells, their high-energy demands, and the mandate for electrochemical communication combine to place the nervous system at high risk for chemical perturbation. This inherent vulnerability is exploited by natural agents, synthetic chemicals, medications, and recreational substances designed or used to target the nervous system as well as by a host of other substances that are occasionally encountered in the environment. The neurotoxic actions of chemicals are expressed in a wide range of neurologic phenomena, some of which are associated with purely functional changes, others with structural damage, and still others with both. Many chemicals cause effects that appear and disappear rapidly; others produce effects that evolve over days or weeks and regress over months or years. Diagnosis is heavily dependent on the history and characteristic clinical phenomenology. Specific treatment other than termination of exposure is rare. Although clinical improvement is the rule, neurotoxic disorders leave scars or disappear without a trace.",

It includes both the sensory input and any modulation by physiological, psychological and environmental factors. Not surprisingly there are no objective measures – there is no way to measure pain directly by sampling blood or urine or by performing neurophysiological tests. Measurement of pain must therefore rely on recording the patient’s report. The assumption is often made that because the measurement is subjective it must be of little value. The reality is that if the measurements are done properly, remarkably sensitive and consistent results can be obtained. There are contexts, however, when it is not possible to measure pain at all, or when reports are likely to be unreliable. These include impaired consciousness, young children, psychiatric pathology, severe anxiety, unwillingness to co-operate, and inability to understand the measurements. Such problems are deliberately avoided in trials.",

Suicide may be the end-point of a number of different contributing factors. It is more likely to occur during crisis periods associated with divorce, alcohol and drug abuse, unemployment, clinical depression and other forms of mental illness. Because of this, suicide is often used as a proxy indicator of the mental health status of a population. However, the number of suicides in certain countries may be under-estimated because of the stigma that is associated with the act, or because of data issues associated with reporting criteria (see “Definitions and deviations”).",

One of the symptoms of schizophrenia is sensory perception disorder, namely hallucinations which are typical of mental disorders in individuals characterized by changes in sensory perception, by feeling false sensations in the form of sounds (hearing), sight, taste, touch, or smell. Mental disorders are syndromes or patterns of behavior that are clinically significant that are associated with distress or suffering and pose obstacles to one or more functions of human life. One that includes mental disorders is schizophrenia. Hallucinations are false perceptual distortions that occur in maladaptive neurobiological responses, sufferers actually experience sensory distortions as real things and respond accordingly. Factors that can influence the recurrence of schizophrenic patients with hallucinations include high family emotional expressions, lack of family knowledge, availability of health services, family income and medication adherence in schizophrenic patients. psychiatric nursing care to Tn.

      "abstract": "Schizophrenia and related psychoses is primarily characterized by positive and negative symptoms, as well as cognitive disturbances. Cognitive factors crucial in the pathogenesis of psychosis are specifically studied in terms of cognitive biases that may play a role in the formation and maintenance of psychotic symptoms. Cognitive biases refer to systematic errors in both cognitive processing and content that deviate from logical thinking. Cognitive biases can affect attention, decision-making/reasoning, memory recall, motivation or even attributional style. Psychotic-like experiences and psychotic disorders have been associated with a tendency to jump to conclusions, bias against disconfirmatory evidence and bias against confirmatory evidence as well as liberal acceptance bias. Moreover, patients with schizophrenia tend to present higher belief inflexibility in comparison to healthy individuals and are overconfident in wrong judgments. In the monitoring tasks showing they show a higher tendency to misattribute internally-generated stimuli to external sources (externalizing bias) (1). Finally, patients with schizophrenia tend to have excessive attention toward irrelevant, neutral or familiar stimuli known as the salience aberrant bias. There are several specific psychological interventions designed to ameliorate cognitive biases, such as Metacognitive Training (2,3), Thinking Well (4), Social Cognition and Interaction Training (5). These trainings have been shown to teach patients about cognitive biases and how they contribute to symptoms of psychosis and consequently how they can affect their daily life. There is an increasing number of studies showing results of these interventions in reducing cognitive biases and positive symptoms as well as improving clinical and cognitive insight.",

      "title": "Unusual Presentations of Epilepsies",
      "abstract": "Seizures are either focal (partial) or generalized in onset (Table I).1 The manifestation of the seizure is related to the area of the brain involved in the initial electrical seizure discharge. If the initial seizure discharge is related to the motor strip then one might see a Jacksonian type of seizure with first clonic movements of the thumb and fingers, then a march up the hand, arm, face and leg on the contralateral side of the body. If the initial seizure discharge is related to the temporal lobe then one might see impairment of consciousness and automatic movements (automatisms). The \"aura\" is actually the start of the electrical seizure discharge which is confined to one area of brain. The type of \"aura\" that a patient has is related to the area of brain involved in the seizure discharge. For example, the olfactory aura of an unusual smell may be related to a mesial temporal lobe or mesial frontal lobe discharge. The aura of an unusual taste is related to a discharge in the insular cortex. If the electrical seizure discharge spreads out to involve other areas of brain or the whole brain then the patient has a secondarily generalized major motor seizure. The important point is to recognize that the seizure was a partial onset seizure becoming secondarily generalized and therefore due to a focal etiology rather than a primary generalized seizure disorder, which affects a particular area of brain which is may be precipitated in response to some stimuli which effects a particular area of brain which is extraordinarily sensitive because of an epileptic lesion in that area.

      "abstract": "Chronic fatigue syndrome is characterized by severe, persistent fatigue which is not relieved by rest and is not associated to other medical conditions. Other common symptoms are including concentration and memory impairment, muscle and multiple joints pain, extreme exhaustion after physical or mental exertions, irritable bowel syndrome-like symptoms and depression, anxiety, mood swings and panic attacks. Etiology of the syndrome is not yet clear, post-viral and stress hypotheses were not verified. Diagnosis is confirmed in case of new onset of severe fatigue, for six consecutive months or more; fatigue is leading to significant reduction of the activity levels and is accompanied by other four or more of the specific associated symptoms, which are also lasting for six months or longer. The management of the disease is based on cognitive behavioral therapy, graded exercise therapy and pacing; medication plays a minor role in therapy. The occupational status is severely affected, more than half of the cases being unable to work. Full recovery rate is in average of about 5%.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Parental alienation is a mental condition in which a child—usually one whose parents are engaged in a high‐conflict separation or divorce—allies himself or herself strongly with one parent (the preferred parent) and rejects a relationship with the other parent (the alienated parent) without legitimate justification. Parental alienation usually comes about when the preferred parent indoctrinates the child to fear and hate the rejected or alienated parent. Typically, the alienating parent interferes with or limits the child's contact with the rejected parent. Alienating parents have been described as being angry and vindictive and having maladaptive personality traits. Parental alienation frequently causes short‐term and long‐term psychological problems in the affected children. Many writers have concluded that causing parental alienation is a form of psychological child abuse.",

Second, Does any characteristic type of insanity follow trauma? From the mental symptoms alone, while ignorant of the history of an injury, is it possible in any given case to know that a man is insane because he has received a trauma?

An obvious obsessive or fixated quality is associated with both behaviours, and personality traits of rigidity and rumination are frequently observed, though the state of mind rarely conforms to that found in obsessional disorders. Stalkers and querulants rarely regard their behaviour as unjustified, let alone irrational, and few see their persistence as senseless. They may resist the impulse or urge to pursue their victims or cause on occasion but, for the most part, devote themselves wholeheartedly to their objectives. This chapter explores the epidemiology ad phenomenology of stalking and querulousness and the role of (forensic) psychiatry in responding not only to the perpetrators of these behaviours, but also to the unfortunate victim’s of their disordered attention.",

      "title": "Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Following Intraoperative Awareness",
      "abstract": "Intraoperative awareness (IA) is an anesthesia complication defined as the unexpected and explicit recall by patients of events that occurred during anesthesia. This complication represents a potentially traumatic event as it may lead to psychological or psychiatric consequences, such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). PTSD is the most frequently reported psychiatric consequence of IA. However, the accurate proportion of PTSD following IA is not known. Due to the low incidence of IA, little is known about risk factors for developing psychiatric or psychological sequelae following IA. However, risk factors for the development of PTSD following trauma, in general, have been extensively explored and can be applied to IA. The common risk factors for PTSD are female gender, younger age, minority status, single status, low socioeconomic status, low level of education, low intelligence, psychiatric history, substance abuse or dependence, severity of the trauma, peritraumatic emotional responses, peritraumatic dissociation, lack of social support, low perceived support following the event, history of past traumatic event(s), life stress, childhood adversity, and family psychiatric history. PTSD symptoms may be experienced in the hours or days following IA but can also be delayed and appear months after the traumatic event. They are variable in duration, from a few weeks to several years. To make a diagnosis, they must be present for at least 1 month. Although PTSD is the more frequently reported psychiatric consequence of IA, it is important to note that other syndromal or subsyndromal mental disorders such as the acute stress disorder and the subsyndromal PTSD may develop following IA. Early management strategies have to be provided in order to reduce the deleterious outcomes of IA, including taking complaints about IA seriously and offering early psychiatric care.",

      "abstract": "All healthcare professionals dealing primarily with physical disorder need a working knowledge of relevant psychological factors and psychiatric dis­orders. Despite the geographical and, often, cul­tural separation of most ‘general’ (i.e. physical) and psychiatric hospitals, there are close links (1) be­tween physical and psychological disorders, and (2) between physical and psychological factors in the aetiology, presentation, and management of all illness. This chapter aims to stimulate you to think about these issues in primary care and in the general hospital, and to equip you with the know­ledge required to think about them in an integrated, biopsychosocial way. The links between physical and psychological fac­tors are multiple. They include: … ● psychiatric and physical disorders occurring together by chance— as they are both common; ● psychiatric disorders causing physical symptoms— for example, depression is associated with low physical energy (anergia), amenorrhoea, and constipation; ● psychiatric disorder adversely affecting the outcome of physical disorder— for example, a depressive disorder might impair self- management of diabetes mellitus, because low motivation is a common symptom of depression, and may reduce adherence to self- monitoring of glucose; ● psychological factors increasing disability associated with physical disorder— for example, if a patient recovering from a myocardial infarction believes that it has led to a permanent reduction in their cardiac function, they are less likely to return to work, to take regular exercise, and to have a normal sex life; ● untreated psychological problems leading to the inappropriate use of medical resources and to poor compliance with medical advice— for example, people with panic disorder are more likely to attend emergency departments with acute ‘cardiac’ symptoms; ● physical symptoms and disorders having psychological consequences, which include psychiatric disorder— for example, hypothyroidism and cerebrovascular disease may lead to depression; ● physical disorder exacerbating unrelated psychiatric symptoms— for example, a viral infection could delay recovery from a depressive disorder, by impairing the person’s usual activities, at work and at home, which would otherwise provide therapeutic distraction and stimulation.",

      "abstract": "One of your patients, a 24 year old student, has recently recovered from a first episode of functional psychosis. At a pre-discharge meeting with the patient and his relatives, they inquire about the long term outcome, in particular about the chances of a recurrence in the next few years.\n\n“Prognosis” concerns the prediction of future events. The main form of the prognostic question is usually “what is the likelihood of this particular outcome in a patient with this disorder?” In mental health, prognostic questions may be about the medium to long term outcome of an illness—or they may be about the short term likelihood of a serious adverse event—for example, homicide or suicide. We may also ask if there are any characteristics of the patient that make it more likely that they will have a particularly good or bad outcome. These prognostic factors can be demographic (eg, age or sex), disease specific (presentation and symptomatology), or the presence of other conditions (comorbidity).1 Prognostic factors are distinguished from risk factors for the disease because they are determinants of what will happen after development of the illness rather than deteminants of whether the patient will develop the disorder.\n\nTreatment is one form of prognostic factor, although a special form in that it can be manipulated to improve the likelihood of a beneficial outcome. The fact that treatment can be manipulated also means that it can be studied experimentally in randomised controlled trials. It is either impossible or unethical, however, to randomise most prognostic factors, and therefore alternative study designs are required. The aim of the alternative study design is the same as a randomised trial—that is, to provide an unbiased estimate of the effect of the prognostic factor. When randomisation is not possible, a cohort study is usually the most reliable …",

      "abstract": "Bizarre repetitive behaviour may be quite common, with estimates in people and dogs of a prevalence of up to 8%. Whereas these are often considered important indicators of mental health problems in people, in companion animals, many owners view these behaviours as quirky or even amusing features of their pet. However, the absence of self-report also means that the array of repetitive behaviour conditions in companion animals is also much more diverse than in humans and there is a danger of drawing simple analogies between human and non-human animals based on very superficial phenotypic features. For example, the following differentials might be considered for a dog who chases its tail:\r\n •Seizure possibly a primary partial seizure or secondary to a lesion in the brain such as damage to the vestibular system \r\n•Inner ear infection \r\n•Play \r\n•Pain in the tail or lower back due to damage to the nerves (neuralgia), bones or soft tissues \r\n•Pain around the region of the tail including skin inflammation and infections, impacted or infected anal sacs or trauma \r\n•A learned response aimed at attracting owner attention. \r\n•Acute conflict\r\n•Compulsive Disorder \r\n•Stereotypy \r\n\r\nThese explanations are not independent and a dog who starts chasing his tail for one reason may subsequently learn to do it at other times in order to gain attention, or the frequent repetition of the behaviour may potentially result in neurological sensitization and the expression of the behaviour becoming emancipated from its original triggering stimuli. From the simple (and by no means definitive) list of differentials for tail chasing given above it should be obvious that underlying cognition can vary enormously with a given presenting stereotypic behaviour. This presentation considers the value but also limitations of using companion animals as models of human conditions and especially the value of using real world rather than laboratory models.",

In the elderly, it involves a rapid cognitive decline from the preexisting level of functioning (whatever that might be) involving conscious level, orientation, attention, memory and concentration. The mental state fluctuates from minute to minute or hour to hour, often worse in the evenings than mornings. There are perceptual abnormalities (illusions, hallucinations and misrecognition), affective changes (apathy, lability, irritability, autonomic arousal), persecutory or terrifying ideas, behavioral changes (hypokinesis or hyperkinesis), and motor features – ‘plucking’ and pointing are common. It is an unpleasant state with a high mortality and a high risk of adverse iatrogenic consequences. In approximately 85% of recognised cases, one or more physical causes can be identified, for example infection, intoxication with prescribed drugs, and cardiovascular, respiratory and metabolic disease. In the other 15%, psychologic factors such as removal from home, grief, depression or acute psychotic illness are sufficient to precipitate delirium. The risk of delirium appears to rise with age and underlying cerebral disease.",

This condition is common, with a lifetime prevalence of up to 13%, and one third of affected persons have major dysfunction. <i>Methods:</i> The English-language literature on social anxiety disorder indexed on MEDLINE was searched using the phrases \"social phobia\" or \"social anxiety disorder;\" this search was supplemented with other data sources, such as recent textbooks, to determine common clinical symptoms, differential diagnosis, and management in the primary care setting. <i>Results:</i> Recognition and treatment of social anxiety disorder is poor; only a small minority of patients with this condition have it appropriately diagnosed or treated. Primary care physicians should suspect social anxiety disorder in patients who have specific symptoms and signs (such as hyperhidrosis, flushing, tremor, and white-coat hypertension), in patients who have symptoms of anxiety (such as chest pain, palpitations, or dizziness), or in patients who have another known anxiety disorder, depression, or substance abuse. Drug treatment consists of serotonin-reuptake inhibitors, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, or high-potency benzodiazepines. A specific type of psychotherapy called cognitive behavioral therapy is another effective treatment, but it is not acceptable or accessible to most patients. <i>Conclusions:</i> Because social anxiety disorder is common, disabling, and treatable, primary care physicians should intensify their efforts to recognize it.",

      "abstract": "Depression has been conceptualized in two separate ways. Some define the phenomenon by a unique array of psychological abnormalities (a social and behavioural profile). On the other hand, depression can also be described as a quantifiable diseased state of the brain that may be cured using a biological therapy or pharmaceutical. Neither one of these definitions is incorrect; rather, they each describe different aspects of this form of mental illness. This duality inherent to understanding depression makes light of the sparse assemblage of literature that exists concerning such a socially, psychologically, and biologically complex phenomenon. Research has shown that the therapeutic benefits of exercise offer treatment for both the psychosocial and biological effects of depression. A more unified research perspective that looks for a coincidence of the social with the biological may allow for steps forward in understanding mental illness and disease.",

      "abstract": "Stress is a non-specific response of the body to stressor which is perceived as a threat to homeostasis. Each stressor causes stress and a specific action. Manifestation of the disease depends on the stressors specific action, individuals internal factors (age, gender, breed, genetic inheritance) and external factors (nutrition, housing conditions, ect.). There are two types of stress, positive (eustress) and negative stress (distress). The stress response is a useful physiological response to stress and consists of three phases: alarm reaction, resistance phase and exhaustion phase. It is a combination of behavioral responses, responses of the autonomic nervous system, neuroendocrine and immune response. The result of stress response can be return to homeostasis or development of pathological conditions. Adrenal hormones and the sympathetic nervous system regulate stress response. Stress can suppress, potentiate or not have any effect on the immune system depending on the type of stressor (psychic, physical, etc.), on the genetic properties of the individual, age, social hierarchy and whether the effects are acute or chronic. If stress is prolonged, the immune system is suppressed through the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal gland axis. The influence of the genetic heritage as the intrinsic factor is used to reduce the sensitivity of animals to stress which consequently, results in faster growth, better reproductive capability and a reduced incidence of diseases",

We performed the DST in 95 depressed inpatients to determine whether abnormal DST results were associated with individual symptoms of depression, latent behavioral \"factors,\" melancholia, or severity of depression. Initial insomnia, agitation, loss of sexual interest, and weight loss correlated significantly with nonsuppression. Using multiple regression, these four symptoms contributed independently to the variance in DST results and more closely associated with the DST results than did severity or the diagnosis of melancholia or endogenous subtype. Factor analysis failed to identify a factor that correlated with the DST results more significantly than did the individual symptoms. Our findings and a literature review suggest that DST nonsuppression associates with certain vegetative signs of depression but not with such symptoms as loss of interest or anhedonia nor with \"psychological\" symptoms such as guilt, worthlessness, helplessness, hopelessness, or suicidal ideation.",

This syndrome can be differentiated from depression and is recognizable in palliative care settings. It is associated with chronic medical illness, disability, bodily disfigurement, fear of loss of dignity, social isolation, and--where there is a subjective sense of incompetence--feelings of greater dependency on others or the perception of being a burden. Because of the sense of impotence or helplessness, those with the syndrome predictably progress to a desire to die or to commit suicide. A treatment approach is described which has the potential to alleviate the distress caused by this syndrome. Overall, demoralization syndrome has satisfactory face, descriptive, predictive, construct, and divergent validity, suggesting its utility as a diagnostic category in palliative care.",

Su identificacion puede ser dificil pues, en ocasiones, son expresiones exageradas o temporalmente inadecuadas de lo que se consideran reacciones normales y adaptativas: el miedo y la ansiedad. Los TA incluyen trastornos de inicio especifico en la infancia y adolescencia (ej. el trastorno de separacion) y otros cuya expresion sindromica es semejante a los TA del adulto (ej. trastorno de panico). Las manifestaciones de los TA son polimorfas y desconcertantes en ocasiones (quejas fisicas variadas, rechazo a ir al colegio, comportamientos de apego excesivo a los padres o a los principales cuidadores, resistencia a ir a dormir, hiperactividad y oposicionismo, etc.). La consulta del pediatra es el lugar idoneo para establecer un diagnostico de presuncion y proceder a la indagacion y posterior confirmacion de aquel. El pediatra debe estar familiarizado con el diagnostico, las herramientas basicas de tratamiento y los procedimientos de derivacion a salud mental. Las principales modalidades de tratamiento en la practica clinica son la terapia cognitivo-comportamental (TCC), las intervenciones informativas para familiares y el tratamiento farmacologico. Aunque se han producido importantes avances en el desarrollo y aplicacion de tratamientos para los TA, aun existe un numero limitado de estudios que prueben la eficacia de los mismos.",

From an epidemiological point of view, normality can be seen as the person being within the mid-range of a bell shaped curve of normal population distribution.Abnormality typically has a negative connotation or meaning like being anomalous, aberrant, deviant, odd, etc. A person has a mental disorder if the person suffers from a disturbance of thought, mood, volition, perception, orientation or memory that impairs judgment or behaviour to a significant extent. Psychiatric diagnosis usually refers to a statement specifying required symptoms and signs, their onset, duration, reaction to treatment and possible outcome. The main practical purposes of diagnosis in psychiatry are communication between mental health professionals and statistics of mental disorders. The reliability of psychiatric diagnoses is sometimes questionable and their validity can be dubious and arbitrary. Current work is underway by the International College of Person-centered Medicine (ICPCM) in collaboration with other major international organizations in order to overcome these limitations using a model of Person-Centred Integrative Diagnosis.",

Anyone can have such concerns for a time, but when it becomes a pervasive and enduring feature of one's way of dealing with the world, then this can constitute a paranoid personality disorder. Among mental health disciplines, there is consensual agreement reflected in the American Psychiatric Association's (APA) Diagnostic and Statistical Manual ( DSM; the gold standard for diagnosis of psychiatric disorders) that a personality disorder is an enduring, inflexible pattern of behavior across a broad range of functional contexts that produces either clinically significant personal distress or disruption and impairment in a person's social, occupational, or “other important areas of functioning” (APA, 2000). The prevalence of paranoid personality disorder (PPD) has been estimated to range from 0.5–2.5% in the general population, to be four times more prevalent in outpatient psychiatric settings, and to occur 10–30% in inpatient psychiatric facilities (APA, 2000). It is also thought to be more prevalent among males. Though it is a comparatively uncommon condition, its impact can be pervasive. Many would agree that dramatic examples in history of paranoid personalities include Joseph Stalin and perhaps Saddam Hussein.",

      "abstract": "Musculoskeletal diseases can heavily influence a patient’s life due to their inherit impact on ability/capability. Ability/Activity/capability is defined by The World Health Organization (WHO), as a multilayered concept that involves a dynamic interaction between body functions and structures, health conditions (disorders or disease), ability to participate, environmental factors and personal factors. Lack of capability due to a musculoskeletal injury or illness can result in reduced mobility, independence and quality of life. Patient Reported Outcome Measures (PROMs) are used to quantify symptom intensity and magnitude of activity intolerance (i.e. ability/capability/disability ). Considerable variation exists in both PROMS and the subjective experience of musculoskeletal diseases. A great portion of this variation is explained by mental health (psychological distress, cognitive bias [misconceptions] regarding pain) and social health, rather than objectifiable measures such as radiographs. While negative thoughts, misconceptions and a lacking support system can influence capability negatively, strong social support, days full of meaning, purpose and structure, a hopeful and curious mindset, and healthy thoughts/coping mechanisms, help people manage adversity and will help them adapt and build resiliency. Patients seeking care want to be helped, people with impairments want to be understood. For clinicians seeking to aid their patients on the road to recovery it is important to understand what factors drive the very questions patients came to visit them with. Patients are more than just their symptoms, objectified by the biomedical measures of illness, they are influenced by the entire paradigm of biomedical, psychological and social factors.",

      "abstract": "The term <bold>psychosis</bold> is often misunderstood. It can be considered an ‘umbrella-term’ for symptoms that suggest the individual is unable to distinguish between what is real and what isn’t, e.g. believing things that cannot be true (delusions) or seeing or hearing things that are not there (visual or auditory hallucinations). It is, however, the <bold>context</bold> and <bold>pattern</bold> of these symptoms that define the underlying diagnosis. This chapter presents the key features of psychotic disorders. It opens by discussing the misunderstanding, particularly in medical circles, of the term ‘psychosis’, providing a simplified explanation of the concepts, essential for all clinicians working with patients. It then describes key diagnostic features of schizophrenia, factors that influence outcome, and general principles on management. The text ends with a discussion of other, less common psychotic disorders, including schizo-affective disorder and specific delusional disorders. This chapter provides <bold>knowledge</bold> about: • Clinical features of schizophrenia. • How to manage schizophrenia. • Key facts about aetiology. • Factors that influence prognosis. <bold>Practical tips</bold> include: • How to identify ‘negative’ symptoms of schizophrenia. • Simplified representation of management strategies for schizophrenia.",

      "abstract": "How exactly do mental disorders affect one’s agency? How might therapeutic interventions help patients regain or improve their autonomy? Do only some disorders excuse morally inappropriate behavior, such as theft or child neglect? Or is there nothing about having a disorder, as such, that affects whether we ought to praise or blame someone for their moral success or failure? Our volume gathers together empirically informed philosophers who are well equipped to tackle such questions. Contributors specialize in free will, agency, and responsibility, but they are informed by current scientific and clinical approaches to a wide range of psychopathologies, including autism, addiction, Tourette syndrome, personality disorders, depression, dementia, phobias, schizophrenia, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. These conditions exhibit a diverse array of symptoms that can contribute quite differently to being blameworthy or praiseworthy.",

      "abstract": "The concept of depression includes clinical conditions whose main disorder concerns mood or affect. Traditionally, this group includes depressive disorders, mania and submaniacal states, and anxiety disorders. A light form of depression is often unrecognized. The person feels chronic fatigue, weariness and discouragement to life. Depression caused by reactive factors is manifested by a smaller number of psychosomatic symptoms. According to the WHO (World Health Organization) report, by 2020 depression may become the second largest health risk after cardiovascular disease. The clinical picture of depression is dominated primarily by the depressed mood, which is felt by the patient as a state of gloom, resignation, and sadness. The patient is unable to experience joy, happiness and satisfaction. Anhedonia appears, or inability to feel any pleasures. A separate problem is the recognition of depression in the elderly age, when symptoms characteristic to depression are very often considered a normal manifestation of the body aging or as an inherent element of the somatic disease. Currently, it is estimated that as many as 40% of cases of depression in people over 65 remain undiagnosed.",

      "title": "Ataxia and Disequilibrium",
      "abstract": "Ataxia and disequilibrium are clinical symptoms expressing basic conditions of body balance. The author proposed to give them clear definitions concerning the human posture. Ataxia would mean the failure in maintaining the posture during more complicated movement, while disequilibrium implys the disturbed body balance in static posture while standing or sitting. Fukuda referred the difference between disequilibrium and ataxia to the postural change, static to active, during vestibular stimulation.There are many complaints and symptoms relating to ataxia and disequilibrium. Several points in this field were raised and discussed for the future clinical purpose.1. An abnormal sensation called “Memai” in Japanese arises with ataxia or disequilibrium. It may be classified into three categories. The first category “vertigo” is a moving sensation, which is typically accompanied with vestibular dysfunction. The second, dizziness or giddiness, is a kind of unsteadiness such as staggering, blurred vision or weakness at the knees. The third contains inconstant symptoms, for example diplopia, malaise, feebleness, nausea and fainting. Those symptoms belong to a new concept of “Memai” and seem to be directly related to ataxia.2. The characteristics of labyrinthine disequilibrium were 1) laterality or past pointing, 2) easy to be compensated after onset of lesion, 3) accompanying a rotatory horizontal nystagmus, 4) no sensory disorder and 5) measurable by neurootological tests.3. Causes of ataxia were enumerated and several new diagnostic techniques were mentioned. The measurements of optokinetic nystagmus potential and correlation between head movement and movement of the center of gravity seem to be useful diagnostic tools for vertiginous and ataxic patients.",

In addition, 91% experienced “cravings'and 87% felt “restless and irritable'when attempting to cut down or stop gambling. Contrary to expectations, none of the symptoms correlated with gender, type of gambling, extent of alcohol or drug use while gambling, or self‐described alcoholism or drug addiction. Symptoms did correlate with number of hours spent gambling, severity of the problem as measured by proposed DSM‐IV criteria, and presence of dissociation.",

The latter refers to delay in cognitive development such that performance against age‐related norms appears to drop. The former, real deterioration can occur due to concomitant degenerative neurological disease of which epilepsy is also a symptom, or it may happen as a consequence of one or more of a number of other factors. These include (1) direct effects of seizures and abnormal electroencephalogram activity on brain function, (2) traumatic brain injury secondary to seizures, including status epilepticus, (3) the influence of antiepileptic therapy, both drugs and surgery, on cognitive function, (4) psychosocial sequelae of diagnosis. Some epilepsy syndromes include intellectual deterioration as a frequent feature, with various causes. Developmental factors may also play a part. Cognitive functioning may be impaired by the presence of an epileptogenic lesion, and also in different ways and at different times by other brain areas involved with partial seizures, including irritative and functional deficit zones. Abnormal activity in these areas at critical periods in development may interact and disrupt pathways necessary for maturation of frontal lobe and limbic system functioning, leading to long‐term neurological deficits. Increased understanding of the mechanisms by which this may happen raises intriguing possibilities for prevention and remediation.",

      "abstract": "Collusion is a mostly unconscious phenomenon occurring in the therapeutic relationship, which can be commonly identified in psychiatry but more generally in medicine. Collusion is especially present in circumstances in which the effects of disease and its treatments have a heavy impact on patients and caregivers, and where the stakes are existential. Collusion is triggered by unresolved psychological problems, for example, loss, intimacy or control, which are shared by the patient and the clinician. Collusion, if unrecognized, can seriously hamper the clinician-patient relationship and the care of the patient.La collusion est un phénomène inconscient survenant dans la relation thérapeutique, observable en psychiatrie, mais aussi en médecine. Elle se manifeste surtout dans les domaines où les effets de la maladie et des traitements pèsent lourdement sur les patients et les cliniciens et où les enjeux sont existentiels. L’origine d’une collusion se situe dans des problèmes psychologiques non résolus, en lien avec des thématiques comme la perte, l’intimité ou le contrôle, qui sont partagés par le clinicien et son patient. La collusion, si elle n’est pas reconnue, peut sérieusement entraver la relation clinique et avoir des conséquences négatives sur la prise en charge.",

In addition to this “transversal” presence of the photosensitive trait across various epilepsy types and diseases, some syndromes in which all, or almost all, seizures are induced by photic stimuli seem to have sufficient specificity and may be considered as syndromes of pure reflex photosensitive epilepsy. Here we review the clinical characteristic of the different types of photic‐induced seizures and the main epileptic syndromes that are characterized by visual sensitivity either as the sole manifestation or as an accessory feature.",

The confused elder is more often anxious, very disoriented, with poor onirism, disturbed sleep, ideas of persecution and behavior disorders. Even if a multiple causality is usual, initiating circumstances come principally from an affective source. There is rupture with customary situation of the elder which hold a plurality of risk factors. These confusional disorders increase with aging and cognitive impairment. Late life delusional subject has also persecutory ideation without dissociation but with emotional reactions and affective changes. Different factors promote birth of late life delusion (personality features, isolation, sensory defect...). On psychodynamic way, these two disorders are issued from a breakdown followed by a more or less durable appointment. Confusion agrees with a somatic and psychic regression (consciousness disorganization). This is an elder's attempt to prevent anxiety. Late life delusion lays on denial and projective mecanisms. It is jointed with prejudice and intrusion (with regard to ownership, health and reputation). This is an elder's attempt to establish defences against depression. In the two situations, treatment consists on a biological regulation associated with psychodynamic approach taking elder personality, actual condition and recent life events into account.",

      "abstract": "Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. In these patients, cognitive, mood, and emotional disturbances are commonly observed, including depression, anxiety, mania, psychosis, and anger/aggression. The debilitating effect of TBI extends years after the initial injury and impairs the recovery process and patients' quality of life. Compared to other major neurological diseases such as stroke or degenerative diseases, TBI occurs relatively young. Therefore, patients have to endure the sequelae for a more extended period. Therefore, proper diagnosis and treatment of the cognitive–emotional symptoms are essential. Studies have been made to seek the pathogenesis of the cognitive and neuropsychiatric symptoms. Unfortunately, these emotional disturbances are not apparent and often unnoticed by busy clinicians. Their phenomenology, predicting factors, and pathophysiology have been underrecognized and understudied. In addition, well-designed clinical trials regarding these symptoms are rare. It has been suggested that the congitive and emotional sequelae are related to the \"remote\" effect of the initial brain injury rather than the initial pathology itself. This review will describe some of the most common or relevant poststroke mood and emotional disturbances. The phenomenology, factors or predictors, and relevant lesion locations will be described, and pharmacological treatment of these emotional disturbances will be discussed based on presumable pathophysiological mechanisms.",

      "title": "Orthorexia nervosa – a different lifestyle or a specific eating disorder?",
      "abstract": "Orthorexia nervosa (ON) is considered an obsession with healthy eating, a phenomenon that includes excessive dietary restrictions, which in turn can lead to metabolic dysfunctions. Although the nosological status of this pathology is currently insufficiently determined, ON attracts the interest of mental health specialists due to the possible harmful psychological and biological consequences, its high prevalence in the general population and the difficulty of adequate therapeutic management (low level of insight and lack of evidence-based treatments). Orthorexia nervosa should be distinguished from other mental disorders with which it has a high degree of clinical overlap (obsessive-compulsive disorder, anorexia nervosa, restrictive/avoidant eating disorder etc.), but also from “healthy orthorexia” (this being considered part of a lifestyle focused on eliminating foods labeled as “impure”, “toxic” or “artificial”). The analysis of risk factors for ON highlights the importance of several obsessive-compulsive personality traits (perfectionism, rigidity, self-control), executive dysfunctions, internalization of social models (thinness or perfect health, for example), media pressure, parental and social group influences, belonging to certain professional categories (nutritionists, medical students, athletes) or practicing yoga. Several psychometric instruments for measuring the severity of ON have been developed over the last two decades, but they should be used with caution because not all of them have well-established validity. Also, several sets of diagnostic criteria have been proposed in order to identify the clinical features of orthorexia nervosa and to differentiate these patients from those diagnosed with anorexia nervosa, obsessive-compulsive disorder, somatoform disorders or nonpathological orthorexic behaviors. Finally, some therapeutic suggestions are presented, mainly psychotherapies, but it should be mentioned that they are based on case studies or on the extrapolation of data from trials dedicated to pathologies considered to be related to orthorexia nervosa. In conclusion, because ON is a nosological entity that has only recently been cornered, there is an urgent need to explore psychometric tools with higher specificity and to find more widely accepted diagnostic criteria. Also, no clear, evidence-based therapeutic recommendations could yet be formulated, because no clinical trial focused on the effectiveness of therapeutic interventions in patients with orthorexia nervosa has been conducted.",

      "title": "CONSISTENT PATTERNS IN SECONDARY HEALTH EFFECTS OF DISASTERS",
      "abstract": "Most disasters produce a consistent pattern of death and injury. Primary causes are directly attributable to the event itself and thus vary by event type, e.g., drowning in tropical storms and floods, direct trauma in earthquakes and tornados. Secondary causes vary less by event type as they are driven by common effects: loss of electrical power and shelter, transportation disruption, loss of healthcare access, attempted repair/restoration, and other disruption of daily routine. Primary and particularly secondary causes may be difficult to attribute, typically leading to undercounting. Secondary causes of death, illness, and injury can be divided into four broad categories: pre-existing medical conditions, environmental degradation or magnified exposure, secondary trauma, and psychological effects. Pre-existing medical conditions include common non-communicable diseases that are typically medication-controlled (e.g., cardiorespiratory ailments, diabetes, psychological disorders), rely on recurring procedures (e.g., hemodialysis for end-stage renal disease), or a combination; some conditions require regular oxygen administration, powered life-support equipment, or other adjuncts. The link among all is the dependence on maintenance care, the disruption of which turns a chronic, relatively stable condition into an acute one at the worst possible time. Environmental causes include unmediated exposure to ambient environment, degraded air and water quality (including otherwise-controlled infectious diseases), and introduced toxicants (most commonly carbon monoxide). Secondary trauma includes motor-vehicle collisions, electrocution, and other injuries, particularly those related to repair and short-term recovery. Psychological causes include response to the primary event beyond effects of pre-existing conditions: disruption to lifelines and routine and extended effects (e.g., prolonged outages, seismic aftershocks, personal loss). Most secondary health effects of disasters are predictable and can be prevented or at least lessened by the combination of awareness and deliberate action by governments, institutions, support services, and individuals. In actual practice, secondary effects recur in most events and see limited preventive measures.",

Patients are resistant to psychiatric referrals but typically go from one doctor to another. It is important to make sure that the patient does not have an organic skin disorder and the delusion is not secondary to another mental or physical illness. DP is considered a delusional disorder, somatic subtype, and treated with antipsychotic medication, with poor compliance and mixed outcomes. DP may also be understood as a chronic somatoform disorder (monosymptomatic hypochondriasis), in which some underlying emotional disturbance is expressed via physical symptoms. Treatment of the latter sometimes involves antiparasitic medication, stress reduction, and self-help techniques, as well as a family assessment.",

These include impaired attention and concentration (often due to preoccupation with morbid or worrying thoughts); anxiety, which usually accompanies depression; irritability; agitation or retardation; fatigue after sleepless nights; and weakness due to insufficient food intake. In addition, depressed patients may take risks with little regard to the consequences, make suicidal gestures or attempts that go wrong, and take alcohol or other substances that impair functioning to relieve distress. In keeping with these considerations are the reductions in performance in tests of cognitive and psychomotor function in depressed patients.1\n\nIf depression causes or contributes to accidents in these ways then therisk of accidents might be expected to fall as the disorder improves in response to treatment with antidepressant drugs (or other treatment). On the other hand, the unwanted effects of antidepressants may adversely affect cognitive and psychomotor function (especially in those with pre-existing cerebral impairment), thereby increasing the risk of accidents. This is particularly the case in patients who do not respond to treatment and thus are impaired by both the depression and the drug.

Herein this term is redefined, and an additional term, parahallucinations, is introduced. Hallucinations are defined as sensory perceptions that have the compelling sense of reality of true perceptions but that occur without external stimulation of the relevant sensory organ and are experienced as following the sensory path, that is, can be localized in three-dimensional space outside the body. Pseudohallucinations are defined as hallucinatory phenomena that do not follow the sensory path and are experienced predominantly by psychiatrically ill subjects. Parahallucinations are defined as hallucinatory phenomena that occur due to an injury or abnormality to the peripheral nervous system. Insight into the reality of these experiences-the realization that they are not real-is not felt to be important in their phenomenology.Utilization of this classification system during clinical investigations will yield greater insight into the pathophysiology, course, treatment, and prognosis of psychiatric and neurologic disorders.",

Mostly, several symptoms together are forming a multiple somatoform syndrome. As well known from other psychogenic disorders, spontaneous long-term course of somatoform symptoms is variable due to the psychic co-morbidity (in particular anxiety and depression) and a strong tendency to symptomatic shift. The long-term course of total impairment by additional psychogenic symptoms is rather bad in somatoform disorders. Clinically significant personality traits and traumatic influences during early childhood development are correlated with somatoform disorders. Within the traditional role patterns of the relation between physician and patient, somatoform complaints often communicate or indicate a psychodynamic conflict.

      "title": "\"Overuse\"--an overused term?",
      "abstract": "Use of the term overuse injury should be avoided until there is definite proof of the cause of the injury\n\nInjuries are often categorised as being due to trauma or overuse. When no moment of trauma is recalled, then an assumption is made that an injury is the result of overuse. In this article, I will argue that there is insufficient evidence to support this extensive use of the term “overuse” and that there are problems associated with using it. Thus, we should avoid the term, which implies the cause of the injury, until we have proof of the cause.\n\nOveruse injury is now categorised in medical subject headings as “cumulative trauma disorder (CTD)”. This is a subcategory of sprains and strains. CTD is defined as a “Harmful and painful condition caused by overuse or overexertion of some part of the musculoskeletal system, often resulting from work-related physical activities. It is characterized by inflammation, pain, or dysfunction of the involved joints, bones, ligaments, and nerves.” The term includes overuse injury, overuse syndrome, repetition strain injury, repetitive strain injury, and repetitive motion disorders. As CTD is defined as being caused by overuse, this definition fails to clarify the meaning of overuse injury. Overuse probably implies there is an amount of use that is excessive, and if use reaches or exceeds that amount then injuries arise.\n\nConsider now this term as used in sports medicine. Traumas, such as a fractured tibia caused by a tackle in soccer, are likely to be most common among players who play or train most. Yet, overuse is not said to be the cause of this injury. Injuries arising from obvious trauma are excluded from the category of overuse injuries. Such a trauma may be witnessed or may be felt as an acute moment of injury. An …",

      "abstract": "Spiritual pain/suffering is commonly experienced by persons with life-limiting illness and their families. Physical pain itself can be exacerbated by non-physical causes such as fear, anxiety, grief, unresolved guilt, depression and unmet spiritual meets. Likewise, the inability to manage physical pain well can be due to emotional and spiritual needs. This is why a holistic, interdisciplinary assessment of pain and suffering is required for each patient and family. The mind, body and spirit are understood in relationship to each other and, in those cases, in relationship to a deity or deities are important to understand. Cultural interpretations of pain and suffering may conflict with the goals of palliative care. Understanding the spiritual framework of the patient and family can help to assure that the physical and spiritual suffering of the patient can be eliminated to provide a peaceful death. Spiritual practices may help in the management of physical pain.",

      "title": "Social Anxiety Disorder (Social Phobia)",
      "abstract": "Social anxiety disorder (SAD) is conceptualized as an excessive and/or unreasonable fear of situations in which the person’s behavior or appearance might be scrutinized and evaluated. This fear is a consequence of the person’s expectation to be judged negatively, which might lead to embarrassment or humiliation. Typical examples of feared and usually avoided social situations are giving a talk in public, performing other tasks in front of others, and interacting with people in general. Although the existence of SAD as a psychopathological entity has been known for at least 100 years, it was only relatively recently, with the publication of DSM-III in 1980, that SAD (or social phobia) acquired the status of an ‘‘official’’ psychiatric diagnosis. The term social anxiety disorder has been increasingly used instead of social phobia, because it is felt that the use of the former term conveys more strongly the pervasiveness and impairment associated with the condition and that this term will promote better recognition of the disorder and contribute to better differentiation from specific phobia (Liebowitz et al., 2000). Like generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder is common and controversial. Unlike generalized anxiety disorder, which is described in different ways by different diagnostic criteria and different researchers and clinicians, SAD does not suffer from a ‘‘description problem.’’ It is not particularly difficult to recognize features of SAD; what may be difficult is making sense of these features. Main issues associated with SAD are listed below…. 1. Where are the boundaries of SAD? How well is SAD distinguished from ‘‘normal’’ social anxiety and shyness on one hand, and from severe psychopathology on the other? 2. Is there a danger of ‘‘pathologizing’’ intense social anxiety by labeling it a psychiatric disorder? How can the distress and suffering of people with high levels of social anxiety be acknowledged if they are not given the corresponding diagnostic label? 3. Is SAD a bona fide mental disorder? 4. Can the subtyping scheme (nongeneralized vs. generalized SAD) be supported? 5. Is there a spectrum of social anxiety disorders?",

      "title": "NEUROPSYCHIATRIC ASPECTS OF HIV INFECTION",
      "abstract": "A consultation on the neuropsychiatric aspects of HIV-1 infection was held at the World Health Organization (WHO) headquarters January 11-13, 1990. Of topics discussed, participants concluded that a group of conditions characterized by cognitive and motor impairment can be described. New terminology was suggested accordingly. Participants found that otherwise health HIV-1 seropositive patients were no more likely than HIV-1 seronegative patients to manifest clinically significant cognitive impairment. The serological screening of asymptomatic patients for HIV-1 in attempts to protect public safety was therefore deemed unnecessary. Hallucinations and delusions being not infrequent in AIDS and ARC patients, they may be indicative of cognitive impairment or later accompanied by symptoms pointing to diagnosis of delirium or dementia. Acute psychotic disorders outside of evidence of cognitive impairment may result as anomalies described within the text. Depressive syndrome may result outside of severe depressive episode or major depression due to recent diagnosis as HIV-1 positive and/or as the first stage of HIV-1 dementia. DIstinguishing between ARC and the above-mentioned states as the cause of this syndrome may be difficult. Consultation participants cited stress associated with HIV-1 infection or disease to be conditioned by several factors. Finally, neuropsychiatric disorders due to HIV-1 opportunistic processes were discussed. Country-level recommendations included preparing health workers for a wide range of neuropsychiatric conditions in the HIV-1 positive patient, and notifying then that otherwise healthy HIV-1 positive patients may not show clinically significant signs of cognitive impairment. Recommendations followed in urging health services to prepare for a large burden of neuropsychiatric illness in AIDS and ARC patients; governments should support services and train health workers accordingly. Pre- and post-serological testing counseling was stressed, with facility for and understanding of the special needs of HIV-1 positive patients' families and involved health staff. Research on the neurological and mental health needs of patients should be given high priority with attention given to the immediate policy and care implications. Final qualification of the difficulty involved in generalizing research findings to apply across sociocultural and geographical contexts was provided with mention in the text of a WHO multicenter study addressing this concern in its pilot phase at the time of publication. Neurological tests were designed for use in this study to be culturally nonspecific.",

The patient's capacity to unfold appears to increase almost as a result of the psychiatrist's control over his own emotions. The author, who is here referring to Epinal's image of the infallible psychiatrist, believes that the psychiatrist, in moments of privacy can observe the effects of his own emotional stress and how they often relate to his unresolved neurotic problems. It is in his practice, nevertheless, that the psychiatrist can privilege and give meaning to his own emotional stress in order to gain deeper insight in his mode of relating to his patient. Such additional awarness should then permit a more careful and satisfying analysis of what is experienced in a two person or group relationship. The acknowledgment of physical state resulting from emotional stress precedes an insight which always corresponds to a signifier leading to a signified which is then to be decoded.",

      "title": "PROTOCOL: Personal assistance for children and adolescents (0‐18) with both physical and intellectual impairments",
      "abstract": "The International Classification of Impairments, Activities, and Participation (ICIDH-2) refers to impairment as loss or abnormalities at the level of body, body part or organ. People may have difficulty performing particular activities as a result of impairments, and a person's participation in education, social life, work, and other areas may be limited as a result of interactions among impairments, activities, and environment (WHO 2003). Though the ICIDH-2 refers to adults, except with reference to studies using specific definitions of other terms, this review follows the classification in ICIDH-2, which does not include the terms disability or handicap. This review will include children and adolescents with both physical impairments and intellectual impairments, which include learning impairments (e.g., Down's syndrome, global developmental delay, or pervasive developmental disorder), learning disability (also called ‘intellectual disability’ or ‘mental retardation’) and acquired brain injuries. Intellectual impairments and physical impairments affect activities and participation differently. Therefore, young people with intellectual impairments only or physical impairments only will be considered in other Cochrane and Campbell reviews, as will working-age adults and older adults. Around the world, about six hundred million people have impairments (UN 1990), most of whom live in the developing world. Previous reviews have identified inconsistencies in the measurement of impairments and activity limitations (UN 1990) and cross-national estimates of impairments and activity limitations in childhood and adolescence are even more variable than national estimates. The prevalence of intellectual impairments is difficult to quantify due to problems in diagnosis and classification. Most children and adolescents with intellectual impairments have mild to moderate impairments. Relatively few have ‘profound’ impairments (DSM-IV R). Over five million (10.6%) American children and adolescents experience a limitation in learning ability; respectively, about 4.0% and 3.2% have moderate and severe limitations (Hogan 1997). Gross rates of impairments in the United States (U.S.) have increased substantially in recent decades as a result of an aging population that is living longer and, more recently, as a result of higher reported levels of impairments among children and young adults (Kaye 1996). Recent increases in the prevalence of impairments among children and adolescents may be a result of changes in medical care. For example, very low birthweight babies are more likely than ever to survive (Alberman 1991; Allen 1993; Doyle 1995). These children are at high risk of both physical impairments and intellectual impairments (Middle 1996; Williamson 1983; Wilson-Costello 2005). Over six million (12.3%) American children and adolescents experience some type of functional limitation (as defined by (Hogan 1997)). Of the four million American children and adolescents who experience one serious functional limitation, about half experience one or more other functional limitations. About one million American children and adolescents experience serious limitations in two or more areas (Hogan 1997). Impairments are more prevalent in boys than in girls (Newacheck 2004) and more prevalent in low-income families than in high-income families (Newacheck 2004; UN 1990). Of non-institutionalised children and adolescents aged 5-17, 1.3% experience limitations in mobility and about .2% experience a moderate or severe limitation in mobility. Respectively, .9% and .5% experience limitations in self care; 5.5% and 1.2% experience limitations in communication (Hogan 1997). About 3.2% of American children attend special schools or classes (Wenger 1995). As far as possible, this review uses internationally accepted definitions of impairments and refers to impacts that are likely to occur across cultures. However, many epidemiological studies have been conducted in the United States and Western Europe. Readers should consider the applicability of epidemiological data to other settings. A discourse of disability ethics has evolved to discuss concepts of independence, defined not as people with disabilities “doing everything” for themselves, but as having maximum control over how help is provided (Morris 2001). Proponents of the social model of disability regard activity restrictions as caused by societal and structural barriers and stress the need for their removal (Abberley 1987; Oliver 1990). In addition to structural and environmental changes (e.g., making buildings accessible), the social model emphasises changes in public attitudes towards impairments to encourage increased participation and improved self-esteem. Participation in age-appropriate activities may be limited for children and adolescents with impairments when physical, social and attitudinal environments restrict their involvement (Hammal 2004; Mihaylov 2004). Impairments in children are related to societal limitation, and different types of impairments contribute uniquely to societal limitations (Hogan et al., 1997). Impairments may affect the quality of life, health, development, and family functioning of children and adolescents (Lavigne 1993; Neely-Barnes 2004; Pit-Ten 2002; Varni 2005). Limited participation in activities may have negative impacts on the mental and physical functioning of children and adolescents and may lead to emotional and behavioural problems. Children and adolescents with intellectual and physical impairments are at increased risk for mental health problems; however, most children and adolescents who might benefit from psychological services do not receive them (Witt 2001). Comorbid problems can also impact carers. For example, challenging behaviour often occurs in the context of learning impairments and mental health problems (Moss 2000). Parents and siblings of children with impairments are at risk for psychological problems (Rossiter 2001; Sharpe 2002; Thyen 1998). Total healthcare costs for children and adolescents with impairments may be four times greater than for those without impairments (Newacheck 2004). However, children and adolescents with impairments require varying degrees of support. For example, in one large study, ‘those in the upper decile of the expenditure distribution accounted for 65% of all charges’. Costs born by families of children and adolescents with the most severe impairments were similarly high; out-of-pocket healthcare expenses (i.e. those not reimbursed by insurance or a health service) for the top 10% of the distribution accounted for 85% of all out of pocket expenses (Newacheck 2004). All children and adolescents require some level of care. However, children and adolescents with extensive impairments may require many hours of assistance every day in addition to the normal assistance required by their peers. Consequently, family members (notably mothers) may withdraw from work and social life. Caring for a child with severe physical impairments can put great financial and emotional stress on parents and families (Neely-Barnes 2004; Witt 2001). In the U.S., parents of children with impairments are less likely to have attended college and more likely to be single and poor (Hogan 1997). The stress of caring for children with impairments may have negative impacts on parents, but some problems associated with impairments may increase the risk of impairment. For example, poor children are less likely than their peers to receive preventive healthcare (Newacheck 1988) and depressed mothers are less likely than other mothers to use injury prevention strategies like car seats and electrical plug covers (McLennan 2000). Furthermore, some evidence suggests that the development of intellectual impairments is affected by sociodemographic factors (Resnick 1998). Low birthweight black babies are more likely than white babies to survive (Morse 2006), which might affect the relative prevalence of impairments in different racial groups; however, ‘controlling for socioeconomic differences and family structure, black children are no more at risk of functional limitation than whites’ (Hogan 1997). Since the causes and consequences of impairments are often difficult to disentangle, retrospective studies are difficult to interpret. Increased participation (inclusion in activities of daily life) may have positive effects on the social functioning, development, mental and physical health of children and adolescents. There are many ways to increase participation by children and adolescents with impairments. For example, school schedules may be designed such that children and adolescents with impairments can engage in age-appropriate activities with their peers. Clinicians and policymakers can work together to influence policy, discourse, and planning and to apply the social model in support of children and their families (Colver 2005). However, broad interventions may not be sufficient to meet all needs. People with severe impairments require interventions tailored to their unique impairments, lifestyles, living arrangements, etc. Assistive devices, skills training, physical therapy, education, and human support help young people control their lives appropriately and engage in normal activities. Personal assistance is support given to children and adolescents with impairments living in normal housing (e.g., family homes or school accommodation) to enable them to participate in mainstream activities in various settings. Personal assistance is directed by users and their representatives and is designed to promote independence and to reduce strain on families. Assistants might help with bathing, dressing, moving around during the day, shopping, etc. Personal assistance is provided by non-professionals; it may aim to improve mental and physical health, but it differs from services by professional healthcare providers (e.g., nurses) with whom users have very different relationships. Personal assistance may be purchased by governments, insurance providers, or individuals. It may be provided directly or indirectly through payments or vouchers. Personal assistance differs from voluntary or charitable services over which users do not have the same control. It also differs from respite care, which is temporary and aims to help carers rather than children and adolescents with impairments. Personal assistance is designed for people whose participation in many normal activities would be impossible without help. While user needs should be assessed periodically, personal assistance is designed for people with permanent impairments. For example, the needs of a person with a recently acquired impairment might be different from the needs of a person who has had an impairment from birth and the needs of both might change; personal assistance would be designed to meet their unique needs and would develop with them. In this way, it differs from rehabilitative services and from services provided for fixed periods of time. Receipt of personal assistance is dependent on the amount of help required by an individual. For example, personal assistance in Nordic countries is generally provided to people requiring at least 20 hours of help per week, though most users have severe impairments and both require and receive substantially more assistance. Some form of personal assistance is now available (often by statutory right) in all Nordic countries, most Western European countries, Australia, parts of Asia, Canada, and the U.S. Services in different countries for different users are called by different names, which often relate to legislative categories rather than types of interventions. Eligibility varies around the world. For example, countries that see services for adults as a ‘right’ may not be able or willing to provide comprehensive services for children and older adults. Services for people of different ages may be provided through different mechanisms. Rules about who may be a personal assistant also vary. For example, some countries allow users to employ family members (e.g., parents) while others do not. Differences in eligibility affect the number and types of people who receive support and these differences affect the amount and types of support individuals and their families receive. That is, the relative number of people receiving personal assistance and their characteristics vary across countries, insurance schemes, etc. Advocates of personal assistance argue that personal assistants should be chosen, trained and managed by users or their representatives. However, the organisation of services and the degree of user control varies around the world and may be affected by the administration of payments, employment laws, etc. Compared to other interventions, personal assistance may have unique benefits and potential drawbacks. Assistants may help children achieve more, but having a personal assistant could be stigmatising. Parents of children with impairments might be relieved to have assistants help care for their children, but assistants might interfere with family life and with users’ need for privacy, or with parents’ own needs to see themselves as adequate carers for their children. Compared to other ways of compensating for particular activity limitations, personal assistance may create unnecessary dependencies for some people. Even if personal assistance is clearly preferred over other services by working adults with physical impairments, groups that are underrepresented in the public discourse about the rights of people with impairments (e.g., children, people with intellectual impairments, and people in rural areas) may prefer other services, particularly since these groups may be more susceptible to abuse and less able to manage employees. Direct payments for personal assistance may not be ideal for children and families who have difficulty finding an assistant, administering services, negotiating or giving instructions (Pijl 2000). While many personal assistants are managed by users or their representatives, the nature of personal assistance can make it difficult to separate the roles that individuals play in supporting people with impairments. For example, Askheim identified one mother of a child with intellectual impairments in Norway who acted both as the manager of her child's payments and as a full-time personal assistant (Askheim 2003). Policies that permit different care arrangements may have substantially different impacts. As the personal assistance movement gained strength, Ratzka noted that ‘there has been surprisingly little in the way of policy evaluation. The work that has been done in this area is restricted to gathering descriptive statistics on number of hours provided by one type of service, number of consumers, staff, and expenditures’ (Ratzka 1986). Some research now suggests that personal assistance may meet otherwise unmet needs of people with impairments. Shortly after its introduction, a survey of direct payment recipients in the UK found that 40% had a need for additional hours of personal service while 80% of people receiving other services had a similar need (Zarb 1994). However, traditional reviews have failed to locate many evaluation studies and have not offered a definitive account of international research on personal assistance. A recent report by the Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare (Socialstyrelsen) highlighted the need for a sensitive and exhaustive search for trials and a systematic synthesis of existing studies (Socialstyrelsen 2005). To assess the effectiveness of personal assistance for children and adolescents (0-18) with both physical and intellectual impairments, and the impacts of personal assistance on families and carers, compared to other interventions. Randomised controlled trials, quasi-randomised controlled trials and nonrandomised controlled studies of personal assistance compared to other forms of support or to ‘no-intervention’ (which may include unpaid care) in which participants were prospectively assigned to study groups and in which control group outcomes were measured concurrently with intervention group outcomes. Children and adolescents (0-18) living in the community who require assistance to perform tasks of daily living (bathing, eating, getting around, etc.) and participate in normal activities due to permanent physical and intellectual impairments. With the exception of young people living in student accommodation (e.g. residential schools), young people living outside their own homes (e.g., in private or public institutions for people with impairments) will be excluded. Children and adolescents with physical impairments only and intellectual impairments only will be excluded because these impairments affect activities and participation differently. Personal assistance is paid individualised human support that is designed to promote participation of people with permanent impairments. In consultation with experts and the reference group, the reviewers sought to determine what minimal amount of assistance would could be offered and still follow the personal assistance model for this population. For inclusion in this review, personal assistance must have been delivered for at least 20 hours per week. Comparisons might include, either singly or in combination, family care, institutionalisation, on-demand services, escort services, and other alternatives to personal assistance. ‘No-treatment’ and ‘waiting list’ groups will be included even if other services received are no described. These will be treated as separate comparisons. Studies examining different forms of personal assistance (e.g., assistance organised by users compared to assistance organised by others) will be included in the review, though these comparisons will be discussed separately as the outcomes from such studies would not indicate the effectiveness of personal assistance relative to other interventions. Primary outcomes will include: 1) Global quality of life, both (a) generic measures (e.g., the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory; Varni 2005) and (b) specific measures designed for people with particular impairments. Though well-validated measures for the general population will be considered, a review of global health measures found that ‘very few measures have been validated specifically for cognitively impaired respondents’ (Riemsma 2001) or for people with both physical and intellectual impairments. 2) User satisfaction. Direct reports will be preferred, though proxies might be used if users are unable to communicate. 3) Participation, including social activities, ability to participate in spontaneous activities, time outside the home, and mobility. Secondary outcomes will include: 1) Unmet needs, particularly the inability to perform activities of daily living. 2) Developmental outcomes, including cognitive milestones, acquisition of skills, and school attendance. 3) Health outcomes, including direct measures of muscle strength, disease, injuries, abuse or pain and indirect measures such as nutrition, emergency room visits or need for hospitalisation or institutionalisation. 4) Psychiatric outcomes, including self-harm, pica (eating non-food substances), and outwardly directed challenging behaviour. Measures might include items from the externalising scale of the Behavior Problem Inventory (Sturmey 1993). 5) Impact on others, including parental (maternal) employment, satisfaction, and quality of family life. For example, measures might include the Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36; (Ware 1992) or General Health Questionnaire (GHQ; (Counsell 1994). 6) Direct and indirect costs, both immediate and long-term. To account for normal development and the changing impacts of impairments, outcomes will be grouped by length of follow-up (e.g., 1-3 years, 4-6 years, 6+ years). The organisation of services is often a complicated task and new users or their representatives must train personal assistants. Outcomes measured during the first year of receiving personal assistance will be considered apart from outcomes measured after one or more years to account for this adjustment period, which may not be representative of personal assistance as a whole. As we anticipate many relevant documents will be unpublished, a three-part search strategy will be undertaken in order to maximise chances of capturing all relevant literature. Databases will be searched for published and unpublished studies. All electronic searches will be limited to research reported since 1980 because scoping for this project, including a review of relevant laws and policy documents and contacts with international experts, found that widespread personal assistance programmes began in the mid 1990s. Experts have noted that personal assistance was available in some form before the introduction of programmes in the 1990s, but they and the reviewers believe it is extremely unlikely that any relevant trials were conducted before 1980. No language restrictions will be imposed on any results from any search attempts, although most databases will be searched in English. Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACs) will be searched using Spanish and Portuguese terms and Scandinavian databases will be searched in appropriate languages. No filters based on methodology will be applied because test searches indicated that such filters might eliminate relevant studies. The authors worked with a reference group of users, clinicians, policymakers, and analysts (Jackson 2005) to develop this protocol and search strategy. The group recommended a highly sensitive search (one that will likely to capture all relevant reports) rather than a more specific one (a search that would identify fewer irrelevant papers). The following databases will be searched electronically: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) MEDLINE CINAHL (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature) EMBASE LILACs (Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature) ASSIA (Applied Social Science Index & Abstracts) BIDS (International Bibliography of the Social Sciences [IBSS] on Bath Information and Data Services [BIDS]) C2-SPECTR (The Campbell Collaboration's Social, Psychological, Educational and Criminological Trials Register) Dissertations Abstracts A (Dissertation Abstracts International A: The Humanities and Social Sciences) EconLit ERIC (Educational Resources Information Center) PsycINFO Sociological Abstracts SIGLE search (System for Information on Grey Literature in Europe) Artikelsök DIVA Handicat Hicat LIBRIS LIBRIS Uppsök SveMed+ Danbib Medline will be searched using the following terms: 1 Home Care Services/ 2 Activities of Daily Living/ 3 Personal Health Services/ 4 (personal adj2 assist$).mp.

These approaches and any replies will be documented by the authors. Additionally, impairment-oriented email lists (list-servs) will be sent a letter requesting assistance in locating studies. The reviewers will contact authors of all included and excluded studies to request details of ongoing and unpublished studies. Reference lists from previous reviews and from all included and excluded studies will be searched. Relevant websites, including those maintained by users, governments, other agencies, and academics will be searched. From the resultant list of articles, outcome evaluations about people with impairments will be identified through electronic and hand searches. Two authors (EMW and PM) will check titles for relevance. When a title appears potentially relevant, both authors will examine the abstract. If one author feels an abstract might be relevant, the full article will be obtained. Two authors will examine the remaining papers to determine eligibility. Study authors will be contacted if further information could resolve initial disagreements about inclusion. Remaining disagreements will be discussed with the third reviewer (JD). If a consensus cannot be reached, the Coordinating Editor of the CDPLPG will be consulted. A flowchart of the process of trial selection will be made in accordance with the QUORUM statement (Moher 1999). Data extraction will be conducted independently by two authors (EMW and PM) using a specially developed data extraction form. When more than two treatment arms are included in the same trial, all arms will be described. The following data will be collected for all trial arms: 1) Descriptive data, including participant demographics (age, gender, types and extent of impairments, social and economic status); 2) Intervention characteristics (including delivery, duration, and within-intervention variability); 3) Other interventions received; 4) Outcome measures listed above. The following data will be collected for all studies: 1) Programme differentiation (Dane 1998; MRC 2000), including crossover between groups and the differences between the interventions received; and 2) Context. Two reviewers (EMW and PM) will independently assign each included study to a quality category described in the Cochrane Handbook (Higgins 2005) where: (A) indicates adequate concealment of the allocation (for example, by telephone randomisation, or use of consecutively numbered, sealed, opaque envelopes); (B) indicates uncertainty about whether the allocation was adequately concealed (for example, where the method of concealment is not known); (C) indicates that the allocation was definitely not adequately concealed (for example, open random number lists or quasi-randomisation such as alternate days, odd/even date of birth, or hospital number) (D) random allocation not used. Studies in all quality categories will be considered for inclusion in the review and meta-analyses. Though well-designed nonrandomised studies sometimes come to the same conclusions as randomised trials, nonrandomised studies are most likely to arrive at different conclusions about an intervention's effects when groups are different at the outset (Deeks 2003). Therefore, the pre-treatment assessment and the allocation of participants will be described in the description of studies to identify differences between intervention and control groups that may have existed at baseline. Existing scales for measuring the quality of controlled trials have not been properly developed, are not well-validated and are known to give differing (even opposing) ratings of trial quality in systematic reviews (Moher 1995). At present, evidence indicates that ‘scales should generally not be used to identify trials of apparent low quality or high quality in a given systematic review. Rather, the relevant methodological aspects should be identified a priori and assessed individually’ (Juni 2001). The following components will be considered in the description of studies: 1) Allocation bias (Was group assignment determined randomly or might it have been related to outcomes or the interventions received?); 2) Performance bias (Could the services provided have been influenced by something other than the interventions being compared?); 3) Detection bias (Were outcomes influenced by anything other than the constructs of interest, including biased assessment or the influence of exposure on detection?); 4) Report bias (Were the outcomes, measures and analyses selected a priori and reported completely? Were participants biased in their recall or response?); 5) Attrition bias (Could deviations from protocol, including missing data and dropout, have influenced the results?) (Delgado 2004; Juni 2001); and 6) Outcome validity (Were the outcome measures objective, validated for the population, reported directly by the user or obtained through official records, etc.?). All eligible outcome measures for all trial arms will be reported in the review. If two or more eligible intervention groups are compared to an eligible control, thus requiring that the reviewers choose a single intervention group for comparison",

It underscores the primary focus of personality theory, clinical psychology, and social psychology. Deviancy in psychology describes behavior and thought patterns that are significantly different from what constitutes the norm in a population. These differences in cognition, behavior, and performance can be consistent and fixed or varying over time and situation. They are generally described as too much of an undesirable behavior or too little of a desired behavior. Alternately, these differences can occur as high‐intensity isolated events, as in the cases of violence or mental illness.",

The mother says intrafamily difficulties. Information reported by the patient's mother confirms next visit also providing pictures on the wall of your room is returned. Referral to child and adolescent mental health is decided. Exploration/complementary tests There is no single test for pica. It is carried out systematic blood, biochemical (iron, zinc, lead…) to assess toxic substances and nutritional levels. Abdominal Rx. Both normal. Diagnosis Pica (F98.3). Differential diagnosis Ingestion of nutrients can occur in the course of other mental disorders (for example, a pervasive developmental disorder, schizophrenia), mental retardation, in the Kleine–Levin syndrome… In these cases, should only be established an additional diagnosis of pica if the feeding behavior is sufficiently severe to warrant independent clinical attention. Conclusions Pica disorder has been studied by pediatricians, gynecologists, dermatologists, psychiatrists, psychologists, nutritionists, anthropologists, etc., which has been interpreted as a conduct disorder, food, mental illness, poverty, hunger… but really the cause it is unknown. Although morbidity and mortality is unknown and difficult to study, include poisonings, parasitosis and surgical abdomen as serious complications. Finally, like all other eating disorders, the overall management of this entity requires the coordinated intervention of various professionals.

Parental alienation may affect men's mental health: a) parental alienation negatively influences mental health of male children and adolescents who are victims of parental alienation. Alienated children/adolescents display guilt, sadness, and depressed mood; low self-esteem and lack of self-confidence; distress and frustration; lack of impulse control, substance abuse and delinquent behavior; separation anxiety, fears and phobias; hypochondria and increased tendency to develop psychosomatic illness; suicidal ideation and suicide attempt; sleep and eating disorders; educational problems; enuresis and encopresis; b) parental alienation negatively affects the mental health of adult men who were victims of parental alienation when they were children and/or adolescents. Long-term effects of parental alienation include low self-esteem, depression, drug/alcohol abuse, lack of trust, alienation from own children, divorce, problems with identity and not having a sense of belonging or roots, choosing not to have children to avoid being rejected by them, low achievement, anger and bitterness over the time lost with the alienated parent; c) parental alienation negatively influences mental health of men who are alienated from their children. Fathers who have lost some or all contact with their children for months or years following separation or divorce may be depressed and suicidal.",

Patients with hypochondriasis may be managed with either naive realism or consideration of morbid categorization or via dimensional assessment of illness beliefs and behaviors. Naive realism will foster focus somatization and promote regression as well as lead to needless tests and treatments. Attention to categorical entities such a major depression or anxiety disorders will alert the clinician to comorbid psychiatric disorders that respond to traditional psychiatric treatments.

Definitive clinical testing and/or biological tests rarely exist for most mental illnesses. Even when tests (such as PET scans or excess Abeta42 in cerebral spinal fluid indicating presence of neuronal plaques, for example) and other suggestive biomarkers are \"positive\", there are often no outward cognitive-behavioural symptoms or symptomatic evidence associated with the alleged mental illness (and vice-versa). Furthermore, environmental stressors, dehydration and other fully curable illness and treatable issues such as urinary tract infections, delirium, drug interactions and insomnia can quickly create outward ‘false’ symptoms of mental illnesses, often mistaken for true mental health diagnoses. Therefore, a comprehensive consideration of ex parte narratives, experience, familiarity and also possible underlying motivations, of even the most well-meaning family members in the “family history method” of mental illness diagnoses, currently used by doctors and other professionals, should be revisited.",

The disorder and related syndromes have had a rich history in the history of philosophy, disease classification, and psychiatry, going back to the Greek philosophers who described melancholic character as one of four basic character types. According to the DSM‐IV (APA, 1994) and DSM‐IV‐TR (APA, 2000), individuals are diagnosed with DPD when they meet five of the seven following criteria: (1) usual mood is joyless, cheerless, and dysphoric; (2) the self‐concept centers around feelings of worthlessness and the individual has low self‐esteem; (3) the individual is self‐critical; (4) the individual broods or worries frequently; (5) the individual is negative or critical of others; (6) the individual is pessimistic; and (7) the individual often feels guilty or remorseful. DSM‐IV (APA, 1994) states that this disorder is not to be diagnosed when these criteria “occur exclusively during Major Depressive Episodes” of if they are “better accounted for by Dysthymic Disorder” (APA, 1994, p. 733).",

La diagnosi psichiatrica del paziente formulata il giorno successivo alla messa in atto di un gesto criminale o violento e indispensabile, ma non e sufficiente. Non e necessariamente la stessa diagnosi dell’esame psichiatrico anamnestico prima del fatto e soprattutto non e necessariamente uguale alla diagnosi psichiatrica durante il fatto. Ad esempio, molte donne che hanno ucciso il figlio nel corso di una psicosi post-partum si presentano dopo l’omicidio con una sintomatologia prevalentemente depressiva, mentre al momento del gesto presentavano una sintomatologia piu facilmente riconducibile ad uno stato espansivo o misto, ed ancora prima del gesto presentavano non solo un temperamento irritabile in un contesto d’incapacita genitoriale. Ignorare l’evoluzione della psicopatologia psichiatrica, in generale e soprattutto in relazione alla criminalita, non permette una valutazione e un trattamento adeguati.\r\nE infine utile e necessario ricordare che comportamenti criminali e suicidio sono fenomeni ad eziologia multifattoriale in cui entrano in gioco variabili biologiche, psicologiche, psichiatriche, sociali, ideologiche ecc. In questo senso la diagnosi e la terapia (farmacologica o psicoterapica) sono di stretta competenza psichiatrica ed utili per la comprensione della criminalita ma non sufficienti perche non costituiscono gli unici fattori causali.",

      "abstract": "Diseases with movement disorders may be difficult to diagnose, both at the onset, when motor symptoms are mild and not sufficiently specific (e.g., difficulty in manipulating objects), or at end stage when distinctive motor signs are diluted in a severe and polymorphous clinical picture (eg, gait disorder with postural instability and cognitive decline in aged patients). Erroneous diagnoses are not infrequent, even in the most common disorders such as Parkinson's disease (PD). [1] Some of these errors may be avoided if the cognitive dysfunctions that often accompany these diseases are included in the diagnostic criteria.\n\nIn general, the cognitive disturbances found in movement disorders are in the category of ``subcortical dementia,'' consisting of a frontal lobe-like syndrome, without genuine amnesia or impairment of instrumental functions (aphasia, apraxia, or agnosia). Except for a few illnesses, such as essential tremor and idiopathic dystonia, in which intellectual deterioration is absent, subtle but specific cognitive deficits can frequently be detected in patients with a variety of diseases accompanied by movement disorders. [2] This is explained by the neuronal pathways connecting the basal ganglia to the cortex projecting not only to regions involved in the control of movements (motor, premotor, supplementary motor areas) but also to cortical areas contributing to cognitive functions (prefrontal cortex). In each of these diseases, the loss of different specific populations of neurons in the basal ganglia produces not only a characteristic motor syndrome but also a recognizable pattern of neuropsychological deficits. The use of appropriate neuropsychological tests to detect these deficits can therefore contribute to the diagnosis of such diseases.\n\nThis brief review will not deal with disorders caused by subcortical lesions of nondegenerative origin (tumors, sequelae of trauma or stroke, inflammatory and metabolic disorders, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, etc.) or with easily identified neurodegenerative diseases, i.e., when motor disability is prominent …",

      "abstract": "This review focuses on the differentiation of schizophrenia in the setting of adult psychiatry from neurodevelopmental disorders (NDD's) and psychosis due to other medical conditions (PDMC). Psychotic disorders in early adulthood are most frequently diagnosed with the schizophrenia spectrum or mood disorders. However, they may be the manifestation of neurologic, endocrine or immunologic disease. Individuals with NDD's such as the autism spectrum disorder (ASD) or intellectual developmental disorder (IDD) may also present initially in adulthood. Therefore it is not uncommon that the psychiatrist is the first physician to assess a psychotic patient with underlying medical illness or a NDD. Failure to identify the underlying cause will delay appropriate management. Overdiagnosis of primary psychiatric disorders may be misleading in planning the treatment, as evidence-based treatment algorithms relevant to psychosis are intended for primary psychotic disorders like schizophrenia, and symptomatic treatment may result in unnecessary exposure to antipsychotic drugs. Exclusion of other medical conditions and NDD's is essential before establishing a diagnosis of schizophrenia.",

The obsession can be conceptualized, according to psychodynamic object-relations theory, as resulting from a damaged or defective sense of self, coupled with problems of impulse regulation and defensive operations. Predominant in the psychology of most obsessed patients is their tie with an Other, a selfobject that helps to stabilize favorable aspects of the patient's unstable self-image. Clinical examples are provided, and issues of therapeutic alliance, gradual psychodynamic exploration, potential decompensation and violence, and countertransference are discussed.",

FMS patients usually display a high rate of psychiatric disorders compared to the general population. FMS has been also associated with higher levels of negative affect and lower levels of positive affect. High levels of stress, pain catastrophizing, and angry rumination have been also reported in FMS patients. Additionally, there are a tendency to internalize and suppress anger in FMS patients. Regarding personality in FMS, some studies have observed some FMS features (e.g., high impulsivity, harm avoidance, self-transcendence and neuroticism, and low conscientiousness, cooperativeness and self-directedness), while other authors had not found any particular personality trait. Some personality disorders (i.e., obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, borderline personality, avoidant personality disorder, and histrionic personality disorder) seem to be more frequent in FMS patients than in general population. Moreover, previous research has reported a greater presence of the type D personality and high levels of alexithymia in a significant proportion of FMS patients. It is necessary to improve the understanding of the role of affect and personality in the clinical practice with chronic pain patients, in order to improve the success of a personalized oriented treatment and increase their health-related quality of life.",

OFD1 is characterized by the following features: Oral (lobulated tongue, tongue nodules, cleft of the hard or soft palate, accessory gingival frenulae, hypodontia, and other dental abnormalities) Facial (widely spaced eyes or telecanthus, hypoplasia of the alae nasi, median cleft or pseudocleft upper lip, micrognathia) Digital (brachydactyly, syndactyly, clinodactyly of the fifth finger; duplicated hallux [great toe]) Kidney (polycystic kidney disease) Brain (e.g., intracerebral cysts, agenesis of the corpus callosum, cerebellar agenesis with or without Dandy-Walker malformation) Intellectual disability (in ~50% of individuals) Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of OFD1 is established in a proband by identification of an OFD1 pathogenic variant on molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Surgery for cleft lip/palate, tongue nodules, accessory frenulae, and syndactyly; removal of accessory teeth and orthodontia for malocclusion; routine treatment for renal disease and seizures. Speech therapy and special education may be warranted. Surveillance: Annual audiology evaluation and assessment of speech development in children if cleft lip and/or cleft palate is present. Individuals age ten years and older: annual blood pressure examination, serum creatinine, annual ultrasound examination for renal, hepatic, pancreatic, and ovarian cystic disease. Genetic counseling OFD1 is inherited in an X-linked manner. Approximately 75% of affected individuals represent simplex cases (i.e., with no family history of OFD1). A female proband with OFD1 may have the disorder as the result of a de novo pathogenic variant; the proportion of cases caused by de novo pathogenic variants is unknown. The risk that the unaffected mother of an affected female who is a simplex case will give birth to another female with OFD1 is less than 1%. At conception, the risk to the offspring of females with OFD1 of inheriting the pathogenic variant is 50%; however, most male conceptuses with the pathogenic variant miscarry. Thus, at delivery the expected sex ratio of offspring is: 33% unaffected females; 33% affected females; 33% unaffected males. Prenatal diagnosis for pregnancies at increased risk is possible if the pathogenic variant in the family is known. Prenatal ultrasound examination may detect structural brain malformations and/or duplication of the hallux.",

Affective instability is often confused with mood lability, as in bipolar disorders, as well as with other terms. To clarify the concept, we searched databases for the termaffective instabilityand read related articles on the topic. In this article we situate the term within the current affective nomenclature and human emotional experience, explore its psychophysiological features, and place it within the context of psychopathology. We explain why the term can potentially be confused with mood pathology and then define affective instability as an inherited temperamental trait modulated by developmental experience.",

While its etiological bases remain obscure and consequently its nosological boundaries are uncertain, the condition classically has its onset in childhood or early adolescence [1]. It is characterized by (1) \"positive\" psychotic symptoms like delusions (fixed false ideas that are held with unshakable conviction), hallucinations (perceptions without a stimulus), and thought disorder (difficulty in assembling a coherent stream of speech); (2) so-called negative symptoms like lack of motivation and pleasure, inability of expressing the full range of emotions, neglect of personal appearance, and disinterest in life events; and (3) cognitive impairment (memory and attention difficulties) [2]. All of these attributes, persistent over time, culminate in a decline in social and occupational performance. These features – coupled with the consequences of sustained impairment – result in comorbid depression (see chapter \" Major depressive disorder \") among people with schizophrenia. Approximately 50 % of patients attempt and about 4 % of patients commit suicide. Schizophrenia is poorly understood by the public, and it is often highly stigmatizing [3].",

Often it is clear that such symptoms and signs are being manufactured psychologically, either consciously or, more often, by an unconscious process. Such patients are frequently polysymptomatic, and may have a long history of consulting other specialists, particularly abdominal, dental, gynaecological, and otorhinological surgeons. They run the risk of developing secondary abnormalities induced by surgical and other invasive procedures. Psychologically determined symptoms are a very common cause of neurological out-patient referral. Of those with psychogenic disorders, pain is the commonest symptom, followed by motor symptoms, gait disturbances, dizziness, blackouts, sensory symptoms, and visual dysfunction (Lempert et al. 1990). Depressive and anxiety disorders are twice as common in those with psychologically determined disorders and those with emotional disorders have a greater number of somatic symptoms but are unenthusiastic about psychiatric treatment. Clinical syndromes including Briquet’s syndrome, hypochondriasis, conversion disorder, body dysmorphic disorder and pain disorders are explained and described. The presentation and characteristics of malingering (a process of deliberate deceit, in which symptoms are fabricated) is described, including Munchausen’s syndrome. In addition, associated psychiatric states and the symptoms and physical signs of psychologically determined disorders are discussed. Finally, the management and prognosis of psychologically determined states are outlined.",

Both vestibular stimuli and vestibular dysfunction can underlie unreal experiences. Vestibular afferents provide a frame of reference (linear and angular head acceleration) within which spatial information from other senses is interpreted. This paper reviews evidence that symptoms of depersonalization/derealization associated with vestibular dysfunction are a consequence of a sensory mismatch between disordered vestibular input and other sensory signals of orientation.",

      "abstract": "Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is characterized as significant impairment of cognitive-behavioral inhibition, which is causally associated with cognitive processes evoking anxiety, along with increased desire for perfect control over the possible harm, at least in typical OCD patients who have compulsions in response to obsessions. However, OCD has been well conceptualized as a multidimensional and heterogeneous disorder apparently comprising a number of potentially valid subtypes. For example, OCD can be diagnosed by either obsessions or compulsions, and a certain type of OCD patient has only compulsions in response to rules that must be applied rigidly. They often become stuck as a result of rigid rules in every step of their daily working and social life. This type of compulsive behavior is often triggered by specific sensory phenomena such as sight, touch, or personal expression (e. g. need to express himself precisely in written or spoken words). Thus, such OCD patients usually perform their compulsions in order to relieve sensory phenomena such as feelings of incompleteness and urges to reach a specific sensation of feeling \"just right\", and are less likely to have obsessions or cognitive processes preceding the repetitive behaviors. This type of OCD has also been characterized as \"tic-related\" and tends to have comorbid conditions such as tic disorders, ADHD or skin picking. Indeed, there are some crucial and significant differences in the psychopathology, phenomenology, and putative biological bases between OCD patients with obsession-related compulsions (cognitive type) and those with compulsions repeated according to rigid rules (motoric type). Because of the substantial heterogeneity of OCD, it seems to be beyond the traditional learning model in which anxiety-driven obsessions entrain neutralizing compulsions and also beyond the essential features of anxiety disorders commonly characterized by psychopathological characteristics such as marked and persistent fear, expectant anxiety, fear conditioning, avoidance, and cognitive process to evoke anxiety et al. Eventually, it has caused dramatic changes of view on the core psychopathology of OCD that is based on \"preoccupation\" and \"repeated behaviors\" as a failure of behavioral (cognitive and motor) inhibition, which also constitutes a key characteristic of obsessive-compulsive and related disorders (OCRDs) in process of the revision of DSM-5. The precise nature and compass of this spectrum remains to be fully elucidated, but a preliminary approach emphasizes that putative OCRDs have phenomenological (e.g. repetitive thoughts or behaviors), etiological, psychobiological or treatment overlap with OCD, differentiating OCD from other anxiety disorders. Therefore, OCRDs, including OCD, may be classified apart from other anxiety disorders in the revisions of DSM-5 or ICD-11. Nevertheless, recent neuroimaging evidence points to the critical involvement of the lateral and medial orbitofrontal cortices, the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and amygdalo cortical circuitry, in addition to cortico-striatal circuitry, in the pathophysiology of OCD, suggesting the possibility that fear extinction, in addition to behavioral inhibition, might be impaired in OCD similarly to other anxiety disorders. Moreover, studies have investigated the relevant neurocircuitry, neurochemistry, and neuroendocrinology commonly underlying depression, anxiety disorders and OCRDs, and have explored the underlying genetic basis of and relevant intermediate phenotypes for developing these conditions. Thus more research is needed to elucidate the essential relationships among these disorders and to validate the future diagnostic classifications of anxiety disorders.",

      "abstract": "Unos de los trastornos mas estudiados y que mas interrogantes genera es el trastorno limite de personalidad, en parte por ser una entidad aun sin definir de manera consensuada en cuanto a sus caracteristicas, y tambien por el deterioro clinico que tiene el sujeto que la padece. Es asi, como de una manera generica, podemos mencionar que el nucleo de la psicopatologia del trastorno limite de personalidad se encuentra en una capacidad gravemente deteriorada para las relaciones y unos patrones de comportamiento desadaptativos predecibles, relacionados con la separacion. Cuando estos pacientes se sienten cuidados, sostenidos y apoyados, la caracteristica depresivas (soledad y vacio) se hacen mas evidentes. Ante la amenaza o perdida de esta relacion de apoyo, la maravillosa imagen idealizada del generoso cuidador es reemplazada por la odiosa imagen devaluada de un cruel perseguidor, cambio denominado escision. La amenaza de separacion tambien produce intensos temores de abandono, asi como rabiosos comportamientos autodestructivos (DSM-IV-TR, 2003). Se han empleado diversas perspectivas en cuanto a la concepcion de la personalidad; asi la discusion acerca de la definicion de estos trastornos se centra en base a dos modelos, los categoriales, y los dimensionales. Los primeros son los mas usados en la actualidad, pero son los segundos los que parecen dar luces acerca de la posible explicacion acorde a la sintomatologia presente en el trastorno; la ventaja de estos modelos es que permiten la busqueda de fundamentos biologicos en cuanto a las dimensiones que muchos plantean. \nAl hacer toda la revision teorica podemos observar que varios autores como Lieb et al (2006) y Carrasco (2006), plantean que el trastorno limite de personalidad esta caracterizado por dos elementos: el primero es la disregulacion emocional y el segundo la impulsividad. Ambos autores discuten sobre estas dimensiones y como ambas se encuentran presentes en este trastorno. La confusion generada en cuanto a la delimitacion y caracterizacion de este trastorno, hace necesaria la contrastacion con otro grupo clinico (esquizofreniforme) que permita determinar si efectivamente el trastorno limite de personalidad se circuscribre a la dimension cognitiva o a la afectiva. Esta discusion teorica pretende dar luces acerca de la conceptualizacion del trastorno en base a los hallazgos tanto de esta investigacion como de otras investigaciones en el ambito cientifico. En concordancia con lo anterior...",

      "abstract": "Fatigue is a common complaint in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). More than half of all patients with PD rank fatigue among their three worst symptoms. Fatigue has been variously hypothesized to be caused by dysfunction of the striato-thalamo-cortical loop, abnormalities in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, inflammatory processes, and neurotransmitter abnormalities within the central nervous system. However, there is no firm evidence that any of these proposed etiologies explain the fatigue experienced by patients who have PD or other diseases. Fatigue may be associated with depression, sleep disorders, and medication-induced adverse effects, but it also remains a distinct symptom that can occur independently from these other disorders and problems. Fatigue is a persistent symptom in individual patients, and it is unrelated to disease severity. Fatigue is difficult to define and even more difficult to measure. Several questionnaires are available to measure fatigue, but many of these are disease-specific and do not apply to patients who have PD. Some questionnaires measure general overall fatigue, whereas others measure different aspects of fatigue, including mental, physical, emotional, motivational, and exertional fatigue. Often fatigue is confused with sleepiness, a related but distinct construct. Clearly, fatigue has a significantly negative impact on the quality of life and physical function of patients with PD. Currently, there is no proven effective treatment for this problematic nonmotor symptom of PD. Additional research is needed to provide a better understanding of this complex problem.",

      "abstract": "Acute pain is \"the barking police-dog of our health\". It represents an efficient system of information introducing or evoking a series of defensive mechanisms concerning acute illness, whereas the chronic ache is senseless, because it doesn't take over any protective functions; on the contrary, it burdens the total organism, especially the vegetativum and the psyche as well. Chronic pain very often renders independent, then it is no longer any symptom of a disease, but the disease itself: the idiopathic or unspecific syndrome of pain. Analyzing, for example, rheumatological aspects of a case, you can recognise that there exist continuous transitions from concrete local pain to diffuse indefinite psychalgia, whilst that gliding scale is more and more defined by psychic causes. Many aspects of cases imply a lot of such components. Obviously those syndromes of diseases are increasing where only pure psychosomatic facts exist, that is to say when soma is not the primary source but the scenery.",

      "abstract": "Abstract: Fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) is a chronic disorder characterized by widespread and persistent musculoskeletal pain and other frequent symptoms such as fatigue, insomnia, morning stiffness, cognitive impairment, depression, and anxiety. FMS is also accompanied by different comorbidities like irritable bowel syndrome and chronic fatigue syndrome. Although some factors like negative events, stressful environments, or physical/emotional traumas may act as predisposing conditions, the etiology of FMS remains unknown. There is evidence of a high prevalence of psychiatric comorbidities in FMS (especially depression, anxiety, borderline personality, obsessive-compulsive personality, and post-traumatic stress disorder), which are associated with a worse clinical profile. There is also evidence of high levels of negative affect, neuroticism, perfectionism, stress, anger, and alexithymia in FMS patients. High harm avoidance together with high self-transcendence, low cooperativeness, and low self-directedness have been reported as temperament and character features in FMS patients, respectively. Additionally, FMS patients tend to have a negative self-image and body image perception, as well as low self-esteem and perceived self-efficacy. FMS reduces functioning in physical, psychological, and social spheres, and also has a negative impact on cognitive performance, personal relationships (including sexuality and parenting), work, and activities of daily life. In some cases, FMS patients show suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, and consummated suicide. FMS patients perceive the illness as a stigmatized and invisible disorder, and this negative perception hinders their ability to adapt to the disease. Psychological interventions may constitute a beneficial complement to pharmacological treatments in order to improve clinical symptoms and reduce the impact of FMS on health-related quality of life.

      "abstract": "Sometimes concussion is accompanied by an abrupt change in behavior, including psychosis or dementia, but concussion is not necessarily the cause. It is more likely that head injury can sometimes unmask an underlying predisposition to another neuropsychiatric disease that has already begun to manifest, often sub-clinically. Such unmasking may occur as a result of a brain injury superimposed on an already vulnerable brain, or a brain injury that contextually removes the individual from a routine that served as a reliable and dependable structural context. Thus, when abrupt neuropsychiatric manifestations such as psychosis or dementia manifest after concussion, a thorough neuropsychiatric evaluation should be performed, and one should not simply assume that concussion is the cause.",

These forces principally revolve around the parents’ fantasies of themselves, both as spouses and as parents.

Often one or both of the parents may appear to be almost psychotic, when previously they were functioning quite well. Children are drawn into this maelstrom, often siding with one or the other parent in a very pathological fashion. Examples of regressive behavior as well as case examples are given.",

      "abstract": "The topicality of the psychological correction of the personal sense in the structure of mental image of illness of somatic disease is stated. The conception of mental image of illness (on the example of bronchial asthma) from the bodily psychology point of view is considered. All the variants of the personal sense of disease (as a result of interrelations and interactions of actual personal motives in connection with the disease), including negative, positive and conflict senses, are overviewed. It is resumed, that all the variants of the personal sense of disease in the bodily psychology more or less have negative connotation and can cause various psychosomatic deviations or disorders. Thus, it is necessary to determine the most optimal and favorable from the therapeutic and prognostic points of view personal sense of disease. Thereby, the notion of the “adequate” negative personal sense of disease is suggested. The “adequate” negative personal sense of disease should be formed in the process of psychological correction over against “inadequate” negative and conflict senses of the disease. It should be understood as such, which is conducive for the adaptation to the disease, the formation of the aspiration to overcome the disease and understanding the health as a value, and the achievement of the recovery on the background of the most complete, full-scale, clear and conscious perception of the disease in accordance with the objective, “external” image of illness. The formation of the “adequate” negative personal sense of disease is possible through following the overviewed methodological and technological vectors and outlines in the process of psychological correction. It is shown, that due to the structure of mental image of illness as a holistic consciousness image, the correction of the personal sense of disease will cause the changes on the other levels of mental image of illness and formation of the “adequate” mental image of illness in general. Herewith, the psychological correction on the level of the perception of intraceptive bodily sensations and emotional experiences and on the level of mythologizing should complement the program of psychological correction and increase the efficiency of psychocorrective effect.",

      "abstract": "Depression and moral masochism are inseparable, and originate in a particular climate of lived experience in which one or both parents suffer from a masochistic-depressive disposition. Developmentally, there has been a deficit in the child's experience of shared pleasure, and of being a source of enjoyment to the parent. Instead, the child experiences himself or herself as a source of pain and feels responsible for the parent's dysphoric, anhedonic state. This is not simply a fantasy construction of the child, as parental reproachfulness is characteristically encountered. The child makes reparative efforts, but they generally do not succeed. Central psychological capacities are compromised under these conditions, particularly a sense of personal efficacy and of natural entitlement. The evolution of initiative, autonomy, and individuation are also significantly affected. The aggression, both conscious and unconscious, which is generated by these early conditions creates intrapsychic conflict which further inhibits the development of these essential psychological functions. Some therapeutic recommendations are proposed based on these considerations.",

Attempts even to describe the first level may be nullified by conflict, misinformation, ignorance and emotionality related to the second level. Common interpretations of drinking, driving and accident, the tendency to view drinking-and-driving as a unitary phenomenon, the popular attribution of rarity, evil and irrationality to the behavior, the widespread use of single-cause explanations for highly complicated events, all suggest the need to describe the second-level problems before defining the events themselves. Major difficulties in gaining information for adequate understanding of first-level problems are described. Recent social changes suggest that these difficulties are currently more susceptible to effective attack.",

      "title": "Gastrointestinal motility and perception disorders re-visited",
      "abstract": "The importance of gastrointestinal motility and gut perception in medicine has been long recognized. Physiologically, these key functions ensure normal unperceived feeding and digestion, crucial aspects of health and wellbeing. Conversely, pathophysiological disturbances may produce digestive symptoms, which are common in the general population and may range from the simply annoying to the incapacitating. In fact, major disturbances may lead to malnourishment, metabolic imbalance and general deterioration of the body. Altered normal gut motility may also disrupt gut homeostasis, induce changes in the gut flora and facilitate bacterial translocation from the intestine to other viscera (Fig. 1). Clinical recognition of gastrointestinal motility and perception disorders is largely based on the anatomic localization of their symptomatic expression (1-4). Thus, dysphagia, reflux symptoms and chest pain are normally associated with esophageal or gastroesophageal disturbances. Upper abdominal pain or discomfort, early satiety, nausea and vomiting, and other dyspeptic-like symptoms are usually ascribed to dysfunction of the stomach and/or upper small bowel. Bloating is a somewhat mysterious symptom that may be generated by motor/sensorial disturbances throughout the gastrointestinal tract. Diarrhea and/or constipation usually result from small bowel and/or colonic disorders. Ano-rectal symptoms usually derive from dysfunction of the pelvic floor, distal colon or sphincteric structures. Traditionally, clinical conditions were divided into somatic gastrointestinal motility disorders: achalasia, gastroparesis, chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction and so on, and functional disorders: dyspepsia, irritable bowel syndrome and a myriad of clinical syndromes and descriptions. The distinction between both groups was largely based on whether a propulsive failure was or not demonstrated by conventional imaging tests. Thus, a patient with recurrent abdominal pain and distension could be categorized either as a chronic intestinal pseudoobstruction (if dilated loops of bowel were visualized on Xrays) or irritable bowel syndrome (if nothing obviously abnormal was found). Application of more sophisticated and discriminating diagnostic tests (intestinal manometry, barostat, etc.) and histology increasingly showed that Gastrointestinal motility and perception disorders re-visited",

      "abstract": "Os distúrbios psiquiátricos podem acometer os indivíduos em diversas fases de sua vida. Uma vez que a vulnerabilidade é agravada por eventos naturais somados a predisposição psicossocial e psicológica. A depressão trata-se de uma perturbação afetiva que culmina com um estado melancólico, mais que pode evoluir com alguns episódios de ansiedade que compartilha algumas características coma tristeza. As causas da maior parte das doenças de ordem psicológica não estão bem esclarecidas. Não existem causas isoladas da depressão, tratando-se assim de uma doença multifatorial, ou seja, não possui fatores causadores específicos que possam ser identificados dentro dos critérios de certeza absoluta científica. Quando surge imediatamente após o parto toma a designação de Depressão Pós-Parto. O estudo tem como objetivo Conhecer os fatores desencadeantes da Depressão Pós-Parto em gestantes no terceiro trimestre e puérperas do 1° ao 3° mês no PSF da cidade do Crato-Ce. Identificar os principais fatores de risco relacionados ao desenvolvimento da Depressão Pós-Parto. A pesquisa e do tipo exploratório-descritivo, com abordagem qualitativa. A população constituiu-se por gestantes no terceiro trimestre de gestação e puérperas de qualquer idade obedecendo aos seguintes critérios de inclusão e exclusão. Para a obtenção de dados junto à amostra, utilizou-se uma entrevista semi-estruturada contendo perguntas abertas e fechadas. Concluímos que se faz necessário um planejamento das equipes para a execução de ações preventivas que proporcionem uma gestação e um puerpério emocionalmente sadios. Essas equipes devem atuar, fundamentalmente, no acompanhamento das mães puérperas atendendo às suas necessidades básicas de saúde e educação, bem como na orientação daquilo que se refere aos cuidados com a criança. Tais atitudes básicas não devem ser específicas da medicina em geral ou da psiquiatria em particular. Elas devem ser realizadas por equipes multiprofissionais da rede básica de saúde treinada para isso.",

      "title": "Body Part Concerns Questionnaire (BPCQ) in an Iranian Population with Special Needs",
      "abstract": "Introduction Body image is a person’s perception of his/her physical appearance. There is little relation between the actual appearance and sense of attractiveness. Great physical appearance doesn’t guarantee a positive body image, or does lacking natural beauty lead to a negative body image. In fact, beauty doesn’t properly reflect one’s feelings of body image; it depends on one’s appearance. There are relations between body image and feeling, thinking and acting in particular conditions (1). One of the key features of the ‘Body Dysmorphic Disorder’ (BDD) definition is excessive preoccupation with slight or imagined defect in body appearance (2). BDD has the worst outcome of all the body image disorders (3). Since BDD has a negative impact on quality of life (4) screening BDD patients in clinical settings seems important (5). Sense of body image may put an adolescent’s physical health at risk (6). However, physical concerns don't necessarily reflect body dysmorphic disorder (7). In addition, there are high numbers of BDD patients that have extreme body image dissatisfaction (8). The main feature of BDD is excessive attention to negative body image. Subsequently, negative evaluation of images can lead to rumination, mood changes and compulsive behaviors (3). Self-worth based upon appearance (9) and poor body image is important in BDD (10). The feeling of attractiveness (11) and body image can influence BDD symptoms (12). BDD patients have high rates of suicidal ideation and attempts and also completed suicide attempts (13). Since this disorder can have a devastating effect on the quality of a person's life, it seems necessary to identify it at an early stage (14). Compared to men, women are more likely to undergo cosmetic surgery. Lack of body satisfaction can predict cosmetic surgery. Experience of cosmetic surgery among family or friends can increase the rate of cosmetic surgery in women. Media has no effect on the rate of cosmetic surgery",

      "abstract": "LA PARALISIS CEREBRAL INFANTIL ANTE EL CAMBIO SOCIAL EN YUCATAN\r\nEn la Republica Mexicana, Yucatan posee el mayor indice de discapacidad motora, dentro de la cual se halla la paralisis cerebral infantil (PCI). Esta se da antes, durante o despues del parto, debido a una lesion o anomalia de desarrollo del cerebro inmaduro, que dificulta los mensajes del cerebro a los musculos, conduciendo a la persona, a dificultades de movimiento. No obstante es un trastorno motor, tambien lleva a trastornos sensoriales, perceptivos y psicologicos. No es progresiva, ni se agrava cuando el nino crece.\r\nAcercarnos a las condiciones de vida de las personas con PCI nos llevo al concepto de cuerpo social de discapacidad por PCI, que es algo asi como la presencia o vida social de las personas con la afectacion en la postura y el movimiento que le son propias. El termino de cuerpo social de discapacidad, hace referencia a esa experiencia subjetiva que se impone a las personas con una deficiencia en el cuerpo que se convierte en su discapacidad, que se ha construido socialmente y por medio de la cual, se reprime o excluye a estas personas socialmente.\r\nAl encarnarse el dano cerebral se establece en el cuerpo fisico, la deficiencia, que posteriormente se vivira como discapacidad (cuando socialmente se imponen las barreras discriminatorias a las personas con PCI, es decir cuando sea dificil su asistencia a la escuela, trabajo y mundo social). Hallamos barreras sociales significativas, que obligan a considerar la opresion y exclusion social que acompana a la PCI. \r\nEl estudio de la PCI, requiere estar al tanto de la investigacion en discapacidad e investigacion emancipadora. Tambien demanda considerar las teorias sobre el cuerpo, argumentando que no hay diferencia cualitativa entre las personas con discapacidad y las personas convencionales o sin discapacidad. Y alienta a tomar conciencia de la importancia de transversalizar la problematica de la PCI con las perspectivas etnica y de genero.\r\nEl cuerpo social de discapacidad en la PCI es un constructo formado por tres elementos: identidad, practica social y estratificacion. Efectuamos un recorrido en el conjunto de variables interactuantes que le dan forma, al hacerlo reflexionamos sobre la salud y la reproduccion, los aspectos trascendentales de la discapacidad como son la educacion, la integracion y la inclusion; trabajo, grupos de ayuda, organizaciones no gubernamentales, organizaciones de la sociedad civil, etc., asi como sobre las particularidades del Yucatan contemporaneo y la relacion entre discapacidad, genero, pobreza, asistencialismo, derechos y legislacion. \r\nPresentamos una opcion de abordaje diferente dentro de las ciencias sociales y culturales, a la problematica de la discapacidad por PCI. Esto significo cambiar la posicion latinoamericana acostumbrada, desistiendo de los metodos mono culturales y etnocentricos que son productos de la tradicion cientifica hispano–europea. \r\nEn cuanto a la metodologia, se investigo en un escenario itinerante, nuestros informantes fueron las personas con PCI, sus familiares y las personas convencionales con las que llevan su vida. Se hizo uso de la observacion y participacion, las tecnicas de conversacion-narracion como la entrevista a profundidad, asi como las trayectorias de vida y el grupo de discusion. \r\nHay que senalar que en la sociedad yucateca se da el discapacidismo, es decir, conducta discriminatoria, opresiva y abusiva que surge de la creencia de que la persona con discapacidad es inferior o menos que humana. \r\nLa opresion se palpa en la falta o carencias de libertad, participacion, voz y decisiones de las personas con PCI, es decir indica esa situacion desventajosa impuesta a las personas con PCI, por los sectores dominantes de la sociedad, al no permitirseles la ciudadania.",

The \"deferred action\" of psychic trauma is an antiquated concept and psychic trauma has immediate effects as well as far reaching developmental consequences. Prior trauma predisposes to later traumatic vulnerability and to trauma linked to phase specific unconscious conflict.

The psycho-analyst is perforce used to the extreme complexity of human material, and who is more aware than most people of the areas of ignorance in the understanding of persons.

Individuals with BDD suffer from time-consuming obsessions about their bodily appearance and excessive compulsive behaviors (for example, mirror-checking, excessive grooming, and skin-picking). Functioning and quality of life are typically very poor, and suicidality is markedly elevated. BDD currently affects 0.7% to 2.9% of the population; however, BDD typically goes unrecognized in clinical settings. This chapter discusses BDD’s definition and classification, epidemiology, demographics, and clinical features, including several case descriptions of BDD, age at onset, course of illness, comorbidity, morbidity (including suicidality), gender similarities and differences, and healthcare utilization. In addition, BDD’s relationships to obsessive-compulsive disorder, psychotic disorders, and social anxiety disorder are discussed.",

      "title": "Fraser's “Dissociative Table Technique” Revisited, Revised: A Strategy for Working with Ego States in Dissociative Disorders and Ego-State Therapy",
      "abstract": "ABSTRACT The challenge in the management of a number of the dissociative disorders–which is not present in any other psychiatric or physical disorder–is the need to manage a person who has a dissociative plurality of self identities. Each self identity or ego state believes in its own separate existence, and that it can relate to the outside world without any need of the other co-existing ego states. The primary treatment of dissociative disorders is psychotherapy (and psychopharmacology when Axis I comorbid disorders cause functional impairment), much like the psychotherapy of other disorders. However, in treating dissociative disorders, it is often necessary for the therapist to interact with the various ego states. To ignore the clients' subjective reality of such ego states often leads to therapeutic failure, a fruitless focus solely on the comorbid conditions, termination of therapy, or a flight to another therapist. Effective therapy most often results from the recognition and acceptance of the subjective reality of the client's separate ego states and the ability of the therapist to lead the client towards a dissolution of the amnestic barriers and disharmony of these ego states. For many clients, however, the switching of ego states is chaotic and uncontrolled. The Dissociative Table Technique offers a technique to allow clients to recognize internal ego states, and to structure and control switching and internal communication. It is an adjunctive strategy to the psychotherapy and has proven successful in establishing internal cooperation and integration of the various ego states. Drawing on principles from hypnosis, gestalt therapy and clinical experience, the strategies of the Dissociative Table Technique allow the therapist to teach the dissociated person to facilitate interaction of ego states, and to integrate and eventually join or fuse the dissociated ego states into a consistent sense of self brought about by the cooperation and coawareness of all ego states who learn to function as a unit. This is an expanded and updated version of the original publication of this technique (Fraser, 1991).",

      "title": "Differential Diagnosis Between Schizophrenia and in Major Depression: The Importance of Abnormal Bodily Phenomena",
      "abstract": "Introduction Anomalies of bodily experience have for long been described as relevant features of schizophrenia and major depression, yet such experiences are usually neglected in clinical examination. Bodily experience is the implicit background of our experiences against which we develop a coherent sense of self as a unified, bounded entity, naturally immersed in a social world of meaningful others. Such tacit experiential background is often perturbed in schizophrenia and major depression. Empirical research shows that patients with schizophrenia and major depression frequently present many different kinds of anomalies of bodily experience in the course of their illness. Objective To characterize the abnormal bodily phenomena in both schizophrenia and major depression. Aim To improve differential diagnosis based on the identification of typical features of abnormal bodily experiences in persons affected by schizophrenia and major depression and to provide supplementary diagnostic criteria. Method Analysis of empirical and theoretical research published in the last 25 years. Result Ongoing bodily feelings of disintegration/violation and nothingness/mechanization (e.g. one's body experienced as a object-like mechanism) are the most typical experiences in people with schizophrenia whereas major depressives are not able to detach themselves from the experience of bodily failure or chrematization (from chrema = corpse, i.e., feeling like a corpse) and therefore, feel worthless, guilty, or decaying. They feel chrematized in their very self. Conclusion These experiences might be considered as specific and they can contribute to differential diagnosis of somatic complaints in schizophrenia and in major depression.

      "title": "Extracorporeal photopheresis in stiff person syndrome",
      "abstract": "1 IntroductionStiff person spectrum disorders (SPSDs) are a rare group of neuroimmunological disorders characterized by progressive rigidity and triggered painful spasms of the limb muscles. Despite the first description by Moersch and Woltman in 1956 of the formerly coined \"stiff man syndrome\" 1 or as a gender-neutral term of \"stiff person syndrome (SPS),\" 2 this condition has a clinical spectrum that includes not only classical SPS but also other SPS variants, such as progressive encephalomyelitis with rigidity and myoclonus (PERM). 3Classical SPS is the predominant clinical form and presents as an insidious onset with rigidity and stiffness of the trunk muscles, which advance to joint deformities, impaired posturing, and abnormal gait. 1, 3 Patients may also develop painful generalized muscle spasms triggered by unexpected stimuli and may be associated with other autoimmune disorders. 3, 4 The clinical features of SPS variants include focal or segmental SPS (\"stiff limb syndrome\"), jerky SPS, SPS with epilepsy, SPS with dystonia, cerebellar, and paraneoplastic variants. 3-5In addition to axial and limb muscle stiffness and diffuse myoclonus, patients with PERM (\"SPS-plus syndrome\") exhibit relapsing–remitting brain stem symptoms, breathing issues, and prominent autonomic dysfunction. 6Despite significant advances in the treatment of SPSDs, the prognosis remains unpredictable, with an inadequate response in many patients, leading to severe disability and sudden death. 5, 7 Moreover, most patients receiving standard-of-care medications may require progressively higher doses, leading to intolerable adverse events, 5 among other limitations of pharmacological interventions discussed later. Therefore, there is a need to identify innovative therapies in which we describe the potential use of extracorporeal photopheresis (ECP) as a rational approach for patients with SPSDs, specifically classical SPS. Of note, there are no case reports, patient cohorts, or clinical trials have been reported on the use of ECP in SPS yet. Accordingly, this study aims to propose ECP as a potential treatment for SPS by analyzing the current evidence supporting its clinical application.2 EtiopathophysiologySPSDs are associated with high titers of autoantibodies to different antigens of inhibitory synapses, generating low level of synthesis and release of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) on presynaptic or postsynaptic neuronal junctions within the central nervous system (CNS), resulting in impaired functioning. 3, 8Glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD), a cytoplasmic enzyme with two isoforms (GAD67 and GAD65) that transforms glutamate into GABA, has been widely recognized as a primary target identified in classical SPS, predominately anti-GAD65 antibodies. 3, 8However, other autoantibodies have also been reported, and various correlations with SPSD variants have been established, including antibodies against GABA receptor-associated protein and dipeptidyl-peptidase-like protein-6 (DPPX) in classical SPS, amphiphysin and gephyrin in paraneoplastic variants, and glycine receptor associated with PERM. 3, 9The classical SPS etiopathophysiology has been explained by the B cell-mediated inhibition of GABAergic neurons and their synapses, whereas GAD65-specific T cells accumulated in the CNS could drive the intrathecal GAD65 IgG production. 3, 10 T cell-mediated cytotoxicity has also been reported in SPS, as GAD65-specific T cells can initiate cytotoxic immune responses. 11Despite evidence suggesting that GAD65-specific T cells are likely to be scarce and mainly confined to the naïve repertoire in blood, 10 there is a systemic and oligoclonal immune response mediated by stable B cell clones 12 leading to serum titers that are 50-fold higher than cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) titers. 4Interestingly, the serum and CSF anti-GAD antibodies first reported by Solimena et al. in a patient with SPS, diabetes mellitus, and epilepsy 13 were not consistently correlated with the clinical fluctuations of the disease. 4, 11 These autoantibodies are directed to GAD65 intracellular antigens and have been postulated to interact with peptide fragments during GABA exocytosis on neuronal surfaces, exerting a change in the synaptic transmission by blocking either GAD function or synthesis. 14GAD65-specific memory T cells could enter the CNS and mount effector responses against GAD65-expressing neurons, including infiltrating CD8+ T cells 11 detected in the spinal cord of deceased patients with SPS, along with neuronal loss and axonal swelling. 15 3 Current therapiesSPS treatment includes drugs that increase the GABAergic tone in combination with immunomodulating or immunosuppressant agents. 4, 5At the onset of SPS symptoms or appropriate diagnosis, diazepam or other benzodiazepines (GABA agonists) are commonly used as the cornerstone of symptomatic therapies. However, other drugs, including muscle relaxants, botulinum toxin injections, and centrally acting agents, are also used. 11SPS immunotherapies are usually the first-line treatment and include corticosteroids, therapeutic plasma exchange, high-dose intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIg), and subcutaneous immunoglobulins (SCIg). 11Anti-B cell therapies have recently been proposed as a rational approach in second-line therapies, along with mycophenolate mofetil, azathioprine, or a combination of therapies. 4, 5, 11 Treatment with autologous anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells has also been successfully reported in a patient with refractory SPS. 16 Third-line therapies include cyclophosphamide or a combination of therapies (e.g., IVIg and rituximab or mycophenolate mofetil). 11 Autologous non-myeloablative hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) in disabled patients with SPS has also been reported, despite its variable beneficial effects (fourth-line therapies). 11, 17Commonly, SPS pharmacological treatment is combined with nonpharmacological interventions (e.g., selective physical therapy, deep tissue massage techniques, heat therapy, osteopathic and chiropractic manipulation, and acupuncture) in a multifaceted approach. 11 Nevertheless, current pharmacological interventions lead to heterogeneous clinical responses and pose various limitations (Table 1), which support exploring further strategies, such as ECP, that might be added to the SPS therapeutic armamentarium.4 Rationale supporting ECPECP is a leukapheresis-based immunotherapy in which autologous leukocytes are exposed to a photosensitizing agent and ultraviolet-A (UVA) irradiation before being reinfused. The photosensitizing agent 8-methoxypsoralen (8-MOP) conjugates with the DNA of leukocytes upon UVA photoactivation, resulting in the inhibition of DNA synthesis and cell division and the induction of apoptosis, generating a cascade of events. 18It has been approved for the palliative treatment of cutaneous T cell lymphoma, and many other indications have been successfully explored, including graft-versus-host disease, rejection of solid organ transplantation, and a few autoimmune diseases. 18During a regular ECP procedure, nearly 5%–10% of the total blood-circulating mononuclear cells are drawn and exposed to 8-MOP and UVA, and the susceptibility to ECP-induced apoptosis varies from cell to cell. 18, 19 For instance, B and T cells are highly susceptible to 8-MOP/UVA exposure, whereas monocytes and regulatory T cells (Tregs) are more resistant to ECP. 18ECP exerts \"direct effects,\" including apoptosis of treated leukocytes, followed by phagocytosis, which trigger cascades of downstream \"indirect effects.\" 20 Many cell interactions initiate a cascade of immunological changes, differentiation of monocytes into dendritic cells (DCs), and successive presentation of antigens. 18 ECP-treated cells also recruit other modulators, such as phagocytes, via soluble and membrane-bound \"find me\" signals. 21 The \"indirect effects\" of ECP include the eradication of (pathogenic) clonal cells, a shift in antigen-presenting cell (APC) populations, changes in cytokine secretion, and modulation of Tregs and regulatory B cells (Bregs). 20, 22 4.1 Blood–brain barrier: An objection for ECP?Although the CNS has been considered an immunoprivileged site, current evidence shows the effective recruitment of immune cells across the blood–brain barrier (BBB) into perivascular and parenchymal spaces. 23T cell responses targeting CNS antigens are initiated in secondary lymphoid organs, and not in the CNS. 10 In fact, activated T cells may penetrate the BBB, regardless of their specificity, and intrathecally are retained those T cells which encounter their cognate antigen. 24In this regard, Skorstad et al. indicated that GAD65-specific T cells may first be activated in the periphery and later accumulate in the CNS, including proliferation and promotion of B cell differentiation into GAD65 IgG-producing plasma cells within the intrathecal compartment of patients with SPS. 10Compared with serum anti-GAD65 antibodies, the CSF antibodies of patients with SPS exhibit a 10-fold higher binding avidity, indicating intrathecal synthesis by clonally restricted GAD65-specific B cells driven by local antigens within the confines of the BBB. 4, 10Additionally, DCs involved in both primary and secondary immune responses can migrate not only into the perivascular space under degeneration and neuroinflammation, 23 but also into the CSF-drained spaces of the CNS, even in the absence of neuroinflammation. 25, 26 Furthermore, DCs can traffic to peripheral lymphoid organs (e.g., cervical lymph nodes) and present CNS antigens to T cells in the periphery. 26Therefore, although the BBB may diminish the effects of ECP, the periphery–CNS trafficking of immune cells and anti-GAD65 antibody production can justify its investigational use in preclinical models and, eventually, in clinical trials. 4.2 Weighing the ECP pros and consUnlike standard immunosuppressive therapies, ECP does not cause general immunosuppression; instead, it appears to exert complex specific effects 27 across different immune pathways. 22Analyzing the various immune specificities in the variations of the clinical phenotypes of SPSDs, we herein describe some potential mechanisms and caveats of ECP to be considered in the context of classical SPS.Arguments in favor of ECP feasibility for SPSPostulated ECP mechanisms in classical SPS– Considering the pathophysiology of SPS and the presence of GAD65-specific T cells in the CNS that drive intrathecal production of GAD65 IgG, 10 the indirect effects of ECP may be preponderant in SPS.– ECP induces apoptosis that first appears in activated lymphocytes (e.g., affinity-maturated B cell clones), which are more sensitive to apoptosis than other cells. 28– Despite the intrathecal synthesis of GAD65 antibodies indicating that T cells from CSF cells can be more relevant than those from blood in SPS, 9 there is also persistent systemic oligoclonal production of GAD65-specific IgG. 12– Apoptotic GAD65-specific B and T cells may be phagocytosed by DCs that present antigens to T-helper (CD4+) cells, consequently raising specific tolerance to the clonal T cell population. 29– ECP increases CD4+ CD25+ Foxp3+ Tregs induced by a tolerogenic phenotype of DCs in contact with apoptotic cells in the periphery, 23, 30, 31 which can also gain access to the CNS during neuroinflammatory autoimmunity events. 23– Activated T cells of any specificity can penetrate the BBB; however, only those reactivated in the CNS are intrathecally retained. 10 – Following the increase of Tregs induced by ECP, the CSF-drained spaces of the CNS are eventually accessed by such activated cells, even in a non-neuroinflammatory environment. 25– Before the blood-derived leukocytes enter the CSF, they first pass-through fenestrated capillaries and accumulate in the choroid plexus parenchyma, in which resident DCs can skew immune cells. 25 ECP-induced apoptotic (GAD65-specific) cells can induce a tolerogenic phenotype of such unique DCs.– Blood-borne cytokines that cross the BBB and enter the CSF and interstitial fluid spaces of the CNS may also favor this immune regulation. 30– Circulant GAD65-specific T and B cells may undergo immunogenic cell death and serve as the major sources of subsequent GAD65 antigen processing and presentation. 32– Similarly, other SPS immune-modulating therapies can tackle the peripheral compartment (e.g., therapeutic plasma exchange, 33 high-dose IVIg, 34 B cell depletion, 16, 35 and autologous non-myeloablative HSCT 17).– Substantial Th2 cytokine levels drive a T cell–B cell collaboration and may drive intrathecal production of oligoclonal IgG in SPS. 10 In this regard, ECP may restore the Th1/Th2 balance and induce tolerance. 19– Furthermore, ECP can decrease the pro-inflammatory T cell subset of Th17 cells that commonly cross epithelial blood–CSF barriers. 19Additional elements to be considered– Adequate safety profile of ECP. 36– Different immune specificities may exist within the same patient with SPS, 11 and he/she may still benefit from ECP.– The coexistence of nuclear and cytoplasmic autoantibodies that reflect immune responses to multiple CNS and other tissue-specific antigens 4 would also be addressed by ECP.– The clonal pattern of GAD65 antibodies in the CSF remains stable for several years. 9– ECP may be feasible in the case of certain concomitant autoimmune diseases with SPS (e.g., type 1 diabetes mellitus, ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT05413005, an ongoing clinical trial in our center). 37– Previous and ongoing ECP-based clinical trials on other immune-mediated CNS disorders (e.g., multiple sclerosis –MS, NCT05168384, which is also active in our hospital). 38Previous clinical experience with ECP has been documented in other immune-mediated CNS disorders, such as MS, in which a few case reports and small clinical trials verified the safety of ECP, but the results were inconclusive in terms of efficacy. 39, 40 For instance, Besnier et al. reported that ECP transiently modified the course of severe secondary chronic progressive MS with a rebound after treatment discontinuation, 41 and Cavaletti et al. reported evidence of adequate efficacy in a subgroup of patients with MS not responsive to or ineligible for standard immunomodulating treatments. 42Regarding the use of photopheresis in patients with classical SPS, our group has proposed to execute the termed OPTION study, a pilot open-label trial using ECP as an add-on investigational intervention (NCT06703333) comprised of one ECP cycle (two consecutive days) every other week for three months, followed by one ECP cycle every month for additional three months. This trial will evaluate safety outcomes as the primary endpoints, but the efficacy will be preliminarily assessed through changes in the Distribution of Stiffness Index (DSI) and Heightened Sensitivity Score (HSS). 43Figures 1A and 1B summarize the main etiopathophysiological CNS events and postulated mechanisms of ECP in SPS, respectively. Caveats and limitations of ECP feasibility in SPS– The peripheral blood (main ECP direct target) is separated from the diseased organ by the BBB.– GAD65-specific T cells are likely to be scarce in peripheral blood, and the intrathecal synthesis of GAD65 antibodies indicates that CSF T cells can be more relevant than blood T cells. 9– Serological markers are not commonly correlated with clinical severity, and the systemic synthesis of GAD65 antibodies may be insufficient for mediating SPS. 44, 45– Different epitope specificity between serum and the CSF may reduce the potential efficacy of ECP. 9– ECP may be a rational approach for certain disorders of the spectrum (e.g., classical SPS) but it is not feasible for all SPSDs (e.g., paraneoplastic variants).– Lack of controlled clinical trials due to the low prevalence of SPS.– Potential ECP-induced immune regulation may not be clinically relevant.– The availability of ECP providers may also be challenging, including logistical and financial issues, vascular access needs (which, in the case of poor peripheral venous accesses, may eventually require the insertion of a central venous catheter), potential adverse events, and the uncertain ECP schedule and duration, which ultimately depend on the treatment response.With the aforementioned pieces of evidence, being a well-tolerated and safe procedure with long-term effects in approved indications, ECP might overcome various gaps faced with current SPS treatments, which commonly provide a shorter duration of clinical improvement or variable beneficial effects. 5, 7, 16, 17 For instance, instead of the therapeutic approach of controlling disease symptoms (e.g., benzodiazepines and muscle relaxants), targeting some of the critical cells involved in the etiopathophysiology (e.g., anti-B cell therapies) or even \"rebooting\" the immune system (autologous HSCT), ECP possesses established immunologic effects that, in combination with those treatments, may gradually modulate the dysregulated immune response observed in SPS.5 ConclusionsAlthough the exact mechanism of action of ECP remains unclear and requires further studies in SPS, its wide-ranging immunomodulatory effects may be beneficial in this disabling disorder. By exploring the effect of ECP in preclinical models and formal clinical trials, this approach may also foster its use in SPS and potentially in other neuroimmunological diseases.",

      "title": "Ragatmaka Mantra Therapy: Unveiling an Ancient Science of the Indian System of Medicine",
      "abstract": "In the Indian system of medicine, there are two psychosomatic stages, namely ‘Prakriti’ (natural stage) and ‘Vikriti’ (deform stage), that are significantly discussed in the context of human wellbeing. The natural stage is identified as the 'Prakriti', and the deformed stage is the ‘Vikriti’. When the Tridosha (or Panchadosha) becomes balanced (the natural stage), no psychosomatic diseases occur, and when the Tridosha (or Panchadosha) becomes misbalanced (the deform stage), then all diseases appear in their psychosomatic forms. According to the Indian system of medical philosophy, various types of diseases are caused by the mind, i.e., Panchavikara. These Panchavikaras produce the Panchadosha, which causes entire diseases on the psychophysical dimensions. All psychosomatic diseases manifest on the mental or physical level in two forms. Firstly, diseases are caused by the negative law of Karma, where almost 95% of psychosomatic diseases are caused by internal factors deeply rooted in the subconscious mind due to past acquired negative Karma, namely Panchavikara. Conversely, almost 05% of psychosomatic diseases are caused by external factors that are connected to the present negative karma-made subconscious mind. The principles of modern pathology are prominently based on these three misconceptions. Firstly, the cause of similar diseases in the various individuals is assumed to be similar. Secondly, it is assumed that most diseases occur on a physical level. Thirdly, the existence of the soul is denied. Vice versa, the soul-centric system of Indian medicine strongly considers that every individual is a unique and incredible being. Diseases are caused by the different factors for similar diseases in the different individuals due to the deferring law of Karma individually; thus, most diseases are considered psychic Ragatmaka Mantra therapy heals especially the outer subconscious (Manomaya Sharira) and inner subconscious mind (Karana Sharira). This therapy eradicates all psychosomatic diseases from their root causes in the subconscious mind forever.",

      "abstract": "Includes diagnosis, specific treatments, and appropriate communication \n\nI n all parts of our healthcare system we meet patients presenting with physical symptoms that lack an obvious organic basis. The terms used to describe such symptoms—medically unexplained symptoms or functional somatic symptoms—are purely descriptive and do not imply psychogenesis. Other names such as somatisation and somatoform disorder are also being used but imply different definitions.1–3 Patients with medically unexplained symptoms do not fit into the existing framework of a biomedical model that tends to focus on the exclusion of physical disease. However, the exclusion of relevant physical disease may not in itself cure the patient. He or she may still feel ill and seek medical care. Medically unexplained symptoms therefore represent a clinical problem that must be taken seriously.1–4 General practice has a key role in the management of this clinical problem as at least 20-30% of primary care patients have medically unexplained symptoms. Current evidence indicates that medical care of medically unexplained symptoms should include improvements in three interrelated elements—diagnosis, specific treatment strategies, and communication.\n\nThe concept of medically unexplained symptoms comprises a …",

A healthy personality depends on our ability to integrate various aspects of our experience. The three integrative actions of synthesis, personification and presentification may happen more or less unconsciously, but they require energy and our ability to do them varies with circumstances. Synthesis describes the mental actions that bring different elements of our experience together. In the simplest form there is one elaborate the apparently normal part of the personality (ANP) and one, often rather rudimentary, the emotional part of the personality (EP). The classic example is post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), where the ANP gets on with life, until the EP, which holds the traumatic memory, bursts through, creating what are commonly known as flashbacks.",

      "abstract": "Congenital hypogonadotropic hypogonadism/Kallmann syndrome (CHH/KS) is a rare, treatable form of infertility. Like other rare disease patients, individuals with CHH/KS frequently experience feelings of isolation, shame and alienation. Unlike many rare diseases, CHH/KS is not life threatening and effective treatments are available. Nevertheless, it remains a profoundly life-altering condition with psychosocial distress on a par with untreatable or life-limiting disease. Patients with CHH/KS frequently express lasting adverse psychological, emotional, social and psychosexual effects resulting from disrupted puberty. They also frequently experience a ‘diagnostic odyssey’, characterized by distressing and convoluted medical referral pathways, lack-of-information, misinformation, and sometimes-incorrect diagnoses. Unnecessary delays in diagnosis and treatment-initiation can significantly contribute to poor body image and self-esteem. Such experiences can erode confidence and trust in medical professionals as well as undermine long-term adherence to treatment - with negative sequelae on health and wellbeing. This review provides a summary of the psychological aspects of CHH/KS and outlines an approach to comprehensive care that spans medical management as well as appropriate attention, care and referrals to peer-to-peer support and mental health services to ameliorate the psychological aspects of CHH/KS.",

What is depression, then, in modern medicine?

When shame is avoided, pathological narcissism, counterfeit behaviour, hostility or violence may result. A move by a patient into a merged state with the therapist may, therefore, signal anxiety due to the presence of unconscious shame. The way that the therapist deals with the projected shame may be crucial to the outcome of the therapy. The situation may become an intractable \"shame-guilt cycle\" in which there is a repetition-compulsion, without insight, of an unconscious sado-masochistic relationship in the transference and countertransference. Defences against shame are manifestations of a wish to hide from oneself or from the seeing other. Whatever the sequence of cause and effect, shame and sexuality are closely associated. Shame undoubtedly plays a part in many, if not all, psychological disturbances and may be the most important factor in some.",

Diagnosing Meige syndrome is challenging due to its similarities with various movement disorders and psychiatric conditions. Functional neurological disorder (FND) refers to a condition characterized by neurological symptoms that are inconsistent with recognized neurological or medical conditions. Symptoms may include motor or sensory disturbances such as weakness, tremors, paralysis, or seizures. Importantly, these symptoms cannot be fully explained by another medical condition or by the direct effects of a substance. Instead, they are believed to stem from psychological factors. This case demonstrates the diagnostic dilemma of Meige syndrome. It was initially misdiagnosed as a functional neurological disorder in a 42-year-old female. The difficulties in differentiating between these disorders highlight the necessity of a thorough evaluation and increased clinical suspicion in cases of movement disorders. For treatment outcomes to be optimized and to resolve patient distress, prompt and accurate diagnosis is essential.",

Dabei sind bis zu 150 verschiedene Symptome beschrieben worden, die diesem Syndrom zugeordnet werden konnen. Allein die Vielzahl der Symptome weist darauf hin, wie unscharf der Symptomenkomplex charakterisiert ist. We it unklarer als die klinische Beschreibung ist seine Pathophysiologie. Nach klinischen Gesichtspunkten spricht man von einem pramenstruellen Syndrom, wenn es urn die Beschreibung von psychischen oder somatischen Beschwerden geht, die pramenstruell auftreten und postmenstruell vollig verschwinden (Dalton 1985). Das pramenstruelle Syndrom war offensichtlich schon im klassischen Altertum bekannt. Bereits Hippokrates bezog Veranderungen der Gemiltslage in der pramenstruellen Phase auf ein Verhalten des Regelbluts. Die Regelblutung wurde als ReinigungsprozeB des Korpers und der Seele aufgefaBt. Zu den soma tisch en Beschwerden, die im Rahmen des pramenstruellen Syndroms gesehen werden, gehort die Odemneigung mit Gewichtszunahme, Brustspannen mit Mastodynie, Vollegefilhl mit Obstipationsneigung und Ubelkeit. Bei den psychovegetativen Symptomen stehen erhohte Reizbarkeit, Aggressivitat, Stimmungslabilitat, Angstlichkeit, Antriebsarmut, Schlaflosigkeit, Appetitveranderungen, gesteigerter Durst, Libidobeeintrachtigung, Konzentrationsund Koordinationsschwache im Vordergrund.

Damit wurde gleichzeitig ein relatives Uberwiegen der Ostrogenwirkung angenommen. Die gilnstigen therapeutischen Wirkungen einer Progesteronsubstitution schienen diese Hypothese zu bestatigen. In klinischen Studien, in denen serienmaBig Plasmaspiegel von Ostradiol und Progesteron bestimmt wurden, zeigte sich, daB das pramenstruelle Syndrom sowohl bei ovulatorischen als auch bei anovulatorischen Zyklen auftreten kann (Reid u.

      "title": "Grief Accompanied by Suicidal Thoughts After Traumatic Loss in Adolescent: A Case Report",
      "abstract": "Grief is a normal process that occurs following the irreversible loss of a loved one. This process, characterized by painful experiences, varies widely and is influenced by numerous factors, including the identity of the deceased, the circumstances of their death, the individual characteristics of the bereaved, and the availability of support systems. The suddenness and violence of a loss can disrupt the normal grieving process, leading to the manifestation of traumatic symptoms. This phenomenon, referred to as “traumatic grief” in the literature, is associated with an increased risk of various psychiatric disorders, including major depression, anxiety disorders, and post-traumatic stress disorder. The death of a parent represents a profound loss for an adolescent, complicating their coping mechanisms and significantly impacting their psychological well-being. Parental loss alone is a significant risk factor for suicidal behavior in adolescents. When a parent’s death is traumatic, it can further exacerbate this risk, leading to suicidal thoughts and behaviors by disrupting the normal grief process, even in adolescents who were previously mentally healthy. This article presents the diagnosis and treatment of a 17-year-old girl who exhibited active suicidal thoughts and behaviors after her father was killed with a firearm. The objective of this case report is to explore the atypical grief symptoms that can follow traumatic losses during adolescence and to assess the effectiveness of holistic approaches that combine supportive psychotherapy with pharmacotherapy in treating such cases.",

It is considered one of the most complex sensorimotor functions because of the high level of coordination needed to accomplish the swallowing task over a very short period of 1-2s and the multiple subsystems it involves. Dysphagia (i.e., swallowing difficulties) refers to any swallowing disorder and is commonly caused by a variety of neurological conditions (e.g., stroke, cerebral palsy, Parkinson disease), head and neck cancer and its treatment, genetic syndromes, and iatrogenic conditions or trauma. The signs and symptoms of dysphagia range from anterior loss of food while eating, difficulty chewing, and subjective difficulty swallowing food or liquids to choking or coughing before, during, or after eating because of impaired clearance of swallowed material from the throat into the digestive system. When not effectively treated, dysphagia can cause malnutrition, dehydration, immune system failure, psychosocial degradation, and generally decreased quality of life.",

      "abstract": "Whether the experience, symptoms, treatment or neuropathology of Parkinson's disease (PD) could potentially play a role in shaping religious beliefs and practices can be viewed from several different angles. For example, a diagnosis of a serious illness could make one reassess and question previously held attitudes and beliefs; faith in a benign God may be challenged. Spirituality, broadly defined as a quest for meaning and truth, could also play a role in the process of integrating the experience of living with Parkinson's disease, as with any disease or major life experience. Less conscious mechanisms might also be in play, more intrinsic to the disease process, such as loss of motivational drive due to dopaminergic dysfunction. The resulting apathy, which is often seen in PD, might reduce efforts to pursue personal interests, including a religious faith. Cognitive deficits, for example altered social cognition such as changes in 'theory of mind', could also potentially contribute. At a more pragmatic level, problems with decreasing mobility, and energy levels as well as a host of other symptoms and drug side-effects could potentially make all aspects of daily life problematic, therefore impeding the pursuit of religious practices or a spiritual path. In this chapter we review and discuss the existing literature and research, in the hope that it might augment understanding of this little-studied aspect of PD as well as contribute to cognitive perspectives on religious belief and experience.",

The emotional outcome most often associated with stroke is depression (or depressed mood), and its frequency after stroke has led some to suggest that post-stroke depression is a distinct type. The increased recognition of mood disorders, behavioural changes, and cognitive impairment and their effects on patients, has resulted in the development of new interventions, a greater number of professionals skilled to intervene, and increased research evidence on intervention effectiveness. Psychological disorder and distress continue to be under-recognised, some disorders are incorrectly diagnosed and treated, and the relative lack of a research base means that nurses and doctors may be treating disorders in their patients without much certainty about the effectiveness of the interventions.

      "abstract": "Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders, characterized by emotional, behavioral, cognitive and/or social disability, is an important condition to those providing mental health treatment worldwide. With no safe level of alcohol consumption found during pregnancy, symptoms at the severe end of the spectrum can be obvious, easily diagnosed and extremely debilitating; at the mild end of the spectrum the disabilities may be subtle, and often attributed to other causes. Common symptomatology in an individual with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders includes: attention problems, impulsivity, mood disorders, conduct and oppositional defiant disorder symptoms, drug and alcohol problems, impaired executive functioning, memory disturbances, learning disabilities, poor social skills and reduced ability to function independently as an adult. Because of the lack of widespread knowledge of this disorder by mental health providers, especially in the absence of mental retardation or dysmorphic features, individuals with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders are often not identified as having an organically based mental health, and/or cognitive disorder; thus reduces their ability to qualify for special support services found to improve long-term outcome. Despite the great need for neuropsychiatric treatment research that could lead to improved fetal alcohol spectrum disorders targeted multilevel mental health, and social support services, there is much the mental health professional can provide at this time to improve the lives of these individuals. Accordingly, the mental health community needs to be prepared, as the disorder becomes more widely recognized by affected patients and their families; they will be requesting formal diagnoses and sensitive, creative options to prenatal alcohol related problems in all areas of neuropsychiatric treatment.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Disaster mental health is an evolving field of clinical practice that is carried out by a combination of clinicians and indigenous workers. It is typically a set of interventions for use after a disaster or humanitarian emergency that normalize the responses people have to the event. Situations in which disaster mental health interventions may be offered include natural disasters (e.g., tornadoes, floods, etc.), human‐caused disasters (e.g., technological disasters, terrorism, etc.), school and workplace shootings or suicides, or any situation in which groups of people are believed to have been subjected to danger or exploitation (e.g., civil or human rights abridgments or cultural dislocations associated with community or “compound” legal interventions). The philosophy behind disaster mental health is that most people experience normal or common reactions to the event and only a few will develop pathological symptoms that require extensive treatment. The set of interventions employed by disaster mental health practitioners usually consists of outreach, public education, and screening for more problematic reactions to the event. People who may show symptoms of major psychological disorders (like depression, anxiety, or posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)) are referred to clinicians offering longer term treatment services. There are legal protections in place for disaster mental health practitioners who are part of a larger disaster response.",

      "abstract": "Abstract In the conclusion of this two-part article, the authors present the notion of psychiatric confounders to assist non–psychiatric physicians in assessing the “difficult pain patient.” Non–psychiatric physicians need not have a detailed understanding of all psychiatric diagnoses, but an understanding of certain diagnoses will assist in evaluating patients with enduring pain complaints. Psychosocial factors have important effects on the relationship between pain and disability. In one study, job satisfaction was a predictor of future disability in low back pain patients; in another study, psychiatric morbidity in a pain-free population predicted the development of back pain over a defined period. In many patients with persistent somatic and/or pain complaints, unrecognized psychiatric diagnoses drive or complicate symptoms and may precede the onset of low back pain. Mood, anxiety, and substance abuse disorders are common and can be associated with physical and pain complaints. Somatic symptoms often are the core feature of the depressed patient who presents to a primary care physician. Somatoform disorders are a spectrum of psychiatric disorders in which physical complaints are driven or aggravated by psychological factors; somatizing patients have chronic problems, many of which are pain-related and involve recurrent physical symptoms, often in different bodily systems, that wax and wane over time. Physicians who evaluate patients with pain complaints must understand the complexity of the challenge, including the probability that pain complaints indicate underlying psychopathology.",

      "title": "ADVANCES IN COMPREHENSIVE PAIN MANAGEMENT",
      "abstract": "Pain has been defined by the International Association for the Study of Pain as “an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage, or described in terms of such damage.”106 Pain is the most common reason a patient presents to a physician for evaluation.80, 81 As expected, this physician is rarely a psychiatrist. If the patient suffers from chronic pain, defined by Bonica12 as pain persisting on a daily basis for a month beyond what would be considered the usual time for healing of underlying pathology, then many specialists are commonly involved in the care of the patient. The psychiatrist offers special skills in the care of patients with chronic pain. First, the psychiatrist is the examiner of mental life composed of thoughts, feelings, and actions. Patients with chronic pain suffer from depression, anxiety, and other psychiatric conditions often not recognized or, when recognized, undertreated. The psychiatrist possesses the expertise in making these diagnoses and providing treatment for them. When a complete evaluation of the individual patient is not performed, the opportunity for making a diagnosis is lost, and the patient's suffering cannot be optimally treated. Second, as a result of caring for patients with mental disorders, the psychiatrist is the keeper of a specialized fund of knowledge. It is this specialized fund of knowledge about the conditions psychiatrists treat and not the fundamental methods they use in clinical practice that distinguishes psychiatrists from other medical specialists. Psychiatrists follow the same process of evaluating a patient as other physicians. Psychiatrists then offer the opportunity of innovative applications of their psychiatric knowledge, especially to the treatment-resistant chronic pain syndromes. This application helps to reintegrate psychiatry with the other specialties of medicine. These two skills define the role of psychiatrists in the treatment of patients, and subsequently how they can make a substantial contribution to the management of chronic pain. Chronic pain as a field of study has grown considerably. Many individuals now are attempting to define pain management as a separate medical specialty. Although it is impossible to review this entire literature, several advances are especially relevant to psychiatry. Psychiatrists need to understand that in addition to providing treatment for the psychiatric disorders accompanying chronic pain, they can apply psychological and pharmacologic methods to the primary treatment of chronic pain. The multidisciplinary, integrated treatment model of chronic pain is particularly suited to use by the psychiatrist who examines the entire person and not just a particular organ system. As a result, psychiatrists offer the opportunity to provide assistance to other health care providers who are managing patients with this difficult problem.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Patlents with hemianopis following unilateral brain damage occasionally report seeing visual shapes such as squares and circles as complete, even though a significant portion of the shape falls within their objectively blind hemffield. In addition, some individuals report that partial shapes appear to be complete (e.g. they see a semicircle as a complete circle) when the half-shapes are presented entirely within the Intact hemffield, such that their amputated edge is aligned with the border of the field defect. These phenomena are referred to collectively as 'pathological visual completion'. The phenomena are distinct from 'blindsight', in the sense that patients claim to 'see' parts of visual stimuli that fall within their blind hemffield (i.e. they appear to have conscious, veridical perception within their blind hemffield), or else they claim to see visual information that Is physically absent from the display altogether (i.e. they appear to have conscious, non-veridical or confabulatory perception within their blind hemffield). In this article we review critically all of the published reports of pathological visual completion phenomena, and interpret them in the context of the current debate surrounding visual completion in normals. We show that although there is evidence to suggest that visual completion can arise for particular kinds of stimuli in people without brain damage, the evidence for completion among brain-damaged patients is less clear-cut. We demonstrate that an overwhelming majority of studies claiming to show the existence of pathological completion phenomena can be questioned on methodological or theoretical grounds. Significantly, most patients reported as completing partial figures had parietal lobe damage and concomitant attention disorders such as unilateral neglect and visual extinction. We conclude that in these cases pathological completion phenomena may reflect unawareness of visual loss, rather than active filling-in.",

      "abstract": "Examples have been presented of children's behaviors that demonstrate the trauma-learning pattern of re-enactment, repetition, and displacement. They become persistent parts of the symptom complex of PTSD. The encapsulation phase occurs when the trauma event occurs and symptoms present themselves, but the events as yet are undisclosed. The trauma-specific behavior patterns, the general hyper-arousal symptoms, and the avoidant, numbing symptoms persist; the emerging disruptive behaviors are not linked to the traumatic event and reactions to the trauma. The response of the child's social and interpersonal context to the internalizing or externalizing behaviors post-trauma, continue shaping the internal cognitive schema of the child. When the child is unable to link ongoing, self-defeating, disruptive behavior to trauma experience, the underlying fear persists. This interferes with the child's ability to modulate emotions either through altering the persistence of refractory, self-limiting cognitive schema or the inability to use new experience to develop and grow. The flexibility of children to discriminate new information may be lost; the children are either numb to new information or hyperalert and perceive danger. Issues for treatment include children's distress over memories of the trauma and the lack of capacity to learn and develop from new interpersonal experiences. It has been our experience that nurses first must help the child relearn flexibility through self-observation, the element of self-soothing and calming behaviors, processing of new information, and strengthening of social relationships. With new and strengthened personal resources, the child then is able to begin to process the traumatic memories.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION Anger is a frequently experienced emotion for most people (1). When mild to moderate in intensity and expressed in constructive, nonhostile ways, anger can lead to positive, adaptive behaviors such as expressing feelings; asserting one's rights, thoughts, and feelings; problem solving; redressing concerns; setting appropriate limits on the behavior of others; and motivating effective behavior (1,2). Anger, however, is a double-edged sword, often leading to many negative outcomes. For example, chronic anger and hostility are associated with health problems such as coronary artery disease, hypertension, compromised immune functioning, dental problems, and overall mortality (3). Intense anger is often associated with marital discord, abusive parenting, intimate partner violence, and other relationship problems (4,5). Anger has also been implicated in school violence, bullying, and disrupted teen relations. Anger may also lead to major or minor property damage (4), and an overall propensity to aggression and violence (6). Anger is also associated with reduced work effectiveness and problems such as being placed on probation, demotion, and termination (7). For some angry individuals, their anger is totally externalized and entirely justified, leaving their sense of self untouched. For others, however, their anger impairs their sense ofpsychological well-being; they feel out of control and overwhelmed by their anger and feel anxious, embarrassed, guilty, ashamed, and depressed by their anger and anger-related reactions. While these are but a few examples, anger and its dysfunctional expression affects the physical, psychological, interpersonal, educational, and vocational lives of many people.",

      "title": "Different Childhood Adversities Are Associated with Different Symptom Patterns in Adulthood",
      "abstract": "A history of childhood adversities has been associated with the pathogenesis of several psychiatric conditions: major depressive disorder, panic disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, schizophrenia, eating disorders, alcohol/substance dependence, personality disorders [1]. It has therefore been suggested that childhood traumata might be a non-specific risk factor for psychopathology [2].This is in contrast to most psychological models, that postulated a certain specificity between the kind of childhood trauma, the attachment style and adult psychopathology [e.g. [3]].Few studies have dealt with this issue on empirical grounds. It has been reported that patients with a history of maltreatment exhibit greater severity, higher comorbidity, greater risk for suicide and poorer treatment response compared with non-maltreated patients with the same diagnoses [4].Emotional neglect during childhood was reported to be associated with depression, dysthymia and social phobia and with the anhedonic symptoms of depression, whereas sexual abuse in the past was associated with anxious arousal and general distress [5,6].As these findings are scant and not fully consistent, we decided to study the effects of early traumata on adult psychopathology, exploring the hypothesis that different adversities might be associated with different symptom patterns.Operational diagnoses, with their high rate of comorbidity and lack of specificity, might not be an adequate way to explore this topic. It is conceivable that different types of early adversities might produce symptom patterns that range transdiagnostically. Since to our knowledge no study has systematically explored this hypothesis, we assessed the relationship between early adversities (loss, neglect and abuse) and symptoms in a representative sample of psychiatric patients according to a transnosographic perspective.During the period November to December 2010 it was possible to contact and interview 409 consecutive patients admitted, within 1 week of the interview, to all the psychiatric in- and outpatient facilities of Tuscany. A group of 200 people randomly drawn from the general population living in the same catchment area and matched with the psychiatric cases for age, gender and education made up the controls.The adversities of childhood/adolescence were studied by the Childhood Experience of Care and Abuse Questionnaire (CECA-Q [7]) and by an interview for early trauma widely used in the past [8]. For the purpose of this study early adversities were evaluated as follows: (a) presence of a loss event whenever a death or separation (for 1 year or more) from parents was reported; (b) presence of sexual abuse or physical abuse when the CECA-Q or the interview showed the occurrence of physical and/or sexual abuse; (c) the presence of neglect was based on the CECA-Q scores in the scales 'Mother's Neglect' and 'Father's Neglect' using the proposed cut-off [7].DSM-IV diagnoses were made using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders [9]. The symptoms were assessed independently of the diagnoses: the items of several well-known rating scales, combined in a single fully validated instrument [8], were used.Compared with controls, patients as a whole showed an excess of all early life events (below statistical significance only in the case of loss; p value used <0.05). When the patients were divided according to their DSM-IV diagnoses (only diagnoses with at least 30 cases were considered), almost all the main diagnostic groups showed a significantly higher rate of abuse and neglect compared with the control group. An excess of loss events was generally reported, but the significance level was attained only by non-affective psychosis, bipolar disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder. When the diagnostic categories were compared with each other, no significant difference was found.The psychiatric symptoms of the patients who reported the occurrence of no adversity during childhood/early adolescence were compared with those of the cases who reported loss, neglect, sexual abuse or physical abuse. Of the 54 symptoms shown by at least 10% of cases, 17 bore significant associations with early adversities. Six maintained the significance (p < 0.001) after Bonferroni correction.Compared with patients with no early adversity, the patients reporting neglect were characterized by an excess of early awakening [odds ratio, OR (95% confidence interval, 95% CI) = 1.86 (1.06-3.30)], hyporexia [OR (95% CI) = 2.05 (1.13-3.70)], eating restrictions [OR (95% CI) = 2.87 (1.16-7.06)], suicidal ideation/attempts [OR (95% CI) = 1.83 (1.03-3.53)], decreased sexual desire [OR (95% CI) = 2.09 (1.17-3.74)] and sexual activity [OR (95% CI) = 1.91 (1.08-3.38)], mood-congruent delusions [OR (95% CI) = 2.61 (1.04-6.50)], and a previous history of hyperthymia [OR (95% CI) = 1.87 (1.03-3.38)].Sexual abuse was associated with night terror [OR (95% CI) = 2.46 (1.03-5.69)], recurrent nightmares [OR (95% CI) = 1.99 (1.02-3.91)], intrusive memories [OR (95% CI) = 2.96 (1.05-8.34)] and flashbacks of the event [OR (95% CI) = 3.4 (1.16-9.92)], aggressive impulses [OR (95% CI) = 2.96 (1.51-5.82)], hyporexia [OR (95% CI) = 1.99 (1.02-3.91)], binge eating [OR (95% CI) = 2.18 (1.07-4.42)], eating restrictions [OR (95% CI) = 3 (1.02-8)], suicidal ideation/attempts [OR (95% CI) = 2.04 (1.21-4.76)], decreased sexual desire [OR (95% CI) = 2.43 (1.22-4.83)], mood-congruent delusions [OR (95% CI) = 3.41 (1.03-8.96)], and a past history of substance abuse [OR (95% CI) = 3.02 (1.39-6.82)].Physical abuse bore significant associations with eating restrictions [OR (95% CI) = 3.09 (1.27-7.51)], recurrent nightmares [OR (95% CI) = 3.19 (1.11-9.14)], intrusive memories [OR (95% CI) = 2.63 (1.01-6.84)], decreased sexual desire [OR (95% CI) = 1.9 (1.07-3.67)] and a past history of substance abuse [OR (95% CI) = 2.25 (1.05-4.8)].Loss of parents was associated with a significantly increased risk of having weight loss [OR (95% CI) = 2.54 (1.37-4.59)] and grandiose thoughts [OR (95% CI) = 3.38 (1.54-7.42)].As the symptoms had some level of reciprocal association and the early life events also were not independent of each other, we adopted the stepwise forward conditional method of regression for controlling the multicollinearity. The adjusted ORs confirmed that each type of early adversity was associated with a specific symptom pattern (table 1).A huge number of previous studies already reported that early adversities differentiate psychiatric patients and controls, but failed to distinguish among specific DSM-IV diagnoses [1,2]. The well-known heterogeneity of DSM diagnoses and the high level of comorbidity can account for this. For this reason we chose the 'functional' approach proposed by Van Praag [10] and indeed in the present study early adversities seem to influence differentially specific symptom profiles rather than diagnoses.Retrospective recall may obviously bias the assessment of early adversities. However, the excess of even those early adversities that are reliably retrieved, such as death of parents, renders plausible that also the more subjective accounts retain a sufficient amount of credibility.The present study is one of the first yielding empirical evidence supporting the common psychotherapeutic position that different early adversities are associated with different adult clinical states. While these associations do not warrant a causal link, they suggest that the topic merits being studied from different perspectives rather than by adopting a purely nosological approach.",

Few long-term studies concerning outcome of the depressions exist. At least the following factors can be assumed to indicate a favorable outcome: minor extent of depressive symptoms at the beginning, no severe personality disorder, absence of psychotic symptoms, no alcohol dependency or major physical illness, reliable social background, intellectual functions not being impaired, and skillful choice of antidepressant drug therapy regimes.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Disaster mental health is an evolving field of clinical practice that involves a combination of clinicians and indigenous workers. It is typically a set of interventions for use after a disaster or humanitarian emergency that normalize the responses people have to the event. Situations in which disaster mental health interventions may be offered include natural disasters (e.g., tornadoes, floods, etc.), human‐caused disasters (e.g., technological disasters, terrorism, etc.), school and workplace shootings or suicides, or any situation in which groups of people are believed to have been subjected to danger or exploitation (e.g., civil or human rights abridgments or cultural dislocations associated with community or “compound” legal interventions). The philosophy behind disaster mental health is that most people experience normal or common reactions to the event and only a few will develop pathological symptoms that require extensive treatment. The set of interventions employed by disaster mental health practitioners usually consists of outreach, public education, and screening for more problematic reactions to the event. People who may show symptoms of major psychological disorders (such as depression, anxiety, or posttraumatic stress disorder) are referred to clinicians offering longer term treatment services. There are legal protections in place for disaster mental health practitioners who are part of a larger disaster response.",

Consequently, it is necessary for clinicians to learn to distinguish between \"primary\" psychiatric illnesses and those disorders of behavioural control and mood that stem specifically from brain injury. There is relatively little in the clinical literature that explains the relationship between variable states of behaviour, mood or temperament, and clinical disorders that may have long-term implications for patient management. This concept paper therefore addresses abnormalities of mood and behaviour that are episodic in character and are not recognisably included in the DSM and ICD classifications of psychological or psychiatric disorders.",

It is important to understand that stress impacts psychological, physiological, immunological, and behavioral functions that not only require individual coping strategies but affect disease onset and/or progression in both humans and animals. Integrative studies have demonstrated significant consequences of stress on metabolic, cardiovascular, mental, and reproductive health as well as individual fitness and immune modulation. It is apparent that there exist many similarities between humans and animals encountering a stressful stimulus. Individual variation in stress susceptibility is related to genetic predisposition and early experience. This chapter provides an overview on stress concepts, physiological cascades, and stress-related diseases.",

      "abstract": "Psychological reactions to negative life events have been among the most interesting subjects to researchers for a long time. In recent years post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), in particular, has been the focus of numerous studies. This disorder is defined as a reaction to an event that is accepted as traumatic by almost everyone, to an extraordinary life-threatening event, or to a disaster. Psychological reaction to events, which are not directly life threatening, is classified as adjustment disorder and is rarely diagnosed in clinical practice. As a result of experiencing such non-life threatening events, PTSD is claimed to be an adjustment disorder as well. Immigrants frequently report a depressive state in which physical symptoms are in the foreground accompanied by social withdrawal and diminished energy. Negative life events, which are not life threatening and are not experienced everyday, can impair mental health so that the above state may worsen and an immigrant may have a reduction in his performance at work. This state, which is accompanied by such symptoms as embitterment, feelings of injustice, repeated intrusive memories of critical events (injustice at work place, loss of a job, discrimination in a public office, etc.), phobic symptoms, and avoidance behavior towards the place or persons related to the event, might best be described by the term, posttraumatic embitterment disorder (PTED). This disorder, which was initially described in immigrants from East Germany following the fall of the Berlin Wall, and which does not exactly match the diagnostic criteria of adjustment disorder or PTSD, is presented in a case vignette and its differential diagnosis is discussed.",

      "abstract": "The new DSM-5 has a number of changes to addictions and substance-related disorders. Internet Gaming for instance is a “Condition for Further Study”. This means that it is not an “official” disorder in the DSM, but one on which the American Psychiatric Association request additional research. The DSM diagnostic criteria for addictions to the X-subject generally include: – repetitive use of X, that leads to significant issues with functioning; – preoccupation or obsession with X; – craving/withdrawal symptoms when not dealing with X; – the person has tried to stop or curb X, but has failed to do so; – the person has had a loss of interest in other life activities, such as hobbies; – a person has had continued overuse of X even with the knowledge of how much they impact a person's life; – the person uses X to relieve anxiety related to other issues; – the person has lost or put at risk and opportunity or relationship because of X. I suggest that some sport fans may: – meet the above mentioned criteria; – be subject to over-identification with “their team performances”, superstitious conditioning and loss of self-consciousness that may lead to a full blown addictive syndrome, along with comorbidity with pathological gambling. This seems particularly true in Italy, for example, as far as the phenomenon of ultra football supporters is concerned. I argue that further research might be needed to explore the psycho-social consequences of obsessive sport addiction and how this may impact on a person's overall functioning.",

      "abstract": "The clinical observations on alexithymia which were initiated by Sifneos and Nemiah in the earlier 1970s have given rise to a host of studies with implications beyond the psychosomatic field of enquiry. Is alexithymia a pathology of affect or a character neurosis; is it primary or secondary; genetic or developmental? Is it an adaptational deformation related to social class and low psychological sophistication, a life style or a cerebral deficit? Is it global and consistent (trait) or partial and temporary (state)? Is it part of the necessary and sufficient condition for the development of a psychosomatic symptom or is it a nonspecific autoplastic alteration? It is quite possible that alexithymia is one of several mediating processes between stress and disease along with genetic susceptibility, developmental variables, context and reaction to untoward life events, coping dispositions, psychosocial support and sociocultural factors. Therapeutic approaches would depend on whether we are dealing with a primary affectless condition or a secondary one. A differential diagnosis is essential since self-numbing following psychic trauma or a pathological grief, masked and atypical depression are treatable. Blocking of affect may have dire effects on the psychosomatic economy and on the capacity for intimacy. Muscular and psychological rigidity, weariness, ennui and anhedonia may be the only clues to the presence of alexithymia. Since we may be dealing with a spectrum disorder, there is no single treatment modality. There are no controlled studies on the use of psychotropic drugs and psychoanalytic-oriented and behavioral approaches have been shown to be of some benefit.",

      "abstract": "Functional neurological symptom disorder, alternatively termed conversion disorder (FNSD‐CD) (Although the DSM‐5 utilises the term 'conversion disorder', practitioners and consumers consider this to be an outdated, unsubstantiated and often stigmatising term. In accordance with this, the current terminology used in the field is 'functional neurological symptom disorder'), involves symptoms of altered voluntary motor or sensory functions without identifiable nervous system disease or pathology. It is considered a psychiatric disorder and is, thus, listed in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (5th Ed.; DSM‐5 ). As per the nosology of the DSM‐5 , the discrete behavioural or psychological syndrome or pattern observed in FNSD‐CD is assumed to be a function of a problem of, or a disorder within, the individual. Accordingly, the psychiatric approach to FNSD‐CD, as set out in the DSM‐5 , invokes an assumption common to the medical model which is that of lineal (i.e., straight‐line) causality, namely, causal events are arranged in a lineal sequence. The interactional approach, however, which is a development of general system theory in the field of family therapy, offers an alternative approach to understanding psychiatric disorders. Specifically, this approach places the emphasis on the relationships between individuals and their reciprocal influences on – including their psychological and emotional wellbeing with – one another. It draws on the assumption of nonlineal (i.e., circular) causality, namely, causal events are arranged in a circular sequence. From an interactional approach, therefore, FNSD‐CD is thought to be a function of a problem of, or a deficit within, the individuals’ relationship/s, rather than within an individual, per se. This article utilises a composite case study to investigate FNSD‐CD from an interactional approach.",

      "abstract": "Insomnia refers to the complaint of experiencing unsatisfactory sleep, typically characterized by difficulties in initiating or maintaining sleep. Individuals with insomnia are dissatisfied with their sleep quality and perceive it as hindering their ability to perform well in work, school, and social settings. Common symptoms of insomnia include fatigue, decreased mood,irritability, general discomfort, and cognitive difficulties. Stress, on the other hand, is the result of emotional or physical tension triggered by various events that can lead a person to feel frustrated, angry, or anxious. Stress is the body&amp;#39;s response to a challenge or demand, and it is accompanied by the release of hormones. The specific physiological response to stressdepends on factors such as the type of stress, the individual's characteristics, their neuroendocrine system, and the combination of these elements, which collectively determine how the brain and body react to a particular stressor. The activation of the Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis is a response mechanism triggered by stress. Disturbed sleep, particularly insomnia, is a common side effect of stress, varying in intensity. Sleep plays a crucial role in maintaining both physical and mental well-being, making the physiological connections between sleep and stress vital in understanding the development of stress-induced pathophysiology. Current treatments for insomnia include Cognitive BehavioralTherapy, improving sleep hygiene, and employing psychological and pharmacological interventions. However, these approaches primarily aim to improve insomnia symptoms rather than addressing its underlying cause. In the context of Homoeopathy, the concept of constitution refers to an individual's unique structure, composition, nature, and physicalmakeup, influenced by both inherited qualities and environmental factors. Therefore, it is essential to individualize each case and administer a similimum remedy to achieve complete healing according to Homoeopathic principles. This review aims to explore the physiological and neuroendocrine changes that occur as a result of the interplay between stress and thedevelopment of insomnia.",

The effectiveness of medication in the treatment of psychiatric disorder is well established for the non‐learning‐disabled population. In clinical practice, medication seems to be broadly as effective for people with learning disabilities. The effectiveness of medication in the treatment of challenging behaviours is less well established, although evidence for effectiveness is accumulating for some types of problem behaviour. When treating behavioural problems, medication is often used in combination with other management strategies. Knowledge of side effects is important, because people who have difficulty communicating may not be able to Report problems before they become severe. When using medication, it is important to try to achieve the best benefit: risk ratio, taking into account the person's other health problems and disabilities. It may be necessary to measure treatment effects, using standardised assessments or individual measures of target symptoms or behaviours.",

Key risk factors for pathological bereavement outcomes can be identified on admission to palliative care, permitting preventive models of psychological care to be used through palliative care into bereavement. Models of therapy include supportive-expressive, interpersonal, cognitive behavioural, family focused, and specific therapy for complicated grief. Pharmacotherapy can judiciously accompany psychotherapy. Life-cycle issues include bereaved children, siblings, parents, and grief for the very elderly. Grief can be stigmatized and ambiguous in special circumstances, yet positive growth is a desirable outcome from any loss.",

Unlike the term “disease,” the term “personality” doesn’t describe a condition that a person has. Rather, it describes what a person is. In defining personality disorder and demarcating this diagnosis from “normal” personality, one can use either a categorical approach (i.e., personality disorder is distinct from normal personality) or a dimensional approach (i.e., personality disorder differs from normal personality only in the degree to which it deviates from what is average in the population, similar to variations in height or weight). As might be expected for a group of disorders defined by variation along a dimensional continuum, the personality disorders are extremely common in the general population, with a prevalence of between 10% and 18% in various surveys. The prevalence is even higher in the clinical setting: 30%–50% of psychiatric outpatients have a personality disorder and 15% of inpatients are hospitalized primarily for problems attributable to personality disorder (with as many as half of the remaining inpatients having a comorbid personality disorder). Comorbid personality disorders are important to recognize, as they increase the likelihood that the other psychiatric illness will be more refractory to treatment.",

High levels of anxiety and depression may continue for 2-3 months and may be exhibited in agitation, risky sexual behavior, crying and suicidal ideation and attempts. In fact symptoms of depression and anxiety may overlap with HIV symptoms complicating diagnostic and treatment efforts.\r\nThe National AIDS Control Organization of India (NACO) estimates the number of people within India as 5-1 million in 2004.

India Accounts for almost to persons of the million people living with HIV/AIDS globally.\r\nThe objectives of the study was to assess level of depression and coping strategies among HIV Clients. A descriptive Research design was adopted for this study. The study was conducted in We Care Social Service Society, Singaperumal among 100 clients. The data was collected from HIV Clients who fulfilled the inclusion criteria by using Beck's depression Inventory and Lazarus coping Inventory. The Interview was conducted in Tamil. Ethical aspects were considered throughout the study. The conceptual framework adopted for this study was modified Pender‟s Health Promotion Model.\r\n\r\n\r\n13\r\nThe study findings revealed that among 100 HIV Client, 11% of HIV clients had mild depression, 15% of HIV Clients had sever depression and 74% of HIV clients had moderated depression. It also revealed that 3% of HIV Clients had inadequate coping, 7% of HIV Clients had adequate coping and 90% of HIV Clients had moderately adequate coping.\r\nThe Psychiatry Nurse, as a Nurse Educator should aim at reorienting general education system and professional curriculum to suitably incorporate the preventive measures and management strategies regarding HIV. As a Psychiatric Nurse the investigator has provided information to the entire subjects about HIV and method to overcome the problems.",

      "title": "Prevention and treatment",
      "abstract": "Preventive activity in the field of the biopsychosocial disorders of childhood can, like other forms of medical prevention, be classified as follows.♦ Primary prevention: action taken to prevent the development of the disorder in the first place, usually by removing the cause.♦ Secondary prevention: action taken to identify the disorder at its onset, or as early as possible thereafter, so as to prevent extension and to minimise duration.♦ Tertiary prevention: action taken to limit further avoidable disability arising from an established condition.Rational prevention is made easier if there is good understanding of the factors that may be related to the development of disorders. The presence of a risk factor implies that the individual has an increased likelihood of developing a disorder. Protective factors are those that reduce an individual’s likelihood of developing the disorder in the presence of a risk factor (or conversely those that enhance resilience), and vulnerability factors are those that increase likelihood of disorder. Thus, for example, the presence of parental marital disharmony is a risk factor for conduct disorder. If a child at risk for this reason has a good relationship with an adult outside the family, this can act as a protective factor, and if the child is educationally delayed, this may increase the child’s vulnerability to develop such a disorder. Therefore action to reduce risk and vulnerability factors, and to enhance protective factors and resilience, may result in successful prevention. Although perhaps the major responsibility for prevention lies in social and educational policy areas, as far as health professionals are concerned the onus for prevention in this field is largely, although not entirely, on those working in primary health care, such as general practitioners, community health doctors, and health visitors. Therefore emphasis in this section will be on activities that these professionals can undertake. However, those involved in secondary care, such as paediatricians, psychologists, and psychiatrists can also undertake activities of major preventive significance, particularly if there is a focus on high-risk groups (Boyle and Offord 1990). Social policy measures of potential preventive significance will be discussed first.Treatment methods in child and family psychiatry are scientifically less well established than in some, but by no means all, other branches of medicine. In particular, knowledge concerning the effectiveness of different types of treatment for particular disorders is often uncertain. Consequently, it is not surprising that treatment practice still varies quite widely from centre to centre. Nevertheless, much useful knowledge is available and the evidence base is increasing steadily (Hoagwood et al. 2001). This is as true for what does not work, as for what does (Turk 2005b). Further, although there is a need for far more evaluation of treatment methods in this field, there is already a substantial amount of evidence available concerning the effectiveness of different psychotherapy techniques for specific disorders (Fonagy et al., 2002a; Target and Fonagy, 2005; Weisz and Jensen 2001). In the following sections a number of methods of treatment are described, although it must be appreciated that many practitioners often use different forms of therapy in combination. In each case an attempt has been made to describe the form the treatment takes, the principles underlying it, indications and contraindications for its use, and evidence for its effectiveness. Some examples are given of its application in different types of facility: primary care, paediatric and psychiatric. For brevity, the case examples do not contain all relevant information. Names of children described, and some identifying data, have been altered to preserve anonymity.",

Disorders of the nervous system can ruin the lives of individuals and are of such a magnitude that they create many of our greatest social problems. People become mentally ill, insane, or psychotic and a few such individuals in a society can destroy its fabric. People can become addicted to drugs. They can ruin their lives, and their habits create an underworld willing and able to exploit them. Some people become alcoholics. The chapter discusses about schizophrenia disorder. The primary characteristic of schizophrenia is the impairment of logical thought processes. Speech is often bizarre and confused, reflecting a disturbed mind. Thoughts that are usually only remotely connected emerge together in speech (loose associations), and in extreme cases speech may be completely incomprehensible. Depression is another behavioral disorder. It is diagnosed as being either primarily endogenous or exogenous. The endogenous form of depression refers to severe depression that occurs in the absence of any identifiable external source; the exogenous form of depression results from external stresses.",

      "title": "Chronic Pain, Psychopathology, and DSM-5 Somatic Symptom Disorder",
      "abstract": "Dear Editor:\r\n\r\nThe neurophysiological mechanisms and comorbidities of anxiety and depression with chronic pain cited by the authors1 serve as evidence of correlation, not causality. When A (neurophysiological mechanism) and B (symptom of chronic pain) occur together, it cannot be concluded that A causes B, because it could just as well be that B causes A, or a third factor causes both. Regarding the comorbidity of chronic pain with anxiety or depression, it could be that these forms of psychological distress result from chronic pain due to physical impairment, that the pain is a symptomatic expression of anxiety or depression, or that underlying psychosocial issues are causing both. A mentor of mine used to say, “You can’t have a bad thought without a bad molecule, and you don’t know which comes first,” and this paper proves that adage.\r\n\r\nWhen a symptom or condition is diagnosed as psychosomatic, this should not be done solely by exclusion, that is, lack of objective medical evidence. There should be positive substantiation through identification of psychological factors that provide an understanding of what is going on in the life of the patient. The ability to at least ballpark such situations should be in the therapeutic armamentarium of every physician, while psychiatrists should be able to provide biopsychosocial formulations as a core skill. By doing so, we help our patients by empowering them to deal with real life problems, as opposed to placing them in a position of passivity as recipients of a medical solution. Problems occur when psychosomatic diagnoses are communicated poorly, such as “There’s nothing really wrong with you” or “It’s all in your head,” and when patients are not ready to assume psychological ownership of personal problems. Either of these can result in demonization of physicians who make such diagnoses, in the former case justifiably, not so the latter.\r\n\r\nCase in point: the diagnosis of tension headaches seems to have disappeared from the medical lexicon, because everyone has migraines. Despite their potential severity, tension headaches are not seen as medical enough, place an onus on patients to deal with whatever source of tension is causing the headaches, and places physicians who make this diagnosis at risk of demonization for allegedly blaming patients and minimizing their suffering. By contrast, the diagnosis of migraine is perceived as more validating and more supportive, leading to a proliferation of migraine diagnoses and treatments.\r\n\r\nJust as the failure to make a medical diagnosis can have serious consequences in patients with chronic pain and other medically unexplained symptoms, so, too, can the neglect of a psychosomatic diagnosis, in terms of extensive and fruitless investigations and consultations, iatrogenic complications of questionable treatments, and reinforcement of illness–disabled role issues at the expense of dealing with real problems. The mind is more than the sum of the neurochemical parts of the brain, and the failure to recognize this places us at risk of falling into a mindless brand of psychiatry.2",

      "abstract": "The affective disorders include a variety of conditions characterised by mood changes unrelated to life events, i.e. they are not reactive. There is major depression, sometimes referred to as psychotic or endogenous depression, mania and bipolar or manic depression. Any extreme of mood may be associated with psychosis in which thinking may become irrational and delusional. Since drug therapy should be based upon symptomatology and not on diagnosis this should not cause problems. However, it has sometimes been rather difficult to differentiate clearly manic depression from schizophrenia and the boundaries may merge. In typical cases the distinction is clear. There may also be a tendency for the nature of the illness to change over the years and the diagnosis may change accordingly. Until the major mental illnesses can be characterised completely in terms of specific disorders in structure or function, diagnosis will need to remain linked to symptoms and treatment. A recent promising beginning is the association of a genetic abnormality with the illness.",

      "abstract": "Frailty is a common, but under-described, condition in older people, that is now better understood thus aiding better identification and treatment. It is characterised by multisystem deterioration and loss of physiological reserve to cope with insults. The traditional physical phenotype of frailty comprises 5 key findings: weakness, sarcopaenia, weight loss, physical inactivity, and slowness (which are also modulated by psychosocial factors). Several inflammatory, endocrine and nutritional markers have been proposed as contributory, although cause-and-effect is not clear. Predisposing factors are early childhood development and lifestyle, followed by physical inactivity, chronic disease, and anorexia/ malnutrition in later adulthood. These may form a cycle of deterioration. Frailty predisposes to marked decline in physical and mental function resulting from even apparently small insults. This commonly manifests as a \"domino\" effect, with a small initial insult leading to a cascade of adverse events. Several interventions have been shown to be helpful for frail older adults including exercise programs, nutritional support, maximising function prior to a planned interventions such as surgery, and early intervention when an acute insult threatens independence. Specialist geriatric assessment and management identifies and treats unstable medical conditions, reviews polypharmacy, facilitates early mobilisation, offers nutritional support, and assesses social circumstances. Frail older people in whom function has been compromised may be labelled as \"unable to cope\" but in fact many benefit from early comprehensive geriatric assessment to enable them to regain lost function.",

      "title": "Study on Neurological Soft Signs in patients with ObsessiveCompulsive Disorder.",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION:\r\nIn the era of expanding recent advancements and progress made in\r\nThe field of neuro psychiatry , a relatively neglected aspect is complete\r\nNeurological examination which is non invasive, easy to administer and\r\nProvides wealth of information regarding the various aspects of the\r\nDisease. Impaired neurological performance has been documented in\r\nVarious psychiatric conditions and the concept of neurological\r\nExamination in psychiatry ,a time old concept whose significance has\r\nGained importance with blurring of the thin line between neurology and\r\nPsychiatry leading to the concept of neuropsychiatry. Neuro biological\r\nUnderpinnings of psychiatric conditions further propelled the significance\r\nOf neurological examination in psychiatry.\r\nNeurological examination in psychiatry, particularly has two\r\nGeneral aspects\r\n1] Examination for ‘hard signs’ or ‘major signs’ or ‘localizable\r\nSigns’ such as cranial nerve lesion, motor deficit, sensory impairment,\r\nReflex asymmetry which reflects presence or absence of neuropathology\r\nAnd a localizing lesion.\r\n2] Evaluation of performance decrements in neurological domains\r\nWithout any identifiable neurological lesion or disorder (Sanders &\r\nKeshavan, 1998).\r\nAs mentioned above these decrements in neurological domains\r\nMainly includes the concept of our focus “NEUROLOGICAL SOFT\r\nSIGNS” or “SOFT NEUROLOGICAL SIGNS”.(Sanders & Keshavan,\r\n1998)\r\nNEUROLOGICAL SOFT SIGNS\r\nDr. Loretta Bender ,a pioneer in neuro psychiatric aspects of\r\nChildhood disorders introduced the concept of neurological soft signs in\r\n1947 in reference to non diagnostic neurological abnormalities seen in\r\nChildren with schizophrenia .(Sadock, Benjamin James., Sadock, 2007)\r\nDEFINITION\r\nNSS are defined by Shaffer and o’connor as\r\n“ Non normative performance (s) on a motor or sensory test(s)\r\nWhich would be identical or akin to test(s) of traditional neurological\r\nExamination, but elicited from an individual who shows none of the\r\nFeatures of fixed or transient neurological disorder ”\r\nShaffer et al also proposed that to consider a sign as an NSS it should\r\nHave following features\r\n1] No association should exist between an observed behaviour and\r\nA positive history of neurological disease or trauma\r\n2] It should not be a pathognomonic sign of any neurologic disease\r\nOr encephalopathy\r\n3] It should not be indicate any specific CNS pathology\r\nThus the NSS are minor neurological deviation in motor and sensory\r\nFunction that are not localized to any specific area of the brain and not\r\nCharacteristic of any specific neurological condition ,mostly indicating\r\nDiffuse cerebral dysfunction.\r\nEver since they have been introduced they were termed as ‘soft\r\nSigns’, ‘non focal signs’, ‘diffuse signs’, ‘minimal brain damage\r\nSyndrome’ due to their lack of specificity ,validity or localization at that\r\nTime. The term ‘soft’ also signifies the nature of wide but blurred\r\nBoundaries of varying domains like EEG findings ,behaviour disturbance,\r\nLearning disorders, neurological functions that were considered under the\r\nUmbrella of soft signs.(Sanders & Keshavan, 1998)\r\nThe initial focus of these NSS remained mainly in the field of child\r\nPsychiatry with description of concepts of ‘Minimal Brain Damage’ in\r\nChildren with hyperactivity, impulsivity and with no demonstrable\r\nNeurological lesion. Later from 1990 with quantification of validated and\r\nStandardised instruments for assessment of these signs, the focus shifted\r\nTo major psychiatric conditions leading to exhaustive research in the\r\nSubject which provided significant understanding of the neurobiology,\r\nNeuro anatomical correlates, genetic underpinnings , neuro developmental\r\nBasis, endophenotypic markers and predictors of neuropsychological\r\nDysfunction in certain psychiatric conditions.\r\nWith this brief introduction about the neurological soft signs ,we\r\nNow focus on existing documented literature that has changed the concept\r\nOf these NSS, their significance in psychiatric conditions and the various\r\nAspects of their relation to Obsessive compulsive disorder which is the\r\nMain focus of our study.",

      "title": "Quantification of walking mobility in neurological disorders",
      "abstract": "Difficulty in walking is a major feature of neurological disease, and loss of mobility is the activity of daily living on which patients place the most value.1 Consequently, how to measure and assess this is of importance to any member of the inter-disciplinary team. In clinical practice, the World Health Organization international classification of functioning (ICF)2 is often adopted as the underlying framework for the assessment of mobility, which is an individual's ability to move about effectively in their environment.2 The ICF also introduces the constructs of performance (what an individual does in his environment) and capacity (ability to execute a task or action). This has a clear impact on the current methodology for the assessment of mobility.\n\nDifferent pathologies and impairments culminate in abnormal or reduced walking. For instance, in multiple sclerosis (MS), impairments such as weakness and spasticity from pyramidal tract lesions, loss of proprioception and co-ordination from dorsal column and cerebellar lesions, vestibular and visual dysfunction, cognitive and mood disturbance and pain may all contribute (Figure 1). In primary muscle disease, mobility is determined by weakness but secondary factors such as weight gain, contractures, fatigue and breathlessness may have important impacts. The degree of impairment has a non-linear relationship with activity and participation. For example leg strength and walking speed are poorly correlated,3 while many personal and environmental factors may influence the impact of similar degrees of loss of walking on mobility. Figure 1. \nFramework of international classification of function (ICF) as illustrated by mobility in MS.\n\n\n\nImpaired walking can be a marker of both disability and disease progression, and is therefore an important outcome measure in the treatment and rehabilitation of diseases such as MS and Parkinson's disease (PD). In some cases, measurement of mobility may have a direct influence on access to treatment. … \n\nAddress correspondence to Dr O.R.

Self-injury is more common in patients with other co-occurring anxiety or mood disorders. An addictive component to self-injury has been identified related to an increase in dopamine levels from the self-injury, which then disrupts normal dopamine production similar to substance use disorders. Instruments are available to help identify patients who self-injure along with questions that should be asked in the course of a mental health assessment and physical examination. Patients with self-injury should be treated for any underlying mental health disorder as well as for self-injury, which includes therapy strategies and medications. Nurses can play a vital role in identifying and treating this disorder, which carries risk factors including infection, accidental death, and a higher risk of suicide.

      "title": "Resisting Perceptions of Patient Untrustworthiness",
      "abstract": "Abstract A beneficial therapeutic relationship between a patient and their clinician requires mutual trust. In order to effectively treat someone, a clinician has to trust the patient’s reports of their symptoms, relevant experiences, medical history, and so on. Many psychiatric symptoms do not have physical markers that can be verified by clinical testing, and thus psychiatrists have to accept more on trust than clinicians treating somatic illnesses. However, many psychiatric diagnoses are stereotypically associated with traits that indicate untrustworthiness (such as irrationality). In this chapter, I illustrate how psychiatric labels can signal stereotypes of untrustworthiness, and how this can have repercussions in clinical contexts. In particular, I show how perceptions of untrustworthiness cause epistemic injustices by unfairly reducing the perceived epistemic credibility of patients with psychiatric conditions.",

      "title": "Validation of Stress Assessment Using Mobile Phone",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTIONStress is a universally experienced phenomenon. It represents a continuum which no single definition can encompass. Stress is considered as an external load or demand on a biological, social or psychological system (Lazarus, 1993). In general terms, stress is defined as the reaction of an organism to a change in its equilibrium. More commonly it is referred to, as, the tension one experiences in response to a threat (Lu et al., 2012). Cumulative stress in daily life impacts negatively on health and societal well-being. Stress being highly pervasive, is widely accepted as the leading cause of illness and diseases. This presents an inherent need to detect and monitor stress as a pre-requisite for eliminating stress and diseases caused due to stress. Yet, despite the scientific advances of modern times, stress continues to be measured only through a self declared questionnaire. Such a questionnaire has several limitations, including lack of portability to measure frequently.Physiologic responses to stress could be used as markers to quantify stress. As a rule, stress does not exist in the absence of stressors. Stressors are stimuli which evoke stress responses. They could be real or imagined, physical or psychological. Physical stressors pose a threat to a person's physical equilibrium such as an electric shock, prolonged exercise, or deprivation of sleep. A psychological stressor on the other hand could be an event that poses a threat to an individual's self-esteem, e.g., the pressure of solving a difficult mental task within a time limit (Lu et al., 2012). It has been recognized that all stressors, whether physical or psychological elicit the same physiological response. Among the various physiological responses to stress such as, changes in heart rate, blood pressure and body temperature, respiration, skin conductance etc., cortisol responses function as the chief biomarker of stress. Largest cortisol responses entailing longest time for recovery are found to occur as a result of acute psychological stressors. (Dickerson and Kenney, 2004) These stressors refer to tasks of motivated performance (public speaking and mental arithmetic) with both uncontrollable and social evaluative elements (i.e., task performance could be negatively judged by others) present in them.On the other hand, it has been widely acknowledged (Hecker, Stevens, von Bismarck and Williams, 1968, Scherer, 1986., Tolkmitt and Scherer, 1986) that human voice is influenced by stress. According to Chang, Fischer and Canny (2011) the human voice encodes a wealth of information about emotion, mood and mental state. Variations in speaking fundamental frequency, duration (Griffin and Williams, 1987) amplitude (Brenner and Shipp, 1987) etc., provide for changes in acoustic speech signal that are measured as correlates of stress. Alterations in acoustic signals could be an outcome of changes in respiration during stress. Rate of respiration increases during stress, as a result, sub glottal pressure increases during speech. This in turn increases fundamental frequency or pitch of voice. Increased rate of respiration decreases duration of speech between breaths. Dryness of mouth, activity of the muscles of the larynx, vibrating vocal cords affect the volume velocity through the glottis and thereby fundamental frequency which contribute to changes in speech production under stress. These facts tender human voice as a potential source for stress detection. Voice features that could be influenced by stress include loudness, fundamental frequency, jitter, zero-crossing rate, speech rate and high-energy frequency ratio (Rothkrantz, Wiggers, van Wees and van Vark, 2004). Utilizing these facts the stressMobile-a tool developed to assess stress, demonstrates the possibility of quantifying stress levels from voice features recorded in a mobile phone.The present investigation was conducted to validate stress assessment using stressMobile against salivary cortisol responses to psychologically induced stress task on a sample of university students. …",

A third criterion has been used, including several minor symptoms [fatigue, sleep disorders, stiff ness …] and probable FMS has been defined by two criteria out of three. These different definitions suggest that FMS is more than one disorder and that other criteria are probably needed.Conclusions: Our definition of probable or “in complete” FMS is based on the presence of spontaneous, wide spread, persistent pain, fatigue, and peripheral symptoms such as stiffness, of ten modulated by weather changes, stress, and exercise.Our definition of mechanical allodynia is based on pressure induced tendino-muscular pain [tenderness] usually associated with central symptoms such as sleep disorders [TePs syndrome].Fibromyalgia might then be defined by the association of two distinct conditions: incomplete FMS [spontaneous, diffuse pain, and fatigue], and tenderness [mechanical allodynia], both having been aggravated by physical deconditioning.",

Then, the information is conveyed to the brain through the spinothalamic tract that projects to the thalamus, insula, SII and other areas. In clinical situations, a dysfunction of this nociceptive system explains chronic pain that can be simply classified into 3 subtypes according to pathophysiological mechanisms. Case 1: the nociceptive system is functioning normally, and provides (appropriately) a pain message that informs the brain of a local inflammation, or cancer, or infection... This is the situation of chronic pain because of an excess of nociception. Case 2: there is a (past or present) lesion of the nervous system that induces a dysfunction in the pain system. This is the neuropathic pain. Case 3: between the two former cases, there is no evidence for a lesion in the nociceptive system, and there are no evidences for lesion at the peripheral level, but there are evidences of dysregulation(s). These are the cases of dysfunctional pain.",

The essential characteristics of AD is the presence of clinically significant emotional or behavioral symptoms in response to an identifiable psychosocial stressor. Although the issue of boundaries in mental disorders is obviously profound and common, the issue of defining boundaries is especially problematic in the subthreshold diagnoses, for example AD, in which there are no symptom check lists, algorithms, or guidelines for the \"quantification of clinical features.\" There are six AD subtypes: (1) depressed mood; (2) anxiety; (3) mixed anxiety and depressed mood; (4) disturbance of conduct; (5) mixed disturbance of emotions and conduct; and (6) unspecified. In addition there is an acute form (persistence of symptoms less than 6 months) and a chronic form (persistence of symptoms for more than 6 months) after the termination of the stressor or its consequences. Etiologically, the ADs are in the stress-related category of mental disorders and treatment often involves attempting to eliminate or mitigate the stressor(s), or to enhance coping with them. The AD diagnosis in children and youth has been related to more serious mental illness in adulthood. In adults the subthreshold disorder usually remits after the cessation of the putative stressor: Counseling and psychotherapy may be employed with more refractory patients.",

One might argue that the seven eponymous syndromes of the DSM (Alzheimer's, Asperger's, Creutzfeld-Jakob's, Huntington's, Pick's, Rett's, and Gilles de la Tourette's) require a bit of study before their nature is clarified, but all the others either stem from common English roots (gambling, binge-eating, sleep disorder) or are decipherable from their Greek or Latin origins (trichotillomania: pathological pulling of hair; insomnia: absence of sleep, etc.). Borderline, when used adjectivally, suggests something that is in close proximity to something else. Indeed, in its first uses in psychiatry, borderline designated either (a) a condition that approximated another, already well-established disorder, or (b) a condition that occupied a region in between two rather indistinctly boundaried levels of mental functioning. As we shall see, the borderline of our current BPD is derived from both these usages.",

      "title": "Symptomatology and Management of Acute Grief",
      "abstract": "At first glance, acute grief would not seem to be a medical or psychiatric disorder in the strict sense of the word but rather a normal reaction to a distressing situation. However, the understanding of reactions to traumatic experiences whether or not they represent clear-cut neuroses has become of ever-increasing importance to the psychiatrist. Bereavement or the sudden cessation of social interaction seems to be of special interest because it is often cited among the alleged psychogenic factors in psychosomatic disorders. The enormous increase in grief reactions due to war casualties, furthermore, demands an evaluation of their probable effect on the mental and physical health of our population. The points to be made in this paper are as follows: i. Acute grief is a definite syndrome with psychological and somatic symptomatology. 2. This syndrome may appear immediately after a crisis; it may be delayed; it may be exaggerated or apparently al)sent. 3. In place of the typical syndrome there may appear distorted pictures, each of which represents one special aspect of the grief syndrome. 4. By appropriate techniques these distorted pictures can be successfully transformed into a normal grief reaction with resolution. Our observations comprise tot patients. Included are (i) psychoneurotic patients who lost a relative during the course of treatment, (2) relatives of patients who uied in the hospital, (3) bereaved disaster victims (Cocoanut Grove Fire) and their close relatives, ( ) relatives of members of the armed forces.",

      "title": "Poststroke spasticity",
      "abstract": "People who have strokes are subject to numerous potentially devastating sequelae, most often sensorimotor paresis, impairment of cognition and language, and other functional disabilities, including depression and dementia. Of these sequelae, spasticity occurring with motor dysfunction is a frequent finding that has to be evaluated in light of other diagnoses, such as central paresis, ataxia, pathologic stance or gait, and other coordination dysfunctions. Often, spasticity is not notably present in acute ischemic strokes but develops later on, and may then become a major obstacle for achieving independence in performance of activities of daily living (ADLs). Spasticity appearing after a stroke demonstrates quite convincingly that stroke is not a stable condition, but must be viewed instead as a dynamic condition that over time can precipitate additional impairments that were not necessarily noted or present in the acute phase. Poststroke spasticity (PSS) can indeed appear immediately after the ictus, but is most often seen later in the course of the illness. It then becomes a marker of changing or increasing sensorimotor malfunction and therefore requires repeated neurologic assessments. PSS can occur coupled with pain, be noted with decreased dexterity or positioning, or simply be associated with a gradual increase in sensorimotor paresis. When occurring late, PSS can induce changes in the entire health perception of the patient and caregiver.

Life events and stresses/hassles are a more specific risk factor for mental health problems. Social factors are often inadequate to explain the nature and severity of people’s mental health problems without taking into account psychobiological factors. Given the greater effect of culture on how mental health conditions are expressed, there is some overlap between psychiatric and general medical diagnostic constructs rather than near total overlap. Mental health conditions do seem associated with greater stigma (some of this seems related to the categorical nature of diagnostic constructs) and also with greater use of coercion than for general medical conditions, but this also occurs for general medical conditions hence the conclusion of some overlap.",

      "abstract": "The cause of pain and disability in chronic low back pain (CLBP) is frequently difficult if not impossible to identify. Attempts to prove a causal relationship between identified pathological evidence, pain and disability are frequently disappointing. The suggestion that chronic low back pain would be better understood in terms of inappropriate responses to pain and that the concomitant disability was better understood as inappropriate illness behaviour was suggested by Fordyce [1]. One of the key aims of a behavioural approach to the management of disability due to CLBP is the reduction of inappropriate illness (pain) behaviour. Loeser and Fordyce [2] define pain behaviour as: 'any and all outputs of the individual that a reasonable observer would characterise as suggesting pain, such as (but not limited to) posture, facial expression, verbalising, lying down, taking medicines, seeking medical assistance and receiving compensation'.",

      "title": "Síndrome de sobreentrenamiento",
      "abstract": "El sindrome de sobreentrenamiento (SSE) se define como la dificultad para mantener el desempeno, no justificado por otras causas o morbilidades y que persiste mas alla de 2 semanas a pesar de un adecuado periodo de reposo o recuperacion. El SSE es un estado de disminucion del rendimiento fisico combinado con alteraciones en el estado de animo. Las manifestaciones mas frecuentes son disminucion del rendimiento, sensacion de piernas pesadas, perdida de la fuerza, disminucion del estado de animo, apatia, disminucion de autoestima, inquietud, irritabilidad y trastornos del sueno. Multiples teorias se han planteado en el intento de explicar la genesis del SSE: la inadecuada periodizacion de las cargas de entrenamiento que podria generar cambios tanto fisiologicos como psicologicos en los deportistas; la realizacion de actividades extradeportivas de tipo laborales, estudiantiles, situacion personal y la constante y ascendente presion social; cambios de horario, viajes; disfunciones hormonales posiblemente inducidas por el ejercicio. Otras hipotesis planteadas hacen referencia a la presencia de alteraciones en el sistema inmunologico;  eficiencia en las concentraciones plasmaticas de algunos aminoacidos; deplecion del glucogeno muscular e insuficiente consumo de calorias. Debido a la complejidad del sindrome, la variabilidad y poca especificidad en la presentacion de los sintomas, el diagnostico de SSE se realiza por exclusion de otras patologias y requiere un alto indice de sospecha y vigilancia por parte de los profesionales encargados del proceso de entrenamiento y de los mismos deportistas. Sin embargo los intentos de realizar dicho diagnostico por medio de una prueba o grupo de pruebas de laboratorio han sido hasta el momento infructuosos. Entre estas las que mejor correlacion han demostrado son las mediciones de cortisol, testosterona en ayunas, el indice cortisol/testosterona, las concentraciones de adrenocorticotrofina y hormona del crecimiento. En cuanto a pruebas diagnosticas clinicas, se han disenado desde tiempo atras una serie de cuestionarios basados en los sintomas frecuentemente reportados de SSE: el cuestionario del perfil del estado de animo; la escala de percepcion esfuerzo; el cuestionario de la sociedad francesa de medicina del deporte (SMFS); el cuestionario de estado estres-recuperacion para atletas; la utilizacion de zonas individuales de funcionamiento optimo. Al igual que con las pruebas de laboratorio, las herramientas de tipo clinico han demostrado en mayor o menor grado su utilidad y el uso de las mismas depende del conocimiento, la validacion local y la disposicion de estudios previos que certifiquen su sensibilidad y especificidad dentro de las diferentes poblaciones. Para nuestro pais una buena herramienta seria el cuestionario SMFS para deteccion de manifestaciones tempranas de SSE, el cual se encuentra adaptado transculturalmente para nuestra poblacion y que fue con exito empleado por nuestro grupo de trabajo para la deteccion se SSE en deportistas de Antioquia en 2012. En casos en los que se han instaurado los sintomas y persisten por un periodo superior a 2 semanas, se hace necesario iniciar medidas que permitan recuperar al deportista, la mas efectiva es el reposo y la suspension de la actividad competitiva y el entrenamiento; aun hay discusion en la literatura sobre el tipo de reposo, el cual puede ser absoluto, con suspension de todo tipo de actividad deportiva, o relativo, manteniendo actividades de ejercicio reportadas como “suaves”. Otras medidas tanto preventivas como de tratamiento utiles en SSE, son la adecuada periodizacion del entrenamiento, las medidas de higiene del sueno, el control de factores estresantes ambientales y sociales, el adecuado aporte calorico ajustado a las necesidades del momento del entrenamiento y la terapia sicologica encaminada a aumentar la seguridad, la autoconfianza, la autodeterminacion y disminuir la ansiedad y las reacciones al fracaso.

Psychologists consider personality a long‐term, relatively consistent phenomenon, but healthy individuals are able to adapt their personalities to the demands of various situations. The difference for people with personality disorders is that their behaviors lack flexibility and tend toward extremes that impair their ability to interact well with others, causing problems in their work and family relationships. For example, they may be exceedingly sensitive, hostile, suspicious, deceitful, self‐absorbed, or impulsive, depending on the type of personality disorder they have. Mental health professionals consider personality disorders to be some of the most difficult problems to treat, especially given that most people with these disorders lack insight into the role they play in their own interpersonal problems. Thus, people with personality disorders continually replay their complex dynamics and relational struggles in both their daily lives and in the therapeutic relationship.",

      "abstract": "Work-related mental problems can be defined as behaviors, emotions and cognitions that impede the successful completion of a task in a given time frame, i. e., the difficulty or inability to achieve important work-related goals. They are highly prevalent but have been neglected in psychology in general and as a target of psychotherapy in particular. Although work-related problems do not represent a mental disorder per se , they are associated with severe distress and high psychosocial costs. In this article, the prevalence of work-related problems, associated burden, diagnostic assessment and treatment are reviewed. So far, research has primarily focused on procrastination, i.e., the act of postponing or delaying tasks until the last minute or past the deadline. However, procrastination represents just one type of work-related problems among several others. Further forms of work-related problems are presented (e.g., perfectionism, or work-related problems in the context of specific personality types). The relation of work-related problems to specific mental disorders is discussed. Psychosocial interventions are the treatment of choice for work-related mental problems. However, response rates for the treatment of procrastination are limited, which calls for further research into which treatments work for whom. No evidence-based treatments are currently available for other types of work-related problems, with the exception of perfectionism, a personality trait that is also linked to problems in the field of work. Thus, there is a need to further improve the treatment of work-related problems including procrastination. For other types of work-related problems, effective treatments need to be developed and validated. They may be based on existing manualized treatments and extended by specific aspects or modules focusing on work-related problems.",

      "abstract": "What is the best available evidence regarding pharmacologic treatments used to relieve nonspecific fatigue in people with advanced disease?\r\nType of Review\r\nA systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was conducted. Meta-analysis was performed when two or more studies of the same substance could be analyzed in a subpopulation of participants (i.e., with the same illness).\r\nRelevance to Nursing\r\nFatigue is the most commonly reported symptom in individuals who have cancer and also is highly prevalent in populations with progressive life-threatening conditions. Fatigue presents a challenge for healthcare professionals because it can be nonspecific to treatment or illness, ongoing, subjective, and disabling to patients. In addition, the actual causes of fatigue are difficult to isolate, particularly in the person who is receiving palliative care because the symptom usually overlaps with concurrent disease-related problems such as malnutrition, sleep disturbances, pain, depression, asthenia, infections, and anemia. No consensus exists on the definition of fatigue or a standardized method of assessment. The working diagnosis used for the purpose of this review was “fatigue is a subjective feeling of tiredness, weakness or lack of energy” (Radbruch et al., 2008, p. 15).\r\nIn the context of palliative and advanced disease, fatigue can be viewed as an inevitable characteristic of the last phase of life. However, several pharmacologic treatments have been studied in an attempt to reduce the severity of the symptom and thereby improve the overall quality of life. Knowledge of effective medical treatments will be of particular interest to nurses who care for patients who frequently experience debilitating fatigue.",

One of the common referral queries to clinicians of people with ID – ‘Is this a mental illness or just a problem behaviour?’ – tends to stir up more discussion. At one extreme, attempts to understand maladaptive behaviours are merely descriptive and simply default to the ID itself. For example, aggression or self-injurious behaviour is said to be a product of the individual's cognitive disability and does not warrant a ‘diagnosis’. At the same time, the degree to which an individual is held accountable for his behaviour is also placed into consideration, as is the appropriateness of pharmacotherapy, depending on the answer to the referral question.",

The patient in depression displays a state of pseudodementia when he is regarded as having senile dementia by the people around him. The depressed patient falls into delirium when he is embarrassed by an unexpected situation. In other words, the patient shows pseudodementia when he is continuously out of the world of daily meaning; he would fall into a disturbance of consciousness when he is suddenly put out of the world of meanings. This principle is applicable not only to depression but also to all mental diseases. In mental diseases, the symptoms themselves have some meaning for the patient. However, when the patient is put out of the world of ordinary meaning, mental disease presents the aspect of a somatic disease such as dementia or disturbance of consciousness.",

Objetivos: Revisar as características e pontos principais da migrânea. Materiais e Métodos: revisão narrativa realizada em bases de dados digitais, livros e informações de organizações de referência mundial. Resultados: A migrânea é um tipo de cefaleia primária de alta prevalência, sendo mais comum em mulheres. Pode ser com ou sem aura – sintomas neurológicos focais que precedem a dor – ou crônica. Caracteriza-se por cefaleia pulsátil, unilateral, de intensidade de moderada a grave, associada a náusea, vomito, foto ou fonofobia e que se agrava com atividades físicas rotineiras. Deve ser diferenciada de outras cefaleias primarias e, quando na presença de sinais de alarme, também das secundárias, em especial se na terceira idade. Fatores como odores e luzes fortes, consumo de bebida alcoólica, certos alimentos, jejum prolongado, distúrbios do sono e ciclo menstrual podem desencadear uma crise. Seu tratamento pode ser farmacológico ou não, além de envolver medidas gerais; e pode ser sintomático ou profilático – mais indicado em casos mais graves ou refratários. Dentre os medicamentos utilizados durante as crises há os específicos (triptanos e derivados da ergotamina) e não específicos (analgésicos e anti-inflamatórios não esteroidais). Conclusão: Conclui-se que a migrânea deve ser reconhecida e diagnosticada correta e precocemente, objetivando uma terapêutica adequada e individualizada para que se alcance uma melhora na qualidade de vida do paciente.",

      "abstract": "A possible cause for the persistence of symptoms following an injury to the back is put forward, together with a suggestion relating the psychiatric symptoms frequently seen in these cases to the initial injury. A depressive reaction as a primary result of the injury to the cervical spine is postulated, rather than as a result of failure of treatment or of persistent pain. The concept of litigation neurosis and the present state of medical evidence and attitudes toward a “functional overlay” are discussed in the light of this concept of depressive reaction after injury. This brings up a difference in evidence and attitude toward psychiatric disability in workers’ compensation law, since, as the Act at present differentiates between psychiatric conditions arising from the accident and those which result from pain and suffering occurring after a known physical disability, the present concept brings depression in an anxious individual into more direct relationship to the initial injury. The problems of anxiety in relation to litigation, and the effect of this on the efficiency of treatment of depression, anxiety and post-traumatic neurosis, are mentioned, and further work on this subject with particular reference to the immigrant population will be presented in a further paper. A follow-up study is needed to determine the mechanism of “cure” after settlement of insurance claims.",

Abusive drinking is any use of alcoholic beverages that contributes to the development of a physical illness, a mental or emotional disorder, or the destabilization of an economic or social relationship that would not have otherwise been destabilized. This broad definition of alcohol abuse is employed because no single definition of alcoholism can adequately describe the variety of behaviors and clinical symptoms encountered when one studies or treats Navajos whose lives have been changed by frequent or poorly timed intoxication. When providing services to Navajos who suffer from alcohol abuse, this broad definition of 'alcohol abuse provides more insight into the manner in which intoxication contributes to the patient's maladaptation than any of the more strictly defined constructs, be they medical, psychological, or traditional",

      "title": "Suicidal behaviours, euthanasia and AIDS",
      "abstract": "Introduction An increased risk of suicidal behaviours is considered almost a natural concomitant of many terminal diseases such as AIDS, malignant neoplasms, multiple sclerosis, and Huntington's disease [1]. Common reasons for suicidal ideation and acts in AIDS patients are social stigma, withdrawal of family support, diminished or lost occupational functioning, loss of personal autonomy, sense of hopelessness, and concern with the burden caused to significant others [2]. AIDS patients may also express the wish for passive suicide (i.e., stopping medical treatment), assisted suicide (planned together with other significant persons, sometimes with the physician) or euthanasia. These behaviours have been associated with a high prevalence of depressive syndromes reported in HIV- infected subjects [3], but have also been interpreted as a way of coping with the painful and unbearable social and emotional consequences of their disease and with the extreme physical and emotional suffering caused by the many debilitating conditions (i.e., wasting syndrome, opportunistic infections, cancer) that frequently occur in the late stages of HIV disease [4]. Many persons with AIDS consider ending their lives as a deliberate choice for a peaceful, rationally decided death before the inevitable, intractable physical and mental decline [5]. However, the debate in the area of HIV infection and end-of-life issues is limited to moral and legal aspects; the paucity of studies is evidence that the topic is still taboo or at least very much underestimated in the international AIDS research forum [6]. The general issues are regularly raised in the medico-legal press as international incidents emerge, such as the US Supreme Court decision not to issue a federal 'approval' for assisted suicide, but rather to delegate decision-making to individual states. This article reviews the empirical literature published on suicide and end-of-life issues in HIV/AIDS subjects. A Medline search has been performed (using the keywords HIV, AIDS, suicide, assisted suicide, and euthanasia) to locate relevant studies published between January 1985 and September 1997. The abstract books of the five most recent International Conferences on AIDS, and of related Satellite Symposia on Neuropsychiatric Aspects of AIDS, were used as additional reference sources. Definitions For the purpose of this review, 'suicide' is defined as a deliberate act to end one's life. A distinction is often made between 'rational' and 'irrational' suicide: the former refers to the act of a terminally or incurably ill person to hasten death; it would come at the end of an enduring illness rather than an impulsive decision, and would be taken by a competent adult in the absence of mental illness. Reasons to commit suicide in this case would be understandable by his/her peer group. On the other hand, 'irrational' suicide would connote the killing of one's self by a mentally disturbed person, often exposed to an overwhelming crisis; it would generally be an impulsive and violent act, carried out alone and in secret, without the support of a peer group. 'Physician-assisted suicide' (PAS) is the provision by a medical doctor of a causative agent (generally a medication) to a patient, at his/her request, with the intent that the patient will use the drug to commit suicide. 'Assisted suicide' is the provision of assistance to a person, at his/her request, to comply with his/her wish to end life. 'Euthanasia' is defined as an act or practice to cause a person's painless death, with his/her full informed consent. 'Medical euthanasia' requires, in addition, that there is a physician administering a treatment (usually medication) to hasten death (voluntary active euthanasia is another term to describe this action). 'Passive euthanasia' is characterised by the withholding or withdrawal of life-sustaining treatments (non-treatment decisions is another way to describe these actions). 'Non-voluntary euthanasia' is the act to intentionally cause a patient's death by administration of a treatment without the patient's full consent (the patient may be incompetent or may never have consented). 'Alleviation of pain with double effect' refers to the administration of drugs to relieve pain whose side-effects can cause respiratory depression/extreme sedation, resulting in the death of a patient. Finally, medical euthanasia, PAS, non-treatment decisions and alleviation of pain with double effect are generally included within the concept of 'medical decisions at the end of life'. Suicidal behaviours in AIDS patients Epidemiological studies Suicidal behaviours in AIDS patients have been investigated from a range of different perspectives: register studies, post-mortem examinations, evaluation of suicidal behaviour in cohorts of HIV-seropositive individuals, and seroprevalence surveys in persons hospitalized for suicide attempts [7]. Findings from register studies, in which population statistics on causes of death are matched with AIDS register data, are generally considered the most reliable and valid. However, in spite of the attention devoted to this research area in the last decade, the magnitude of the phenomenon has still to be clarified. The reported age-corrected relative risk (i.e., the ratio of the suicide rate of AIDS subjects to that of the general population in a defined age-group) can differ as much as fivefold (Table 1) [8–15].Table 1: . Register studies on suicidal behaviour in AIDS patients.The evidence of lower rates reported in more recent investigations has been interpreted as a possible consequence of better psychiatric management in HIV- infected subjects, lessened social stigma and wider availability of new antiretroviral drugs. The largely divergent results reported by Mancoske et al. [15], who estimated that the relative risk (not age-corrected) of suicide in persons with AIDS was 134.6 times higher than that of people without AIDS, can be explained on the basis of the inclusion criteria adopted: subjects with either an AIDS diagnosis recorded on death certificates or a diagnosis of 'opportunistic infections commonly seen in AIDS' (cytomegalovirus, Kaposi's sarcoma, Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia) [15]. Post-mortem studies (carried out on autopsies performed on violent or suspicious deaths, as stated by the coroner) represent a useful strategy to assess the prevalence of suicidal behaviours in HIV-seropositive persons not diagnosed as having AIDS. To date, one of the largest post-mortem studies that has ever been completed was carried out by Rajs and Fugelstad [16]. Out of a total 16 938 bodies examined during the period 1 July 1985 to 30 June 1990 at the Department of Forensic Medicine in Stockholm, Sweden, 85 showed positive results on HIV analysis. Twenty one (25%) of these 85 HIV-positive subjects had committed suicide; two of them had previously attempted suicide and nine were drug users. Similar results have been obtained by Barbieri et al. [17], who carried out a retrospective analysis of all judicial autopsies on violent or suspicious deaths performed in the Instituto Medico Legal in Sao Paulo, Brazil, between May 1985 and October 1988. They reported that 0.3% of all autopsies were HIV-seropositive. Of these 97 cases, 23.7% died as a result of suicide. No data on the suicide rate in seronegative subjects were presented. Even considering the estimate of those deaths from other causes occurring in HIV-seropositive subjects, these data seem to confirm that a significant proportion of all deaths in HIV-seropositive subjects is from suicide. Psychosocial risk factors Several studies have addressed the need to identify psychosocial factors that may increase the risk of suicidal behaviour in persons with HIV/AIDS [18–21]. It is well established that previous suicide attempts, current neuropsychiatric disorders (depressive syndromes and neuropsychological impairment), and chronic substance use are the strongest predictors of suicidal acts. Moreover, the importance of the following has been emphasised [18–21]: multiple psychosocial stressors, perceived social isolation, perception of self as a victim, reliance on denial as the main psychological defence mechanism, and perceived unavailable social support. Suicidal tendencies appear to be less frequent in women infected with HIV than in HIV-infected men, at least in a population of HIV-infected military personnel [22]. The adoption of coping strategies using more avoidance and less support-seeking was confirmed to be significantly related to lifetime suicidality in a sample of HIV-infected homosexual men [23]. In contrast, the perception of social support, sense of subjective integration, and use of behavioural escape-avoidance coping strategies were found to be unrelated to suicidal ideation in a sample of HIV- seropositive homosexual men caring for their HIV- infected partner [24]. Homosexual men and injecting drug users (IDU), who are at high risk of contracting HIV infection, have been reported to show high rates of attempted and successful suicide, irrespective of serostatus [25–28]. Atkinson et al. [29] examined 105 homosexual men for lifetime suicidality with a sociodemographically matched group of heterosexual men from the Epidemiological Catchment Area Study taken as a control group. The lifetime prevalence of major psychiatric disorders was much higher in the homosexual men than in the control group. Amongst homosexual men, however, no difference was found between HIV-seropositive and HIV-seronegative subjects. It appears that the increased risk of suicide in this group was related more to the higher prevalence of psychiatric syndromes than to HIV seropositivity. Lifetime prevalence of syndromal depression has been confirmed to be higher in HIV-seropositive homosexual men than in the general population by other research groups [18,30]. On the other hand, current depressive syndromes were not significantly different from those reported in the general population (6 versus 5%) according to Rabkin et al. [20], who surveyed a sample of long-term-surviving homosexual men with AIDS. Suicidal ideation was reported by 57% of the sample, but was related to the worsening of physical symptoms and to bereavement periods. Moreover, amongst those who attempted suicide, only 17% did it after AIDS diagnosis. A suicidal ideation less frequent in AIDS patients than in AIDS- related complex or asymptomatic subjects has been also documented by O'Dowd et al. [19], who proposed the following as possible explanations: adoption of denial as a coping strategy, refocusing of life goals in AIDS patients, and neuropsychological changes associated with central nervous system impairment. Gala et al. [31] explored the lifetime prevalence of psychiatric disorders in a sample of 218 HIV-infected subjects and 60 HIV- seronegative persons belonging to the same at-risk groups (homosexual men and IDU). The prevalence of attempted suicide was 22% in HIV-seropositive persons, 17% in HIV-seronegative persons, and only 0.2% in a control group drawn from the general population. Therefore, it can be argued that belonging to groups showing higher frequency of at-risk behaviours may be more important than actual serostatus in increasing the risk of suicide. The same applies to previous or concurrent psychiatric morbidity. In fact, no significant difference was found in the incidence of suicidal behaviours between patients attending a psychiatric outpatient clinic for HIV-related problems and a matched sample of patients attending a general psychiatry outpatient clinic [32]. For most AIDS patients, the first suicide attempt preceded the diagnosis of AIDS or HIV seropositivity. Methodological issues Some caution is needed, however, when considering the above epidemiological data [33]. Questions have been raised concerning the overestimation of suicidal phenomena due to the differential competing risk of non-suicidal deaths in AIDS subjects and in the general population, and the role of confounding factors, such as 'at-risk' lifestyles (known to be associated with an increased prevalence of psychiatric problems and suicidal behaviours). Furthermore, register studies have been carried out in subjects diagnosed as having AIDS, with only one exception, which obviously limits the generalizability of results to the much larger population of HIV-seropositive persons. On the other hand, persons undergoing HIV testing generally remain anonymous, making it impossible to relate a suicide act to HIV seropositivity (unless post-mortem testing is routinely performed in all violent or suspicious deaths). Finally, it should be considered that some suicide- equivalent deaths (e.g., such as those by drug overdoses or accidents) are often recorded as 'undetermined' and that many primary care physicians tend to consider death as the natural outcome of AIDS, whatever the final cause. This can lead to the underestimation of many 'rational' suicides (according to the above-mentioned definitions). A more general remark concerns the problem of definitions adopted to circumscribe the issue of suicide. This is a crucial matter of concern. In fact, errors in identifying suicides may vary to such an extent to hamper the validity of the studies reviewed. The lack of adequate registration of causes of death in mortality statistics can actually lessen the reliability of suicide statistics [34]. Euthanasia and assisted suicide in AIDS patients It has been argued that AIDS is the disease that makes the case for euthanasia [35]. Uncontrolled symptoms, psychological distress and human suffering are amongst the most compelling factors that lead HIV-infected patients to request PAS and euthanasia, and these practices are believed to be increasingly diffused amongst AIDS patients. Unfortunately, the epidemiological literature on assisted death and other medical decisions at the end of life in persons with AIDS is very limited. Prevalence of euthanasia/PAS: the empirical evidence The only epidemiological surveys currently available on the frequency of euthanasia and other medical decisions at the end of life have been carried out in The Netherlands, where these practices are no longer penalized, provided that a defined set of legal and medical guidelines is followed. The criteria, formulated by the Royal Dutch Medical Association [36], were included in regulations under the Burial Act and acquired formal legal status in 1990: The request for euthanasia must be free, voluntary, well considered and persistent; it is made by a mentally competent patient who has intolerable suffering (physical or mental) with no prospect of improvement; pain cannot be acceptably controlled with ordinary procedures; alternatives to euthanasia have been considered and extensively discussed with the patient; an independent judgement formulated by a second experienced physician has been obtained; a written report has been kept. It is not surprising that, as a consequence of depenalization, the number of reported cases of euthanasia increased dramatically from 19 in 1984 to 1318 in 1993 [37] giving researchers and decision-makers a unique opportunity to study and analyse these phenomena. Van der Wal and Onwuteaka-Philipsen [38] have recently published data concerning all cases of euthanasia reported in the province of North Holland from 1984 to 1993 (Table 2). Out of the total 1707 cases, 148 (9%) concerned patients with AIDS, compared with 1326 (78%) in patients with cancer. On the other hand, the rate of euthanasia out of all deaths due to AIDS was 13.41% (148 out of 1104) compared with 2.26% in cancer patients. The decision to perform euthanasia appeared to be associated with the extent to which intolerable and hopeless suffering was experienced, which clearly differs not only between patients but also between diseases.Table 2: . Epidemiology of euthanasia and assisted suicide in AIDS patients.It is of some interest that only slightly different results have been reported by Cooke et al. [39] from their small study to determine the extent to which Californian homosexual men in the terminal stage of AIDS receive medication intended to hasten death. Out of 140 persons with AIDS, 12.1% were administered a drug increase immediately prior to death with the deliberate intention of causing the patient's death. Somewhat contradictory figures have been reported by Laane [40,41] on euthanasia practices in AIDS patients in Amsterdam. In this town, according to the official death statistics, euthanasia and other medical decisions at the end of life in AIDS patients accounted for 21% of the overall incidence of euthanasia practices in 1991. The high rate was most likely due to the fact that about 55% of all AIDS patients in Holland reside in Amsterdam. The rate of euthanasia in AIDS patients was 21% of all AIDS deaths. In his survey amongst Amsterdam general practitioners, Laane found that the overall incidence of euthanasia/PAS amongst AIDS patients in Amsterdam was 26%. This figure was far greater than that found in cancer patients (7%). Moreover, other medical decisions at the end of life, such as non-treatment decisions and pain management treatments that may shorten life, were also more frequent in AIDS patients than in persons with other terminal illnesses. It is of some interest that the incidence of euthanasia/PAS amongst AIDS patients in hospitals and nursing homes is reported to be lower than in those living at home: 71.5% of AIDS-related euthanasia/PAS were performed at home, 26.5% in hospital and 2% in nursing homes. Loss of dignity, pain, unworthy dying and dependency were the most frequent reasons reported in euthanasia/PAS requests. A crucial question in the euthanasia/PAS debate concerns the decrease in survival time possibly associated with these practices. To address this problem, Bindels et al. [42] assessed the impact of euthanasia/PAS on survival time of persons with AIDS by comparing it with that of a group of AIDS patients who died from natural progression of the disease. The patients studied were 131 homosexual men enrolled in a cohort study in Amsterdam, diagnosed as having AIDS between 1985 and 1992. Results indicated that euthanasia had a very little impact on survival time: in the judgement of their physician, life was not shortened by more than 1 month in 72% of cases, and none of the patients would have lived more than an additional 3 months beyond the time of active intervention. Interestingly, a longer survival time from AIDS to death was found in the euthanasia group: authors argued that the continuing progression of HIV disease and the loss of quality of life might be a factor influencing patient's decision to avoid further suffering. Untreated pain syndromes Pain syndromes are highly frequent in subjects with AIDS, and up to 60% of hospitalized AIDS patients and as many as 80% of subjects in palliative care units report persistent pain experiences [43]. The severe and unrelenting suffering associated with AIDS was initially documented by Lebovits at al. [44], who reviewed the clinical records of 96 patients with AIDS: 43% of them had at least an analgesic prescription and 11% had a note regarding pain but not intervention. The inadequate treatment of pain in AIDS patients and the under-utilization of opioid analgesics has been reported by several authors [45,46]. Breitbart et al. [47] found that nearly 60% of 366 ambulatory AIDS patients presented persistent or frequent pain in the 2 weeks before the survey and that only 15% of them received adequate analgesic therapy. Women, less educated patients and IDU were those most likely to receive inadequate analgesia. Prevalence of euthanasia/PAS ideation and planning Available data on euthanasia/PAS ideation in HIV/AIDS patients are reported in Table 3. HIV- infected subjects may be no more likely than those with other terminal diseases to request PAS or euthanasia. This was found by Green [48] when assessing the proportion of people who considered asking assistance to end their lives in a cohort of 57 HIV-seropositive subjects. The proportion of persons who reported having ever or recently considered euthanasia was high (euthanasia ever considered, 28%; euthanasia considered in the last month, 10%) but comparable to that reported in a British cross-national study of friends and relatives of people dying from all causes of mortality [49]. However, significant differences were found when HIV-seropositive subjects were compared with a cohort of HIV-seronegative persons showing the same at-risk behaviours (euthanasia ever considered, 4%; P < 0.001; euthanasia considered in the last month, 1%; P < 0.05). Noticeably, lifetime and recent (last month) suicidal ideation was not significantly different amongst the two groups. The wish to die with dignity and to avoid losing personal autonomy were the main reasons to consider requesting help to hasten death.Table 3: . Prevalence of euthanasia/physician-assisted suicide (PAS) ideation and planning in HIV/AIDS patients.The relationships between AIDS, euthanasia planning, suicidal ideation and grief were investigated by van den Boom et al. [50], who interviewed 60 relatives (mainly partners) of 52 deceased AIDS patients in the period October 1988 to May 1990. In 22 out of 52 cases no medical decision at the end of life was made, and most of these patients had never discussed euthanasia. In 16 cases, death came after stopping or not starting a possible life-sustaining treatment, or as a consequence of the administration of increasing dosages of pain-relieving medication with the possible side-effect of shortening life. The life of 12 patients (25%) was terminated by means of a thanatic drug. With only one exception, all these patients had discussed and arranged for euthanasia in the early stages of the disease. No association was found between suicidal ideation and attempts, and euthanasia planning and arrangement. Authors gathered data on coping styles of the recruited subjects. Results showed that a functional and active behavioural coping style was more frequent in those who discussed the possibility of euthanasia more often and earlier, whereas depressive/avoidance coping was more common in patients who did not discuss the possibility of euthanasia or discussed it only in the terminal stages. Attitudes of HIV-seropositive persons towards assisted death have been surveyed in Belgium by Fleerackers et al. [51] in a sample of 315 HIV-seropositive subjects. Of the participants, 82% stated that physicians should be able to help terminate the life of an HIV-infected person at his/her explicit request if severe physical suffering is present, 50% in the case of psychological suffering, and 26% simply on demand. Of the sample, 67% felt that 'a physician should be able to administer a high dose of medication to terminate life quickly and painlessly.' Attitudes of persons living with HIV about assisted death have been also explored by Ogden [52], who reported findings regarding the unofficial phenomena of euthanasia/assisted suicide in British Columbia (Canada). His study documented 34 assisted deaths, often provided by lay individuals and friends of the patient, accounting for 2.7% of all AIDS deaths in British Columbia. Results showed that a majority (83%) of persons with HIV/AIDS considered euthanasia/assisted suicide as a possible choice. Plans for an assisted death had been prepared by 44%. Considering that assisting AIDS patients to die is a practice more common than generally believed, the author concluded with a plea for guidelines to regulate it. American HIV-infected patients clearly favour policies allowing PAS and euthanasia, according to Tindall et al. [53], who assessed attitudes of 53 AIDS and 52 HIV- seropositive white, homosexual patients; 95.2% of their sample expressed support for legalizing these practices. They stated that 'individuals with a life-threatening illness should have the option of euthanasia available.' These findings have been recently replicated in a survey carried out in 378 ambulatory HIV-infected subjects, of whom 90% were diagnosed as having AIDS [54]. Sixty-three per cent of the patients expressed a positive attitude towards the legalization of PAS and 55% acknowledged interest in PAS as a possible option for themselves. Supporters did not differ from non- supporters with regard to religious affiliation, health-related variables or subjective reports of intensity of pain. Independent predictors of personal interest in PAS were experience of the death of a friend or family member, suicidal ideation, race/ethnicity (Caucasian), less effective social support, and regular attendance of religious services. AIDS was amongst the diagnoses most frequently associated with an explicit request for PAS, as reported by Back et al. [55]. In their survey on patients' requests for PAS/euthanasia and physician responses in Washington State, the authors assembled a case series describing patient characteristics, physician perceptions of patient concerns, and physician responses to these requests. Cancer and AIDS accounted for 54% of all diagnoses made in the sample of 207 cases described (AIDS alone was reported in 13% of the sample); for patients whose prognosis was equal to or less than 6 months, cancer and AIDS accounted for 73% of the diagnoses. It must be noticed that, given the same life expectancy, AIDS patients requested assisted death more frequently than patients with heart disease. Professionals' attitudes towards euthanasia/PAS Results of available studies on professionals' attitudes towards euthanasia/PAS in HIV/AIDS and how they have evolved in recent years are reported in Table 4. Slome et al. [56] surveyed a group of physicians primarily working with AIDS patients and a comparison group working with the general patient population from San Francisco Bay Area using a mailed self- administered questionnaire. The estimated number of direct and indirect requests from AIDS patients for assistance in hastening death was surprisingly low (1.75 ± 5.26 and 3.97 ± 9.95, respectively). Requests were more frequently reported by physicians primarily working with AIDS patients. In response to a case vignette, 24% of physicians reported they would be likely to grant an AIDS patient's initial request for assistance (no difference between the two groups) and 27% would comply with an adamant request (physicians primarily working with AIDS patients, 34.8%; physicians working with the general patient population, 20.5%; P < 0.05). Two variables predicted the intention to assist in a patient suicide: (i) considering assisted suicide as ethical ('in keeping with humane care and with the medical principle of relief of suffering'), and (ii) the identification with the AIDS patient (in terms of sexual orientation, lifestyles, beliefs and philosophy of life). Slome et al. [57] replicated the survey 5 years later. The data indicated that Californian physicians who treat AIDS patients frequently comply with requests from patients to assist their suicides. The median number of direct and indirect requests rose from 1990 to 1995 (from one to two and from three to eight, respectively). The majority (53%) of the respondents reported having granted an AIDS patient's request for assisted suicide at least once (median, 1.0; mean, 4.2; range, 1–100). In response to the same case vignette, 48% reported that they would grant an AIDS patient's initial request for assistance and 51% reported that they would grant an adamant request, versus 28% (P < 0.01) and 35% (P < 0.05), respectively, of the 1990 survey.Table 4: . Euthanasia/physician-assisted suicide (PAS) in AIDS patients: professionals' attitudes and practices.Patients with AIDS or lung cancer, although having prognoses comparable to patients with liver cirrhosis or severe congestive heart failure, receive orders not to resuscitate much more frequently than the latter conditions [58]. This difference cannot be explained by clinical indicators, although it might be associated with the ways in which physicians interpret prognostic information, the feeling of impotence, and the clinician's perception of quality of life and quality of death. Attitudes and practices regarding assisted suicide have also been explored in a large sample of 389 physicians from many different specialities in Hawaii [59]. One- third (34%) of the physicians surveyed had received at least one direct or indirect request of assisted suicide, 9% of which were from AIDS patients. Forty-one per cent of physicians reported having complied, at least indirectly, with the desire of a suffering patient to end his/her life. Ethical beliefs, age, history of assisting a patient to die and religious commitment were the best predictors of the intention to assist suicide. In response to a case vignette, 33% of the physicians reported they were likely to agree to the request for assisted suicide. Hogg et al. [60] recently surveyed the opinions of a Canadian national probability sample of physicians. Out of the first 1153 respondents (who expressed an opinion) attending to patients, 60% agreed with the legalization of PAS. The analysis, which was restricted to 788 physicians (589 randomly selected general practitioners and 199 Canadian 'HIV-practising' family physicians) treating at least one HIV-seropositive person in the last year and with an opinion regarding the legalization of PAS in persons with HIV, showed that 48% of general practitioners and 58% of Canadian 'HIV-practising' family physicians believed PAS should be legalized. These physicians were more likely to provide routine follow-up care and palliative care, showing that a more stable relationship with the patient and a professional experience in the terminal stage of the illness are significant predictors of a positive attitude towards PAS. Nurses' attitudes towards assisted suicide do not differ significantly from those described in physicians. Among 214 Californian nurses dealing with AIDS patients who responded to a mailed anonymous questionnaire, 54% reported having been asked indirectly and 38% reported having being asked directly to assist in a patient's suicide [61]. Seven per cent reported assisting the suicides of AIDS patients in the workplace, 10% reported assisting outside the workplace, and 15% reported ever assisting a suicide. When asked whether they would help a patient obtain a lethal dose, 59% responded positively, and 14% reported that they would administer a lethal dose. Independent predictors of willingness to assist were sexual orientation (homo- /bisexual), nurses' personal likelihood of considering suicide if terminally ill, and a belief in life after death. Amongst the predictors of unwillingness to assist were personal ethics, belief that assisted suicide was essentially murder, and fear of legal liability. Impact on significant others and professionals involved Euthanasia has a significant impact on survivors. According to van den Boom et al. [50] 29% of partners of persons with AIDS choosing euthanasia/PAS suffered from an episode of clinical depression, and a significant association was found between a complicated euthanasia process and complicated grief. In fact, unforeseen complications in euthanasia/PAS are common and extend the moral and ethical questions posed by assisted death. On the other hand, Cooke et al. [39] found no evidence of excessive discomfort in caregivers who administered drugs intended to hasten death. In their Californian survey to assess the emotional impact of assisted death by means of 'double effect', 50% of caregivers described themselves as having been uncomfortable prior to the administration of increased doses of medication, although the rate dropped to 19% 3 months after the death [39]. As expected, euthanasia/PAS practices have a significant emotional impact on professionals asked to perform them. Van Ham et al. [5] discussed a case of a consultant–liaison psychiatrist assisting the suicide of a 42 year-old homosexual man with AIDS and examined the crucial issues of transference and counter- transference. It is worth mentioning that Dutch psychiatrists often provide guidance in such instances but rarely perform euthanasia themselves. The role of psychiatric consultation Few studies assess the role of psychiatric consultation in the management of AIDS patients seeking help to hasten death [59]. Physicians surveyed by Haghbin et al. [59] were presented an hypothetical case vignette, in which an AIDS patient requesting PAS was described as showing signs and symptoms possibly orienting towards the diagnosis of depressive syndrome. Only half of the non-psychiatrists would have referred the patient to a psychiatrist. Moreover, among non- psychiatrists who diagnosed depression (25.5%), one-third declared they would not have requested psychiatric consultation. These findings are consistent with those reported by Huyse et al. [62] who surveyed the members of The Netherlands Consortium of Consultation–Liason Psychiatry, most of whom felt that their role should be limited to the assessment of patients' decision-making competence on the demand of the general practitioner. However, psychiatrists considered a single evaluation session insufficient to assess whether a psychiatric disorder was impairing the judgement of a patient requesting assisted suicide [63]. Moreover, it should be considered that terminally ill patients can seldom tolerate long-lasting structured interviews, especially if they are under the effects of analgesics, narcotics or psychotropic medications [64]. When patients are close to death, psychiatric evaluation becomes difficult to perform. The physician's long-term relationship with the patient may well be considered a sufficient basis for that physician to assess the nature of the patient's request. Conclusions The empirical evidence reported in this review provides an overview on what we consider to be a neglected issue in AIDS care and policy. Suicidal behaviours/medical decisions at the end of life are much more common than expected in persons with AIDS, and physicians caring for such patients should be aware of this. It seems that good practice would dictate a need for all AIDS patients to receive a systematic assessment of psychological state and personal attitude towards end-of-life issues. Multidisciplinary care may go a long way to addressing this. In addition, this can be achieved by specific training of physicians in a number of ways: (i) to raise awareness; (ii) to enhance proficiency and skills whereby these topics would be routinely included within medical care; and (iii) to ensure good liaison and referral to specialized providers. In appropriate cases, mental health professionals could be primarily involved. As far as medical decisions at the end of life are considered, we ought to recognise that HIV infection has acted as a trigger to reformulate the classical, paternalistic doctor–patient relationship, and to stimulate a much broader debate concerning the issues of patient autonomy, the right to refuse treatments, the quality of care for terminally ill persons, and the quality of the dying process [65]. It cannot be ignored, however, that new and puzzling clinical and ethical questions will arise. Does the obligation to assist hold for physicians, whatever the autonomous decision of the patient? Should governments/medical associations provide specific guidelines to regulate medical decisions at the end of life, or should they be left to the doctor–patient relationship? What should the role of psychiatrists be in this new scenario: to consider every demand for assisted death as a depressive symptom that needs to be treated, or simply to evaluate the patient's mental competence on request of the assisting general practitioner? Is legal prohibition effective in limiting the phenomenon, or does it serve only to restrict communication between patients and physicians, resulting in the paradoxical effect of reducing standards of care? This review raises the complexity of these issues. The studies reviewed highlight the need to improve pain relief approaches in persons with AIDS, to facilitate the access to palliative care, and to educate physicians in recognising the critical importance of an integrated management in terminal care, including both physical and psychological aspects of the dying process. The current situation regarding euthanasia and assisted suicide may well evolve rapidly, especially with the advent of changes such as the introduction of new antiretroviral therapies. There are no studies that have taken these therapies into account, but unless they prove to be effective in transforming AIDS from a terminal to a chronic disease, it is possible that a further postponement of the consideration of these issues will occur. The risks of disenchantment and disillusionment with the early hope of these treatments may well have an unpredicted effect on mood, adjustment and approach to end of life issues.",

      "title": "PIK3CA-Related Segmental Overgrowth",
      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics PIK3CA-associated segmental overgrowth includes disorders of brain (e.g., MCAP [megalencephaly-capillary malformation] syndrome, hemimegalencephaly); and segmental body overgrowth (e.g., CLOVES [congenital lipomatous asymmetric overgrowth of the trunk, lymphatic, capillary, venous, and combined-type vascular malformations, epidermal nevi, skeletal and spinal anomalies] syndrome, fibroadipose hyperplasia [FH]). Heterozygous (usually somatic mosaic) pathogenic variants of PIK3CA are causative. MCAP syndrome is characterized by the major findings of (1) megalencephaly (MEG) or hemimegalencephaly (HMEG) associated with neurologic findings of hypotonia, seizures, and mild to severe intellectual disability; and (2) cutaneous capillary malformations with focal or generalized somatic overgrowth. Additional findings can include digital anomalies (syndactyly, polydactyly), cortical malformations – most distinctively polymicrogyria (PMG); and variable connective tissue dysplasia. CLOVES (or CLOVE) syndrome and fibroadipose hyperplasia (FH) may be associated with (1) MEG or HMEG; and (2) patchy segmental overgrowth associated with skeletal anomalies, lipomatosis, vascular malformations, and epidermal nevi. Diagnosis/testing PIK3CA-associated segmental overgrowth is confirmed in an individual with a pathogenic variant on one PIK3CA allele, typically in affected tissues. Because the vast majority of PIK3CA pathogenic variants arise postzygotic (and are thus mosaic), more than one tissue may need to be tested. Failure to detect a PIK3CA pathogenic variant does not exclude a clinical diagnosis of the PIK3CA-associated segmental overgrowth disorders in individuals with suggestive features. Management Treatment of manifestations: Significant or lipomatous segmental overgrowth may require debulking; scoliosis and leg-length discrepancy may require orthopedic care and surgical intervention. Neurologic complications (e.g., obstructive hydrocephalus, increased intracranial pressure, progressive and/or symptomatic cerebellar tonsillar ectopia or Chiari malformation; epilepsy in those with HMEG) may warrant neurosurgical intervention. Routine treatment of the following, when present, is indicated: cardiac and renal abnormalities; intellectual disabilities and behavior problems; motor difficulties; speech, swallowing, and feeding difficulties. Surveillance: MCAP syndrome: Follow up no less than every six months until age six years and at least yearly thereafter to monitor for neurosurgical complications, breathing or sleep disorders, seizures and orthopedic complications. Provisionally recommended imaging in early childhood includes brain MRI every six months for the first two years, then yearly until age eight years for neurologic complications (e.g., hydrocephalus, cerebellar tonsillar ectopia). Consider screening for Wilms tumor following the protocol suggested for Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS) (by ultrasound examination every 3 months until age 8 years); however, tumor risk in PIK3CA-related segmental overgrowth is undetermined and appears to be lower than in BWS. CLOVES syndrome and FH: Monitoring for severe scoliosis, infiltrative lipomatous overgrowth, paraspinal high-flow lesions with spinal cord ischemia, lymphatic malformations, cutaneous vesicles, orthopedic problems, central phlebectasias, and thromboembolism. Genetic counseling PIK3CA-associated segmental overgrowth is not typically inherited. Most affected individuals with MCAP reported to date (21/24) had somatic mosaicism for pathogenic variants in PIK3CA, suggesting that mutation occurred post-fertilization in one cell of the multicellular embryo. Two of 24 affected individuals had a de novo germline pathogenic variant in PIK3CA. All reported individuals with CLOVES and FH had somatic mosaicism for pathogenic variants in PIK3CA. No confirmed instances of vertical transmission or sib recurrence have been reported. Because family members are not known to have an increased risk, prenatal diagnosis is usually not indicated for family members.",

      "abstract": "Psychosis is a symptom complex that may include hallucinations, delusions, disorders of thought, and disorganized speech or behavior. Acute psychosis is primary if it is symptomatic of a psychiatric disorder, or secondary if caused by a specific medical condition. Patients with primary psychiatric disorders are likely to have auditory hallucinations, prominent cognitive disorders, and complicated delusions. If psychosis is caused by a medical condition, the patient may exhibit cognitive changes and abnormal vital signs, and may have visual hallucinations. Illicit drug use is the most common medical cause of acute psychosis. Clinicians should ask about recent head injury or trauma, seizures, cerebrovascular disease, or new or worsening headaches. A subacute onset of psychosis should raise suspicion for an oncologic cause. Collateral history from family members is helpful in establishing the presentation and course of the illness. The physical examination should include complete neurologic and mental status assessments. Tachycardia or severe hypertension may indicate drug toxicity or thyrotoxicosis; fever may suggest encephalitis or porphyria. Suggested initial laboratory tests include a complete blood count, metabolic profile, thyroid function tests, urine toxicology, and measurement of parathyroid hormone, calcium, vitamin B12, folate, and niacin. Testing for human immunodeficiency virus infection and syphilis should also be considered. Prompt recognition of the etiology of psychosis may improve treatment, consultation, and prognosis.",

      "title": "Depresija kao rizični čimbenik za školski uspjeh kod adolescenata",
      "abstract": "Depression is a condition of continuous low mood and loss of energy that affects a person’s thoughts, behaviour, feelings, and physical condition. It is a disease with a thousand faces and is one of the most common disorders nowadays. Although until recently depression was considered a disorder that affects adults and the elderly, research has shown that this disorder is increasingly occurring in children, adolescents, and younger people. Adolescence is a turbulent period in which psychosocial maturity is achieved, identity is formed, crises of earlier developmental stages are resolved. If crises are not adequately resolved, the action of hereditary or various psychological, emotional and social factors leads to the development of depression. Symptoms that manifest in a depressed adolescent can be of varying intensity, may be short-lived, and may be present throughout life. Depression most commonly occurs as a primary disorder, but it can also occur in combination with other psychological disorders. In adolescents, it carries a high risk of developing delinquent behaviour, substance abuse and alcohol abuse, school failure, and suicide attempt. Diagnosing depression in children and adolescents can be challenging due to the specificity of the clinical picture in relation to adults. Therefore, a team of experts participates in the diagnosis of depressive disorders, and an important role in the team is played by a subspecialist in child and adolescent psychiatry. The treatment of depression in children and adolescents aims to eliminate symptoms and achieve complete remission, prevent recurrence, alleviate long-term morbidity and create conditions for normal growth and development. The treatment requires a holistic and multimodal approach, which includes psychoeducation, psychotherapy and, if necessary, pharmacotherapy. With proper diagnosis, choice of treatment methods and the inevitable support of family and friends, depression can be cured. Since depression is a multifactorial disease, which leaves numerous consequences on the further physical and mental health of adolescents, the emphasis is on prevention. Risk and protection factors can be found in the school, family and social environment, which then means that prevention should also be multifactorial.",

      "title": "HEALTH EFFECTS OF COASTAL DISASTERS AFTER THE WATER RECEDES",
      "abstract": "Most disasters produce consistent death and injury patterns. Primary causes stem directly from the event itself and thus vary by event type, e.g., drowning in tropical storms and floods, injury and drowning in tsunamis. Secondary causes are driven by common effects regardless of event type: loss of electrical power and shelter, transportation disruption, loss of healthcare access, attempted repair/restoration, and other disruption of daily routine. Cause of death may be difficult to attribute, typically leading to undercounting. Secondary causes of death, illness, and injury can be divided into four broad categories: pre-existing medical conditions, environmental degradation or magnified exposure, secondary trauma, and psychological effects. All of these relate not only to post-impact outcomes but also may affect primary event survival. Pre-existing medical conditions include common non-communicable diseases that are typically medication-controlled (e.g., cardiorespiratory, diabetic, and psychological disorders) and/or rely on recurring outpatient procedures (e.g., hemodialysis for end-stage renal disease); some conditions require home oxygen administration, powered life-support equipment, or other adjuncts. All categories rely on maintenance care, lack of which turns a chronic, relatively stable condition into an acute one at the worst possible time. Environmental causes include unmediated exposure to ambient environment, degraded air and water quality (including otherwise-controlled infectious diseases), and introduced toxicants, particularly carbon monoxide. Secondary trauma includes motor-vehicle collisions, electrocution, and other injuries, particularly those related to repair and short-term recovery. Psychological causes, beyond preexisting conditions, include disrupted routine and lifelines and extended effects (e.g., prolonged disruption, personal loss, subsequent events). Most secondary health effects are recurrent and thus predictable well in advance of an incident. Even if they canâ€™t be prevented in entirety they can be lessened by awareness and deliberate action on the part of governments, institutions, support services, and individuals, including more realistic assumptions, expanded insurance coverage, and refocused preparedness campaigns.",

      "abstract": "Dissociation refers to a breakdown of the normal connection between the processes of consciousness and memory;it has been defined as a lack of integration of thoughts,feelings,and experiences into the stream of consciousness.It was a mechanism to keep people unconscious of their traumatic experience.Those who have traumatic experience almost inevitably show some dissociative symptoms.Therefore,dissociation is now often used to diagnose the mental and behavioral disorders.As for the etiological agent of dissociation,some researchers thought it is engendered by the environmental influences and others advanced the hypothesis that it is decided by heredity.There are three confusing concepts of dissociation about clinical symptoms: dissociative experience,dissociative symptom,and dissociative disorder.In child and adolescent psychiatry,improper diagnoses of dissociation are frequently made: it receives inappropriate treatment or is simply ignored.The proper assessment of the dissociative symptoms,however,is of great importance in their clinical treatment.",

      "title": "Medically unexplained physical symptoms",
      "abstract": "Concern about physical symptoms is a common reason for people to seek medical help. Many of these symptoms, such as headache, chest pain, weakness, dizziness, and fatigue, remain unexplained by identi­fiable disease even after careful medical assessment. Several general terms have been used to describe these types of symptom— somatoform, medically un­explained, and functional. We prefer the terms ‘med­ically unexplained physical symptom’ or ‘functional symptom’, because they imply a disturbance of some kind in bodily functioning without implying that the symptom is psychogenic. Patients and doctors often assume that a physical symptom implies that a phys­ical pathology exists. However, commonly experienced and often severe, distressing, and disabling symp­toms, such as menstrual pain or ‘tension headache’, indicate that this is not always the case. By assuming that a physical symptom is explained by physical dis­ease/ pathology, we may be subjecting the patient to unnecessary tests and hospital visits, adding to pa­tient distress, and failing to deliver the integrated management required. There are many kinds of these symptoms (Box 25.1), presenting across healthcare settings. They are con­sidered in this psychiatry textbook because (1) psy­chological factors (including, at times, psychiatric disorder) are important in aetiology and (2) psycho­logical and behavioural interventions have a funda­mental role in treatment A major obstacle to effective management of pa­tients with functional symptoms is that they feel their doctor does not believe them. They are concerned that they may be thought to be ‘putting it on’. Note that the deliberate manufacture or exaggeration of symptoms or signs (malingering) is quite different (see p. 359). Diagnoses of three kinds may be given: … ● Descriptive physical syndromes. These include fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome, non- cardiac chest pain, chronic pain syndrome, and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Although the specific terms are useful in everyday medical practice, there is substantial overlap, and many patients with, for example, fibromyalgia will also have IBS. ● Psychiatric syndromes as the primary cause of the functional symptoms. Psychiatric disorders, such as depression, anxiety, and adjustment, are common primary causes of functional symptoms, and commonly present via the general hospital’s emergency department or cardiology clinic.",

      "abstract": "In DSM-5, the sector of ‘Other Conditions That May Be a Focus of Clinical Attention’, has discussed about cults. The said section covers all conditions and problems that are a focus of clinical attention or that may otherwise affect the diagnosis, course, prognosis, or treatment of a patient's mental disorder. While cults are usually led by charismatic leaders, who offer acceptance and guidance to troubled followers, cult followers are strongly controlled and forced to dissolve commitment to family and others to serve the cult leader's directives and personal needs. On the other hand, there were many cult leaders, who have been convicted of violent or non-violent crimes, as a commander or committer, before, during or after their period as a cult leader. While many bio-psycho-social factors involve in the grouping and formation of sects or cults, numerous dynamics, too, may prepare the group’s state of mind for perpetrating crime. Among a number of conceivable historical, cultural, or radical causes, while psychopathy, at all times, have had a firm position in forensic psychiatry, narcissism, whether as a primary trait or as a misleadingly stirred quality, have been generally over looked. Interrelationship between narcissism and psychopathy, from one hand, and the scarce set of circumstances, on the other hand, may create a situation, full of mix-ups, which can be continued melancholically and hazardously. In the present article, the likely role of narcissism, among numerous mechanisms that may involve in establishment of sectarian misbehavior, will be discussed in more detail.

      "abstract": "Abstract The core problem of addicts is addiction and not the other mental disorders that may be present. This is because the addictive thinking, feeling and acting is the dominant defense that blocks success in therapy. The therapist and the patient therefore externally symbolize with chairs 1. The patient’s healthy adult thinking, 2. His self-protection through his addictive thinking and feeling, and 3. His symptoms in everyday life. They develop further his addictive thinking and feeling in the as-if mode of play and paradoxically work out the positive meaning of this defense within the framework of his self-regulation. The patient’s self-development initially should take place in the symptom production. This is because metacognitive confusion prevents patients with addiction from adequately processing deeper conflicts. The patient should first gain ego control over his addictive self-regulation. This disorder-specific approach is indicated for harmful use or dependence on alcohol or drugs, and also for non-substance-related addictions such as eating disorders, internet addiction, sex addiction, and other addictions. It makes the experiences of Alcoholics Anonymous fruitful in digested form for depth psychological, behavioral, and systemic therapy.",

It is suggested that the extent of such injury is unrelated to the magnitude of shock current and that the timing of the ldquodiffuse electrical injuryrdquo may be indefinitely delayed with respect to the time of the sustained shock. Other reports refer to possible shock injury mechanisms that manifest solely with neuropsychological symptoms. A critical examination of this literature reveals no mechanistic basis for the association of the proposed physical symptoms of diffuse electrical injury with remote injury. Additionally, serious errors in the stated methodology of the publications citing the existence of diffuse electrical injury cast doubt upon the scientific basis for the stated conclusions.",

Some of these symptoms disappear quickly, whereas others persist. This chapter focuses mostly on symptoms that cannot be easily understood from a solely biomedical perspective, the so-called functional somatic symptoms (FSS). The symptoms referred to as FSS are comprised of varying combinations of pain in different parts of the body, functional disturbances attributed to organs like cardiovascular or gastrointestinal dysfunctions or dizziness, and symptoms surrounding fatigue. Their main characteristics, pathophysiology, and etiology are briefly discussed. In addition, the authors discuss the relation between FSS and the current DSM classification of somatic symptom disorder and other related diagnostic categories.",

      "abstract": "Four cases were diagnosed as schizophrenic by careful observation and documentation. The patients had the following in common: 1. By all symptoms no schizophrenia was immediately apparent. It required time and attention to establish the diagnosis in all cases. But then it remained firmly established by the basic accepted criteria. 2. The patients were persons of good intelligence and had other assets as well. They tended to mobilize many mechanisms of defense as \"ego\" structure threatened to \"weaken\" further. These consisted both of additional neurotic defenses and some tendency toward \"acting-out,\" but no change was manifested in areas considered schizophrenic. Therefore, we are considering a category of individuals who belong to the group of schizophrenias according to legitimate definition, but apparently no more capable of disorganization, or display of blatant \"accessory\" symptoms, than the next person. In each of these instances, schizophrenic psychopathology comprised one part of the total picture, but did not thereby characterize the case. This concept differs from Hoch's \"pseudoneurotic schizophrenia\" (9) in that the latter describes an illness which is schizophrenic for all important clinical purposes: disorganization potential, therapeutic technique required, goals of therapy, and prognosis. By way of contrast, perhaps the best diagnostic approach to the above \"pseudoschizophrenic neurotic\" cases is the one or two paragraph description of psychopathology, with all factors evaluated on an individual basis.",

It is based on the analysis of clinical characteristics and pathology of a series of 278 cases submitted to different methods of treatment, and on physiological data of the literature. The hypothesis is that trigeminal neuralgia is a sort of sensory reflex epilepsy. The posterior root, damaged and distorted by a vessel or compressed by other lesions shows demyelination, micro-neuromas, and so on. At the site of this chronic damage ectopic impulses and afterdischarges are generated; the gasserian ganglion cells too give rise to spontaneous impulse generation. Owing to this chronic anomalous afferent barrage, an epileptic subliminal focus is \"kindled\" in the trigeminal nucleus. The pain paroxysms develop when this subliminal activity is driven in prolonged seizure discharges by peripheral (trigger zone stimulation) or other (not perceived) afferences. Clinical characteristics of the attacks (triggering by innocuous stimulations; persistence of pain after stimulus stops; diffusion of pain outside the stimulated division; refractory period after each paroxysm; increase in frequency of the attacks up to an epileptic-like status; sensibility to carbamazepine and phenytoin) and recurrence following diverse procedures are discussed on the basis of experimental research in reflex epilepsy and \"kindling\". If this hypothesis is true, the treatment of choice of trigeminal neuralgia should be a direct approach to the posterior fossa in order to relieve neurovascular compression which, in more than 75% of the cases, is the causative factor of the disease.",

In Malaysia, psychiatric disorders were responsible for 8.6% of the total Disability Adjusted Life Years and were ranked fourth as the leading cause of burden of disease by disease categories1. More and more evidence shows that physical illnesses are strongly associated with psychiatric disorders. Those with physical illnesses have much higher risk of developing psychiatric disorders compared to that without2-3. The mechanisms of co-morbidity of psychiatric and physical illness are complex. It is a two-way interaction and there are five different possible ways to describe this4-5. Co-incidence or By-chance In clinical practice, the psychiatric illness may be coincidental and unrelated to physical problems, as both physical and psychiatric conditions are common in the general population. Such disorders do, however, complicate the management of the physical illness. For example, depression can predate the onset of the medical illness in up to 25% of patients with co morbid depression, and it is associated with an increase in somatic complaints5. Common cause for both Here, either patient factors or non-disease factors may have given rise to both; for example, stressful life events in a vulnerable person may precipitate both a stroke and a depressive illness6.",

Symptoms tend to vary in manifestation and time course, worsen during flares, and affect patient's quality of life.1 A dysregulation of the brain-gut axis that interacts with visceral hypersensitivity and associated with observed digestive motor disturbances and micro-inflammation of the gut, with possibly an imbalance of the intestinal bio-flora. These are factors that may be responsible for the symptoms generation. Psychosocial stressors may then interact with biological factors and are modulated by cultural beliefs and practices resulting in variations on observed symptoms constellation and health seeking behaviours, a biopsychosocial disorder.\r\n\r\nA better outcome is achievable if a positive diagnosis of IBS is made, based on clinical symptoms (in the absence of alarm signs) alone, rather than making a diagnosis by exclusion. Several diagnostic exist and each new criterion refers to the insufficiencies of the previous ones. The most commonly accepted diagnostic include the original Manning and the subsequent series of foundation defined criteria. A formal definition according to the Rome III is recurrent abdominal pain or discomfort for at least 3 days per month during the previous 3 months associated with two or more of the following with onset at least 6 months before diagnosis: (1) symptoms improvement with defecation, (2) onset associated with a change in the frequency of stools and (3) onset associated with a change in form or appearance of stools.1-4\r\n\r\nThe prevalence of IBS varies across the world, ranging from as high as 10%-20% in the West,5,6 to as low as 4.2% in India.7 There is a perception that IBS is less of a problem in Asia and its epidemiology to be different. In addition, the prevalence rates of IBS itself vary in Asia with higher rates being documented from more affluent urban communities of Japan, Singapore and Guangzhou in China.8-10 Prevalence rates also differ within the same country (Beijing 7.3% and Guangzhou 12%) and within the same racial community from different countries.8,11,12 Such observed differences may be due to the different (Manning vs Rome II vs Rome III) used to diagnose IBS or due to a different target population studied. However more recently, Park et al13 reported similar prevalence rates using Rome II (8%) and Rome III (9%) in a Korean IBS population.\r\n\r\nIn this study Makharia et al reported a prevalence rate of 4% which is in good agreement (4.2%) with a previous study by Ghoshal et al.7 This is interesting as the population involved in both studies were quite different. Ghoshal looked at subjects from mainly the hospital/clinic setting (recruitment centres from Northern, Central and Southern India) while the present study was solely community based (Northern India). Furthermore Makharia's group used a questionnaire based on the new Rome III module while Ghoshal's local criteria was more clinical and practical. Yet the resulting prevalence rates from both centers were quite similar. The observed prevalence rate is low compared to data from other Asian centers and also lower than the Western prevalence rates. We would expect lower prevalence rates from a rural community in Northern India, as IBS is recognized to be a disorder of developed nations and communities.8-10 However, Ghoshal's hospital based study confirmed that the prevalence rate is indeed low in India.\r\n\r\nOne possible explanation for the low prevalence rate could be from the use of different diagnostic tools or for the detection of a variable condition that is solely symptom based. One of the weaknesses of this study is that the used questionnaire was not validated for the study population. This might affect the quality of data acquired. However, a study from Nam et al14 using validated Rome III in Korea gave a prevalence rate of 8.2% which is still lower than the prevalence rates observed from communities in Europe or America.\r\n\r\nAnother unique observation is the much higher incidence of diarrhea predominant IBS (1.5%) compared to IBS constipation (0.3%). This was also reported from Ghoshal's study who also suggested that in general, Indians tend to pass 1-2 soft stool per day. This may be due to the higher fiber intake and faster gut transit time. Is it possible that another form of functional bowel or IBS exist in this sub-continent which is different from the West? Western patients tend to be more neurotic compared to the Asian patients who are more likely to be post infectious. This difference may also arise from other contributing factors such as race, different cultural practices, variation in food intake and co-existing lactose intolerance.\r\n\r\nThe other notable difference reported from this study is the increasing prevalence of IBS with advancing age, with the maximum in the 50-60 age groups. Across Asia, it has been noted that the prevalence of IBS is higher in the younger age group.8,9,11,12,15,16 In a rural community where the younger folks need to work hard for daily sustenance, symptoms of abdominal discomfort or alteration of pattern is often too trivial to be considered as abnormal enough to visit the hospital. The time of day in which the study was conducted in this native rural community of Northern India would also be important.\r\n\r\nThe often quoted male preponderance in Asian Indian IBS population was not demonstrated in this study. The prevalence of IBS was significantly higher in females compared with males. In the previous study by Ghoshal et al7 the subset of complainants in the study group showed a distinct predominance of male gender (68% vs 32%). The explanation given by the authors is that in a male dominant society, the health seeking behaviour of males can best account for the disparity in prevalence rates seen in the hospital/clinic setting compared to a rural community setting.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, this study by Makharia et al is the first large scale IBS study in India using the Rome III criteria. However, this study has few limitations. Firstly, the diagnostic tool used, the Rome III questionnaire was not validated for this population. Secondly, it was also noted that the Glasgow pictorial stool chart was not used to determine stool forms. Even if patients can describe their stool forms adequately, pictorial definition is still the best method of evaluation since patient's perception is often very different from the actual stool form. Despite all of these, this study has contributed to a better understanding of the epidemiology of IBS in India, by providing an alternative view point to the more accepted norms.",

      "abstract": "Patients with anxiety and/or depressive disorders often experience sudden intense feelings of distressing emotions, including sadness, anxiety, loneliness, gloom and so on, without any apparent psychological reason. Tearfulness often precedes or accompanies such emotional outburst. In addition to these emotional symptoms, mild physiological symptoms similar to those seen in a panic attack, such as palpitations, dizziness, trembling and so on, may appear. Immediately after this emotional outburst, distressing trains of thought or images related to recent or past unpleasant events are experienced and ruminated on repeatedly. They are often manifested as flashbacks with or without visual images. Since these conditions are the bitterest experiences for most patients, they may cope with them in various ways such as deliberate self-harm. These patients generally have a more or less depressive mood. These conditions are considerably different from a panic attack, in that the emotional and cognitive storm dominates the physical one. The author named this condition as an Anxious-Depressive Attack (ADA). In this study, we present five cases of ADA and discuss their psychopathology and differential diagnoses. To the author's knowledge, this is the first report proposing the term ADA, which is a unique but common syndrome. Awareness regarding ADA may help improve understanding and treatment of the patient.",

It may occur to you to ask why has the subject of insane movement and obsession been chosen for this paper; well, gentlemen, for some years it has been my lot to witness, on my daily round of the wards, grotesque movements, antics and pantomimic display by patients, which, were they not interesting as symptoms and physical signs of nervous disease, might otherwise be depressing because of their meaninglessness. About three years ago, however, I had my attention drawn to a woman who seemed engaged in making movements, the precise character of which I had not read of or seen before in any asylum. I shall show you this patient making these movements by means of the cinematograph. We would have brought her here only she obstinately refuses to operate when watched, and it was necessary to have the cinematograph pictures focussed through a partly open window when she least suspected observation.

      "title": "Clinical Practice Guidelines for Assessment and Management of Patients Presenting with Psychosocial Crisis",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION Traumatic and crisis inducing events are increasing in the world. The spectrum of crisis events includes both public events that have a significant social impact, such natural catastrophes that affect entire communities, airplane crashes, or terrorist attacks, and private events, including interpersonal domestic violence, suicide attempts, the loss of a loved one, or the start of serious physical or mental illness. A person's life can change dramatically as a result of exposure to a crisis situations and incidents. Crisis situations and natural disasters, which disrupt daily life, can affect every community. A crisis frequently involves adversity, which are defined by a very distressing state of uncertainty, a perceived threat to core beliefs, and disruptions to daily routines. Crisis can be a challenge or an opportunity for efficient problem solving and growth, or it can be a crippling event that results in sudden disequilibrium, unsuccessful coping mechanisms, and dysfunctional behavioral patterns.[1] Crisis are also distinguished in two main ways. A one-time, acute single event crisis or more chronic state of crisis also sometimes called as complex trauma. Terr also used the term type 1 and 2 crisis for the above subtypes, respectively.[2] Crises may have a significant impact on a person's health, functioning, and general well-being. Stress, worry, uncertainty, physical discomfort, and trauma-related mental health issues are typical outcomes. Health effects due to exposure to crisis have been studied extensively, and in recent decades there has been an emphasis on various mental health consequences including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Several other psychiatric disorder like major depression, anxiety disorders, dissociative disorders, substance use disorders, personality disorders, etc., are reported to be having higher prevalence in people exposed to traumatic events of different kind in various phases of the life. However, the disorders specifically related to exposure to crisis, trauma, and stress are grouped separately both in ICD-11 and DSM-5. For these disorders, exposure to stressor in necessary for making a diagnosis. The details are given in following Table 1.Table 1: Disorders related to stress in ICD-11 and DSM-5The crisis interventions have a very long and rich history. The evidence for successful application of psychotherapeutic interventions in military settings were reported since long.[3] The politicians, administrators, other policymakers, at the society and local community level, should better understand psychosocial difficulties and problems encountered after traumatic events exposure for facilitation of service provisions and health force training and supervision. This clinical practice guideline aims to integrates psychosocial principles of crisis intervention. The model of psychosocial crisis management (PCM) describes how the tasks of crisis managers or crisis intervention workers (CIW) can be guided by principles of psychosocial support. Crisis management insights and psychosocial support principles originated from different several different disciplines and research. Currently, integrating strategies from various models helps in formulating better guidelines and strategies. Several different models of early interventions were tried in forms of disaster mental health programs, crime crisis intervention, or community mental health-based crisis intervention for early identification and help of the individuals suffering from the effect of crisis. Experts have cautioned, nonetheless, that even if a great desire and willingness to assist is not based on factual and scientific strategies, it may be ineffective or even detrimental to the clients.[4] Crises are disruptions with a potential psychosocial impact [Table 2]. The psychosocial dimension of crisis management, and can, therefore, strengthen crisis management in general. Crisis often refers to normal stresses and strain. Each crisis has a continuum, from negative to positive, and the resultant outcome depends upon a balance between the two opposing forces. Crisis in the context of current context is defined in specific terms. The following are important terms in context of crisis intervention.Table 2: Components of crisisRoberts defines a crisis as \"a period of psychological disequilibrium, experienced as a result of a hazardous event or situation that constitutes a significant problem that cannot be remedied by using familiar coping strategies [Figure 1].\"[1] An intensely stressful, traumatic, or serious event combined with the person's faulty perception resulting into psychological disruption and the individual's inability to resolve it are the primary factors requiring crisis intervention. Coping mechanisms that could have helped the person cope are either insufficient or not used at all. Later, James and Gilliland define crises as events or situations perceived as intolerably difficult that exceed an individual's available resources and coping mechanisms.[5]Figure 1: Core conceptualization of crisisCritical incident is a term which refers to an event which is exceptional and outside the individual's usual range of experience and challenges one's ability to cope successfully. The critical incident has the potential to cause a crisis condition by overwhelming one's usual psychological defenses and coping mechanisms [Table 3].Table 3: Factors influencing reactions to the crisisCoping behaviors are active efforts to resolve stress and create new solutions to the challenges of the situation. Coping involves the ability to gain and process new information; the ability to maintain control of one's emotional state; and the ability to move freely within one's environment. Coping behaviors are the source of new, original, unique, and creative solutions or behaviors. In this process, one develops adaptive ego functions that provide resources for coping in the subsequent stages or situations. If a crisis is not resolved in a positive manner, it can lead to destructive forces and psychopathology. Few examples of crises An accident, Natural disaster, Death/loss of a loved one, Onset or deterioration of Physical illness, Financial difficulties, Divorce/separation, Unexpected pregnancy, Employment loss. Clinicians need to address the level of distress, impairment, and instability in a rational and methodical way while confronted with a person in crisis.[5] Although, many clinicians may be aware about the best approaches for the crisis intervention, being in stressful situations, they may revert to strategies that are less than effective. Hence, it is important to have a quick and useful reference guide for do's and don'ts for crisis intervention workers [Tables 4-6].Table 4: Characteristics of the crisis interventionTable 5: Primary aims of the crisis interventionsTable 6: Factors influencing long term recoveryImmediate aftermath of acute crisis event, there are factors that help in long-term recovery and prevention of adverse sequalae over a period of time. Several practice models have been developed to help in assessment and intervention during crisis intervention over the years. MODELS OF CRISIS ASSESSMENT AND INTERVENTION Models of assessment Triage Assessment System: it was developed by Myer,[6] who proposed to assess crisis reactions in three domains: Affective (emotional) reactions: include three pairs of emotions anger/hostility, anxiety/fear, and sadness/melancholy. If more than one pair of emotions are present, it is rated as primary, secondary, and tertiary. Accurate assessment of primary emotion provides an opportunity to deal with the feeling and proving appropriate support. Cognitive (thinking) reactions: client's perception of how the crisis has affected, is affecting or will affect his or her physical, psychological, social, and moral/spiritual life. The perceptions may include transgression, threat, and loss. Behavioral (actions) reactions: include approach/avoidance and immobility. It may be constructive or maladaptive. Each domain is rated on a scale of 1 (no impairment) to 10 (Severe impairment). The score of all the domains is added together to give an overall severity. The higher is the severity, the more is the impairment. In addition to this, the client assessment includes assessment for suicidality, lethality, risk of harm to others, etc., based on the clinical situation. The details of these aspects are not included in this guideline and can be seen at other relevant places. MODELS OF MANAGEMENT 1. Gilliland's Six-Step Model: it was developed by James and Gilliland[5] and is a useful crisis intervention model. It includes three listening and three action steps. i) Listening: focuses on: a. defining the problem, b. ensuring client safety, c. providing support, ii) Action: focuses on: a. examining alternatives, b. making plans, c. obtaining commitment. A few important components of listening are observing, understanding, empathetically responding, respect for the client, acceptance, non-judgmental attitude, and caring. Action denotes those steps done in a nondirective and collaborative manner. It is also important to assess the needs of the client and the environmental supports available to him. 2. Seven-Stage Model of Crisis Intervention: It was developed by Roberts[1] and it contains the following seven stages: i. Conducting a thorough biopsychosocial and crisis assessment (including assessment of suicidal and homicidal risk, need for medical attention, drug, and alcohol use, etc.). The crisis worker should assess the lethality first and confirm whether the client has initiated say, for example, a suicidal attempt. If not, the crisis worker should assess the client's intent for self-harm. It is recommended to get that information from the client through an artful interviewing style rather than by direct questioning. ii. Making psychological contact and establishing rapport. A therapeutic relationship with the client can be established through the counselor offered conditions like genuineness, respect, and acceptance of the client. To instill trust and confidence in the client, the crisis worker should practice good eye-to-eye contact, a non-judgmental attitude, creativity, flexibility, a positive attitude, and resilience. iii. Examining and defining the dimensions of the problem or crisis (including Identification of the precipitant to the crisis). Crisis workers should focus on the client's current problems, usually, that precipitated the crisis. It will also help to understand how the situation escalated to a crisis and how the client tried to cope with the crisis. This will help the crisis workers to plan and suggest necessary modifications to the client to resolve the current crisis and prevent future crises. iv. Exploration of feelings and emotions mainly by actively listening and responding with encouraging statements. The crisis workers should allow the client to vent his or her distress/feelings. Active listening skills like paraphrasing, reflecting feelings, and probing are useful in this stage. In this stage, the crisis workers should work challenging responses (providing information, reframing, and interpretation) into the crisis-counseling dialogue that may help to undo the client's maladaptive beliefs. v. Exploration of past positive coping strategies of client and alternatives if any. Crisis workers need to be creative and flexible in resolving crises. The crisis worker and client can discuss the available options on the table (e.g., a no-suicide contract) for ensuring the client's safety. Some authors recommended integrating solution-focused therapy techniques viz., \"Amplifying Solution Talk\" in this stage. vi. Implementation of the action plan. It is important to identify supportive individuals and contact referral sources The action plans (e.g., entering a 12-step treatment program, joining a support group, etc.) implemented at this stage are important for restoring the client's equilibrium and psychological balance. Roberts highlighted the importance of the cognitive dimension of the client at this stage that will help to gain mastery over the crisis and to cope with similar situations in the future.[1] vii. Follow-up plan with clients to ensure that the crisis has been resolved Also, the post-crisis evaluation of the client is to be done that may include the client's physical condition, overall functioning, cognitive mastery of the precipitating event, the progress of the treatment, and need for any referral (e.g., legal, medical, etc.). In this stage, it is recommended to have a \"booster session\" with the client (usually after a month of termination of the crisis) to assess treatment gains and potential problems. Location Location of crisis intervention strategies is dependent on the crisis intervention program, target population, and available resources. Crisis intervention is offered in clinical settings including emergency settings, makeshift offices in disaster sites, military settings, workplace, schools, and in community outreach centers or at homes. Additional factors influencing location might be local norms, culture, stigma of mental health, and administrative support, etc. MANAGEMENT Pharmacological treatment The choice of treatment is determined by several factors. Availability of treatment options, time and resources available, and choice of treatment by the patient are some of the important considerations. Although, psychological interventions remain the treatment of choice, unavailability of therapist, unwillingness, or inability of the clients to undertake psychological interventions are important reasons for choosing pharmacological treatment options. In practice, most patients with sufficiently severe psychopathology receive a combination of pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions. The pharmacological treatment options available have following important caveats that all medications have some potential for adverse reactions and the empirical base for effectiveness of pharmacological treatment options is limited.[7] Hence, the treatment approach remains symptom based and empirical. SSRIs are considered the first line agents. However, SDAs, mood stabilizers, sedative/hypnotics, and antihypertensives are commonly used for the management of symptoms. Best practice prescribing strategies are followed for drug treatment. It primarily includes information prior to commencement, regular monitoring of response, adverse effects, and suicidal risk. Minimum number of medications is used, and polypharmacy is avoided as far as possible. Appropriate discontinuation and withdrawal practices are followed [Table 7].Table 7: Commonly used medications for psychiatric conditions related to stressPsychological interventions The crisis intervention strategies are offered in various settings including outpatient psychiatric clinics, community mental health centers, counseling centers, or crisis intervention settings. Crisis theory is developed over a period of time using inputs from a variety of disciplines and schools of thought. The commonly used crisis intervention models nowadays are often eclectic mixtures of psychoanalytic, existential, humanistic, cognitive-behavioral, and family system theories.[8] Crisis interventions (CI) are problem-focused, brief mental health interventions that are typically used within 4 to 6 weeks of exposure to a stressor or crisis. It is one of the most commonly used time-limited treatment modalities in the world.[9] This clinical practice guidelines outline broader model and approaches useful in crisis situations. The crisis intervention worker can adapt it appropriately according to the local cultural and contextual issues. An earlier clinical practice guidelines of Indian psychiatric society has been developed for supportive psychotherapy which deals with a related topic.[10] It can also be referred for additional information and further details. The mental health needs of the people exposed to a significant stressor or crisis are different and distinctive. Several different models of interventions are available. This article doesn't aim to comprehensively elaborate and enlist all the available models. Although each situation and client's needs are different, a few common steps can be applied across the situations. It is aimed to discuss common components of these models and essential strategies found successful across different models. Crisis intervention can be offered in multiple settings to a variety of individuals or groups including primary and secondary victims. The deceased, the injured, and their family and friends are examples of primary victims because they were directly involved in the critical event. The term \"secondary victims\" refers to anyone who is somehow witnesses to the immediate traumatic consequences on the initial victims, such as eyewitnesses, rescuers, and converging rescuers. Accordingly, the strategies can be for individual or group settings. A broad range of possible crisis and individual reactions, the severity of distress, and the use of coping strategies call for a reasonable individualization in approaches for every situation [Table 5]. A variety of professionals can conduct crisis intervention (CI). A psychiatrist, a clinical psychologist, psychiatric social worker, or psychiatric nurse can learn to use these skills and can conduct successful crisis intervention. For this document, for the brevity of writing, any professional conducting CI is referred to as crisis intervention worker (CIW). The important steps of crisis intervention are discussed below [Figure 2].Figure 2: Core conceptualization of crisis interventionEstablishing a rapport There are certain general strategies for establishing and strengthening rapport with the client. Many clients have limited attention span, feel distracted, have difficulty at focusing, or are extremely anxious owning to emotional upheaval after experiencing a psychosocial crisis. The crisis intervention worker should be vigilant about these issues and make appropriate alterations in the interview style for the same. Initial success in crisis intervention is largely dependent on the crisis intervention workers' ability to put the client at ease and alleviate these emotional reactions. Asking small questions, and frequently checking if the client can understand and appreciate what is being said is important. At the beginning of the interview, crisis intervention worker has to introduce himself/herself and need to inform the reasons for speaking to the client. Unless the reason for the consultation is implicit (the client himself/herself has come to the crisis intervention workers), crisis intervention workers should take consent for further proceeding. The crisis intervention workers should also inform about the nature of the interview and the approximate amount of time needed. The client is informed that they are free to make suggestions regarding the intervention format and they will not be pushed to talk or cooperate against their wishes. The information regarding privacy and confidentiality is also provided to the client. The information is shared with others only if there is a serious concern related to the safety and security of the client or relevant others (e.g., suicidal or homicidal intent). A respectful, non-judgmental, and considerate environment is created during the interaction. Clients are often going through considerable distress, emotional pain, and feeling vulnerable and uncertain about several things. It must be acknowledged, and due consideration is given during the interaction. This respectful and considerate environment significantly contributes to the development of rapport. Few key clinical skills are discussed in this regard Active listening- The most basic yet most important skill in psychological therapeutic interventions remains active listening. Active listening is paying attention to the verbal and non-verbal speech of the client and ongoing reactions to it so that clients know that they are being heard and understood. The components of active listening include adequate eye contact, attentive, and encouraging body language like appropriate head nodding, slight leaning toward the client while talking, appropriate facial/hand gestures, and vocal style showing concern. Questioning techniques- A combination of open-ended and closed-ended questions is used during the interview. As usual, it is better to start with open-ended questions and gather information. Close needed questions are useful in completing important areas which are missed like the further elaboration of the information provided till now and evaluating the risk of suicide/homicide or other risky behaviors. Certain interviewing techniques are also useful. Clarifying: It aims at clearly understanding what is being said. The crisis intervention workers may ask questions to clarify and to also show that he/she is actively listening. Paraphrasing: Crisis intervention workers restate what clients have already spoken in simpler words emphasizing factual and cognitive aspects. Summarizing: Summarizing is used to bring focus to the most important aspects of crisis intervention workers' understanding. Feedback is taken from the client so that both mutually agree on the extent of the problems and difficulties. Reflection: Reflection is a statement that emphasizes the affective or emotional part of verbal or nonverbal speech of the client, e.g., sounds like you are angry with your boss, you seem to undergo humiliation while living with xxx. Reflection is a powerful technique to express empathy. Expressing empathy means letting the client know that crisis intervention worker understands the emotions and feelings being experienced by the client. Matching and mirroring nonverbal communication: Consciously matching and mirroring the postures, gestures, and facial expressions in subtle way improves rapport and communication. It is also important to note that crisis intervention workers should avoid confrontation, getting into debates and argument with the client. It should be accepted that every client's situation, needs, and context are different and \"clients\" are expert in their situation. Whenever appropriate, taking \"one-down position\" to client is useful to foster better therapeutic relationship in many situations. Evaluating the problem Crisis intervention workers need to evaluate several aspects of the crisis. The areas of inquiry include precipitating event, client's perceptions of meaning and reasons of the event, amount of subjective distress, and identifying different emotions being experienced by the client, as well as functioning in various areas of life like personal, familial, social, academic, and occupational, etc. The client's level of comfort and amount of distress is monitored while talking about the event. It is important to know that the clinician does not have to know everything about client's difficulty and the goals in order to successfully provide crisis intervention effectively. Exact and minute details of the event are not important and even maybe counterproductive to ask. Therapeutic strategies Assessment of the client's perception is one of the most important tasks in crisis intervention. This aspect is often the most important target for intervention in crisis intervention. It is the perception of the client and his/her ability to cope with the event that led to the current problem. Once the cognitions, perceptions, meaning of the event, and frame of reference regarding various aspects of the event are assessed, crisis intervention worker aims at addressing them to identify the thinking errors made by clients and alter these cognitions into more adaptable and helpful cognitions. This strategy of cognitive restructuring is an essential aspect of crisis intervention. Once this has been achieved, it leads to a reduction of the accompanying emotional distress. Usually, the dysfunction and distress originate from the following areas. a) Loss of control, b) Loss of self-esteem, c) Loss of support, d) Difficulty in adjustment to change in life or a role. The subjective distress and functioning levels of the client need to be independently assessed. It is helpful for the client if they can ventilate their difficult emotions, distressing feelings, and other associated behavioral and somatic symptoms. Functioning should be assessed in each area as improving functioning early during the treatment process is an important goal of therapy. Identifying and evaluating medical, psychiatric (including suicidal, homicidal, and substance use-related issues), social, and legal needs are other important tasks. These needs may be contributing to the effective application of healthy coping strategies. Appropriate referrals must be made once a client needs help in an important area that falls outside the expertise area of crisis intervention worker. Solution focused approach- The emphasis is on finding solutions rather than solving problems. The therapeutic skills are asking questions that achieve solutions through \"solution talk or change talk\" in comparison with \"problem talk.\" It is assessed that what has not worked till now. It is conveyed to the client that there are several approaches to feel better and improve in the current context. Emphasis is placed on the setting goals for future. It is important that goals are set by the client themselves and these are SMART (specific, measurable, achievable, realistic, and time limited) as far as possible. Goals should be stated in positive rather than negatives, i.e., rather than \"I want to stop feeling depressed\" or \"I don't want to keep laying all the day\" it can be \"I want to feel peaceful and safe\" and \"I want to start visiting markets and shops for my daily needs.\" During next part of the intervention, a few other strategies are also used as therapeutic interaction in crisis intervention. Education: It is important to educate the clients about the universalities of crisis in human life as well as perceptions and emotional reactions of other people who have experienced similar events, e.g., although unfortunate, about 30% of women have experienced intimate partner violence in marriage. It is common to experience sadness, anger, and helplessness during this time. However, there is a lot that can be done to improve the present situation and future risk of violence by your spouse. This educational information may lead to a reduction in the feeling of loneliness as well as empower the clients to take appropriate action. Many clients suffer due to a lack of reliable information and a tendency to unreasonably blame themselves. Educational statements may include information related to statistics, frequency, psychological impact, social perspective as well as scientific understanding of the issues related to crisis events. Empowerment: The process of becoming stronger and more confident, especially in controlling one's life and claiming one's rights. These statements are offered as a part of enabling the application of appropriate coping skills and healthy behaviors as part of recovery. Many clients believe that they have failed in anticipating or stopping the event hence they are unable to do so in the future also. They may also blame themselves or consider themselves weak, wrongful, or wicked. It is important to bring change in this perspective. Clients are presented with various choices and strategies to respond better presently. Crisis intervention worker who offers advice to and generate solution may sometimes quicken the crisis resolution; however, it may not lead to client empowerment. Concept of empowerment is helpful in improving resilience hence is helpful for current crisis as well as enable clients to deal with similar situations in the future more effectively. Validation: Validation is defined as recognition or affirmation that a person or their feelings or opinions are valid or worthwhile. During the treatment process, crisis intervention worker reassures and supports the clients often that the emotional experiences and distress experienced are normal after experiencing such a crisis and it will get better. The aim is also to encourage adaptive and helpful coping strategies for the clients. However, the validation and support statements are not the ones that may be perceived as false or empty. The clients often listen from well-meaning friends and family members that \"Don't worry,\" \"Everything will be okay,\" and \"You are strong and get through this.\" Crisis intervention workers are experts in dealing with such situations hence validation and support come from a deeper understanding of the client's unique difficulties as well as a scientific understanding of the recovery process. Reframe: The clients often have cognitive errors and may have a wrong frame of reference while interpreting crisis events. The clients are encouraged to adopt a realistic frame of reference. Coping At the end of the crisis intervention, crisis intervention worker should aim to summarize the formulation of the client's problem from the medical point of view, address cognitive re-structuring related to events and discussions focus on successful coping strategies. As the rapport with the client is established, the client starts becoming more comfortable due to a reduction in distress levels; he/she is encouraged to take a more active part during the interaction. The client is encouraged to enlist what they have been trying to do to cope with the event till now. Crisis intervention workers should focus on identifying and working with the client's strengths. Emphasizing strengths rather than deficits can help in facilitating better engagement and success of intervention. Earlier research has found that clients want therapist to think positive about them. Making hostile, rejecting, critical, or blaming comments elicit negative reactions toward therapy and therapist. The impact of coping strategies used so far is jointly evaluated. It is attempted to distinguish healthy/adaptive coping strategies from unhealthy/maladaptive coping strategies [Table 8].Table 8: Few examples of coping strategies which can be useful after facing a crisisThe client is asked to suggest a list of healthy/adaptive coping strategies that they can use in the present and future to deal with the undergoing crisis. Once the client has exhausted their ideas about coping strategies, the crisis intervention workers can also suggest some of the coping strategies which the client is not able to think of or is unaware of so that it can be discussed if these are practical strategies and can be of use to the client. Joint decision-making is encouraged at this stage. However, if the client is not able to focus, unable to come up with possible coping strategies, or is indecisive regarding the practical utility of the strategy, they may be encouraged to try the technique and discuss its impact with the crisis intervention workers. Possible hurdles to the implementation of the strategies discussed are also inquired about. Once the list of hurdles, e.g., not having the motivation to go for a walk, feeling fatigued at the end of the day so that could not engage in my favorite hobby, not having the courage to make a call to my old friends as I have not connected with them for quite some time, etc., have been gathered, both crisis intervention workers and clients can jointly find out the plan to handle important issues. This activity significantly increases the chances of successful implantation of the discussion that happened in the session. Some other approaches found useful Support groups: The client may be encouraged to get in touch with local support groups. It might be more comfortable for the clients to receive support from a natural support group like peer groups, relatives, friends, religious groups, or co-workers if any such possibility is available to the client. There can be few organized peer support groups in certain parts of the country. The client is encouraged to try seeking the help of such groups. Journaling: Clients may find it helpful to keep a journal. Crisis intervention worker may encourage clients to maintain a secret/personal journal. Writing once thoughts, emotions, and other experiences allows the person to evaluate these more objectively. This is helpful in the recovery process for several individuals. Bibliography: There are several good books/websites/reading materials available for dealing with different kinds of crises. Advising quality reading material to interested clients is often helpful to people who like to read. Such resources are often developed both by experts and first-person accounts of persons who have gone through a similar crisis are available. Keeping a list of such resources and advising capable clients to use is helpful in several instances. Medical and legal referrals: Many clients may require medical and legal referrals but may be avoiding the same due to several reasons. The crisis intervention worker can direct them to seek appropriate referrals and can help in making some provisions in this regard with any other helping agency, if available. There are several specific models for crisis intervention that are developed over a period of time for different situations. A few of the important models are summarized below. Psychological First Aid (PFA):[11] PFA is defined as a \"humane, supportive response to a fellow human being who is suffering and who may need support.\" PFA is aimed offered to the people who have immediately experienced extremely stressful events. This model of care takes into account both psychological and social aspects of care needed for persons during the early course of exposure to stressors. Special attention is given to focusing on the preservation of the dignity, culture, or abilities of the person to whom the intervention is being offered. The evidence of PFA has been compared with psychological debriefing and it was found that PFA is superior to psychological debriefing in crises. The strategies of PFA have evidence of successful application in low and middle-income countries and these can be offered even by non-professional people also. PFA can be used by non-professionals and professional both. Booklet of PFA is available for free download from https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789241548205 (Last accessed 22 June, 2022). Critical Incident Stress Management (CISM):[12] CISM is evolved from earlier CI programs and group psychological debriefing techniques. CISM was originally developed for emergency service personals like fire department, first line police, rescue or disaster teams and military settings. It is defined as an integrated, multicomponent, and comprehensive intervention program useful for both the primary and secondary victims. The strategies are included for pre-crisis preparation, acute crisis intervention, and post-crisis management. Both individual and group strategies are incorporated usually lasting from 4-12 sessions. Pre-crisis preparation may be thought of as a form of \"psychological immunization.\" The aim of this phase is to strengthen potential psychological vulnerabilities and enhance resilience in individuals specifically who are at risk of developing crisis reactions. It includes providing information so as to have realistic expectations about the stress responses. It also incorporates stress response management, behavioral regulation, improved coping, and practical strategies to help and support each other for people involved. CONCLUSION Crises are common human experiences and a subset of vulnerable people develops clinically significant difficulties necessitating intervention. Evidence-based clinical interventions are available that can be offered to persons in need. Typically, therapeutic interventions needed for crises are offered as early as possible, is problem focused, simple and brief. Therapeutic strategies used in crises are often derived from an eclectic mix of strategies from various psychological intervention models. The major clinical issues are assessed in domains of cognitive, emotional, and behavioral domains. Interventions are focused on handling psychological reactions as well as providing help, information, and support regarding social issues, if feasible. Financial support and sponsorship Nil.

      "title": "I paint, I sing, I dance; I also have a mental illness: The importance of personally meaningful leisure activities in recovery from severe mental illness",
      "abstract": "Individuals with severe mental illness (SMI) often have sedentary and secluded life. It leads to compounded psychological and physical effects in the form of feeling isolated, having an increased propensity for lifestyle-related illnesses, and the like.[1] It affects the perception of others also, which often manifests as a narrow and negative approach to the patient and their problems. This approach creates an impression that the patient and their issues are inseparable and that their life revolves around those problems. It leads to neglect and underestimation of the patient's abilities, hobbies, and likings. For example, a patient with schizophrenia may be perceived as someone with eccentricities (e.g., talks to self) who does not adequately involve in daily living activities and remains secluded. Unfortunately, a patient may imbibe these perceptions leading to self-stigma, which, in turn, can affect their overall functioning.[2] It is, therefore, imperative that intervention for mental illness has a strength-based approach that focuses on the person's abilities apart from the target to improve the symptoms. Motivating patients to engage in personally meaningful activities they enjoy can be a step in this direction. It does not only defocus the attention of the patient and the caregivers from a \"symptom only\" approach but also help make the patient active, participative, and involved in what interests them. Given this, therapeutic recreation is being advocated as one of the ways to promote health and wellness in individuals with mental illness.[3] Therapeutic recreation promotes positive behaviour, such as social connectedness and cooperation, by involving people in therapeutic residential camping, leisure activities, and the like. Involving people in such leisure and recreational activities can be an effective way of reinvigorating those self-soothing and enjoyable activities that get subdued in the inactive life of mental illness. Furthermore, patients can be involved in such goal-driven recreational activities that reduce the illness effects. For example, specially designed cognitively stimulating recreational activities can effectively reduce the cognitive impairments commonly observed in people with severe mental illness. Likewise, group activities can help enhance social skills, decrease apathy (and other negative symptoms), and improve interpersonal skills. THE RESEARCH EVIDENCE Of late, there has been a surge of interest in understanding the effectiveness of leisure activities in promoting the psychological and social well-being of people with mental illness. Research indicates that involvement in personally meaningful leisure activities can boost recovery and aid toward active living for people with mental illness.[4,5] For example, enjoyable leisure activities and perceived active living consistently correlate with a sense of well-being and recovery.[5–7] Therapeutic recovery camps, aiming to involve participants in physically and mentally challenging activities, have been found to lead to a sense of determination to overcome the challenges caused by mental illness.[3] Activities that involve adventure and fun (such as rock climbing, picnic, and skating) can be physically stimulating, weight reducing (a common requirement in mental illness due to metabolic abnormalities), and a boost to self-esteem.[8] Also, leisure activities can act as a protector from mental illness. For example, a sense of meaningful use of time through leisure activities is associated with lower depressive symptoms.[9,10] NOT \"ONE FIT FOR ALL\" Since recreational and leisure activities can significantly boost the psychological and social well-being of people with mental illness, these activities must be part of the overall intervention plan. While doing this, a few things need to be kept in mind. For example: The activities chosen must be personally meaningful for the individual. The contribution of leisure activities in recovery and active living largely depends on what meanings the patients gain from those activities.[4,5] Perception of an activity to be personally meaningful motivates the individual to engage and continue it. For example, realizing that doing yoga with friends brings a positive mood, helps companionship, and revitalizes spirituality can be a driving force for engaging in it regularly.[4] Iwasaki and colleagues suggest that leisure activities can be meaningful for an individual if they promote a sense of belongingness, autonomy, competence, and other factors.[5] Active living does not limit to some physical exercises; it also involves activities that augment body-mind-spirit harmony and promote emotional health, social connectedness, creativity, and so on.[11] Recreational and leisure activities should be planned in a manner that it incorporates the patient's needs. For example, a patient with cognitive deficits can be involved in such activities that are cognitively stimulating. Involving patients to work in groups to create Rangolis (an art in which an array of colors is precisely used to create designs on the floor) can be an enjoyable activity with the potential to improve attention. INDIAN SCENARIO Unfortunately, there is a paucity of research from India about the effectiveness of therapeutic recreational activities for people with SMI. It has significant implications; for example, even if some centers involve patients in recreational activities, they are not guaranteed to be effective. At NIMHANS, we have started a structured recreational program that involves patients in various leisure activities according to their choice. A preliminary study shows that the patients perceive the benefits of these activities in terms of the experience of positive emotions, opportunities for social interactions, and the like.[12] We need more research exploring the utility of various approaches to actively include patients and their caregivers in focused recreational and leisure activities, such as recreational camping for a longer duration. We must remember that symptom amelioration is not the sole target of working with people with mental illness. Recovery is a broader concept with a strength-based perspective to enable an individual to lead a meaningful life and utilize their potential to the fullest. Recreational activities can serve as an important medium to attain this goal. Financial support and sponsorship Nil. Conflicts of interest There are no conflicts of interest.",

      "abstract": "Abstract A common denominator in psychosomatically induced death is stress. Death can occur slowly, as from the preponderance of chronic stressors, or it can come on suddenly, as from an acute stressor. Sudden death is more likely in an individual with a preexistent serious medical condition such as hypertension, CAD, diabetes mellitus, hyperthyroidism, peptic ulcer, Cushing's disease, and bronchial asthma. Individuals are more prone to sudden death who are: (1) highly anxious; (2) hostile; (3) manipulative of the environment; (4) anger repressors; (5) rapid shifters between anxiety and depression; (6) sufferers of a recent major less; or (7) socially isolated. Most cases of sudden death are related to the presence of a severely stressful situation in which there appears to be no means of control or escape. With mind control, hypnosis, and voodoo curses, circumstances can be manipulated to achieve severe stress and uncontrollability.",

Evidence suggests that these comorbidities may be explained by a limited capacity of individuals to exert cognitive control on thoughts, emotions, or behaviors. A decrease of this capacity of control could contribute to the development and maintenance of chronic pain and its associated symptoms. Benefits of the cognitive-behavioral therapy in the treatment of chronic pain may be explained by learning efficient and less costly pain coping strategies in terms of cognitive control capacity.",

      "title": "Functional neuroimaging: the adaptive mechanisms in migraine",
      "abstract": "Migraine is a common neurological disorder characterized by a primary brain dysfunction subtended by an episodic activation and sensitization of the trigemino-vascular pain pathway. Although migraine attacks are clinically welldefined, the underlying pathophysiology of the more complex migraine scenario is largely unknown. Functional brain changes, that occur because of repeated migraine attacks, may be explained through a maladaptive feedforward allostatic cascade model. The fundamental assumption is that “the brain is a central organ of stress” [1], able to detect stressful or potentially stressful situations and react in form of behavioural and/or physiologic responses. These brain responses, mediated by the autonomic nervous system and neuroendocrine mechanisms, could be either adaptive or maladaptive. In this context, allostasis is the ability to protect the body through adaptation [2]. Contrariwise, the allostatic load and overload, resulting from repeated stress and/or allostasis [3], refers to the wear and tear on the systems that normally support adaptation. Compelling evidence suggests that the brain of migraine patients is significantly different from healthy controls. Some of these differences are related to abnormal cortical activity during painful stimulations, suggesting an “adaptive” response observed in the course of moderate or high noxious trigeminal stimulations. Conversely, other differences relate to abnormality in responses that should be adaptive but become impaired or maladaptive, such as altered brainstem processing. More recently, a decreased functional connectivity was demonstrated within the fronto-parietal network (FPN) in patients with migraine without and with aura in the absence of clinically relevant executive deficits. FPN represents the neural substrate of executive functions and FPN functional abnormalities might be a part of a complex cascade that terminates in a migraine attack. Specifically, FPN functional connectivity changes could underlie a defective executive functioning in which high-demanding conditions cannot be correctly processed and solved by patients with migraine, escalating the brain adaptive response, likely resulting in a risk factor for headache attacks. In conclusion, we believe that in migraine an internal state of dysregulation creates an allostatic load with maladaptive consequences on brain, behaviour, physiological regulation and systemic physiology that progress in a feedforward cascade. Thus, we suggest that migraine should be considered a brain disease and not simply a recurrent acute pain syndrome.",

It has been often wrongly diagnosed as schizophrenia, bipolar affective disorder, impulse control disorder, or borderline personality disorder among others. We are presenting one such case. Ms. M, a nineteen year old college going girl was brought for consultation by her mother for repeated attacks of amnesia and poor impulse control related symptoms like irritability, destructive behaviour and self harm. On further enquiry, the patient gave a history of being accused of lying and being hypocritical since she was in the sixth grade; having no memory of how she landed up in unexpected places (a nearby zoo/friend's place); having a sense of being estranged, hearing voices in her head of her mother talking with other people. Her mother gave a history of being able to see 3 different states in her daughter- a nineteen year old intelligent college student; a trusting state in which she speaks in a childish voice and having high risk behaviour (like going off with strangers, taking drinks mixed with intoxicants, not recognizing treating doctors); and an aggressive state in which she is easily irritable, paces about and attempts to harm her mother or herself. She (patient) herself is unaware of these episodes and states. On admission, organicity was ruled out by appropriate tests. She was put on a mood stabilizer and anti depressive agents for symptomatic control. Safety and security was established. The patient narrated her abuse (during adolescence) in one of the other dissociative states. This could have been misdiagnosed as psychosis, intermittent explosive disorder, depressive disorder, or borderline personality disorder. The keen observation by the mother (who herself had possession syndrome and depression earlier in life) helped in the diagnosis. A treating clinician must be aware and be on the lookout for dissociative states and be prepared for therapeutic work with such patients.",

      "abstract": "Traditionally, apathy has been viewed as a symptom indicating loss of interest or emotions. This paper evaluates evidence that neuropsychiatric disorders also produce a syndrome of apathy. Both the symptom and the syndrome of apathy are of conceptual interest because they signify loss of motivation. An apathy syndrome is defined as a syndrome of primary motivational loss, that is, loss of motivation not attributable to emotional distress, intellectual impairment, or diminished level of consciousness. Loss of motivation due to disturbance of intellect, emotion, or level of consciousness defines the symptom of apathy. Neuropsychiatric literature dealing with apathy is reviewed within the framework of three approaches to defining the concept of a syndrome. Clinical and investigative approaches for evaluating apathy when it occurs in association with other syndromes are described.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The AMA Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment ( AMA Guides ) notes that many methods used to report medical impairments rely on the completeness, accuracy, and honesty of the patient's self-presentations. Symptom exaggeration is best understood in the context of clinical phenomena that lie along a continuum from unconscious and unintentional to conscious and intentional. Illness behavior refers to the ways in which given symptoms may be perceived, evaluated, and acted upon by different persons, and such behavior can be appropriate or inappropriate, depending on context, and can be learned and reinforced. Further, certain illness behaviors potentially confound the association between illness or injury, on the one hand, and impairment or disability, on the other hand. For example, any deficit can be exaggerated, including neuropsychological deficits, pain, and loss of sensation. Specialized assessments include symptom validity testing to assess memory or sensory deficits, and maximum voluntary effort testing assesses strength deficits. In their assessment of illness behavior, physicians should employ the same degree of thoroughness as they would with any condition. Written reports should include not only the conclusion that symptom exaggeration is present but also the basis for this determination. A table shows the characteristics of symptom magnification syndromes and other related conditions vs the presence of symptoms such as seeking gain or deception.",

However, in the physical impairment related diseases, it is difficult for the disease to occur only by internal factors, and it can be said that internal factors and external factors are combined. Therefore, when the physical impairment is caused by disease, it is important to the apportionment analysis of injury to think about the cause of the physical impairment by considering both the external and internal factors. The most commonly used the apportionment guide is the “Rhim's trauma apportionment guideline” in impairment evaluation. But this guideline is often difficult to assess in certain diseases. Since the apportionment analysis of external factors can bring about a difference in degree according to the viewpoint of the assessor, the degree of the physical impairment may vary greatly depending on case by case. Especially, it is not reasonable to assess based on causal relation with common sense or emotional, and it is necessary to make rational assessment based on medical evidence and professional knowledge.",

Although comprising the most prevalent set of chronic pain conditions, it was not represented appropriately in the 10th edition of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10), which was organized mainly according to anatomical sites, was strongly focused on musculoskeletal disease or local damage, and did not consider the underlying mechanisms of pain. The new ICD-11 classification introduces the concept of chronic primary and secondary musculoskeletal pain, and integrates the biomedical axis with the psychological and social axes that comprise the complex experience of chronic musculoskeletal pain. Chronic primary musculoskeletal pain is a condition in its own right, not better accounted for by a specific classified disease. Chronic secondary musculoskeletal pain is a symptom that arises from an underlying disease classified elsewhere. Such secondary musculoskeletal pain originates in persistent nociception in musculoskeletal structures from local or systemic etiologies, or it may be related to deep somatic lesions. It can be caused by inflammation, by structural changes, or by biomechanical consequences of diseases of the nervous system. It is intended that this new classification will facilitate access to patient-centered multimodal pain management and promote research through more accurate epidemiological analyses.",

Psychosis is a gross impairment of reality testing, often manifest by hallucinations or delusions. Psychotic symptoms can be an inherent aspect of an illness or a secondary complicating factor. Earlier-onset/primary psychotic disorders, schizophrenia and related disorders, bipolar disorder with psychotic features, often extend into old age. Severe functional disability affects the surrounding environment and worsens caregiver stress, leading to reduced productivity beyond that of the patient. The aging brain shows a disproportion in the synthesis, discharge, and inactivation of noradrenergic, serotonergic, and dopaminergic neurons, loss of resilience, and loss of cognitive reserve, all increasing the risk for psychosis developing as a complication of an underlying pathology.",

Paradoxically, PTSD may be misdiagnosed by a healthcare professional which may result in inappropriate therapeutic intervention. This article introduces a simple five-stage assessment that is designed to help the clinician determine whether the client's distress is caused by PTSD or another disorder. These guidelines are structured and explore the five stages of PTSD assessment: collecting background information; initial contact with the client; correctly identifying the problem; general assessment; and summary. Finally, some recommended structured clinical assessment guidelines and psychometric rating scales are outlined.",

Two variables, type of regression and marital status, provide an empirically derived rationale for the psychiatric treatment of behavioral problems affecting patient management, including especially (1) pain-related behavior, (2) intrusive reexperiencing of the trauma, (3) depletion/despair phenomena, and (4) problems related to scarring.

This is an alerting cue; past modes of reaction to stress in the form of physical patterns (but not conversion reactions); regressive shifts of defenses in the direction of resomatization; mounting aggression that is not directly verbalized; diminution of psychologically expressed guilt, though guilt would be expected and indeed becomes manifest in physical form; psychological versions of transference reactions replaced by expressions in body language; dreams in which stimuli from early physical dysfunction are recurrently part of the daily residue and give a somatic cast to current conflicts; identification with important objects that is increasingly expressed in somatic terms.

      "abstract": "In Myofascial pain is a type of chronic soft tissue pain that is localized in muscles, fasciae and/or surrounding tissues and is characterized by the presence of muscle trigger points, the palpation of which causes localized or referred pain. One of the myofascial pain syndromes is the Serratus Anterior Muscle Pain Syndrome. The condition manifests itself as deep, dull, diffuse pain between the 5th and 7th ribs along the midaxillary line that radiates to the front of the chest wall, shoulder, shoulder blade and, less frequently, to the 4th and 5th fingers of the upper limb. It most often occurs in people who work hard physically and in athletes, and is favored by injuries, overstrain and muscle cooling, mental stress, fatigue, and lack of sleep. A medical history, characteristic clinical picture, physical examination with palpation assessment of muscles, and the exclusion of other disease entities with similar symptoms, such as radiculopathies, fibromyalgia, rheumatic polymyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome, polymyositis, are key in the diagnosis of the Serratus Anterior Muscle Pain Syndrome. It is recommended to combine conservative methods (pharmacotherapy, physiotherapy, psychotherapy) and interventional methods such as needling, blockades, botulinum toxin injection and pulsed radiofrequency in the management. This article describes a patient with Serratus Anterior Muscle Pain Syndrome refractory to conservative management, in which the pulsed radiofrequency of the affected muscle gave significant and long-lasting pain relief without significant side effects. In the opinion of the authors and based on the available publications, pulsed radiofrequency can be considered in the therapeutic management of patients with myofascial pain.",

      "abstract": "Sensitization is conceptually related to cognitive bias in experimental psychopathology, and they share the basic mechanism of neuronal sensitization. Every strongly relevant individual concern, like fears, can yield cognitive bias or \"cognitive-emotional sensitization\". It might also be present for bodily and environmental information related to illness, and could be an etiological factor in medically unexplained complaints. Physiological and cognitive sensitization are theoretically compared. There is evidence for cognitive-emotional sensitization in some medically unexplained somatic complaints, and negative affect is suggested as a catalyst. Prolonged cognitive-emotional sensitization (\"perseverative negative cognition\" or worry, rumination) might even have demonstrable somatic pathological effects. It is concluded that sensitization may be organized at different levels, both in the organism and in the larger living system within which the organism is subsumed. This view might not only help to clarify medically unexplained pain syndromes, but virtually every subjective complaint, both with and without recognized physiopathology.",

      "abstract": "Schizophrenia is a chronic disabling; psychiatric disorder that affects around 1% of the population and its point prevalence is 0.6 to 8.3 cases per 1000 population. 1,2Caregiving in psychiatric illness is an exhausting and challenging activity that typically involves a considerable amount of energy, time and money over considerably long periods of time, in tasks that may be unpleasant or uncomfortable and could be psychologically and physically stressful and tiring.3\r\nCaregiving to mentally unstable people can be particularly challenging in traditional societies such as India. The close - knit family structure and lack of adequate government resources to support people with mental illness place the burden of care on the family which is perceived to be the ‘‘natural’’ caregiver. Socio-cultural expectations envision caregiving as an obligation and moral binding which is to be given by parents, children or the spouse. Religious-cultural attributions often causally implicate supernatural factors in the manifestation of mental illness.\r\nSchizophrenia is a severe mental disorder that usually starts in late adolescence or early adulthood, and is characterized by profound disruption in thinking, language, perception and the sense of self, and includes psychotic experiences, such as hearing voices or delusions. 6\r\nThe volatile nature of the disorder and its accompanying debilitating consequences burdens the family in multiple domains causing social, emotional and financial problems. Several studies had done worldwide reveal a high level of burden, social isolation and stigma among caregivers of schizophrenia. Indian data in this area is relatively sparse however some studies reports the presence of depression, anxiety, poor mental and physical health and other mental disorders among the caregivers. In view of the above the present study was undertaken to evaluate the quality of life and marital adjustment in spouses of schizophrenia patients.",

The syndrome is characterized by hypersomnia (up to 20 hours a day), cognitive symptoms (mainly derealisation, but also confusion, delusions, and/or hallucinations, memory impairments), behavioral symptoms (sexual disinhibition, irritability/aggression, compulsive eating), and mental symptoms such as depression and anxiety [4,8-13].

      "title": "Treatment of Mental Health in Patients With Chronic Liver Disease",
      "abstract": "Answer questions and earn CME Content available: Author Interview and Audio Recording The term depression represents a constellation of symptoms that are largely nonspecific in respect to diagnosis. At one extreme is an \"everyday depression,\" a person's experience in the face of a specific challenge, such as paying one's taxes. At the opposite extreme is major depressive disorder (MDD) described by profound subjective hopelessness, helplessness, and worthlessness. Biological symptoms occur, including sleep continuity disorder with early-morning awakening, a diurnal variation of mood, and anhedonia. Because of their nonspecificity, other conditions may easily mimic depression, including symptoms of chronic liver disease (CLD), such as hepatic encephalopathy (HE) and delirium. The key therefore is to apply careful, psychiatric differential diagnoses, especially in CLD. Notably, this article focuses on depression and anxiety, while important coexisting or independent mental health conditions, such as bipolar disorder, panic disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, and substance abuse, are not discussed. In any evaluation of a patient with depression and/or anxiety, the aforementioned mental health disorders should be evaluated for and managed appropriately. Patients with CLD can have profoundly altered pharmacokinetics resulting in higher systemic drug levels. Portosystemic shunting in cirrhosis reduces the first-pass metabolism of high-extraction medications.1 The volume of distribution (Vd) is further impacted by decreased transport proteins and ascites and peripheral edema. In addition, drugs eliminated by hepatic metabolism or biliary excretion can have dramatically reduced clearance. The stage of cirrhosis and location of pathology also affect drug metabolism, with glucuronidation often preserved in early cirrhosis compared with cytochrome P450 enzymatic activity, while entities affecting the centrilobular region, such as alcohol-related liver disease, where oxidative functions are focused, impact enzymatic activity to a different degree to a disease affecting the portal region.1 There are additional complexities to consider in CLD, including HE and benzodiazepine sensitivity. In patients with severe MDD (9-item patient health questionnaire [PHQ-9] ≥ 20), the preferred initial treatment is pharmacotherapy plus psychotherapy, which is more efficacious than either treatment modality alone (Fig. 1).2 Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) may be considered for severe suicidality. For mild-to-moderate MDD (PHQ-9 < 20), initial monotherapy with either second-generation antidepressants (SGAs), such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) (Table 1), or psychotherapy is reasonable.3 SGAs and psychotherapy have each shown efficacy as monotherapies and have comparable efficacy and tolerability.3 SGAs are the first-line pharmacological agents due to their efficacy and safety (remission rate of 43% versus 29% in placebo)4 and are comparable across and within respective categories.5 The seminal STAR*D study, which captured a broadly \"real-world\" representative patient sample with both medical and psychiatric comorbidities, reported a 37% remission rate with citalopram as first-line therapy.6 Given the comparable efficacy among SGAs, drug selection is based on symptoms, adverse effects, comorbidities, patient preference, affordability, and prior medication experiences. Importantly, SGAs are low-risk hepatotoxic medications with only rare asymptomatic mild elevation of serum aminotransferases (0.5-1%). A specific concern for SSRIs in CLD is their association with gastrointestinal bleeding partly attributed to serotonin transporter inhibition on platelets affecting platelet aggregation after vascular injury.1 Although the clinical evidence is mixed, caution should still be used with coprescribing of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and antiplatelets.1 Concomitant proton pump inhibitors can be considered to mitigate the risk for bleeding in the more vulnerable patients who have thrombocytopenia or additional risk factors for bleeding. The atypical antidepressant, bupropion, is useful in mitigating sexual dysfunction given the lower rate versus SSRIs/SNRIs (6% versus 16%) or for treating comorbid tobacco dependence, whereas mirtazapine should be avoided in patients with features of metabolic syndrome (~3 kg weight gain after 8 weeks).7 Trazodone is useful for insomnia given its higher rate of somnolence versus SGAs, including mirtazapine (42% versus 25%), and can be considered as first-line therapy if insomnia is a large component of the somatic symptoms, with mirtazapine as an alternative.7 The adverse effects of tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) and monoamine oxidase inhibitors limit their routine use. Antidepressants should be initiated with low doses.1 In CLD, no change is required in the initial dose for SSRIs/SNRIs; however, a target maintenance dose of half of standard dosing is recommended.1 Subsequent titration is based on the balance of response and adverse effects. The dosing principles of SSRIs/SNRIs are the same for TCA use in CLD; however, the risk for HE precipitation needs consideration. It is also recommended to reduce the bupropion and mirtazapine dose by 50%.1 Time to improvement is around 2 weeks; however, most patients do not achieve remission after initial treatment,7 necessitating therapy switch or augmentation with additional interventions. Should patients display minimal improvement after 4 to 6 weeks, the next treatment step is titration to the maximum tolerated dose, an early switch to an alternative SGA,8 or augmentation with psychotherapy.9 The previously referenced STAR*D experience reported 31%, 14%, and 13% remission rates for second, third, and fourth acute pharmacotherapy treatment steps, respectively.6 No one psychotherapy is clearly superior in MDD; however, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) or interpersonal psychotherapy are first line because they have been more widely studied.10 CBT involves identifying and changing maladaptive beliefs, improving emotional regulation, and developing personal coping strategies. CBT is effective as monotherapy with higher remission rates achieved versus controls (waiting list or usual care) (41% versus 21%).10 Interpersonal psychotherapy is an attachment-focused psychotherapy that centers on resolving interpersonal problems and symptomatic recovery.10 An important consideration is a patient's willingness to engage fully in psychotherapy, which is crucial in optimizing behavioral intervention efficacy. There are additional behavioral therapies that can be considered, including family therapy, problem-solving therapy, and relaxation techniques. Exercise programs can also be considered depending on tolerability and illness extent.11 Anxiety symptoms are likewise nonspecific and require careful differential diagnosis. Treatment can be deferred with clinical follow-up in mild generalized anxiety disorder (GAD; GAD-7 < 10) if symptoms do not interfere significantly with functioning. For patients who warrant treatment, SSRIs/SNRIs and/or CBT are the established first-line interventions (Fig. 1).12 The benefit of medication and CBT are similar, and the choice of which to use, if not using both, is determined by patient preference, availability, affordability, and adverse effects. There are no differences in the efficacy between SSRIs/SNRIs, and their dosing in CLD is the same as for MDD.12 Patients who have a suboptimal response to a SSRI/SNRI after 4 to 6 weeks should be reassessed for co-occurring untreated conditions or ongoing stressors requiring greater problem-solving focus. If no co-occurring exacerbating factors are elicited, then a different SSRI/SNRI should be initiated. If no response occurs after two SSRI/SNRI trials, then augmentation with either a nonaddictive second-line medication (e.g., buspirone, pregabalin, or hydroxyzine) or CBT should be initiated. Hydroxyzine is useful for short-term control of anxiety symptoms, in lieu of benzodiazepines. If benzodiazepines are being considered in CLD, then short-acting benzodiazepines such as lorazepam (which has no active metabolites) should be prescribed to mitigate the risk for drug accumulation. However, the risk for benzodiazepine dependence, whereby patients develop various behavioral and physical symptoms, including tolerance (loss of efficacy over time) and a withdrawal syndrome with medication cessation, limits their utility. Moreover, patients with CLD treated with at least 3 days of benzodiazepines are at a high risk for developing first-time HE possibly related to increased cerebral benzodiazepine receptor availability in CLD, particularly among patients with alcohol use disorder. Notably, pregabalin (through its agonism of GABA) and hydroxyzine (via its anticholinergic effects) can also increase the risk for HE, and thus patients with CLD who are taking these medications should be monitored carefully. Aerobic exercise, mindfulness-based stress reduction, and yoga may also be worthwhile adjunctive treatments.13 In addition, web-based and telehealth interventions will continue to be incorporated into patient management in the near future.14 If effective, medication for GAD should be continued for at least 12 months given the lower relapse rate versus 6 months of therapy (8.8% versus 53.7%).15 If the patient relapses after cessation of an effective medication, the same medication can be restarted and the treatment course extended.",

      "title": "Using ’White Flags’ to categorize socio-cultural aspects in chronic pain",
      "abstract": "Abstract Issue Persistent chronic pain is a major medical and health economic problem. To assess the individual pain situation, the classification of various factors (flags) has been established. Description of the problem Structural biomechanical factors are classified as “red flags”. Psychological or behavioral factors are summarized as “yellow flags”, psychiatric and mental illness as “orange flags”. Both last flags are important for planning adequate therapies or rehabilitation, as well as for decisions to prognoses and tailored reintegration programs. An extension of the flag model was achieved by naming personal factors at workplace as “blue flags”, and “black flags”, if there is a restriction for returning to work. All these groups do not consider other important reasons for unsuccessful rehabilitation or failed reintegration. Results In these cases, often described as ’therapy-refractory’, clients often exhibit a special subjective understanding of illness that reacts neither to psychological interventions nor to behavioral therapies. These include individual beliefs based, for example, on cultural socialization, religious education, or spiritual experiences. Since such individual mental illnesses are culturally ideologically or religiously justified, they should be classified in a separate group called ’white flags’. Lessons The advantages of categorizing sociocultural aspects separately from other flag classifications are avoidance of unnecessary therapies, including surgery,prevention of iatrogenisation,prevention of legal disputes. It is important to realize that only health restrictions for insurance benefits can be taken into account and that individual socio-cultural circumstances or health convictions are not evaluated. Main messages: A classification of ’white flags’ could contribute to a better classification of pain which are not accessible to various therapies and reduce reservations and misunderstandings by intercultural communication approaches. Key messages For medical professions it is important to recognize, that only health inabilities are taken into account for insurance compensation and not individual socio-cultural circumstances or health beliefs. In Future classifying ’white flags’ could help to properly assess persistent pain conditions.",

Objectives We report the case of a male patient aged 58 with multiple previous admissions for behavioral alteration symptoms, including exhibitionism. He is referred as irritable, uninhibited and sleeping disorders. There is a risk of flight as he is difficult to be held so it is feared that he can be run over by a car. He shows a marked self-referentiality. Methodology The patient is admitted. He properly gets used to the rules of the Ward. Pharmacological adjustment is performed. During his admittance he shows no behavior disorders neither episodes of self or hetero aggression and poor impulse. He properly makes comments of what happened during his stay. He responds well to treatment prescribed. Sleep pattern is restored. Results Schizophrenia (undifferentiated) 295.90 (F.20.3); intellectual disability mild 317 (F70); neurocognitive disorder (possible). Conclusions This is unusual case because it is normal that the sexual function of such patients is adversely affected, not finding numerous cases of disinhibition in our medical consultation. This is due to the different aspects that are affected, biological (drugs), psychological and social levels. We have different therapeutic alternatives to address this problem. However, they may hinder sociability and patient rehabilitation. Disclosure of interest The authors have not supplied their declaration of competing interest.",

      "title": "Unintentional Symptom Intensification by Doctors",
      "abstract": "Physicians at times are confronted with patients who present with vague yet disabling, nonprogressive symptoms for which they can offer no concrete medical explanation despite extensive evaluation. Many individuals who present with abdominal complaints, musculoskeletal pain, headaches, fatigue, dizziness, and other symptoms and/or their families believe that an undiscovered anatomic or biochemical aberration explains their symptoms despite having been informed that the symptoms may represent a “functional disorder.”1 They have difficulty believing that relatively common disorders such as functional abdominal pain,2 fibromyalgia,3 and chronic daily headache can cause the incapacitating symptoms that they or their children are experiencing. Their belief that a more specific “organic” explanation exists is rooted in the medical model, which implies that there is a specific cause for most symptoms that, when identified, will offer a path to cure.4 The faith in this conviction is reinforced by reports of miraculous cures in the press, in medical dramas on television, and by material on the Internet that allows patients to search for uncurated information that might explain their symptoms and communicate with others confronting similar issues. Pediatricians may be particularly vulnerable to experiencing this phenomenon because of intense parental desire for a diagnosis that captures the symptoms that their child is experiencing.5 As a result, many individuals believe that the solution to their or their child’s suffering exists around the next investigative corner, and they bring this expectation to each physician encounter. Unfortunately, at the end of these visits, if no organic diagnosis emerges, patients are often disappointed and unsatisfied and physicians are often frustrated.\n\nWe perceive that physicians generally tend to fall into 1 of … \n\nAddress correspondence to Neil L.

      "abstract": "Abstract This chapter highlights the Panic Disorder module in the Anxiety and Related Disorders Interview Schedule for DSM-5, Child and Parent Version: Child Interview Schedule (CIS). The interviewer should make sure that any “yes” response is not simply caused by exposure to a certain situation or object (Specific Phobia), being the focus of attention (Social Anxiety Disorder/Social Phobia), being separated from parents (Separation Anxiety), and so on. If the child gives examples that are the result of another anxiety disorder, or elaboration of the response to Question 1b suggests that the child does not seem to understand Question 1a, then the interviewer may ask Question 1c to reassess presence of “unexpected” panic attacks. DSM-5 defines a panic attack as a discrete period of intense fear or discomfort, in which at least four of the symptoms listed develop abruptly and reach a peak within minutes of onset. To meet the criteria for Panic Disorder, the child must report recurrent, unexpected panic attacks, at least one of which has been followed for a month by one or more symptoms.",

Despite the clarifications given by the Plenum of the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation, questions arise in judicial practice about the procedure for proving such circumstances as illness, physical pain, limited mobility, adverse sensations, painful symptoms, and moral suffering. Thus, in cases where harm has resulted in the occurrence of a disease, it is proposed to proceed from the presumption of the presence of negative consequences for the victim, which, nevertheless, can be refuted by the defendant. In particular, with objectively confirmed damage to the body, including as a result of the impact of the perpetrator of the harm, pain and negative consequences associated with the disease do not require additional proof. However, in the case of unverifiable pain or unverifiable suffering, which are primarily psychological in nature, it is proposed to proceed from the need for additional, in addition to the plaintiff’s explanation, proof of the grounds for their occurrence and the severity of the consequences. In this case, it is advisable to use the «balance of probabilities» standard of proof and pay attention to specific negative consequences. In cases where the victim presents medical documents to the court based only on his own explanations, such documents cannot transform the plaintiff ›s explanations into the category of written evidence. In turn, to establish the psychological consequences of the harm caused, it is necessary to use persons with special knowledge in psychology. The plaintiff should present the court with the expert’s opinion, and the court should consider the possibility of appointing an expert in such cases.",

      "title": "Posttraumatic Stress Disorder",
      "abstract": "Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is an intense and disabling response to a traumatic event. Acute PTSD occurs 1 to <3 months following the event, whereas chronic PTSD persists for 3 months or longer. The symptoms fall primarily into three clusters. The first includes reexperiencing the event. This reaction manifests clinically as distressing memories, nightmares, or the more extreme \"flashbacks\" to the event itself. During reexposure (either from internal cues such as reexperiencing in the mind, or external, such as visiting the scene of the accident), the person suffers from intense anxiety and distress. The second cluster can, to some extent, be seen as a reaction to the first. This response is characterized by avoidance of reexposure to the trauma and numbing to the psychological responses the exposure creates, including a more generalized emotional numbing. The third symptom cluster involves a constant hyperalert state. The person may have difficulty falling or staying asleep, may have an increased startle response, may have more trouble concentrating, and may be more generally irritable or angry.Approximately 70% of children have had exposure to a traumatic event before age 16 years; however, despite the large amount of exposure, the 6-month prevalence of PTSD in these patients is ∼3.7% for boys and 6.3% for girls. Protective factors against PTSD include, in descending order of importance, connections to positive caretakers, feelings of self-worth, feelings of hope, importance to others, talents valued by others, religious faith, and socioeconomic advantage.Specific risk factors for developing PTSD also exist. These factors primarily fall into four categories, the first of which includes lack of resilience or negative prior life experiences, which would include a history of other traumatic exposures, preexisting psychological problems, and substance abuse. The second main risk factor is the type of traumatic event. Nearly 100% of children who see a parent being killed or sexually assaulted acquire PTSD. This observation is important because it appears that in children, threat to a parent is equivalent to threat to self. Additionally, PTSD develops in 90% of sexually abused children, 77% of children who see a school shooting, and 35% who witness violence around their home.The effects of exposure to trauma through media are less clear. Many researchers have found that children resonate with media via reexposure if they were personally affected by the original trauma, but not if the trauma was more distant.A third area of risk concerns the child's reaction to the trauma. Dissociation, a psychological mechanism whereby a person attempts to protect him- or herself by separating from reality, was found to be strongly predictive of posttraumatic symptoms. Finally, the resources available to a child after a traumatic exposure can be critical. The most important of these is an attentive parent or guardian; thus, attending to parents' mental health can actually be the most effective intervention in aiding the child's recovery.Screening for and identifying PTSD can be difficult. Standardized assessments, such as the Traumatic Events Screening Inventory (see Suggested Reading) can be useful to evaluate exposure. Even after exposure is assessed, diagnosing PTSD itself can be complex, and may best be left to a child mental health provider. If a referral seems difficult, scheduling frequent appointments (monthly) to address any continued disability from the reaction to a trauma can be helpful.Treatment for PTSD is complicated and multifactorial. Regarding medications, there is some evidence that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have some utility. In adults, these agents have been shown to reduce symptoms in all three of the symptom clusters described previously, but in children, only two small studies (24 and 26 children, respectively) support their effectiveness. Additionally, SSRIs can lead to activation (irritability, poor attention, and sleep disturbance), which can mimic the hyperarousal cluster of PTSD symptoms.In two child-specific studies, clonidine was found to decrease basal heart rate, anxiety, impulsivity, and PTSD hyperarousal. Propranolol also was found to decrease reexperiencing and hyperarousal. Opiates may be beneficial, but should be used with caution. Even controlling for subjective pain, one study found that there was a significant linear association between morphine dosage and 6-month reduction in PTSD symptoms. Neuroleptic agents, such as risperidone, have shown mixed results. Benzodiazepines have not been found to be beneficial in treating PTSD-specific symptoms, and may worsen some symptoms characterized primarily by disinhibition (aggression, acting out).In children, the strongest empiricalevidence to date supports Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavior Therapy (TF-CBT). In fact, a study comparing TF-CBT and placebo to TF-CBT and an SSRI showed no significant differences in response rates. TF-CBT begins with the child directly discussing the traumatic event, and then proceeds to anxiety-management techniques, such as relaxation and correction of distorted trauma-related thoughts. Through this procedure, the children learn that they do not have to be afraid of their memories. CBT often is accompanied by psychological education and parental involvement. Research shows that the better parents cope with the trauma and the more they support their children, the better their children will function. Therefore, it is important for parents to seek treatment for themselves so as to develop the necessary coping skills that will help their children.Comments: After September 11th and, more recently, the devastating earthquake and tsunami in Japan, there has been more focused national and international attention on PTSD in children and adolescents. These experiences provide important examples of how communitywide interventions are essential and needed; however, Dr Kelly's In Brief reminded me of how important this topic is to patients whom I serve. I have worked most of my career with low-income patients who live in an urban area and I have been continually inspired by the resilience of these families. This In Brief reminded me of the heightened risk of these children and adolescents to PTSD because of their chance of witnessing or being involved with traumatic events, such as homicide, domestic violence, child abuse, house fires, or even dog attacks. I worry that parents may minimize some of these experiences because, unfortunately, they occur more frequently in urban communities. It is important that parents know that we as pediatric health-care providers have an interest in these experiences and to ensure that diagnosis and treatment is initiated.",

      "title": "The Physiological Aspects of the Stress",
      "abstract": "Generally the term stress refers to experiences of endangering one’s physical or psy­chological wellbeing. Physiological stress refers to bodily adaptation processes and the maintenance of body’s balance. Selye defined stress as a function of elevated corticosteroid levels and used the term stress to refer to the effects of any agent that threatens the homeostasis of the organism. The term allostasis which refers to the body’s ability to achieve stability. The allostatic load is assumed to be caused by frequent stress, lack of adaptation to repeated stress, and inability to shut down the allostatic response when the stress is over and inadequate response or dysfunction of the stress systems  Thus, psychological stress can be defined as a discrepancy between personal capacities and environmental demands. Somatic stress symptoms are related to both physiological and psychological stress. The different types of stressors are likely to elicit divergent stress reactions. The multifaceted nature of stress and various sources of stress must also be taken into account. It is important to define the stress precisely in epidemiological studies. Consequently, stress has been determined here in terms of stressful life events, experience of chronic stress, experimentally induced mental and physiological stress reactions and work stress. The work stress models that are presented here have been used extensively in studies of occupational and cardiovascular health. The inheritance of stress refers here to an innate temperament. Rationale is as follows: temperament a) has a biological basis, b) is highly inherited, and c) explains what one experiences as a stress and partly determines what the health consequences are. The common assumption in several temperament theories is that temperament plays important role in moderating stress. In the end we presented the comparative analysis between the eustress and distress.",

      "abstract": "Chronic pain is pain without a clear somatic substrate. As a result, patients with chronic pain often do not receive a clear diagnosis following a medical examination. In many patients, having pain without a proper explanation or diagnosis induces stress and the urge to search elsewhere for explanations and treatments. There is growing evidence that many chronic-pain syndromes, such as chronic low-back pain, whiplash and fibromyalgia, share the same pathogenesis: sensitisation of pain-modulating systems in the central nervous system at both spinal and supraspinal level. This central sensitisation is facilitated by numerous factors that contribute to the maintenance of pain in a way that differs from individual to individual. How sensitisation may develop and persist as a result of medical, psychological and social factors calls for research from the perspective of a bio-psycho-social model. If sensitisation is used to explain chronic pain to a patient and the patient understands the relation beween pain and the factors that play a role in the maintenance of the pain, this can lead to acceptation of a treatment learning to cope with these factors.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Depressive illness in the elderly may be the result of a physical illness, the cause of secondary physical problems, coincidental tophysical illness or the result of an aetiological factor common to both conditions. Analysis of a cross‐sectional community sample of 396 elderly people showed depression to be significantly linked to presence of headaches, dyspnoea, and malignant disease known to the patient. It was not linked with heart disease nor arthritis per se , although those on anti‐arthritic or analgesic medication were significantly more depressed. The subjective description of physical health given by the patient also correlated strongly with depression. Depressive illness is sometimes unrecognized and frequently untreated with a consequent reduction in quality of life for many patients. Clinicians must be aware of the possibility that depression may coexist with physical illness, and that both conditions may need appropriate treatment. Further analysis of the above sample, controlling for physical illness and the additive effect of the variables concerned, showed depression to be positively correlated with adverse social factors such as not going out because of physical disability, feeling lonely, having a shopper and having hearing difficulties. The home help service was identified as a probable protective factor, implying the importance of this service in supporting the emotional as well as the physical needs of its clients.",

      "title": "Extreme Psychospiritual States Versus Organic Brain Disease: Bringing Together Science and the Human Factor",
      "abstract": "Extreme states can be psychospiritual and “functional” in origin or they can be “organic” and driven by biological dysfunction. Contemporary psychiatry largely rejects this distinction, preferring to insist that everything “extreme” is biological in origin; but the distinction is important for understanding and helping people. Psychospiritual crises, including those labeled bipolar or schizophrenic, are “functional” and express meaning. As “bizarre” as the language or the symbols may seem, meanings that often reflect childhood abuse can be explored in a trusting, kind, and caring therapeutic relationship. The more that a real biological or organic dysfunction, such as traumatic head injury or neurotoxic exposure, is the root cause of the extreme state, the less sense its manifestations will make. Nonetheless, drug-induced extreme states, even when caused by hallucinogens or by psychiatric “medicines,” often leave sufficient brain function operational to reveal important meanings about the person’s experience, along with the otherwise senseless intoxication. With so many people prescribed psychiatric drugs, these neurotoxic chemicals are now the most common cause of extreme states in clinical practice, and withdrawal from these offending agents is critical to recovery (Breggin, 2013). However, even when the extreme state is driven by neurological dysfunction, a safe space and skilled therapists can help relieve the individual’s otherwise overwhelming feelings of anxiety or terror.",

Current prevalence ranges of factitious disorders is between 0.05 and 2.0%, with women being 4–20-fold more likely to be affected than men (1, 4–8). Contemporary psychodermatology classifies these disorders as: 1) dermatoses of primary psychiatric genesis (emotional/psychiatric disorders); 2) dermatoses with a multifactiorial basis, of which the course is subject to psychiatric influences (psychosomatic disease); or 3) secondary psychiatric disorders due to serious or disfiguring dermatoses (somatopsychic disease) (9).

      "abstract": "Muscle weakness is a common complaint among patients presenting to family physicians. Diagnosis begins with a patient history distinguishing weakness from fatigue or asthenia, separate conditions with different etiologies that can coexist with, or be confused for, weakness. The pattern and severity of weakness, associated symptoms, medication use, and family history help the physician determine whether the cause of a patient's weakness is infectious, neurologic, endocrine, inflammatory, rheumatologic, genetic, metabolic, electrolyte-induced, or drug-induced. In the physical examination, the physician should objectively document the patient's loss of strength, conduct a neurologic survey, and search for patterns of weakness and extramuscular involvement. If a specific cause of weakness is suspected, the appropriate laboratory or radiologic studies should be performed. Otherwise, electromyography is indicated to confirm the presence of a myopathy or to evaluate for a neuropathy or a disease of the neuromuscular junction. If the diagnosis remains unclear, the examiner should pursue a tiered progression of laboratory studies. Physicians should begin with blood chemistries and a thyroid-stimulating hormone assay to evaluate for electrolyte and endocrine causes, then progress to creatine kinase level, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and antinuclear antibody assays to evaluate for rheumatologic, inflammatory, genetic, and metabolic causes. Finally, many myopathies require a biopsy for diagnosis. Pathologic evaluation of the muscle tissue specimen focuses on histologic, histochemical, electron microscopic, biochemical, and genetic analyses; advances in technique have made a definitive diagnosis possible for many myopathies.",

An important aspect of pain is nociception, a complex series of electrochemical events that involves activation of specialized neural pathways in response to (potentially) tissue-damaging stimuli. Clinically, the degree of nociception is manifested as signs of tissue damage. Pain, in contrast to nociception, is a subjective experience that may involve stimulus-induced activation of afferent neural pathways or other components, such as somatosensory processing or psychosocial factors. Reflex responses to nociceptive stimulation can be described as suprasegmental or cortical and spinal or segmental. Spinal reflexes are generated by nociceptive signals being transmitted through the dorsal horn to somatomotor or autonomic neurons at various spinal levels, resulting in responses such as paralytic ileus, vasoconstriction, tachycardia, or muscle spasm. Suprasegmental reflexes are propagated via the ascending pathways to the brain stem, hypothalamus, and cortex, where withdrawal reflexes and autonomic responses are generated.",

      "abstract": "Non-organic voice disorders are characterised by an impaired voice sound, and/or reduced vocal capacity, and/or laryngeal sensory disturbances, all in the absence of causal organic laryngeal pathology. Psychogenic causes, a \"psychological disequilibrium\", and an increased tension of the laryngeal muscles are presumed to be one end of the spectrum of possible factors leading to the development of the disorder. In making a diagnosis, perceptive and acoustic methods for voice analysis are used in addition to the ENT-examination and the laryngostroboscopy. An assessment of the degree to which the patient feels him/herself subjectively affected by the voice disorder also plays an important role. If the history reveals any indication of psychosocial stress or conflict, the patient is offered psychological consultations. These conflicts seem less often to be deep rooted psychopathological problems but rather daily anxieties, failures, injuries, annoyances, disappointments regarding the sufferer him/herself and others, the non-fulfillment of desires, feelings of inadequacy and of lack of self-confidence. The patients may find it difficult to speak about conflicts and feelings, and they follow social conventions to an excessive extent. In frustrating situations patients tend to react aggressively towards themselves rather than towards others and are too quick in seeking a solution to any problem that may arise. The role of the voice as a \"barometer of emotion\", where a disorder may be regarded as a sign of emotional stress, has to be taken into consideration before starting a therapy: If the non-organic voice disorder is obviously due to vocal misuse and muscle tension, a more symptom-orientated voice therapy may be favoured. If psychosocial stress seems to play a greater role, additional counseling may be necessary. Only by using this approach can the patient be offered a therapy which goes into the causes and thereby addresses the whole person.",

      "title": "Primary or secondary? What came first and how to treat?",
      "abstract": "Most of the literature regarding the importance of accurately and efficiently differentiating neuropsychiatric symptoms as secondary to medical conditions or as a primary psychiatric illnesses is found in the emergency department setting. It has been reported that 6 to 12% of patients presenting to the emergency department have psychiatric complaints or behavioral disturbances.12 Patients with psychiatric or behavioral disturbances are generally \"medically cleared\" prior to transfer to psychiatric care.2 Assessing if a patient is \"medically cleared\" helps to identify medical illnesses that could cause or contribute to psychiatric or behavioral symptoms which may make treatment at a psychiatric facility inappropriate or even dangerous.2 Appropriate treatment in the emergency department setting, therefore, may prevent morbidity and mortality associated with misdiagnosing of a medical illness as a psychiatric illness and from improper treatment of psychiatric illnesses.2 When psychiatric, neurologic, or behavioral manifestations are secondary to medical conditions, the focus of treatment should be on the underlying condition.3 This can be said for any kind of signs or symptoms – rarely is a single or set of signs or symptoms addressed without an evaluation for the underlying root cause. Symptomatic treatment of the neuropsychiatric manifestations, however, should not be overlooked and should run parallel to the primary condition.3To help identify a primary psychiatric illness compared to symptoms secondary to a medical illness, several factors that may assist in clarifying diagnosis include a focus on cognitive versus somatic symptoms, identification of personal or family history of psychiatric illness and response to treatment, careful neurologic exam emphasizing cognitive and mental status exam as part of the physical exam, and an understanding that a psychiatric diagnosis is not purely a diagnosis of exclusion of medical illnesses.3 Features suggesting that psychiatric symptoms are secondary to a medical illness include an abrupt onset with no known or readily recognizable precipitants, a temporal association with onset, worsening, or remission of the psychiatric symptoms concurrent with the medical illness, and the presence of atypical features.34 Additionally, the absence of a personal or family history of psychiatric diagnosis, late onset of new behavioral symptoms, obvious systemic disease, evidence of increased intracranial pressure, nonauditory hallucinations, use of psychoactive or centrally-acting medications, the occurrence of autonomic dysfunction with good premorbid function, and treatment resistance further suggest a medical origin.4 Though routine laboratory testing of all psychiatric patients presenting to the emergency department has not been supported in the literature, it is suggested that a complete history (including a detailed medication history) and physical exam with a full set of vital signs may be sufficient to exclude medical reasons for symptom presentation.125 Further laboratory and ancillary testing may be guided by the obtained information.125 Obtaining information directly from the patient may be, at times, difficult to obtain, therefore, collateral history from bystanders, family, friends, caregivers, health care professionals, law enforcement, paramedics, etc. is important.2Illnesses that may be commonly known to be associated with psychiatric symptoms are presented in Table 1. Increasing awareness and understanding of neuropsychiatric symptoms and adverse effects (and subsequently, management) may lead to more appropriate therapy choices or management and improved patient care. Additionally, comorbid medical illnesses may have implications on psychotropic medication selection. This issue of the Mental Health Clinician highlights psychiatric and neurologic manifestations of medical illnesses or those adverse effects secondary to medications.",

      "title": "From Normative to Deviant Behaviour: Health and Illness Definitions Related to Children and Adolescents’ Perspectives",
      "abstract": "Medical solutions are currently being sought for a variety of behaviours or conditions described as deviant. Thus, since the 1980s, in the USA and UK and more recently in Portugal, diagnosis for health situations understood as problematic seems to have become common. A range of diagnostic, practices such as those related to dyslexia in children/adolescents with reading difficulties, or hyperactivity in others whose behaviours appear as deviating from the normative, among others, are frequently used. This attribution of deviance is part of a historical, social, cultural and economic process of enacting normality and deviance, and it often goes back to the medical sphere. This relates to what Parens describes as medicalisation: 'a process by which \"non-medical\" (or \"life\" or \"human\") problems become understood and treated as \"medical\" problems'. Therefore, this phenomenon 'of making medical' includes a range of activities involved in constructing new deviance definitions for social control. Zola also explains that very often medical intervention as social control seeks to limit, modify, regulate, isolate, or eliminate deviant behaviour with medical means and the interest of health. All of these aspects have a profound impact on children and adolescents' lives, since these still constitute historically invisible groups particularly vulnerable to victimization and labelling. Contrary to this approach, and assuming that children and adolescents are agents and not passive subjects, this chapter explores their perspectives regarding health and illness definitions and practices. The research is based on part of 10 focus group discussions with adolescents between 14 to 16 years from two public schools in Northern Portugal. We expect the results will enable a deeper understanding of the meaning of health and illness, as well as the implications of processes of medicalisation.",

      "abstract": "Patients with disorders of mood or affect make up a numerically very important part of the psychiatrically ill. To facilitate references to cause, outcome, and results of treatment in clinical situations, a number of classifications of the affective disorders have been proposed. The bases of these classifications are most varied, involving consideration of the extent and nature of the psychopathology present (for example, neurotic versus psychotic depression, agitated depression, retarded depression, smiling depression, hypochrondriacal depression); longitudinal history of the patient (recording, for example, manicdepressive illness, circular type, in a person who, in the course of one or several episodes of illness, has exhibited mood swings to both the manic and the depressive poles, or endogenous-reactive depression, determined on the basis of the presence or absence of clear and meaningful precipating events); and demographic data such as age (pointing, for example, to early onset versus late onset depression, or to involutional depression in illness occurring in elderly males or in menopausal or postmenopausal females). One very important basis of classification that has been largely neglected, but that would have considerable value from an etiologic viewpoint, is a genetic one. There is considerable evidence that genetic factors are important in affective disorders. Winokur & Pitts (1965) found a greater prevalence of both affective disorder and alcoholism in parents of affectively ill patients than in parents of a control group of medical, surgical, and obstetrical patients who had been matched for age, sex, ward versus private-room status, and marital status. These results appear in Table 1, in which it can be seen that for three other psychiatric disordersneurosis, schizophrenia, and chronic brain syndromethere was no significant increase in comparison with the control figures. The finding of a greater prevalence of alcoholism in fathers of affective patients further suggests a genetic trait, according to Hanna (1965), who proposed as one criterion of a",

An alternative, dimensional approach assumes that psychotic symptoms are continuous with normal experiences and are not necessarily associated with disability. Evidence for a continuum of psychosis comes from studies showing that the core symptoms of psychosis, delusions and hallucinations, are much more prevalent in the general population than their clinical counterparts. These milder forms of expression of psychosis show similar patterns of associations with demographic and environmental risk factors as the clinical disorder, providing further support for the notion of continuity. Although the majority of individuals experiencing these lesser psychotic “symptoms” are not in need of care, they may nevertheless have an increased risk of developing a clinical disorder. Transitions over the psychosis continuum may in part be driven by the cognitive and emotional response to the psychotic or psychosislike experiences.",

Among the factors identified as particularly relevant to define the cognitive effects of stress are the intensity or magnitude of stress, its origin (i.e., whether triggered by the task or externally), and its duration (i.e., whether acute or chronically delivered). At the cognitive end, the specific cognitive operation (e.g., implicit or explicit memory, long-term or working memory, goal-directed or habit learning) and information processing phases (e.g., learning, consolidation, and retrieval) are essential as well to define stress effects. The emerging view is that mild stress tends to facilitate cognitive function, particularly in implicit memory or simple declarative tasks or when the cognitive load is not excessive. Exposure to high or very high stress acutely (whether elicited by the cognitive task or experienced before being trained or tested in the task) or chronically impairs the formation of explicit memories and, more generally, of those that require complex, flexible reasoning (as typically observed for hippocampus- and prefrontal cortex-related functions) while improving performance of implicit memory and well-rehearsed tasks (as reported for amygdala-dependent conditioning tasks and for striatum-related processes). In addition to these general principles, there are important individual differences in the cognitive impact of stress, with gender and age being particularly influencing factors.

      "abstract": "Shame is an unpleasant and powerful feeling that occurs during the social exposure\r\nof your own shortcomings. It’s connected with a sudden drop in self-esteem because of a\r\nnegative evaluation of the self. Shame restrains, isolates, lessens and limits. It starts because\r\nof a developmental mistake in an early dyadic relationship with the first important object. It is\r\na reaction to rejection, or to real or imaginary danger of losing that object. Complications\r\nduring the self structuring lead to lasting narcissistic sensitivity and a tendency to shame.\r\nShame hurts more than guilt because the whole self is subjected to a negative assessment, not\r\njust inadequate behavior. It is one of the main narcissistic affects. It exists in either open or hidden form. Narcissistic patients often suffer from overwhelming, conscious or unconscious\r\nchronic shame. With the domination of shame, we often find a disorder of the self in the\r\nclinical picture of narcissistic people. Shame is an affect that suggests that self is endangered\r\nso change and consolidation are needed. Due to intolerance to feeling of shame in these\r\npatients, it carries the risk of several complications, of which suicide is the worst. In\r\npsychoanalytic therapies unconscious shame must be made conscious so it can be analysed,\r\nworked on, and then used in therapy as a motivational and a driving tool. Except for its\r\nnegative sides, shame has an important protective and warning function, as well as an\r\nevolutionary and an upbringing role.

      "title": "Body Dysmorphic Disorder: Common, Severe and in Need of Treatment Research",
      "abstract": "The appearance preoccupations trigger feelings of depression, anxiety, distress, shame, or other painful emotions. These emotions, in turn, trigger repetitive compulsive behaviors that are intended to alleviate the emotional distress [5] . As required by DSM-5 criterion B (which is new to DSM-5), all individuals with BDD perform excessive repetitive behaviors in response to the preoccupations with appearance at some time during the course of the disorder [1] . These repetitive behaviors have many similarities to OCD compulsions, and thus they are commonly referred to as compulsions or rituals. Common excessive behaviors include checking mirrors, excessive grooming, seeking reassurance about the perceived defects, skin picking (to try to minimize perceived blemishes), and tanning (e.g. to darken ‘pale’ skin) [3] . Some BDD compulsions consist of mental acts, such as comparing one’s own appearance with that of other people, rather than observable behaviors [3] . The repetitive behaviors are difficult to control and occur, on average, for 3–8 h a day [4, 5] . Nearly all patients camouflage the perceived defects (e.g. with a hat, makeup, hair, clothes, body position). Although camouflaging is a safety behavior, it can also be done repeatedly (e.g. reapplying makeup 20 times a day), in which case it may be considered a repetitive behavior [3] . Body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) is common yet very under-recognized. It has a point prevalence of about 2%, making it more common than obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), anorexia nervosa or schizophrenia [1] . BDD typically causes tremendous suffering and substantial impairment in psychosocial functioning. The rates of suicidal ideation, suicide attempt and completed suicide appear markedly high. Yet treatment research on BDD lags very far behind that of other common and severe disorders. Thus, the study by Veale et al. [2] is a major contribution to the literature and to patient care. Individuals with BDD (previously known as ‘dysmorphophobia’) are preoccupied with one or more perceived defects or flaws in their appearance; these defects, however, are not observable or appear only slight to others (DSM-5 criterion A) [1] . Preoccupations most often focus on skin (e.g. perceived acne, scarring, wrinkles, color), nose (e.g. size or asymmetry) and hair (e.g. too little hair) but may focus on any body area [3] . Patients typically describe the disliked body parts as ‘ugly’, ‘unattractive’, ‘hideous’, or even ‘monstrous’. The preoccupations occur, on average, for 3–8 h a day (usually for at least an hour a day). They are intrusive, unwanted, and usually difficult to resist and control [4, 5] .

      "abstract": "Post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) occurs after a person has been exposed to a traumatic event involving actual or threatened death, and has responded with intense fear or helplessness. The event is then persistently re-experienced. The person avoids stimuli associated with the trauma and experiences a numbing of general responsiveness. Symptoms of increased arousal can occur as well as depression and anxiety. PTSD causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. The general practitioner is uniquely placed to identify PTSD and can have a key role in treatment. Cognitive behavioural treatment is a central therapeutic approach and can be carried out in general practice. The issues are to counteract the physiological components, expose the patient to the feared situation and help the patient to relearn that the stimuli are not necessarily associated with danger or threat. Repeated brief consultations over time can facilitate this process.",

      "abstract": "Sexual sadistic and masochistic disorders fall into the paraphilic disorders according to the DSM-5 classification. Paraphilic disorders are defined as persistent, intense and atypical forms of sexual excitement that appear with clinically significant functional impairment. The original clinical use of the terms sadism and masochism was to describe the sexual perversions of attaining sexual pleasure by hurting or being hurt. These terms have been usefully expanded to mean emotional sadism and masochism: experiencing emotional satisfaction or comfort due to exercising power over another or submitting to another’s power. This disorder begins at an early age and most sadists and masochists are actually satisfied with their unconventional sexual activity. Personality disorders are divided into three groups: A, B, and C, based on descriptive similarities. Group B in the classification of personality disorder is composed of an antisocial, histrionic, borderline and narcissistic personality disorder. People who fall into this group are characterized by impulsiveness and emotional instability, in their behavior they are dramatic and mischievous. Unlike true love, falling in love by itself is not a conscious choice nor a willing act. Love constitutes a voluntary act with which spritiual growth and maturity of ourselves and others is achieved. Similarly, love is action, not a feeling. In every long-lasting romantic relationship, including sadomasochistic ones, mutual respect and paying atttention play a major role.",

Although grief is not a disease and most people adjust without professional psychological intervention, bereavement is associated with excess risk of mortality, particularly in the early weeks and months after loss. It is related to decrements in physical health, indicated by presence of symptoms and illnesses, and use of medical services. Furthermore, bereaved individuals report diverse psychological reactions. For a few people, mental disorders or complications in the grieving process ensue. We summarise research on risk factors that increase vulnerability of some bereaved individuals. Diverse factors (circumstances of death, intrapersonal and interpersonal variables, ways of coping) are likely to co-determine excesses in ill-health. We also assess the eff ectiveness of psychological intervention programmes. Intervention should be targeted at high-risk people and those with complicated grief or bereavement-related depression and stress disorders.",

      "abstract": "Abstract This chapter examines chronic pain. Pain starts as a symptom—associated, for example, with arthritis or neuropathy—and, for one in five Americans, this symptom becomes “chronic,” that is, it lasts for weeks, or months, or even years. Chronic pain has its own reliable neurobiology and its own brain activation signature—although it cannot be localized in any specific “pain area” like other sensory perceptions, such as smell or sight. Still, pain changes the brain’s structure, its neuronal configurations. Moreover, pain’s significance in a person’s life is highly individualized. The experience of chronic pain can be altered by mood, sleep quality, distraction, suggestion, or even anticipation of new pain. This implies that pain may be exacerbated by social conditions—by violence, by anxiety. Living in poverty, for example, increases the odds of living with chronic pain. Although pain is real, it is still doubted and disputed. In the legal system, it is the subject of arguments over payment for disability claims and personal injury suits. The lack of an objective measure of pain means that some who might deserve compensation miss out because they cannot “prove” their discomfort. Assessing and treating pain, recognizing the pain of others, coping with its presence, and limiting its ruinous effects without misusing opioids or taking one’s own life remain central tests of people’s empathy and their efforts to promote health.",

      "title": "Manic episode with psychotic symptoms in a patient with Pseudologia Fantastica of years of evolution. A case report",
      "abstract": "Introduction Pseudologia Fantastica (PF) also called “mythomania” is a disorder centred on the tendency of the sufferer to distort reality through constant lies. These patients find it difficult to moderate their sense of self and their self-esteem. Therefore, they display significant grandiosity, which seems to defend them from intense psychological disturbance, pretending to counteract deep feelings of unworthiness, emptiness and alienation. Notable characteristics include: normal or above average IQ, absence of formal thought disorder, poor sense of identity, poor sexual adjustment, low frustration tolerance, strong dependency needs and narcissism. The phenomenon of “imposture” (the person’s claim of achievement or having connections to famous or influential people) is frequent. The patient’s history often shows that one or both parents were experienced as rejecting figures. They are more likely to be involved in legal problems and 20% receive some form of psychiatric treatment. The aetiology and pathogenesis of this disorder requires consideration of developmental disturbances, personal history and current life stressors. Objectives A case of a patient with PF is presented followed by a theoretical review on the topic. Methods A case is presented with a bibliographic review. Results We admitted a 47-year-old man to the Acute Hospitalisation Unit for a suspected “psychotic episode with clinical mania”. He presented manic and psychotic symptoms, with delusional ideation of months of evolution, megalomaniacal and fantastic discourse, centred on his work with high-ranking government officials and other implausible events. Multiple academic, work and personal life failures, with a diagnosis of depression 15 years earlier. During admission, he constantly confirms his history. He tends to present a rationalising discourse and a minimising attitude towards behavioural alterations. He appears cooperative and docile at certain times, while at others he is irritable, complaining and threatening. As for medication, olanzapine was initially prescribed at a dose of 20 mg per day, which was reduced to 10 mg given the psychopathological improvement and the difficulties of adherence. On discharge, the presumptive diagnosis was “delusional disorder and probable personality disorder with narcissistic traits, with a history of PF, which in recent months has presented a manic episode with psychotic symptoms”. Conclusions Their management poses challenges in terms of engaging with treatment and building a therapeutic alliance. It is important to assess the social and legal implications. Ensuring that they have stable relationships and adequate social supports is essential for successful treatment. Further exploration and research into this disorder is needed to better understand its manifestations and psychiatric consequences. Disclosure of Interest None Declared",

      "abstract": "A depressive issue is a disease that includes the body, state of mind, and contemplations. It meddles with day by day life, typical working, and causes torment for both the individual with the confusion and the individuals who think about him or her. A number of people have suggested that mood disorders are an evolutionary adaptation [39,40]. A low or depressed mood can improve an individual's ability to cope with situations in which the effort to pursue a major goal could result in danger, loss, or wasted effort.",

Ces troubles ont en commun : la problematique de leur definition et de leur reconnaissance par l'equipe de reanimation, leur expression frequente par un comportement d'agitation, une association avec la reponse de stress post-agressive rencontree au cours des pathologies traitees en reanimation. La physiopathologie de ces troubles est complexe, impliquant a la fois la pathologie qui a determine l'hospitalisation du patient en reanimation, ses antecedents medicaux, mais aussi la reanimation elle-meme par les therapeutiques invasives qui y sont utilisees, ainsi que la sedation medicamenteuse ou le coma artificiel. En outre, ces troubles peuvent etre associes dans leur expression comme dans leur determination, certain pouvant etre cause ou consequence d'un autre. L'objectif de cette these etait de montrer qu'une prise en charge diagnostique et therapeutique rationalisee de la douleur, des troubles neurologiques et psychologiques etait associee a un meilleur pronostic du patient en reanimation.",

      "abstract": "One of the significant challenges of maintaining animals in captivity is the development of abnormal behavior in some individuals. The presence of abnormal behavior is often construed as a marker for ill being, indicating some adverse exposure to psychosocial stress. Abnormal behavior is any pattern of activity that differs from some standard. The ethological standard focuses on species-typical behaviors that have been shaped by natural selection. Abnormal behavior patterns are classified into four broad categories: stereotypic behaviors, which include locomotor, mouth-directed, and body-directed activities; dangerous self-directed behaviors that can cause tissue damage; affective behaviors indicative of abnormal mood states; and displacement activities. An association between painful disorders and the development of abnormal behavior has been noted in some animals.",

      "title": "Haliucinacijų etiologijos aspektai",
      "abstract": "Hallucinations are misperceptions of things or events with one or more senses when an internal or external trigger doesn’t exist. They can be divided into visual, audioverbal, olfactorical, tactile and gustatory. Hallucinations develop due to 3 main pathophysiologicalmechanisms: psychophysiological, psychobiochemical (neurohormone dependent) and psychodynamic. Etiology of these perceptions consists of many things and is not always binned to psychiatric illnesses. These are some of the etiological factors which will be mentioned further bellow: psychosis, delirium, dementia, Charles Bonnet syndrome, Anton syndrome, seizures, migraine, Lhermitte syndrome, sleep disorders and “Alice in Wonderland” syndrome. Audioverbal hallucinations are thought to be a misperceptionof one’s own thoughts which are understood as the speech of someone else. This happens because of distorted function of frontotemporal efferents. These parts of brain are known for their sensorial region activation in the brain and also for the identification and perception of triggers that arise in a person. Furthermore, and increased activity of Wernicke’s region, right putamen, thalamus, and nucleus caudatus was also noticed. During the events of audioverbalhallucinations increased activity of Broca’s region and dorsal cortex of gyrus cinguli were noticed. Subcortical structures might also be the reason or the regulating part of the brain responsiblefor the manifestation of hallucinations which originate in the cortex. Visual hallucinations appear after triggering the primary or associational visual cortex, deafferetion mechanism, when there is some sort of damage to the periferial or central parts of nervous system responsible for visual perceptions. In addition, sleep and wakefulness cycles might be unbalanced and there can be some cognitive disorders.",

Depression can seriously impact a child’s academic achievement, social interactions and other aspects of their daily lives. [1] The reported prevalence of depression is 1 to 2% in prepubescent children, 3 to 8% in younger teenagers and 14% in teenagers aged 15 to 18; overall, it is estimated that 20% of the population will experience at least one episode of depression prior to the age of 18. [2] During childhood there is no significant gender difference in the prevalence of depression, but after puberty female rates of depression become higher than those for males. [3] The etiology of childhood depression remains unclear: it may be caused by the interaction of various risk factors and protective factors including genetic predisposition, abnormalities of the structure and function of the brain, psychological and physiological stressors, poor parental relationships, and so forth.

Feelings of ambivalence towards pregnancy, a distorted perception of reality, the unconscious refusing of a wanted child and the worry about a relation between nutrition of the foetus and the HG have influence on the development of the HG. The role of the social context, especially the mother, of expectations towards vomiting and of secondary gain in the genesis and the evaluation of HG is explained. Therapeutical approaches beside the known somatic therapies are acupuncture, the electric stimulation of the N. vestibularis and different methods of psychotherapy, which can include the partner or other persons from the social context. In some cases an intensified therapy under in-patient conditions can improve therapeutic results.Psychosocial factors are involved not only in the genesis of HG, but also in the duration and intensity of symptoms as well as in the resistance especially, towards isolated somatic therapeutical approaches.When psychosocial factors are taken into account in the search for a cause and the treatment of HG results of treatment are more successful and persist over a longer time.",

      "abstract": "A number of behavioral, social, biological, and cultural factors are associated with suicide. However, the ability to predict an imminent suicide attempt remains problematic. Prior studies indicate that the manifest dream content of depressed, non-suicidal patients differs from that of depressed, suicidal patients. The dream imagery of depressed, suicidal patients contains themes of death, dying, violence, and departure. The dream imagery of depressed, non-suicidal patients contains themes of rejection, helplessness, hopelessness, humiliation, failure, and loss. In the present study, the dream reports of 52 depressed patients were collected and rated for various themes. Patients were divided into three groups: Depressed and non-suicidal; Depressed, with suicidal ideation; Depressed, with suicidal ideation and/or attempt(s). Themes of death and/or dying, and to a lesser extent, themes of violence, injury, and/or murder occurred with greater frequency in the dream reports of depressed patients with suicidal ideation and/or attempts, than in the dream reports of depressed patients without suicidal ideation or behavior. These observations correspond with the prevailing psychodynamic explanation of suicide; namely, that it is a murderous attack on the self that is identified with hated internalized objects.",

      "abstract": "From a historical point of view, medicine (in modern society) has set its mission as to cure diseases–medical–type issues–and to ignore patient's condition–illness endurance. By accepting this point of view with reference to their problem, patients have entered some sort of conspiracy of silence and started ignoring the emotional reaction to their medical problems (or to cancel these reactions), regarding them as irrelevant to the problem itself. This approach is also reinforced by the medical pattern that absolutely contests the idea that mind influences the body in a very important way.\r\n\r\nAnother equally unproductive ideology is the idea that people could cure themselves alone even of the most serious illnesses by feeling happy or by thinking in a positive manner, or the idea that people are guilty of getting sick. This attitude resulted in creating a widespread confusion and in significant misunderstandings regarding the extent to which illness can be influenced by mind, at times even blaming someone for having got ill.\r\n\r\nIn the world of illness, emotions have supremacy and fear is the only ‘thought’. We can be so fragile emotionally speaking when we suffer from some illness because part of our mental good–humor is partially based on the illusion of invulnerability. Illness–especially a severe one – destroys this illusion and cancels the premise that our world is one in which existence is completely secure. All of a sudden, we feel thick with weaknesses, we feel helpless and vulnerable [12].\r\n\r\nThere is a problem when the medical personnel ignore the way patients react from an emotional point of view, even though they should exclusively take care of our physical state. This lack of interest in the emotional reality of an illness neglects something obvious which shows that the emotional state of people can play a significant role as to their vulnerability towards illness and during the recovery process [4].\r\n\r\nThere is already a scientific basis according to which a limit to the medical efficiency appears not only during the prophylactic process but also during treatment. This efficiency can be enhanced by curing the emotional state of the patient at the same time with his/her medical state. Unfortunately, too often, the medical personnel is in a hurry or unsympathetic towards patients' despair and, seemingly, things get worse indeed in the midst of the medical system harsh reality, medical system that depends too much on time keeping performed by accountants [5 ].",

The most frequently reported symptoms experienced via somatization are pain, gastrointestinal and/or neurological. It is important to recognize that an underlying illness or injury can itself be a significant stressor that triggers or exacerbates somatization. For example, a child with epilepsy might also have non-epileptic seizures, or a child with cancer might get nauseated in anticipation of a hospital admission for chemotherapy.Somatization is not intentional; it is an automatic or habitual physical and behavioral response to stress. While it is possible with training and practice to gain some control over one’s symptoms, somatization is not equivalent to falsifying symptoms (as one might see in malingering or a factitious disorder). Therefore, to simply suggest that one cease somatizing is not helpful.",

En cambio otras pueden desarrollar con mayor facilidad una conducta adictiva a las actividades, a las máquinas u objetos o a las personas de manera exclusiva, permanente y/o sucesiva, a la cual se le denomina personalidad adictógena. Una de estas patologías es la conducta adictiva al juego llamada también ludopatía y es la que desarrollaremos en este trabajo. Se presentan las características clínicas del trastorno, las diferentes etapas del proceso adictivo, incidiendo en los mecanismos cognitivos. Se propone una clasificación del adicto al juego. AbstractThe addicionology field is more extensive these days than many years ago because it comes up pathology some at chemical substance addiction but there aren't a psychoactive substance in use, this pathology is calling for the specialists \"addictive behaviors\" or none conventional addictions.

One of this interesting and complexity pathology is the gambler addictive behavior, calling also ludopatia and the following are the clinical profile. Characteristics of gambling are presented, the stages of the addictive process, especially on cognitive mechanisms. A classification of gambler is presented.",

      "title": "Mental fatigue and chronic fatigue syndrome in clinical practice",
      "abstract": "Fatigue is an extremely disabling symptom both in healthy people and in various diseases. Physical fatigue is characterized by limitations in physical functioning, while mental/cognitive fatigue involves difficulties in concentrating and performing cognitive tasks. Mental and physical fatigue exist in both pathological and physiological fatigue. Fatigue is primarily an adaptive physiological process. It is a signal to have a rest and helps conserve energy to prevent injury, which can be useful after intense work, or when the body’s defenses need to be redistributed, for example, during infectious disease. It is important to distinguish between fatigue or tiredness and chronic fatigue syndrome in clinical practice. Chronic fatigue syndrome has multisystem manifestations and affects millions of people globally. Although the exact aetiology of chronic fatigue syndrome is uncertain, the studies point to neurological, immunological, autonomic and energy disorders. The main sings of chronic fatigue syndrome are debilitating fatigue that is worsened by activity, poor exercise tolerance, unrefreshing sleep and cognitive impairment. Reduced information processing speed is the most common cognitive impairment in chronic fatigue syndrome. Other manifestations include decreased reaction time, working memory, and attention. These symptoms must persist for at least 3–6 months for a diagnosis to be made. As there are no specific tests for chronic fatigue syndrome, a diagnosis can be established on the basis of a medical history and physical examination. Although there are no standards-based methods specific to chronic fatigue syndrome, clinicians can reduce the severity of symptoms using pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatment approaches that have proved their efficacy in clinical practice. In particular, nootropics are widely used in asthenic conditions and chronic fatigue syndrome. Fonturacetam is a nootropic drug that directly activates brain integration activities, promotes memory consolidation, and improves concentration and mental activity.",

No matter monogenic or sporadic, the form of dystonia is a growing evidence, suggesting the presence of non-motor components to the disorder. Dystonia patients suffer from reduced quality of life, which might be related not only to the dystonic movements itself but to different non-motor symptoms and signs, as well. Based on literature review, this chapter aims to focus on the association of different types of isolated/primary dystonia (forms of focal, segmental, and generalized dystonia) with some non-motor disorders, including sleep and psychiatric disorders, cognition, as though as pain and sensory symptoms, their pathophysiological and biochemical mechanisms, relations with the symptomatic treating strategies for the abnormal movements, and specific treatment for the non-motor signs.",

      "title": "LIVING WITH A CHRONIC DISEASE, EMOTIONAL RESPONSES TO CHRONIC DISEASE",
      "abstract": "The way the individual is psychologically affected by the disease depends on many factors. Some of them include the nature of the disease, its severity and treatment, other factors that affect the ability of individuals to cope with the disease related to their personality, circumstances in their life before illness and the level of social support that they have. Regardless of these factors, all individuals pass certain stages while trying to adjust and cope with the reality of the chronic condition. In this paper we review the stages of acceptance of the chronic disease and emotional reactions to the chronic disease such as sadness, fear, anxiety, anger, depression and guilt. When a person finds out that it's diagnosed with chronic illness, first reaction may be shock, denial and disbelief that anything is wrong. The persistence of the symptoms is difficult to ignore. The resistance to the actual changes that occur in the body cause a person to be exerting much more than its body can sustain, creating exhaustion and a growing decrease of strength. In response to the uncertainty of the future, a feeling of anxiety and fear of the possible loss of unrealized goals may appear, which leads to sadness, depression and regret. Additional losses occur in the form of a force to abandon previous roles and responsibilities which leads to a feeling of inadequacy and guilt. A person becomes sensitive to the potential burden that now his loved ones can feel, which leads to more shame and eventual dissatisfaction and anger. The loss of the sense of independence has an impact on self-confidence, self-esteem and self-image, a real identity crisis can appear. As a result of the increased sense of dependence, emotions associated with loss of status, power and control occurs, which exceed once healthy and capable functioning of the individual. Very often a stigma is present which is associated with the illness and may also be a result of reactions from others, including friends and family and all that can cause an increased withdrawal and isolation. The individual becomes affected by a sense of abandonment, rejection and loneliness. Bringing together all these possible reactions, guilt and self-punishment occurs, imposed upon themselves because they have the disease in the first place. In addition to trying to cope with this disease on a daily basis, it is not surprising that the profound nature of these emotional consequences can cause a feeling of helplessness and hopelessness. Fortunately, there are ways that a person can learn to move through all the complex reactions and adjustments he is facing, as he will pass through the different stages of the disease.",

      "abstract": "Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is triggered by an individual experiencing or witnessing a traumatic event, often precipitating persistent flashbacks and severe anxiety that are associated with a fearful and hypervigilant presentation. Approximately 14–30% of traumatized individuals present with the dissociative subtype of PTSD, which is often associated with repeated or childhood trauma. This presentation includes symptoms of depersonalization and derealization, where individuals may feel as if the world or self is “dream-like” and not real and/or describe “out-of-body” experiences. Here, we review putative neural alterations that may underlie how sensations are experienced among traumatized individuals with PTSD and its dissociative subtype, including those from the outside world (e.g., touch, auditory, and visual sensations) and the internal world of the body (e.g., visceral sensations, physical sensations associated with feeling states). We postulate that alterations in the neural pathways important for the processing of sensations originating in the outer and inner worlds may have cascading effects on the performance of higher-order cognitive functions, including emotion regulation, social cognition, and goal-oriented action, thereby shaping the perception of and engagement with the world. Finally, we introduce a theoretical neurobiological framework to account for altered sensory processing among traumatized individuals with and without the dissociative subtype of PTSD.",

      "abstract": "Psychiatric epidemiology constitutes an important subdiscipline of scientific psychiatry. Nevertheless, it still lags behind other branches of epidemiology. This has been attributed to the difficulties encountered in conceptualising and measuring mental disorders.1 It is only recently that the emphasis in the field has shifted from descriptive to analytical research and this is probably because of the influences from genetic epidemiology and social sciences.2 Psychiatric epidemiology has taken most of its tools from general epidemiology—that is, chronic disease epidemiology.3 It is therefore not surprising that no fundamental differences between the mother discipline and her psychiatric descendant exist. Yet, there are particular challenges in the conduct of psychiatric epidemiological research that are absent or less prominent in general, mostly somatically oriented, epidemiology.4 Challenges particularly encountered in psychiatric epidemiology include\n\n\n\n1. Assessment of caseness: psychiatric diagnoses are mostly made on the basis of symptoms—patients’ reports of their subjective experiences—and not signs, like fever in general medicine. Moreover, there are no pathognomonic symptoms or signs;\n\n2. Neither most mental disorders nor their best-known risk factors, like social deprivation, stress exposure, lack of social support, social isolation, abnormal personality traits or genetic liability, are as easily captured in a singular variable as tends to be the case in the epidemiology of somatic disease;\n\n3. Making a psychiatric diagnosis is costly in time and effort; and\n\n4. Information bias and non-response bias are more of a problem in psychiatric epidemiology than in other branches of epidemiology.\n\n\n\nIn our view, this warrants recognition of the epidemiology subspecialty “psychiatric epidemiology”.\n\nIn trying to cope with the above-mentioned challenges, psychiatric epidemiology has developed a set of concepts, albeit limited, and vocabulary of its own.

Massive trauma cannot be grasped because there are neither words nor categories of thought adequate to its representation; knowledge of trauma is also fiercely defended against, as it poses a momentous threat to psychic integrity. Yet knowing nevertheless occurs on some level, often in restricted or defensive forms. This paper sets forth various forms of knowing and not knowing massive historical trauma as manifested in clinical symptomatology, transference phenomena, life themes and witnessing narratives. Metaphor is also mentioned as yet another form of knowing and addressing trauma, available primarily to those who have not been directly affected as victims nor as family members of victims. The different forms imply a continuum of progressively more integrated and subjectively owned levels of knowing, directly related to the actual and psychological distance from the traumatic event. Illustrations drawn from clinical and testimonial settings are given for each level of knowing described, and implications for therapeutic strategy are discussed.",

      "abstract": "The criminal couple is an uncommon phenomenon, since criminals act alone or involving other individuals in a fortuitous manner. The murders committed in pairs represent a rather rare eventuality (it is estimated that in Italy they are about 5%). At the base of this very particular dynamic there is the c.d. folie à deux, otherwise indicated in the psychiatric nosography as “Shared Psychotic Disorder” and ICD-10 as “Induced Delusional Disorder”. Described for the first time in 1887 by Lasègue and Falret, it is characterized by the appearance of a delirium in a subject called the Primary Case, shared by the induced subject. The delusional couple lives in close correlation and at the same time isolated from the social context, conditions that facilitate the influence of the incube, bearer of a more serious mental pathology, on the succubus not necessarily affected by a psychotic pathology, nor, by force coming from a criminal subculture. The succubus therefore welcomes the delirious ideas of the incube and makes them its own, giving life not to the simple sum of two individuals but to a quid novi represented by the couple, united by a very strong pathological dependence. This contribution aims to highlight, through the analysis of some famous homicidal couples, the recognition or otherwise of the perpetrators of crimes, a total or partial defect of mind and the consequent imputability not omitting considerations on the social reintegration of them; once the prison sentence has been expiated.",

On the other hand, fatigue as a pathological condition is always experienced as an ,unpleasant sensation. Asthenia is perceived as an unpleasant sensation whenever it exceeds one’s physiological resources, such as rest that must be recuperated. In a number of nontumor-associated conditions, asthenia, experienced as fatigue and/or weakness, is definitely a component or even a leading symptom (Table 9.1).",

It Is suggested that the convergence of a number of factors is necessary for the production of the Illness. These factors include an individual's control or repression of emotional discharge over a long period. In addition, the affected person may show personality characteristics consistent with such control, and may live In a situation of unresolved conflict. The choice of illness might be determined by organ “weakness”. The persistence of symptoms after resolution of the conflict is explained in terms of conditioning.",

Two cases are presented on the etiology of organic brain lesions which result in an eerie form of remoteness. In one instance, the man's intelligence and comprehension remain intact while his total span of memory is less than 5 minutes. In another man, intelligence remains intact while the capacity to recognize and remember is increasingly diminishing.

      "abstract": "Stalkers can be loosely divided into those without a mental disorder (usually disgruntled ex-partners) and those who are mentally disordered. Although the former group is by far the larger, very little is known about the characteristics of those stalkers. The mentally disordered group comprises mainly those with erotomanic delusions, presenting either as a primary illness or secondary to another mental illness. The impact of stalking on victims is enormous - many develop post-traumatic stress disorder, contemplate suicide and suffer immense disruption to their lives. A sizeable portion of stalking victims are subjected to physical and/or sexual assault. Anti-stalking laws are usually ineffective against erotomanic stalkers, but may be more effective in deterring non-disordered stalkers. The efficacy of treatment for mentally disordered stalkers is mixed - in some cases the illness resolves completely while in others it persists unabated, often for decades.",

      "title": "Using digital mediums to provice trauma-informed support to people with complex presentations",
      "abstract": "When we talk about ‘severe’ mental health difficulties or ‘complex presentations’, we usually mean mental health difficulties that significantly affect people in their day-to-day lives, often over a number of years or in conjunction with other health conditions. Some might consider particular diagnoses as evidence of a ‘complex presentation,’ such as psychosis or bipolar disorder. However, there is usually a spectrum of severity and experience within any ‘diagnosis,’ and a degree of overlap in signs and symptoms across conditions. For instance, the experience of hearing voices others can’t (be it internal or external) could result from: large doses of certain pain relief or immunosuppressant medication following a major surgery; intrusive thoughts associated with obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) or eating disorders; psychosis; or dissociation. It is also widely recognised that stress, trauma and low self-compassion underpin many frightening and critical auditory hallucinatory experiences, for example. These are broadly psychosocial factors and not symptoms of illness. Therefore, for the purposes of this chapter, we will focus on supporting people with a range of ‘complex presentations’, rather than focusing on specific diagnoses or clusters of specific symptoms. The National Health Service within the UK recognise that complex mental health does not just refer to an individual’s diagnosis, but to a number of different factors (NHS England 2019). This includes: • The nature, duration and severity of mental health problems • Any co-occurring drug or alcohol dependency • The nature, duration and severity of co-existing physical health problems • Problems associated with ageing, such as frailty • The availability and quality of personal and social support and networks • Any associated functional impairment, or impact on activities of daily living • The effectiveness of current or past support or interventions",

Diese ‚psychosomatischen‘ Komorbiditäten nehmen mit der Migräneschwere weiter zu. Schwer betroffene, komorbide Patienten haben oft auch ein schlechteres Ansprechen auf die spezifische Migränetherapie. Interessanterweise haben die Migräne und die genannten Komorbiditäten zahlreiche gemeinsame ätiologische oder begünstigende Faktoren, z.B. genetische Faktoren, das häufigere Vorkommen bei Frauen und bei Menschen mit traumatischen Vorerfahrungen, sowie (bei Schmerzsyndromen) Zeichen einer zentralen Sensibilisierung. Eine weitere Gemeinsamkeit ist der Zusammenhang mit aktuellem oder chronischem Stresserleben. Wir schlagen ein erweitertes Diathese-Stress-Modell vor, das zusammenhängende, aber doch individuell unterschiedliche Vulnerabilitäten berücksichtigt und, abhängig vom Stresserleben, sowohl das Auftreten einzelner Erkrankungen (z.B. einer isolierten Migräne) als auch das gemeinsame Auftreten der Migräne mit anderen Schmerzsyndromen und weiteren psychosomatischen Komorbiditäten abbilden kann.

      "title": "Toward a Dimensional Understanding of Psychosis and Its Treatment",
      "abstract": "Psychosis is a mental state characterized by a set of perceptual, thought disorder, and cognitive symptoms and constructs that manifest themselves in several psychiatric diseases, such as schizophrenia and mood disorders, but also in some neurological disorders, such as epilepsy, Huntington's disease, and Alzheimer's disease, and in some medical diseases, especially endocrinological and metabolic conditions. Psychotic symptoms are characterized by a combination of hallucinatory experiences, delusional interpretations of reality, and frank thought disorder, often accompanied by thought and behavior disorganization. Psychotic symptoms are experienced by individuals as real cognitive and sensory occurrences and involve all sensory modalities (auditory, visual, olfactory, gustatory, and tactile). The most characteristic experience of psychosis is \"loss of reality,\" which represents the psychotic individual's unquestioned perception that his or her symptoms are real occurrences and not pathological mental constructs; this experience occurs particularly in psychiatric psychotic syndromes. The World Health Organization's International Psychosis Study (Carpenter et al. 1973) investigated whether psychotic symptoms vary around the world in different cultures and regions by examining psychosis in individuals across seven countries; the conclusion was that psychotic symptomatology spans continents, languages, and cultures with great similarity, albeit with great interindividual variability. Several first-person accounts written by brilliant and self-perceptive individuals with psychosis record the nature of psychosis and illustrate the profound loss of reality testing around psychotic experiences. John Nash described the nature of his delusion:These ideas just keep coming into my head. I can't prevent it. [I] believe that there is a conspiracy among military leaders to take over the world, and that [I] am in charge of the takeover. [I] secretly feel that I am the left foot of God. And that God is walking on the earth. (qtd. in Nasar 1998, p. 234)Elyn Saks (2007) detailed her experience of psychotic \"disorientation\" as follows:Consciousness gradually loses its coherence. The \"me\" becomes a haze. . reality breaks up like a bad radio signal. There is no longer a sturdy vantage point from which to look out, take things in, assess what's happening. No core lens through which to see the world, to make judgments and comprehend risk. Random moments of time follow one another. Sights, sounds, thoughts, and feelings don't go together. No organizing principle takes successive moments in time and puts them together in a coherent way from which sense can be made. And it's all taking place in slow motion. (p. 89)The clinical manifestations of psychosis are illustrated in these two examples, with evidence of hallucinations, delusions, thought disorder, and disorganization. Psychosis is a disturbance of cognition, not a global loss of cognitive capacity as seen within dementing illnesses. Indeed, psychosis is a \"gain-of-function\" symptom, with increased associational productions, bizarre perceptual experiences, thoughts, and established memories with psychotic content. This is in contrast to the dementias, which are \"loss-of-function\" cognitive disorders, in which memory is reduced and thought processes are altered and frequently diminished. Because psychotic experiences appear entirely real to the person suffering them, it is easy for the individual to act on the psychotic perceptions (i.e., command hallucinations) or the delusional thinking, which can result in bizarre, illogical, or even dangerous behavior. Psychosis is a broadly expressed symptom set across many diagnoses and can be called an intermediate phenotype or a symptom complex that may have a unique and independent brain network and biology and its own genetic associations. One could argue that the intermediate phenotype of psychosis is a symptom dimension representing a final common pathway of cerebral dysfunction (we would argue that psychosis is secondary to a disorder of learning and memory mechanisms) even though it is generated by diverse etiologies. It is possible to conceive that this symptom set has its own unique and distinctive anatomy, pathophysiology, and molecular targets, as well as treatments, although this has yet to be demonstrated. The Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) system from the National Institute of Mental Health is a leading example of this reorientation. In the RDoC framework, dimensions of normal cognition and affect are the unifying, homogenous units that decompose to generate psychopathology.",

Prevalence rates for the assorted conditions vary considerably but the most reliable estimates are greater than 50% for strokes involving the somatosensory system, brachial plexus avulsions, spinal cord injury, and limb amputation, with controversy surrounding the mechanistic contributions of deafferentation to ensuing neuropathic pain syndromes. Deafferentation pain has also been described for loss of other body parts (e.g., eyes and breasts) and may contribute to between 10% and upwards of 30% of neuropathic symptoms in peripheral neuropathies. There is no pathognomonic test or sign to identify deafferentation pain, and part of the controversy surrounding it stems from the prodigious challenges in differentiating cause and effect. For example, it is unknown whether cortical reorganization causes pain or is a byproduct of pathoanatomical changes accompanying injury, including pain. Similarly, ascertaining whether deafferentation contributes to neuropathic pain, or whether concomitant injury to nerve fibers transmitting pain and touch sensation leads to a deafferentation-like phenotype can be clinically difficult, although a detailed neurologic examination, functional imaging, and psychophysical tests may provide clues. Due in part to the concurrent morbidities, the physical, psychologic, and by extension socioeconomic costs of disorders associated with deafferentation are higher than for other chronic pain conditions. Treatment is symptom-based, with evidence supporting first-line antineuropathic medications such as gabapentinoids and antidepressants. Studies examining noninvasive neuromodulation and virtual reality have yielded mixed results.",

The symptom of fatigue is a poorly defined feeling, and careful inquiry is needed to clarify complaints of “fatigue,” “tiredness,” or “exhaustion” and to distinguish lack of energy from loss of motivation or sleepiness, which may be pointers to specific diagnoses (see below). \r\n\r\nPrevalence—Like blood pressure, subjective fatigue is normally distributed in the population. The prevalence of clinically significant fatigue depends on the threshold chosen for severity (usually defined in terms of associated disability) and persistence. Surveys report that 5-20% of the general population suffer from such persistent and troublesome fatigue. Fatigue is twice as common in women as in men but is not strongly associated with age or occupation. It is one of the commonest presenting symptoms in primary care, being the main complaint of 5-10% of patients and an important subsidiary symptom in a further 5-10%.\r\n\r\nFatigue as a symptom—Patients generally regard fatigue as important (because it is disabling), whereas doctors do not (because it is diagnostically non-specific). This discrepancy is a potent source of potential difficulty in the doctor-patient relationship. Fatigue may present in association with established medical and psychiatric conditions or be idiopathic. Irrespective of cause, it has a major impact on day to day functioning and quality of life. Without treatment, the prognosis of patients with idiopathic fatigue is surprisingly poor; half those seen in general practice with fatigue are still fatigued six months later.",

      "abstract": "Research in the neurosciences has demonstrated that the boundary between the external world (its events, pressures, concerns and stress) and the brain and body has been broken. The concept of anything being all in the mind is scientifically and intellectually dead. While some data remain ambiguous and direct causal effect cannot be given to stress per se, the overall patterns of research findings demonstrate that stress is a contributing factor to many illnesses, including somatic and psychological symptoms. Therefore, very real consequences attend those who experience prolonged subacute chronic stress, which characterized in the Gulf deployment, combat, and return home. It is feasible that the effects of these stresses made some soldiers more vulnerable to environmental pathogens, both in the theater and at home, than they would otherwise have been. The symptoms of such insults, nested in sociocultural beliefs about illness and the Gulf, might well have amplified deleterious somatic consequences. Like many illnesses, those pertaining to service in the Gulf have been culturally shaped. An illness narrative describes the causes of the illness as perceived by the patient and is most often constructed out of the assertions, metaphors, folklore, causal attributions, and adduced causes common in the patient's culture. Other agents of a presumed authorities, the Internet, and support and self-help groups. Such illness narratives can become an important factor in shaping both the nature and interpretation of symptoms by the patient. A cogent, widespread, and widely shared illness narrative is certainly a characteristic development of Gulf War illness. The threads of combat and deployment stress and the side spectrum of possible responses, as demonstrated throughout history, weaves into the matrix of possible illness causation. It is also possible that a subset of the population is (in some ways, not yet understood) vulnerable and predisposed to injurious responses to the multiple stressors experienced in deployment and combat. This book argues that, to be most helpful to veterans, we must deal with this issue of complexity and not simply focus on a hypothecated or hoped for singular cause of Gulf War illness.",

Las vias del dolor transmiten la informacion nociceptiva a traves del sistema nervioso periferico y central y estan plenamente integradas con el sistema motor y simpatico a nivel medular y de los centros nerviosos superiores y dan lugar a actividad motora refleja, hiperactividad simpatica y respuestas afectivas y conductuales. Objetivo : Definir los mecanismos fisiopatologicos que se desencadenan en presencia de dolor agudo y las alteraciones que consecuentemente generan en diferentes organos y sistemas. Desarrollo : Las respuestas generadas a nivel segmentario, suprasegmentario y cortical dan lugar a alteraciones fisiopatologicas en el sistema cardiovascular, respiratorio y en otros organos y sistemas. Estas alteraciones pueden modificar negativamente el curso de la lesion o enfermedad que origino el dolor y provocar graves trastornos hemodinamicos que pueden llevar a la muerte del paciente. Conclusiones : Aunque el dolor agudo tiene una funcion biologica protectora, cuando es persistente o no mitigado provoca alteraciones fisiopatologicas en los diferentes organos y sistemas que son nocivas para el paciente. Pese al rapido progreso alcanzado en el conocimiento de su fisiopatologia y el desarrollo de novedosas y efectivas tecnicas para su tratamiento, la conducta terapeutica del paciente con dolor agudo es inadecuada.",

De igual modo, tambien se ha relacionado esta sintomatologia con sindromes que necesariamente no conllevan un intento de suicidio como son el uso y abuso de sustancias, el autismo o la esquizofrenia. En este sentido, estas conductas autolesivas han sido planteadas como con causa de necesidad afectiva o llamada de atencion. El presente trabajo valida una herramienta para el diagnostico y posterior tratamiento de estas autolesiones sin intencion suicida. Los datos arrojan que existen dos subdimensiones de la autolesion: Autolesion por encima de la piel y Autolesion por debajo de la piel. Existen igualmente diferencias de genero entre hombres y mujeres tanto en el tipo de autolesion como en el nivel de la misma. EnglishSelf - injury behaviors have been related to different syndromes of anxiety, depression, attempted suicide and consummate suicide, bullying, and physical and/or sexual abuse. Similarly, this symptomatology has also been linked to syndromes that do not necessarily lead to an attempted suicide such as substance use and abuse, autism or schizophrenia. In this sense, these self - injury behaviors have been related to affective or attention need. The present study validates a questionnaire for the diagnosis, and subsequent treatment, of these self - injuries without suicidal intent. The results show that there are two sub - dimensions of self - injury: Self - injury above the skin and Self - injury below the skin. There are also gender differences between men and women in both the type of self - harm and in the level of it.",

      "abstract": "The physician, like any other human being, is subject to emotional problems, greed, jealousy, and instability of an individual under stress as well as mental disease which may all bring out improper behavior or criminal activity. Over the last two centuries, there have been instances where physicians have committed deliberate acts of murder on wives, relatives, patients, and others. Their motivation has ranged from ridding themselves of a nagging wife or for insurance and inheritance gains to insane acts. The methods used have usually been associated with poisons and drugs, of which the physician may have great familiarity. The frequency of physician-involved murders seems to have increased in the past two decades with several sensational cases being the topics of media coverage and further review in books and visual media, including television and the movies. The investigation of these cases may be very difficult, especially when a drug may be given to a victim which could cause severe problems after small amounts are given. The detection of death as being a murder may be the first problem faced, the demonstration of the fatal agent in the body in the next problem, and probably the most difficult is finding a suspect with the medication in his or her possession or paraphenalia for injecting such as a syringe and needle. The stealth and cunning of the murderer may further complicate the picture for the investigator as well as the reputation of the physician in the community, which is often above reproach so that the public has to be convinced of the actual involvement of the suspect.",

The term, “sui generis,” emphasizes this. Addiction involves an intense focus on using, with a motivational salience to use frequently, and to engage in associated behavior, cognition, and conation -- to the point that it takes over the user’s life, superceding common sense, reasonable judgment, and acceptable behavior. Addiction is usually accompanied by physical dependence, but is not the same thing: that is, using to avoid withdrawal is not the same as using to gratify addictive craving. But physical dependence or other motivations may appear as “pseudo-addiction.” Addictive craving is not a psychological derivative of other motivations (though an addict will say otherwise). In its pathogenesis, occasional alcohol or drug use becomes routine. Then, regular use becomes a turning point for many, toward addiction.",

      "abstract": "The prediction of suicidal intent remains a clinical problem. This presentation illustrates that a distinction may be made between the manifest dream reports of patients who are potentially or acutely suicidal and those who are not. A review of the literature reveals that the manifest dream reports of clinically depressed, non-suicidal individuals differ from those who are depressed and acutely suicidal. The former contain themes of loss, disappointment, rejection, helplessness, hopelessness, failure, and death. The latter contain themes of dying, death, destruction, and violence directed toward the dreamer or others, as well as hopelessness and helplessness. The author collected manifest dream reports from three clinically depressed, non-suicidal patients and three clinically depressed, potentially or acutely suicidal patients. There are apparent differences between the themes of manifest dream reports in the clinically depressed, non-suicidal patients and the clinically depressed, potentially or acutely suicidal patients. The former contain themes of death, loss, rejection, vulnerability, hopelessness, and helplessness. The latter contain themes of active harm or violence (specifically toward the dreamer), dying or being dead, aloneness, vulnerability, hopelessness, and helplessness. Clinical cases and corresponding manifest dream reports are presented. Although this is a preliminary study, it is possible that manifest dream content may be used as one of the predictors of suicidality, in conjunction with latent dream content, diagnosis, life circumstance, and clinical status.",

Depression in three groups of medically ill, disabled patients (Parkinson's disease, right hemisphere stroke, and amputation) was studied. Mean depression severity and frequency of depression were equal for all groups. Severity of neurologic symptomatology was not consistently related to depression. Type of prosthesis, but not amputation type, was related to depression for amputees. Patterns of depression on discriminant analysis did differentiate the groups. A depression symptom conglomerate suggesting guilt and body image change with fatigue characterized the Parkinson patients most and the amputees least. A second depression conglomerate suggesting indecisiveness and thoughts of death or self-harm characterized amputees most and stroke patients least. Depression as an emotional response may not be a singular, specific feature of disabling illness in general, given uniformity of prevalence and severity, but differential etiology in specific instances should be considered.",

Estas se definen como un grupo de padecimientos de origen en muchos casos desconocido y que tienen como atributo común el curso progresivo de los síntomas derivados del daño estructural y funcional de diferentes zonas del sistema nervioso. La Demencia o Trastorno Cognitivo, ocurre cuando el cerebro se afecta por una enfermedad o afección específica que causa deterioro cognitivo. La secuencia en el espectro de la demencia puede terminar en la forma más grave de la enfermedad. El deterioro cognitivo en muchos casos transita desde el leve, referido a una disminución de la función cognitiva mayor de lo esperado por la edad y al nivel de educación del individuo, pero sin interferir con sus actividades cotidianas. El diagnóstico temprano de la enfermedad y la asunción de tratamientos y sobre todo estilos de vida saludables, puede evitar o enlentecer el tránsito hacia la gravedad de la enfermedad y por ende mejorar la calidad de vida. Con el objetivo de contribuir a este propósito se diseñó una herramienta de software denominada Neuromap que permite obtener patrones de conectividad a partir de señales de EEG y realizar una prueba de profundidad de la demencia. De esta forma se enriquecen los instrumentos con que cuentan en la actualidad los especialistas de las ciencias médicas para obtener un mejor y más eficaz diagnóstico.

      "abstract": "We have recently witnessed a growing number of events that can be characterized as traumatic. Due to serious consequences that can be caused by traumatic experience, additional efforts have been made to prevent or reduce trauma-related symptoms. Various therapy models oriented to persons who suffer from traumatic experience are based on the idea of supporting resilience as an individual's ability to positively adapt to stress or adversity. As the body is the dominant media in Dance Movement Therapy (DMT) this kind of therapy can be particularly useful in the area of physical trauma, physical abuse, and body-image disturbances or in conditions where certain physical or sensory limitations inhibit the realization of emotional or social needs. Namely, in various traumas body is often the victim of injuries, ailments and disasters and because of that it can be associated with pain, trauma, hurt, helplessness and fear. In those cases it is logical that body should be involved in the therapeutic process. In this regard, DMT may be appropriate therapeutic approach since it is directed towards body-awareness and body-sense. A considerable number of researches confirmed that DMT may induce different benefits in physiological and psychosocial functioning in persons who suffer from traumatic experience, but also additional researches need to be done aimed to promote DMT as an evidence-based practice and more widely used in wider concept of trauma rehabilitation.",

      "title": "The origin and relief of common pain",
      "abstract": "Where pain of the musculoskeletal system is present, commonly, this pain is without objective evidence of disease, trauma, or disorder. Absence of an apparent cause for common pain prompts the consideration of mechanical stress as a contributing factor. The principal stress of the musculoskeletal system is postural. By posture it is usually meant the distribution of body mass with respect to gravity. Past efforts to predict chronic pain by postural analysis or to reduce such pain by strengthening, conscious control or splinting of posture has had marginal success. Past failure to relate posture to pain is attributable to (1) ubiquity of sub-optimal posture that precludes clinical comparison to those with optimal posture; (2) presupposition that the causal relation between posture and pain is of the observational class of causality rather than the manipulable kind; (3) a definition of posture that is too narrow to complete the picture; and (4) inadequate methods for reduction of postural asymmetry to an extent that is sufficient to elicit a significant and enduring effect on sub-optimal posture and related pain. Posture can be defined more broadly as the stance of the body performing within the boundaries of posture and which is mediated by the Postural Control System towards greatest stability (Fx. 1). The stance of the body is the arrangement of the body with respect to gravity and other accelerative forces. The postural boundaries are the set of forces that resist acceleration and thereby provide the limits within which one functions stably, and this resistance is currently approximated by six principal sources of resistance to acceleration: viscous, elastic, neuromuscular, rigid, viscoelastic, and inertial. The Postural Control System is located in the brainstem and modulates body stance to more economically and stably effect and resist acceleration. The rigid boundaries can be so with respect to compressive, tractive, or tensile qualities that permits three kinds of motion: translation, rotation and oscillation. An example of postural boundaries that are rigid with respect to compression and tensile character are the bones that bear weight. In contrast, ligaments provide a tractive rigidity and musculotendons a relatively elastic boundary. Joint surfaces are considered boundaries that are rigid but not perfectly so. Of fundamental importance are those joints that arc lowermost in a column of the musculoskeletal system namely: (1) the feet and ankles that support the entirety of the musculoskeletal system and; (2) the base of the sacrum that supports the vertebral spine. This broadened definition of posture leads to a greatly enhanced manipulability of posture in the upright stance and alleviation of more than two-thirds of common pain by the coherent combination of (1) manual manipulation to reduce somatic dysfunction; (2) foot orthotics to optimize the amplitude of the arches of the feet and vertically align the ankle; (3) a heel lift to level the sacral base; (4) and a group of therapeutic postures configured to minimize restriction of peripheral soft tissue reflective of the earlier posture, all aimed to optimize posture. Mediated by the postural control system, manipulation of postural boundaries accordingly modifies the structure and function of the entire musculoskeletal system. Typically, this relief is maintained by foot orthotic and heel lift alone without maintenance by manual manipulation, medication, or exercise.",

      "title": "[\"Ear rage\": misophonia : Review and current state of knowledge].",
      "abstract": "Misophonia is a devastating disorder. It is known as an affective sound-processing disorder characterized by the experience of strong negative emotions (e.g., anger, distress) in response to human sounds such as eating/swallowing/breathing. Other sounds produced by humans but not directly by human bodies can also be misophonic triggers (e.g. pen clicking) or environmental sounds (animal sounds/sounds of machines). The type of aversive triggers is individual. The reaction to trigger sounds can depend on many factors, such as assessment of the sound, personal experience, social context or psychological profile. However, there is currently no consensus in defining misophonia. Misophonia is also not yet classified by any official diagnostic system, although it seems to be a separate disorder. There are also associations with other disorders such as activity disorders, tinnitus, hyperacusis, and autism spectrum disorders. In 2013, the first definition criteria were published for the diagnosis of misophonia. Specifically, fMRI showed abnormal activation of the anterior insular cortex (AIC) and other brain areas responsible for the processing and regulation of emotions. To date, no randomized controlled trials evaluating treatments have been published. The use of cognitive and behavioral interventions have been reported as well as external sound systems and sound masking systems as known in the tinnitus retraining therapy. Sufferers try to minimize the trigger sounds by wearing ear plugs or music headphones. Otolaryngologists may also encounter patients with symptoms of misophonia, e.g., when hearing screening is requested or advice should be given on different therapeutic options. This report provides an overview of the current state of knowledge in misophonia and its diagnosis and treatment.Die Misophonie ist eine Intoleranz auf bestimmte Alltagsgeräusche. Hierbei fungieren als „Trigger“ „menschliche Körpergeräusche“, z. B. Schlucken/Schmatzen/Atemgeräusche oder Geräusche, die von Menschen, aber nicht vom menschlichen Körper erzeugt werden (z. B. Klicken Kugelschreiberknopf), ferner Tier‑/Maschinengeräusche. Die Betroffenen verspüren sofort eine negativ-emotionale Reaktion wie Wut, Aggression, Ekel u.a. Objektivierbare Veränderungen sind Herzfrequenzerhöhung und Blutdruckveränderungen. Die emotionale Reaktion ist individuell und hängt z.

Die Misophonie ist bisher als Krankheit nicht definiert und keinem offiziellen Diagnosesystem zugeordnet, sie scheint eine eigenständige Störung zu sein: Assoziationen bestehen u. a. mit Aufmerksamkeits‑/Zwangsstörungen, Tinnitus, Hyperakusis, Autismus-Spektrum-Krankheiten. Definitionskriterien wurden 2013 veröffentlicht; verschiedene, validierte Fragebögen wurden bisher zur Misophonieausprägung entwickelt. Studien mit funktionellen MRT-Untersuchungen des Kopfes zeigten eine übermäßige Aktivierung des anterioren Inselkortex (AIC) und seiner benachbarten Regionen, die für Emotionsverarbeitung/-regulation verantwortlich sind. Bisher gibt es keine randomisierten kontrollierten Studien zur Therapie. Einzelne Publikationen beschreiben kognitive Verhaltensinterventionen, Retrainingtherapien und Schallmaskierungssysteme. Zur Triggerreduktion werden Ohrstöpsel/Musikkopfhörer verwendet. Auch HNO-Ärzte können mit Misophoniepatienten konfrontiert werden, z.

Treatment effects may be confounded by the natural course of the disease, or they may be misjudged by bias and can not be compared with the results of treatments in other hospitals or with previous results. Pathophysiological knowledge does not always lead to the right or the most practical treatment, neither the results of in vitro or animal experiments, nor the experience with related disorders. The randomized clinical trial is the right method to investigate treatment effects, but is not faultless and explanatory experiments ought to be distinguished from pragmatic studies.",

      "title": "Psychiatric Approach of Fibromyalgia",
      "abstract": "Fibromyalgia is a disease that occurs frequently. However, people do not know much about this disease and many doctors find it difficult to diagnose such patients. Symptoms of fibromyalgia may not only include pain, but also sleep disorder, fatigue, melancholia, and other mood disorders. Pain is one of the major symptoms of many diseases and may greatly impede the quality and functionof an individual's life. Yet many clinicians have trouble treating chronic pain in part because they focus on the pain itself, which is merely one of the causes, and not on the evaluation and treatment of problems incidental to pain. It is noted that pain may be accompanied by not only physical suffering, but also emotional problems, such as melancholia and other secondary problems. The causes for fibromyalgia syndrome have not yet been clearly revealed but it is known that mental factors contribute to the occurrence and progress of the symptoms, and that the evaluation of or therapeutic interventions for the mental causes may be due to physical effects. Therefore, based on ad-equate psychiatric knowledge, clinicians should under-stand and treat the patients accordingly. It may be that more effective medical services are needed through in-tensive treatments in multidisciplinary teams for the patients. This article is aimed at investigating the psychological issues that fibromyalgia patients encounter. It also considers the psychiatric drugs and psychosocial treatment that are applied to the disease.",

It is heterogeneous in aetiology, diverse in pathology, and varied in severity. Managing a case of perpipheral neuropathy brings along numerous challenges include identifying a case of peripheral neurophy and differentiating it from mimicks, working up for etiology and treatment based on aetiology. Patients can present with either positive or negative symptoms (or both) linked to motor and sensory systems or with autonomic disturbances in some neuropathies. A detailed history and physical examination provides information regarding onset, course and progression of the disease and the type of involvement like generalized, distal or proximal, symmetric or asymmetric, also the type of bre involvement like large myelinated or small unmyelinated and may give clues to neuro anatomic localization of the disease. The diagnosis can be conrmed through a appropriate investigation for the neuropathic pattern like blood tests, Cerebrospinal uid (CSF) analysis, MRI Brain, Ultrasound (USg). These test along with Electro diagnostic investigations like Nerve Conduction Studies (NCS), needle electromyography (EMG) can narrow down differentials and possible aetiologies, However in signicant cases etiology remain undiagnosed. Genetic testing is most diagnostic in carefully selected cases. Sometimes nerve biopsy and skin biopsy may be needed to conrm the etiologies.",

The group of cases here presented have a physiology or, at any rate, a physiologic psychology which, once understood, opens the doors to a rapid cure. But unless their mechanism of disability is understood the patients may be markedly incapacitated and wander from physician to physician vainly seeking help.

Neuropathic pain is characterized by lesions or dysfunction of the systems that under normal conditions, transmit noxious information to the central nervous system.

Objectives To describe and discuss two clinical cases of DI, in order to show two different ways of presenting in this entity. Methods Two case report and non-systematic review. Results We present the case of a 76-year-old woman, without psychiatric history, with an DI with 5 years of evolution, referred to a psychiatric consultation by a dermatologist. The second case, is a 41-year-old woman with a history of multiple substance use disorder, with an DI with a month of evolution, who resorted to the emergency department. DI is not a single diagnostic entity. The classic form, as represented in the first case,is a primary form, which develops without any known cause or underlying disease, corresponding to a persistent delusional disorder. However, about 60% of patients have secondary forms of DI, in the context of substance misuse, some medications or in the course of physical or psychiatric diseases (e.g. stroke, delirium, dementia, depression, schizophrenia). Conclusions DI can occur as a primary delusional disorder or secondary to several other medical conditions. An in-depth clinical history is essential in order to make the correct diagnosis. A multidisciplinary approach is also important, to exclude any possible organic etiology, not forgetting that many patients may turn to other medical specialities first.

      "title": "[Psychomotor epilepsy: phenomenology, localization, pathogenesis and therapy].",
      "abstract": "Next to tonic-clonic seizures psychomotor (complex focal) seizures are the most common form of all epileptic seizures, except in infancy where they are seen rarely. Differently from generalised non convulsive seizures (like petit mal absences), their first appearance has no typical age limit, however, their proportion to other forms of seizures increases in adolescence and adults especially between the third and fifth decade of life. The main symptom is the disorder of consciousness which lasts at least more than half a minute, normally several minutes in completely distinct seizures, which doesn't begin abruptly and which often ends ill defined. This twilight attack is proceeded by an aura of sensory, psychic or vegetative character. The aura is followed either by a transitory state of immobility and later by motor phenomena or at once by motor phenomena in the form of diverse automatisms of variable intensity, reaching from mild movements in the oral region over verbal expressions to highly dramatic scenes, often accompanied by vegetative symptoms. Tonic versive and tonic symmetrical or tonic asymmetrical seizure symptoms are quite often motor variants which also can lead to sudden drops. Psychomotor attacks can be reduced to \"pseudo-absences\", however, they also can develop into tonic-clonic seizures (Grand mal). Generally, the succession of seizure symptoms is constant in the same patient, the expression can differ from seizure to seizure. Psychomotor attacks can be spread over the whole day or can show a strict connection to sleep, in the course they can likely occur in clusters and can accumulate to a continuous or discontinuous form of psychomotor status epilepticus. Predominantly, but not exclusively psychomotor attacks start from the temporal lobe, whereas neocortical temporal attacks (especially of lateral posterior origin) can be distinguished from those coming from the limbic system, especially from hippocampal or mesio-basal temporal structures and from the nucleus amygdalae. About 20% of the psychomotor attacks are of frontal origin coming from the mesial frontal region or from the gyrus cinguli anterior. Also seizures of occipital or parietal origin can spread so quickly that the seizure itself is impressing as a \"temporal lobe attack\". On account of that, epilepsies with psychomotor attacks cannot be compared to temporal lobe epilepsies. The etiology of psychomotor epilepsies is closely connected to the topographic site of the temporal lobe, who is especially vulnerable for traumatic lesions, cerebral edema and hypoxemia. Also small dysgeneses, heterotopies or small abnormalities of vessels are relatively often found in surgical specimens.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

      "abstract": "The concept of hysteria or conversion disorder, firmly anchored in psychoanalytic theory, postulates the emergence of physical symptoms as an unconscious attempt to resolve a painful psychic conflict. The advantages accruing from the adoption of the sick role contribute to perpetuate the disability. Two major problems with this concept have detracted from its clinical value. The first is the difficulty in establishing the occurrence, relevance and timing of a \\`sufficient' psychological stressor. The second is to distinguish \\`unconscious' motivation from feigning. Faced with these difficulties and threatened by the fear of missing treatable neurological conditions, clinicians have opted for a diagnosis by exclusion, invoking conversion disorder only after detailed investigations have failed to find an alternative explanation for the symptoms. The advent of telemetry and non-invasive imaging and the better characterization of some neurological disorders (e.g. the dystonias) have made it possible to diagnose as neurological hitherto `unexplained' symptoms. Future advances will, no doubt, help to explain others, but there is strong evidence to suggest that for a core of symptoms the diagnosis of hysteria or conversion disorder will remain valid. The strongest evidence comes from follow-up studies of carefully investigated patients (Binzer and Kullgren, 1998; Crimlisk et al ., 1998) for whom conversion disorder is a stable diagnosis and not the harbinger of unsuspected neurological disease. …",

Such damage may occur in utero, intrapartum, or postnatally, and may be seen in isolation or accompanied by injury to other neuroanatomic locations (i.e., global hypoxic-ischemic damage, clinically corresponding to hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy [HIE; Chapters 32–33]; or a more modest degree of injury as seen in preterm infants with white matter damage, termed encephalopathy of prematurity [Chapters 34]). Acquired lesions of the brainstem may have features overlapping with specific maldevelopmental syndromes such as Moebius syndrome and Carey-Fineman-Ziter syndrome, recently recognized to occur sporadically or with familial incidence and to have underlying genetic bases (discussed later) [1, 2].",

      "abstract": "There is growing awareness of the mental health impact of all types of mass violence. The exposure of large population groups, mostly having no mental health problems prior to the exposure, and the subsequent development, in a significant proportion of the population, of a variety of psychiatric symptoms and disorders represent both a challenge and an opportunity for psychiatrists. There is sufficient evidence from the variety of mass violence/conflict situations, that a significant proportion of the exposed population develop different mental disorders. There are vulnerable groups like women, children, widows, orphans, elderly, disabled, those exposed to severe pain and loss of body parts. There is also a consistent finding of the dose-response to the amount of trauma and the prevalence of mental disorders. There is growing recognition that there is need to consider a variety of syndromes, in addition to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) like acute stress disorder (ASD), depression, complicated bereavement reactions, substance use disorders, poor physical health, fear, anxiety, physiological arousal, somatisation, anger control, functional disability and arrest or regression of childhood developmental progression. The challenge is to reach all of the ill persons and provide mental health services. The opportunity provided by this field is to develop a better understanding of issues of resilience, recovery and effectiveness of public health approaches to mental health care.",

Reports from clinics and emergency rooms are pointing to the increase in incidence. However, there are very few studies from India. Many of the people presenting with acts of self-harm do not have suicidal intent, and this has prompted the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5)[1] to propose a category of Nonsuicidal Self-Injury (NSSI) as a “Condition for Further Study” to encourage further research in this area. DSM-5 Proposed Criteria for NSSI requires an individual to engage in intentional self-inflicted damage to the surface of his/her body, on 5 or more days in the last 1 year, with the expectation that the injury will lead to only mild or moderate physical harm. NSSI is defined as ‘intentional destruction of one’s body tissue without suicidal intent’.",

In Vlaeyen’s model of fear avoidance, he proposes that in a first step negative affectivity and threatening illness information could trigger the development of pain catastrophizing thoughts and subsequently result in pain-related fear and avoidance, hypervigilance, physical disuse leading to deconditioning and physiological deterioration, depression, and disability. In turn all these consequences could again have an impact on the patient’s pain experiences [1].",

      "abstract": "A hypothesis raised in the first edition of this book, that psychotic symptoms often originate in traumatic experiences and relate to dissociation, is updated and expanded in this chapter. Evidence now demonstrates that traumatic experiences clearly may be linked to psychotic symptoms, and dissociation predicts not only voice hearing, but other forms of hallucinations and delusions as well. Strongly linked to dissociation are the so-called first-rank symptoms of schizophrenia, particularly passivity experiences such as believing that one’s thoughts, feelings, or actions are not under one’s own control. Traumatic, dissociation and, to a lesser extent, attachment-based explanations for psychotic symptoms are proposed. It is argued that psychotic symptoms are substantially overemphasized in the diagnostic criteria for schizophrenia, leading to a high likelihood of misdiagnosing dissociative disorders as schizophrenia, with the accompanying risks of stigma and inappropriate forms of treatment. This is particularly concerning as there is anecdotal evidence that antipsychotic medications are even less effective and more dangerous for dissociative disorders than for psychotic disorders, while trauma and dissociation-based treatments have demonstrated efficacy for psychotic symptoms. Thus, the traumatic and dissociative nature of some, if not most, psychotic symptoms should, for theoretical, clinical and ethical reasons, finally be acknowledged.",

      "title": "Epilepsy after Traumatic Brain Injury",
      "abstract": "An epileptic seizure is a “transient occurrence of signs and/or symptoms due to abnormal excessive or synchronous neuronal activity in the brain.” Epilepsy is a disorder of the brain characterized by an enduring predisposition to generate epileptic seizures and by the neurobiological, cognitive, psychological, and social consequences of this condition. The widely accepted operational definition of epilepsy requires that an individual have at least two unprovoked seizures on separate days, generally 24 hours apart. An unprovoked seizure refers to a seizure that occurs in the absence of an acute brain insult or systemic disorder. This nosology is based on the observation that while a single unprovoked seizure is often an isolated event that does not recur during an individual’s lifetime, two unprovoked seizures rarely occur in isolation and are associated with high risk of the individual experiencing more seizures. In some cases, such as when the seizure occurs in the setting of a potentially epileptogenic brain insult such as an episode of encephalitis or a traumatic brain injury (TBI), it is possible to recognize the specific form of epilepsy at its earliest presentation. In such cases, the diagnosis of epilepsy can be made after the very first unprovoked seizure. Based on its definition, epilepsy is not a single disorder but rather a syndrome or syndromes. Different forms of epilepsy syndrome(s) have different causes, different manifestations, different implications for short- and longterm management and treatment, and different outcomes.",

The actual burden of mental disorders in older adults is probably underestimated because the stigma associated with mental disorders results in under-reporting of symptoms by older adults, under-diagnosis by healthcare providers, clinical significance of sub-threshold symptoms, and underrepresentation in epidemiological studies of high-risk older adults. Common mental health problems often present atypically in older individuals; and loss of physical abilities, financial resources, and family and friends can challenge even the most resilient amongst older people. As part of comprehensive diagnostic workup, neuroimaging such as non-contrast computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging scans are recommended for all older adults with significant cognitive deficits, new-onset mood or psychotic symptoms accompanied by subtle neurological symptoms, or general physical symptoms.",

      "title": "Clinical practice guidelines for the management of conduct disorder",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION Conduct disorder (CD) and associated antisocial behavior is one of the most common mental and behavioral problems in children and young people. In the United States, CDs associated behaviors are primary presenting complains in children and adolescent. CD are characterized by a repetitive and persistent pattern of dissocial, aggressive, or defiant conduct (ICD-10). Associated behaviors are outside the socially accepted norms that results into persistent and significant violations of age appropriate social expectations. CD is classified along with the diagnosis of oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) in the spectrum of disruptive behavior disorders. ODD can be seen as precursor to the development of CD. Behaviors include stealing and lying, excessive physical and verbal aggression, rule breaking and violence. Persistence of these behaviors into adulthood leads to antisocial personality disorder (ASPD). As these behaviors are present in some children during the course of development, it is essential for the clinician to differentiate between normalcy and pathological behavior. Remote antisocial or illicit acts are not enough to support a diagnosis of CD. CD must be differentiated from other term like delinquency. CD is a mental and behavioral disorder while delinquency is a legal term. It is comorbid with many other psychiatric conditions, including attention deficit hyperactive disorder (ADHD), depression, substance use disorders, etc. CD in early life has been found to be strongly associated with significant decline in educational performance. They are more likely to remain socially isolated with increase in substance misuse during adolescence. There is increase involvement in criminal acts resulting in frequent contact with the criminal justice system. This adverse effect continues even in adult life with resulting poorer educational and occupational outcomes. There are limited data available about the prevalence of CD across the world. Using the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders-III (DSM-III) and DSM-III-R diagnostic guidelines, the prevalence of CD in the United States was found to be 6%–16% in males and from 2% to 9% in females. With a clinical interview as a method of detection, the prevalence of CD in the general population is found to be between 1.5% and 4%. Boys are likely to have these conditions two times more than girls. Those with early-onset exhibit lower IQ compared to children with later age of onset. They have more attention deficits and impulsivity problems. It is comorbid with many other psychiatric conditions including ADHD, depression, substance use disorders, etc., Children with CD also find difficulty in interacting and integrating with peer group and are more likely to had adverse family circumstances. Increased risk factors include poor prenatal care and poor infant nutrition, poverty, physical abuse, and more crime in the neighborhood society. Families of children and adolescent with CD are more likely to exhibit parents with low income, substance abuse, depression, somatization, and ASPD. CD in early life has been found to be strongly associated with significant decline in educational performance. They are more likely to remain socially isolated with increase in substance misuse during adolescence. There is increase involvement into criminal acts resulting into frequent contact with the criminal justice system. This adverse effect continues even in adult life with resulting poorer educational and occupational outcomes. Large numbers of etiological factors for CD have been highlighted in various studies. With the increase in risk factors possibility of developing CD increases. Genetic liability along with various environmental factors acts together for the manifestation of behavioral symptoms of CD. Magnetic resonance imaging has been used to compare structural brain differences between children with CD and normal controls and have documented smaller brain structures and lower brain activity in children with CD. Abnormalities are primarily detected in the bilateral amygdala, right striatum, bilateral insula and left medial/superior frontal gyrus as well as the left precuneus in individuals having ODD/CD. Higher plasma levels of serotonin in blood are positively associated with aggressive behavior in children. Impulsiveness and aggression along with violent behavior have been found to be associated with alteration in the activity of certain brain structures. Areas mainly associated and affected are limbic structures and the anterior cingulate and orbitofrontal areas of the prefrontal cortex. Parental psychopathology along with harsh parenting is associated with CD in their children. The presence of antisocial behavior in children has been found to be associated with parental reinforcement, their responsiveness to the child and punishment given by them. Frequent marital conflicts between parents and interparental violence predict adolescent antisocial behavior. Children with CD have been found disproportionately coming from low-income family and with unemployed parents. Inadequate housing, poverty, and crowding exerts negative influence on the development of the child. Exposure to and prevalence of substance use in the community have also been found significantly associated with the development of CD. Availability of drugs and increased crime in the neighborhood increases the risk of children developing CD. Peer relation also significantly affects the development and maintenance of these behaviors. ASSESSMENT Clinical features of CD develop gradually over a period of time. This evolves to stage where consistent enduring pattern develops which involves violation of basic rights of others. Behavior develops in continuum where ODD forms least severe clinical presentation to ASPD as most severe. As these behaviors are present in some children during development, it is essential for the clinician to differentiate between normalcy and pathological behavior. Remote antisocial or illicit acts are not enough to support a diagnosis of CD. CD must be differentiated from other term like delinquency. CD is a mental and behavioral disorder while delinquency is a legal term. Symptoms develop earlier in boys than girls. The usual age of presentation is 10–12 years in boys, whereas it is 14–16 in case of girls. Individual having CD shows behavioral manifestations in the following four categories as per DSM-5: Aggression to people and animals, destruction of property, deceitfulness or theft and serious violations of rules. Aggression to people and animals includes behaviors such as threatening, frequent physical fights, using weapon that can cause damage to others or showing physical cruelty to people or animals. Setting fire or deliberately destroying others property are included in the destruction of property. Deceitfulness or theft involves setealing or breaking into others house, building. Individual often shows disobedient to parental prohibitions or truancy from school. All this should begin before the age 13 years. DSM-5 requires the persistent presence of three behaviors over period of 12 months with atleast one of them present in the last 6 months. The disturbance in behaviour causes significant impairment in social, academic or occupational functioning. When at least 1 symptom appear before the age 10 then it is specified as childhood-onset while no symptoms before 10 years for CD are classified as adolescent-onset type CD. DSM-5 has introduced a new specifier– \"with limited prosocial emotion.\" Individual must show at least two of the following interpersonal and emotional pattern: (1) Lack of empathy, (2) Lack of guilt or remorse, (3) Unconcerned about performance, (4) Shallow of deficient affect. Depending on the severity of behaviors CD is classified into mild, moderate, or severe type. As per ICD-10 for diagnosis of CD child's developmental level should be taken into consideration. For example, the presence of temper tantrum would not classify for CD. Behavioral manifestation should be present for at least 6 months before making a diagnosis of CD. It has classified CD into three types based on setting in which behaviors are manifested: CD confined to the family, unsocialized CD and socialized CD. In CD confined to family, outside the family environment the conduct symptoms are negligible. Hence, there are no significant disturbances in child's social relationships outside the family context. Main differentiating feature between unsocialized and socialized CD is based on integration into a peer group. Children who meet these criteria exhibit aggressive behavior in different forms such as physical aggression, and bullying. In severe cases, it leads to the destruction of property, physical violence. There is frequent use of substance and involvement in promiscuous sexual activity. They have difficulty in having a relationship with family and peers. They have less concern for others feeling and also have low self-esteem. They frequently blame others for their behavior. Severe punishment for such behavior invariably increases their aggression rather than improvement. In the evaluation complete psychiatric assessment along with appropriate history taking should be carried out. Assessment should be carried out in different settings. Additional information may need to be collected from teachers and other family members. Family history reveals frequents fights in parents, disharmony, frequent use of the substance, high rates of psychiatric disorder and harsh parenting. CD is frequently comorbid with various psychiatric disorders [Table 1]. Early identification of commodities helps in making comprehensive management plan from be-gaining. The frequent association of few psychiatric disorders with CD raises question about common underlying psychopathology. The presence of co-morbidity negatively affects clinical picture and outcome. ADHD is the most common childhood-onset psychiatric disorder frequently occurring with CD. When ADHD comorbidity with ODD and CD are combined, the rates of comorbidity increases to 50%–60%. The presence of ADHD increases risk of CD over the course of time and associated with poor outcomes. The association between ADHD and CD is more frequent in boys and it has a prognostic significance. ODD is frequently associated with CD but still debatable whether it is different diagnosis or antecedent of the CD. When child or adolescent fulfill diagnostic criteria for CD then ODD is excluded from diagnosis. Co-morbid association of both increases risk of substance use that presence of either disorder. Substance use disorder has frequent association with CD. Children with CD often indulge into binge alcohol drinking, regular use of tobacco or abuse of illicit psychoactive substances. There is high prevalence of substance abuse and dependence in children with CD. Prevalence of depression and CD increases during puberty. CD has an earlier age of onset as compared to depression. Some of the behavior in depression in childhood can present as aggressive behavior but are also associated with vegetative signs. Boys are affected more with comorbidity in the adolescent period. The presence of both the condition increases the risk of suicide in children.Table 1: Comorbidities with conduct disorderBehavioral disturbances or aggressive behavior can be present in various childhoods' psychiatric disorders such as mood disorder and ADHD. Thus, it becomes essential to differentiate between those having other psychiatric disorder and CD. A clinician should obtain comprehensive history in relation to the onset and progression of symptoms to determine whether this behavior is transient or persistent. Very distant events of antisocial behavior and aggressiveness do not qualify for a diagnosis of CD. ADHD is commonly associated with CD. It is one of the most common among externalizing disorder which has been found overlapping with CD. Primary symptoms of ADHD can be misinterpreted as antisocial which is present in CD. Careful history in both setting will usually reveal ADHD. Symptoms of ADHD also come before the symptoms of CD. ODD is conceptualized as a milder form of CD where rights are not violated. They are at risk of developing CD. The main differentiating feature is in CD there is violation of basic rights of others. Depression in children and adolescent often presents with irritability and oppositional symptoms similar to CD but it is also often characterized by persistent mood changes along with alteration in biological function such as sleep and appetite. The depressed child usually presents with a change in mood rather than disruptive behavior which is presenting complain in CD. The clinician should also rule out disruptive mood dysregulation disorder, intermittent explosive disorder, bipolar disorder. Another differential diagnosis for CD is adjustment reaction. Adjustment reaction is diagnosed when the onset of symptoms occurs soon after exposure to recognizable stressful life events such as trauma or abuse. Symptoms subside within 6 months after termination of stress whereas CD has persistent behavioral manifestations. ASPD has many common features with CD. Many children with CD are likely to develop ASPD over the course of time. It is diagnosed above 18 years of age as per the DSM-5 with the requirement of CD before the age of 15. There is no age criterion as per ICD-10, but it is not mentioned in the childhood disorder section. A specific learning disorder is also common comorbidity with CD. Symptoms of this disorder precede the diagnosis of CD. Confounding factors that need attention are developmental delay and language deficits. It also predisposes individual to CD. Various differential diagnoses of CDs are described in Table 2.Table 2: Differential diagnosisMANAGEMENT Although CD is frequently the presenting symptoms in the child and adolescent mental health setting, its presentation is quite heterogeneous making the process of assessment difficult.First, we need to know the source of referral to the mental health setting whether it is self/parents/school/law enforcement agencies. The treating doctor must build a good rapport with the parents as well as with the child. During the process of assessment direct interviews with the child and parents is done. If the child and/or parents want to speak separately with the therapist, that opportunity should also be given so that they can speak to the therapist frankly. And also it is quite informative to see the child and parents together, sometimes the entire family together to notice their interaction and to assess how they discuss the problem together and present the same to the therapist. The arrangements of how these interviews are to be conducted vary from case to case and the given clinical setting. If required other informants, for example, school teacher's/counselor's report or if referred from other department then discussion with the primary treating team or for the children with the juvenile justice system or child welfare for children living in institutions, information from agency records and/or institutional caretakers is necessary. The multidisciplinary assessment would be desirable which include nursing, education, social work, physical and occupational therapy, and clinical psychology and pediatrics. Multiple interviews can be required, and there can be inconsistencies and contradictions during interviews which is acceptable. The assessment must include a detailed physical examination. In the mental status examination, the disturbances of mood, suicidality, impulsivity and comorbidities must be looked into. The assessment process involves the following aspects: The CD symptoms, which can be a part of other disorders, especially in children and adolescent age group, for example, depression and adjustment disorders The syndromal diagnosis of CD, which should be differentiated from ODD as described in previous section The CD symptoms are overt/covert in nature and the age of onset, for example, childhood/adolescent onset Presence of delinquent behavior Reactive or proactive aggression or relational aggression The nature and severity of current and past offenses/problem behaviors [Table 3]. Table 3: Assessment of current and past offenses/problem behaviorsPresence of callous-unemotional traits, comorbid ADHD, aggressive and nonaggressive antisocial behavior, and age of onset need special attention because callous-unemotional traits are associated with a more severe and persistent form of CD. Similar association has also been found when it is associated with comorbid ADHD and childhood-onset CD. When it is an early childhood-onset CD, it progresses to aggressive, antisocial behavior which is a stable behavioral dimension. When it is adolescent-onset CD, it is associated with nonaggressive antisocial behavior which is associated with impulsivity and has more moderate levels of stability. Aggressive/rule breaking may be stronger predictors of future outcomes than are the age of onset subtypes. As a part of the assessment process, a structured diagnostic schedule can be applied. Following are the schedule currently available for assessment (1) Diagnostic interview schedule for children by age (DISC-IV). (2) Diagnostic interview for children and adolescents (DICA). (3) The schedule for affective disorders and schizophrenia for School-age Children (K-SADS). (4) Child and adolescent psychiatric assessment (CAPA). DISC-IV and DICA are structured interview and do not require trained professionals to be administered while K-SADS and CAPA should be administered by trained professionals. Although in the routine clinical process, scales/instruments are not applied, for teaching and research purpose it is frequently applied. They are overt aggression scale, the aberrant behavior checklist, the Iowa aggression scale and a conduct subscale of the quay revised behavior problem checklist. Global scales such as the clinical global impression (CGI)-severity and CGI-improvement scales can be used by the investigator to monitor the response to a treatment process. The Achenbach's child behavior checklist had an Indian adapted version and known as childhood psychopathology measurement schedule (CPMS). It is a semi-structured interview schedule having 75 symptoms and has a designated section on CD symptoms, and it gives a dimensional score. It is standardized on Indian children with good reliability (0.88–0.98) and validity. With a cut-off score of >10, CPMS has 82% sensitivity and 87% specificity. TREATMENT General principle The cost of using public services in persons with CD was ten times that of those without CD. As there is a scarcity of parameters involved in cost-benefit analysis while calculating the expenditure of intervention in delinquency, there is a bias toward a lower estimation of economic benefits. There is a significant amount of research has been done on the intervention of CD. As there are numerous risk factors involved, to be effective treatment must be multi-modal, involve a family-based and social systems-based approach, address multiple areas, and continue over a longer period. Treatment should start with psychoeducating the patient and his parents/caretakers about the disorder and its potential complications and long-term consequences and outcome. Various psychosocial crises must be dealt with appropriate psychological intervention. The age of onset CD and its intervention is important. The most aggressive youth who are likely to show antisocial behavior in adulthood usually have childhood onset of for these behaviors. Various interventions are available that are effective in treating early emerging conduct problems, but their effectiveness decreases in older children and adolescents. Because of the heterogeneity in presentation, the interventions need to be individualized. Knowledge of the different developmental processes that may be playing a role in the children with CD could help in selecting the most appropriate modality of intervention for an individual child. Children with ODD/CD need special attention because if untreated the outcome over the lifespan is usually adverse for them. Although there has been much advancement in understanding the risk factors for developing the CD and what interventions are effective, in many countries, there are few services available for them. They may be excluded from mental health services unless they have co-morbid conditions, for example, ADHD. Nonpharmacological management Nonpharmacological management has been the mainstay of treatment in managing the CDs. The preventive programs as discussed in the later section should form the most important of the intervention strategies while talking about this issue. In preschool children such programs, for example, Head Start has been tried. They provide parent education about normal development; provide children with stimulation and crisis management to the parents. In the clinical setting, the interventions are targeted toward the temperament of the child, the interpersonal relations in the family, and increasing the parental efficiency in addressing the child's behavioral issues. In the school-aged children, the primary target of intervention is the child, family, and the school. Both parenting skills training and training for the child to improve peer relationships, social competence, academic performance, and compliance with demands from parents/teachers are effective for CD. As in adolescent period the relative importance of peers is increased than that of the family, the interventions should also be targeted toward the peer group. The multi-systemic therapy is imparted in the family environment to the adolescents with conduct problems. It combines intensive case management in the home setting with family interventions, and this has been found to be cost effective. Psychoeducational intervention to inculcate social skills, address conflict resolution and anger control skills to target adolescents and parents are found to be helpful. There are various specific treatment approaches which are found to be beneficial in treating the CD. Contingency management programs This treatment modality has primarily based on the hypothesis that children and adolescents with CD belong to families in which they have not been experienced a contingent environment– an ill development of social skills which has an important contribution in their scarce capability to adapt the behavior as per the situation. Moreover, some children with CD have a temperamental susceptibility which makes them prone to a noncontingent environment. For example, they focus more on the anticipated positive results of their behavior to so much so that that they ignore the possible negative consequences. The contingency management programs involve. (1) Setting behavioral goals that slowly shape a child's behavior in specific areas of interest. (2) To monitor systematically whether the child is achieving these goals, (3) Positive reinforcement in taking steps in the direction of reaching these goals, and (4) Penalty for undesired behavior. Cognitive behavioral skill training Studies have found that the children and adolescents with CD show deficits in social information processing mechanism. Hence, this cognitive behavioral skill training has been intended to address the social cognition deficit and to improve the problem-solving skill in the social context in children and adolescents with CD. Most of these programs teach the skills to decrease impulsivity and angry responding. This is mainly consists of problem-solving steps, for example, how to recognize problems, how to consider alternative responses, and how to select the adaptive one to deal more effectively with the problems in hand. In this approach, the therapist plays an active role, modeling the skills being taught, role-playing social situation with the child, prompting the use of skills being taught, and delivering feedback and praise for developing the skills. Contingency management program can also be used in this modality. This skill should be practiced in multiple settings for possible generalization and should involve people involve in the natural environment, i.e., parents and teachers. In a recent study, 91 boys aged 6–12 years with a diagnosis of ODD/CD and peer-related aggression were randomized to receive individually delivered social competence training (treatment program for children with aggressive behaviour, THAV) or to an active control involving group play that included techniques to activate resources and the opportunity to train prosocial interactions in groups (PLAY). Outcome measures were rated by parents, teachers, or clinicians. Moderate treatment effects for THAV compared to PLAY were found in parent ratings and/or clinician ratings on aggressive behavior, comorbid symptoms, psychosocial impairment, quality of life, parental stress, and negative expressed emotions. In teacher ratings, significant effects were found for ADHD symptoms and prosocial behavior only. THAV is a specifically effective intervention for boys aged 6–12 years with ODD/CD and peer-related aggressive behavior as rated by parents and clinicians. Parent management training The major objective of parent management training (PMT) is to teach parents the skill of developing and implementing a systematic contingency management plan in home setting. This aims to improve the interaction between parent and child at home and to change the antecedents to behavior to increase the possibility that the child will show prosocial behavior. It also helps parents to improve their capability to keep an eye on their children and teaches them more efficient discipline strategies. Deficiencies in the above-mentioned areas of parenting strategy have been constantly associated with child CD. A randomized study on PMT has shown decrease in the child conduct problem reported by mother. The effect sizes were largest among mothers who were present for >50% of the group sessions. There was no significant effect of the intervention on conduct problems and social competence in kindergarten or school as reported by teachers. Internet-based PMT also showed a greater reduction in conduct problems compared to the waitlist children. It has also been found that during 18 months period after the intervention, child conduct problems continued to decrease whereas parenting skills declined somewhat from post-treatment of internet-based PMT. A Cochrane review of thirteen trials on 1078 participants (646 in the intervention group; 432 in the control group) found that parent training produced a statistically significant reduction in child conduct problems, whether assessed by parents or independently assessed. It also found that there was a significant improvement in the mental health of the parents. There was an improvement in positive parenting skills and a reduction in negative or harsh parenting practices which are found to be statistically significant. This observation was based on both parent reports and independent assessments. The intervention was found to be cost-effective. When the costs of program delivery was compared with the long-term health, social, educational, and legal costs associated with childhood conduct problems they were found to be modest. The researcher concluded that behavioral and cognitive-behavioral group-based parenting interventions are effective. They are cost effective for short-term to improve child conduct problems, parental mental health and parenting skills. However, the long-term assessment of outcomes is still needs to be done. Meta-analytical studies of PMT and cognitive-behavioral Therapy for the child have revealed a positive effect of these interventions on a child with CD. However, majority of the studies included in this meta-analysis were carried out in research conditions and are not representative of the treatment effectiveness in everyday clinical practice. In Germany, \"START NOW\" group-based behavioral skills training program have been developed to target the specific needs of girls with CD in residential care. It aims at enhancing emotional regulation capacities in females with CD or ODD to appropriately deal with day to day life demands. It is intended to enhance psychosocial adjustment and well-being as well as reduce oppositional and aggressive behavior. The primary aim is to decrease the number of CD/ODD symptoms as assessed by a standardized, semi-structured psychiatric interview between baseline and the end of the intervention, in addition to that between baseline and 3 months follow-up point. Secondary objectives include pre- and post-change in CD/ODD-related outcome measures, most notably emotional regulation aspects on a behavioral and neurobiological level. However, this study is underway. Table 4 enumerates some nonpharmacological measures for conduct disorders.Table 4: Nonpharmacological management strategy for conduct disorderPsychopharmacological treatment Only treatment with medication is not sufficient. Pharmacological agents are adjuncts in treatment for acute crisis intervention and short-term management. The role of pharmacotherapy is mainly for the treatment of the comorbid conditions, for example, ADHD or the symptomatic management of aggression and impulsivity [Table 5].Table 5: Pharmacological management of conduct disorderA 10 weeks, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study with two parallel arms with a sample size of 10 in each group was done to examine the role of risperidone in CD. Depending on the weight of the patient, medications could be increased from dose of 0.25 mg or 0.50 mg each morning at the weekly interval during the initial 6 weeks. The primary outcome was measured using aggression against people and/or property scale. Risperidone was found superior in reducing aggression as compared to placebo. It was also found to be well tolerated in this study. A retrospective study on 60 consecutive patients who were treated with lithium for CD found that 48.3% were responders. However, >50% (of the 48.3% who were responders) of them were also receiving concomitant atypical antipsychotic therapy. The reviews suggest that the use of typical antipsychotics is associated with extrapyramidal side-effects. Limited research is available on quetiapine, olanzapine and aripiprazole. Trials of lithium yield contradictory results. Few trials with valproate have shown that it is effective for CD. Although there is evidence to show that the stimulants are efficacious, substance abuse is a potential risk in this case. A recent Cochrane review has following findings. Short-term use of risperidone was found to reduce aggression and conduct problems in disruptive behavior disorders. Most common side effects reported were weight gain and extrapyramidal symptoms. There is no evidence for the use of quetiapine, ziprasidone or any other atypical antipsychotic for CDs. There is low or very low-quality evidence to support the use of haloperidol, thioridazine, quetiapine, and lithium in aggressive youth with CD. Evidence for the use of divalproex in such cases is of low quality. Carbamazepine also has very-low-quality evidence to support its use for the management of aggression in youth with CD. Psychostimulants have a moderate-to-large effect on symptoms regulation in ODD and CD. There is also high-quality evidence to support its use in youth with ADHD, with and without ODD or CD and for emotional dysregulation. Similarly, clonidine has a small effect on oppositional behavior and conduct problems in youth with ADHD, with and without ODD or CD and evidence is very low quality. For oppositional behavior in youth with ADHD, with and without ODD or CD, there is high-quality evidence that atomoxetine has a small effect. There are few case reports indicating that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors were effective in reducing aggression in male youth with various aggressive disorders. To treat aggression in youth beta-blockers have been found to be effective. A meta-analytic study that includes 11 studies on the role of clonidine in ADHD and co-morbid conditions found a moderate effect size on symptoms of ADHD in children and adolescents with ADHD and ADHD comorbid with CD. PREVENTION Prevention is an important component in the intervention of CD. Integration of various modalities of intervention can have added beneficial effects. There is increased effectiveness in addressing multiple risk factors in intervention. The conduct problems prevention research group develops a model for the management of CD through the approach of preventive intervention. The name of the program was FAST Track (Families and schools together) Program. The FAST Track program integrates various interventional modules to encourage psychosocial competence of the child in various settings, for example, the family and school environment. This preventive approach can reduce conduct problems, poor social relationships and drop out from school. In this 10 years intervention program included behavior-management training for the parents and training of child for improving social and cognitive skills. For this tutoring, home visiting, mentoring, and a universal classroom program were included. It was found that there was a significant interaction between intervention and initial risk level at each age but most strongly after Grade 9. The intervention group had a significant positive effect in lowering the diagnoses for CD, and any externalizing disorder, and lowering antisocial behavior scores, but only among those at highest risk initially. Various risk factors for developing CD in future are early adolescent substance use, high-intensity argument/defiant behavior, both low- and high-intensity aggression to people/animals, high-intensity deceitfulness/stealing, high-intensity peer problems, high-intensity destruction of property, and inappropriate sexual behavior should be identified and subsequently targeted for timely intervention. Evidence-based parenting programs decrease the possibility of CD persisting into adult ASPD and have been found to be cost effective. Various school-based programs are also helpful in preventing the CD. The algorithm to the management approach of conduct disorder is outlined in Figure 1.Figure 1: Algorithm for assessment and management of Conduct disorderFinancial support and sponsorship Nil.

      "abstract": "Anxiety and psychosomatic Desease. Escalation mechanisms and therapeutic strategies from the perspective of systems theory and behavioral therapy Abstract. There is unlikely to be a symptomatic malady or disease in humans that is not accompanied by more or less severe anxiety. This can directly negatively influence bodily disease processes, it always creates or intensifies mental suffering, often it causes the development of an independent anxiety disorder. Pathogenetically, nonlinear amplifications play a central role, as they are typical for complex dynamic systems. While these multiple vicious cycle mechanisms are responsible for the escalation of symptoms, misdirected learning processes bring about a chronification. An integrative model for these pathogenetic relationships is being developed, which at the same time makes it clear how one can synergistically combine established behavioral therapy methods for their treatment. This integrative behavioral therapy is exemplified by a case study.Zusammenfassung. Es dürfte kaum eine symptomatische Funktionsstörung oder Erkrankung geben, die beim Menschen nicht von mehr oder weniger starker Angst begleitet wird. Dies kann körperliche Krankheitsprozesse direkt negativ beeinflussen, immer erzeugt bzw. intensiviert es psychisches Leiden, oft verselbständigt es sich zu einer eigenständigen Angsterkrankung. Pathogenetisch spielen nichtlineare Verstärkungen eine zentrale Rolle, wie sie für Komplexe dynamische Systeme typisch sind. Während diese vielfältigen Teufelskreis-Mechanismen für die Eskalation der Symptome verantwortlich sind, bewirken fehlgeleitete Lernprozesse eine Chronifzierung. Es wird ein Integrierendes Modell für diese pathogenetischen Zusammenhänge entwickelt, das zugleich deutlich macht, wie man etablierte verhaltenstherapeutische Methoden zu ihrer Behandlung synergistisch kombinieren kann. Diese verfahrensintegrierende Verhaltenstherapie wird an einem Fallbeispiel exemplifiziert.",

      "title": "Trauma as a life event and its impact on suicidal behaviour",
      "abstract": "Among the many different negative life events commonly associated with an increased risk of suicidal behaviour, exposure to traumatic stress with their associated traumatic stress syndromes are often overlooked in suicidal groups since they are usually not the presenting complaint or they belong to the patient's past. Post-traumatic stress responses with their secondary ill-effects may be caused by brief or single overwhelming events such as disasters, violent assault, rape, terrorism or acts of war. Manifest and enduring symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are usually only seen in those who have been exposed to particularly severe traumatisation or who have been more vulnerable, but frequently lead to additional severe secondary problems such as affective disorders (more than 50% comorbidity), substance abuse and social and relational problems. These are all conditions or disorders leading to an increased the risk of suicidal behaviour, which has indeed been observed in a number of studies of traumatized groups. Examples of the second type of traumatic stress exposure - the long-lasting or chronic traumatisation - are prolonged childhood abuse, long-term battering relationships, combat experiences, concentration camp experiences and torture. These types of traumatic stress have the ability to create more complex clinical stress responses such as personality disturbances, dissociation, behavioural changes and self-destructive behaviour ranging from self-mutilation to completed suicide. In this lecture an update on research into the association between trauma and suicidal behaviour will be presented and implications for preventive work discussed. Language: en",

      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics WDR26-related intellectual disability (ID) is characterized by developmental delay / intellectual disability, characteristic facial features, hypotonia, epilepsy, and infant feeding difficulties. To date 15 individuals, ages 24 months to 34 years, have been reported. Developmental delay is present in all individuals and ranges from mild to severe. All individuals have delayed speech. Although some begin to develop speech in the second year, others have remained nonverbal. Seizures, present in all affected individuals reported to date, can be febrile or non-febrile (tonic-clonic, absence, rolandic seizures); most seizures are self limited or respond well to standard treatment. Affected individuals are generally described as happy and socially engaging; several have stereotypies / autistic features (repetitive or rocking behavior, abnormal hand movements or posturing, and at times self-stimulation). Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of WDR26-related ID is established in a proband with suggestive clinical features and a heterozygous pathogenic variant in WDR26 identified by molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Standard treatment of developmental delay / intellectual disability, seizures, infant feeding problems, and behavioral issues. Surveillance: In infancy: regular assessment of swallowing, feeding, and nutritional status to determine safety of oral vs gastrostomy feeding. For all age groups: routine monitoring of developmental progress, educational needs, and behavioral issues. Genetic counseling WDR26-related ID is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. All individuals reported to date have the disorder as the result of a de novo pathogenic variant. If the WDR26 pathogenic variant found in the proband cannot be detected in the leukocyte DNA of either parent, the recurrence risk to sibs is estimated to be 1% because of the theoretic possibility of parental germline mosaicism. Prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk and preimplantation genetic testing are possible.",

      "title": "Psychological Frailty in the Aging Patient",
      "abstract": "There is little written in the geriatric literature about the concept of psychological frailty which encompasses cognitive, mood, and motivational components. The concept is intended to consider brain changes that are beyond normal aging, but not necessarily inclusive of disease, that result in decreased cognitive or mood resilience in the presence of modest stressors, and may eventually lead to negative health outcomes in a manner parallel to physical frailty, an entity well known to clinicians. Most work exploring the interface between cognition, mood, and physical frailty has demonstrated a bidirectional association between the two domains. Psychological symptoms or deficits have been described as either worsening the degree of physical frailty, or physical frailty has been viewed as a risk to a worsening cognition or depression. However, psychological frailty, a consequence of age-altered brain function, has not been studied for itself. By what possible mechanism does the brain reveal its loss of resiliency under modest stress and how can this be visualized? Are there markers that predate a psychological decline that might permit a preventive intervention which could delay the appearance of negative health outcomes such as reduced functional capacity or increased dependency? The present review will explore these concepts and possibilities.",

      "title": "PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AND MENTAL HEALTH: THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN EXERCISE AND MOOD",
      "abstract": "Physical activity is an important public health tool used in the treatment and prevention of various physical diseases, as well as in the treatment of some psychiatric diseases such as depressive and anxiety disorders. However, studies have shown that in addition to its beneficial effects, physical activity can also be associated with impaired mental health, being related to disturbances like \"excessive exercise\" and \"overtraining syndrome\". Although the number of reports of the effects of physical activity on mental health is steadily increasing, these studies have not yet identified the mechanisms involved in the benefits and dangers to mental health associated with exercise. This article reviews the information available regarding the relationship between physical activity and mental health, specifically addressing the association between exercise and mood. A atividade física é, por seus efeitos no tratamento e na prevenção de várias patologias, um importante instrumento de saúde pública, sendo útil, inclusive, no tratamento de doenças psiquiátricas como transtornos depressivos e ansiosos. Todavia, além dos benefícios, a atividade física também está associada a prejuízos para a saúde mental, aparecendo ligada a quadros como \"exercício excessivo\" e \"síndrome de 'overtraining'\", segundo alguns estudos. Trabalhos sobre os efeitos de atividade física na saúde mental vêm se tornando mais comuns, no entanto ainda não permitem um conhecimento maior sobre os mecanismos implicados nos benefícios e malefícios associados a este tipo de atividade. Este artigo procura revisar os conhecimentos disponíveis sobre as relações entre atividade física e saúde mental, principalmente no que se refere à ligação existente entre exercício e humor.",

      "abstract": "<strong>Background:</strong> The psychological pressure on soldiers during World War I (WWI) and other military conflicts has resulted in many reported cases of psychogenic gait as well as other movement disorders. In this paper, psychogenic movement disorders captured in the WWI film footage ''War Neuroses'' is reanalyzed. <strong>Methods:</strong> Two movement disorders specialists re-examined film images of 21 WWI patients with various and presumed psychogenic manifestations, pre- and post treatment. The film was recorded by Arthur Hurst, a general physician with an interest in neurology. <strong>Results:</strong> All 21 subjects were males, and all presented with symptoms relating to war trauma or a psychological stressor (e.g., being buried, shrapnel wounds, concussion, or trench fever). The most common presenting feature was a gait disorder, either pure or mixed with another movement disorder (15), followed by retrograde amnesia (2), abnormal postures (pure dystonia) (1), facial spasm (1), head tremor (1), ''hyperthyroidism-hyperadrenalism'' (1). Nineteen patients received treatment, and the treatment was identified in nine cases. In most cases, treatment was short and patients improved almost immediately. Occupational therapy was the most common treatment. Other effective methods were hypnosis (1), relaxation (1), passive movements (2), and probable ''persuasion and re-education'' (6). <strong>Discussion:</strong> The high success rate in treating psychogenic disorders in Hurst's film would be considered impressive by modern standards, and has raised doubt in recent years as to whether parts of the film were staged and/or acted.",

There is no such thing as a non‐physical illness. Asking whether emotions cause diseases, or diseases cause emotions, leads to many difficulties and is unprofitable. It is far more useful to ask about stimulus‐response relationships. There are more kinds of specificity relations in psychophysiology and psychosomatic medicine than are usually recognized, and the usual specificity statements in psychosomatic medicine are not concerned with I‐R or S‐R specificity. There are many problems in medicine which psychophysiology could help to solve.",

      "abstract": "The initial clinical assessment of spinal pain consists of diagnostic triage into: (i) serious spinal pathology; (ii) other pathological entities; and (iii) non-specific symptoms. The non-specific group comprises the major burden of spinal illness. There are two broad approaches to the diagnostic challenge of non-specific spinal pain. One approach is to split the group into sub-groups explained by separate pathophysiological abnormalities. The focus of this work is to describe these proposed abnormalities in greater detail and to discover which clinical features distinguish them. The other approach is to 'lump' all of those with non-specific features into one group, and consider the common psychosocial factors that are relevant to the whole group. A variety of pathological and non-pathological models have been proposed. Pathological models include ligament laxity, facet syndrome, discogenic pain, spondylosis and instability; non-pathological models include a pain–spasm–pain cycle, muscle inhibition and deconditioning and somatic dysfunction. All of these models are problematic and do not fully account for all of non-specific spinal pain. Another approach is to consider these two different approaches together and to consider this non-specific category as orthogonal dimensions of pathology and dysfunction.",

      "abstract": "Functional somatic syndromes are increasingly diagnosed in chronically ill patients presenting with an array of symptoms not attributed to physical ailments. Conditions such as chronic fatigue syndrome, fibromyalgia syndrome, or irritable bowel syndrome are common disorders that belong in this broad category. Such syndromes are characterised by the presence of one or multiple chronic symptoms including widespread musculoskeletal pain, fatigue, sleep disorders, and abdominal pain, amongst other issues. Symptoms are believed to relate to a complex interaction of biological and psychosocial factors, where a definite aetiology has not been established. Theories suggest causative pathways between the immune and nervous systems of affected individuals with several risk factors identified in patients presenting with one or more functional syndromes. Risk factors including stress and childhood trauma are now recognised as important contributors to chronic pain conditions. Emotional, physical, and sexual abuse during childhood is considered a severe stressor having a high prevalence in functional somatic syndrome suffers. Such trauma permanently alters the biological stress response of the suffers leading to neuroexcitatory and other nerve issues associated with chronic pain in adults. Traumatic and chronic stress results in epigenetic changes in stress response genes, which ultimately leads to dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis, the autonomic nervous system, and the immune system manifesting in a broad array of symptoms. Importantly, these systems are known to be dysregulated in patients suffering from functional somatic syndrome. Functional somatic syndromes are also highly prevalent co-morbidities of psychiatric conditions, mood disorders, and anxiety. Consequently, this review aims to provide insight into the role of the nervous system and immune system in chronic pain disorders associated with the musculoskeletal system, and central and peripheral nervous systems.",

Rarely it is severe, usually following injury or after a surgical operation, and intensive pharmacological efforts may be needed to relieve the pain and distress. Thus we are all familiar with what pain is. In scientific terms pain has been defined by the International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP) as ‘an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage., or described in terms of such damage’. A painful stimulus is a protective response for the individual.

      "title": "Isaac's Sign: Handkerchief Holding by Older Inpatients",
      "abstract": "“Beware a handkerchief in the hand, a handbag on the arm, food in the mouth, teeth in the jar, the hearing aid in the drawer and the artificial limb under the bed; all betoken a poor prognosis.” To the Editor: The persistent holding of a handkerchief or other object by older people is a common sight on hospital wards and in geriatric medicine outpatient clinics. Despite it apparently being a common observation, little has been documented about this phenomenon. The late Bernard Isaacs's observation that such behavior was associated with poor rehabilitative outcome1 is not proven but could, if true, point to physical or cognitive frailties as the underlying etiologies. Why many older people clutch handkerchiefs and other items is unclear. It may simply be due to physical symptoms such as rhinorrhea, drooling, or cough. There may be a psychological component—an association with insecurity, anxiety, or acute or chronic cognitive impairment. Handkerchief holding has a “mirror behavior” in childhood and could be considered regressive behavior in an older adult, analogous to a child with a security blanket or other attachment agent. One patient told us “I've always done it since I was a child. I had a rag then.” Local use of the term “andrexia nervosa” illustrates the possible association with anxiety or other emotional distress. (Andrex is a popular brand of toilet tissue in the United Kingdom. The late Independent UK newspaper witticist Miles Kington may have originally coined the term “andrexia nervosa.”) The prevalence and patient explanations of this behavior were studied. A point prevalence survey and single-question interview was conducted on all inpatient geriatric medical wards in the Leeds Teaching Hospitals National Health Services Trust (LTHT). The number of patients holding a handkerchief or other object and their age, sex, and handedness were recorded. Patients holding an object were asked one question: “May I ask why you hold a handkerchief [or tissue, etc.]?” Objective evidence of patients' physical explanations was sought from direct observation and case notes. Data are presented descriptively and analyzed using chi-square tests. Three hundred seventy-five of 420 beds in four hospital sites were occupied at the time of the survey. Thirty-three patients were excluded as unable to hold an item because of disability or severe illness; 332 patients were eligible to participate, of whom 11% were observed to be clutching a handkerchief or tissue (in 79% cases) or other object (mainly paper or toy). Patients ages ranged from 66 to 104; 84% were female. There was no difference between patients in beds or chairs; equal numbers were holding the item in their dominant and nondominant hand. More patients were found holding a tissue in acute wards (18%) than rehabilitation wards (7%). Of the explanations given by patients, 50% related to physical symptoms, objective evidence of which existed in only 28% cases (Table 1). Several patients gave a physical and a nonphysical explanation. Nonphysical explanations included “habit” or “for comfort.” Some patients were unable to explain their behavior. Most replies indicated that this behavior was long-standing; 55% using words such as “a long time,”“years,” or “always.” Fewer (2%) indicated that his behavior was recent, since being in the hospital. Some suggested that onset of handkerchief-holding behavior started in later life. We have often observed older patients holding handkerchiefs. This study, the first to explore this observation, found that it is common, with a prevalence of 11% of older inpatients, 84% of whom were female. Isaacs hypothesized that handkerchief holding may be associated with a poor rehabilitative outcome. Functional outcomes were not studied in this study, although patients gave several explanations for this behavior. Half of these were nonphysical, raising the possibility of a psychological association with handkerchief holding. In addition, objective evidence of physical explanations was found in only 28%, suggesting that some patients might be rationalizing the behavior. Tissue holding was more common on acute wards than postacute or rehabilitation wards (18% vs 7%). Greater anxiety in patients who are sicker or in a rapidly changing acute hospital environment may explain this. Use of attachment agents by children is associated with separation anxiety and is also frequently observed as a coping strategy in unfamiliar circumstances irrespective of children's maternal attachment status.2 There are obvious limitations to point prevalence studies; Isaac's sign may be intermittent and therefore underestimated, and short-term observation may inappropriately invalidate patient explanations. Further study is planned to investigate potential psychological and functional associations with handkerchief holding. Isaacs's original observation may prove a useful clinical eponymous sign.

      "abstract": "Introduction Grief is as normal reactive to a significant personal loss. It is characterized by affective, cognitive, behavioural and physiological symptoms. The grieving process is usually divided in five different stages, but in most cases presents a benign course, with decreased suffering and better adaptation to the new context. However, when high levels of emotional suffering or disability persist over a long time period, it becomes a case of complicated grief (CG), which should be adequately addressed. Objectives To review the characteristics of CG, the evidence that supports it as an individual pathological entity, and its place in current classification systems. Methods We performed a bibliographic search in Pubmed and PsychInfo, of articles written in English, Portuguese and Spanish, containing the key words: grief, bereavement, psychiatry, classification. Results The main issue regarding grief is the degree to which it is reasonable to interfere with a usually benign process. Since DSM-III bereavement has been referred to as an adaptive reaction to an important loss, which should not be diagnosed as major depressive disorder or adjustment disorder. However, DSM-5 has stated persistent complex bereavement disorder as an independent entity. In fact, CG fulfils the general criteria of every psychiatric syndrome, namely regarding specific diagnosis criteria, differential diagnosis from depressive disorders and post-traumatic stress disorder, and improvement with adequate treatment. Conclusion It is important to correctly approach CG, since it presents with characteristic diagnosis features and much improvement may be achieved once adequate treatment is provided.

      "title": "Anticipatory Awareness of Emotionally Charged Targets by Individuals with Histories of Emotional Trauma",
      "abstract": "Individual vulnerability to stress is apparently determined partly by genetic-constitutional and partly by psychological factors. With regard to the latter, main weight should be afforded to traumatic experiences from the past, especially those of early childhood, which have sensitized the person concerned to certain current stressors. This led the first author to infer the existence of a personal sensitization factor (PSF), representing a dormant intrapsychic conflict resulting from the internalization of an early traumatic experience or, for that matter, a traumatic object-relationship that has sensitized the individual to life events with the original traumatic experience (Graaf, 1998a, 1998b; Graaf & Van der Molen, 1989, 1996). Accordingly, the precipitating, or trigger event is called the congruent life event (CLE). The concept of a PSF appeared to be very helpful in explaining why a psychobiological ailment, such as a depressive illness or a heart attack, could occur following such a common life event as one's child leaving home. (There is, by now, strong and direct evidence in favor of an intimate connection between the occurrence of cardiovascular disease on the one hand and stressful experiences or circumstances on the other (Schnurr, Spiro III, & Paris, 2000). In the case of a child's leaving home, the child's independence often appeared to have stirred up very painful or guilt-ridden memories in the parents about a traumatic separation from their own parents, e.g., because of the latters' premature death or because of being sent away from home at a very early age. The following two case histories may illustrate this point. Case 1 A 33-year-old married man was sent to me [TKdG] with severe depression, consisting of an inability to work, a strong inclination to shut himself off from his surroundings, and strong suicidal tendencies. Until recently he had functioned well but rather compulsively. The symptoms suddenly appeared when, at his work as a manager, he was forced by the management to fire on the spot two employees who were not working satisfactorily, without due process of law. Not until the family history had become known in depth during therapy did it appear that during his childhood he had been a regular witness to the physical abuse of his two elder sisters by both his parents. Case 2 Bill, B5 years of age, refrained from drinking coffee, tea, etc., when in the company of strangers, for fear that his hand would start to tremble and cause him to spill the drink. His phobia began after he had become a father for the first time and some friends had raised their glasses to toast his and his son's health. There was a 50-year age difference between himself and his father, who had been a distant and very authoritarian man, cynical and harsh towards his son. When Bill was about 13 years of age, his father developed a severe form of Parkinson's disease and he remembered that during mealtimes his father used to tremble to such an extent that he made a terrible mess on the table and on his clothes. Bill had been ashamed of his father's illness, but at the same time had felt very guilty about having these feelings. The examples presented here show that the precipitating events do not take place within a void, but are linked to a pre-existing psychic conflict, which, in turn, is the consequence of earlier psychotraumatic experiences. (This corresponds with what Fairbairn (1943/1952) has called the to the trauma.) A precondition for this transference phenomenon to occur is the presence of a psychic conflict that causes so much intrapsychic tension that it provokes an urgent need to seek an outer for this tension by means of projection or other forms of externalization. Inasmuch as the traumatic and conflicting content of the PSF is reactivated or kindled by the congruent life event, the PSF itself is also able to kindle or facilitate perception of the appropriate CLE, adding and passing on to the event its own aggressive properties. …",

Based on the National Center for Sleep Disorders Research Classification,5 insomnia symptoms can be defined as subjective complaints of difficulty falling asleep, difficulty maintaining sleep, early awakening and non refreshing sleep despite an adequate opportunity to sleep. An important consideration is whether the presence of one or more of these symptoms causes significant impairment to the patient’s social, occupational or other important areas of functioning. Insomnia can be due to primary or secondary causes. Primary insomnia refers to insomnia that appears to be unrelated to any identifiable underlying medical or psychiatric disorder.6,7 Secondary causes of insomnia include conditions where another disorder contributing to or aggravating the insomnia can be diagnosed (Table1). The diagnosis of sleep disorders is often based on obtaining a detailed sleep history, a neuropsychiatric evaluation, a physical examination looking for medical and other disorders, mental status examination and relevant investigations. A sleep diary that the patient maintains in which sleep-relevant behaviours such as bedtime and waking times, awakenings, total sleep time, napping, medications, alcohol and mood on waking often provides valuable information for the patient and physician. Patients with sleep-disordered breathing, sleep-related motor disorders and those with severe, chronic insomnia for which an obvious cause cannot be found may require referral for sleep laboratory evaluation.

      "title": "Borderline Personality Disorder Is a Heritable Brain Disease",
      "abstract": "The prevailing view among many psychiatrists and mental health professionals is that borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a psychological condition. BPD often is conceptualized as a behavioral consequence of childhood trauma; treatment approaches have emphasized intensive psychotherapeutic modalities, less so biologic interventions. You might not be aware that a large body of research over the past decade provides strong evidence that BPD is a neurobiological illness--a finding that would drastically alter how the disorder should be conceptualized and managed. Neuropathology underpins the personality disorder Foremost, BPD must be regarded as a serious, disabling brain disorder, not simply an aberration of personality In DSM-5, symptoms of BPD are listed as: feelings of abandonment; unstable and intense interpersonal relationships; unstable sense of self; impulsivity; suicidal or self-mutilating behavior; affective instability (dysphoria, irritability anxiety); chronic feelings of emptiness; intense anger episodes; and transient paranoid or dissociative symptoms. Clearly, these dusters of psychopathological and behavioral symptoms reflect a pervasive brain disorder associated with abnormal neurobiology and neural circuitry that might, at times, stubbornly defy therapeutic intervention. No wonder that 42 published studies report that, compared with healthy controls, people who have BPD display extensive cortical and subcortical abnormalities in brain structure and function.1 These anomalous patterns have been detected across all 4 available neuroimaging techniques. [ILLUSTRATION OMITTED] Magnetic resonance imaging. MRI studies have revealed the following abnormalities in BPD: * hypoplasia of the hippocampus, caudate, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex * variations in the CA1 region of the hippocampus and subiculum * smaller-than-normal orbitofrontal cortex (by 24%, compared with healthy controls) and the mid-temporal and left cingulate gyrii (by 26%) * larger-than-normal volume of the right inferior parietal cortex and the right parahippocampal gyrus * loss of gray matter in the frontal, temporal, and parietal cortices * an enlarged third cerebral ventricle * in women, reduced size of the medial temporal lobe and amygdala * in men, a decreased concentration of gray matter in the anterior cingulate * reversal of normal right-greater-than-left asymmetry of the orbitofrontal cortex gray matter, reflecting loss of gray matter on the right side * a lower concentration of gray matter in the rostral/subgenual anterior cingulate cortex * a smaller frontal lobe. In an analysis of MRI studies,2 correlation was found between structural brain abnormalities and specific symptoms of BPD, such as impulsivity suicidality, and aggression. These findings might someday guide personalized in-terventions--for example, using neuro-stimulation techniques such as repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation and deep brain stimulation--to modulate the activity of a given region of the brain (depending on which symptom is most prominent or disabling). Magnetic resonance spectroscopy. In BPD, MRS studies reveal: * compared with controls, a higher glutamate level in the anterior cingulate cortex * reduced levels of N-acetyl aspartate (NAA; found in neurons) and creatinine in the left amygdala * a reduction (on average, 19%) in the NAA concentration in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Functional magnetic resonance imaging. From fMRI studies, there is evidence in BPD of: * greater activation of the amygdala and prolonged return to baseline * increased functional connectivity in the left frontopolar cortex and left insula * decreased connectivity in the left cuneus and left inferior parietal and the right middle temporal lobes * marked frontal hypometabolism * hypermetabolism in the motor cortex, medial and anterior cingulate, and occipital and temporal poles * lower connectivity between the amygdala during a neutral stimulus * higher connectivity between the amygdala during fear stimulus * deactivation of the opioid system in the left nucleus accumbens, hypothalamus, and hippocampus * hyperactivation of the left medial prefrontal cortex during social exclusion * more mistakes made in differentiating an emotional and a neutral facial expression. …",

      "abstract": "A atividade sexual satisfatória é um dos pilares da qualidade de vida, envolvendo das preliminares ao intercurso sexual, mecanismos neurológicos, vasculares, endocrinológicos, musculoesqueléticos, psicossociais, culturais, além do parceiro sexual e fatores individuais (autoestima, imagem corporal e habilidade pessoal). A disfunção sexual consiste na incapacidade para participar do ato sexual com satisfação, comprometendo desejo e/ou excitação e/ou orgasmo. Pode também se apresentar como dor que antecede, ocorre durante ou após o ato. Os numerosos fatores de risco para a disfunção sexual explicam sua alta prevalência nas diferentes fases da vida, podendo apresentar etiologia orgânica, psicossocial e/ou sociodemográfica. Entre estes últimos citam-se idade avançada, renda familiar baixa e educação precária. Quanto aos fatores orgânicos, encontram-se: deficiência hormonal, hipertensão arterial, diabetes, cardiopatias, neuropatias, alcoolismo, tabagismo, uso de drogas ilícitas, bem como uso de alguns medicamentos. Depressão e ansiedade respondem pelas causas psiquiátricas mais comuns de disfunção sexual. A prevalência é alta em homens, especialmente nos casos de disfunção erétil (DE) e de ejaculação precoce (EP). O mesmo se observa nas mulheres, quanto à diminuição do desejo, falta de lubrificação vaginal, transtornos do orgasmo e dor ao intercurso sexual. Por comprometer a satisfação sexual e a satisfação com a vida, a disfunção sexual resulta em menor qualidade de vida, baixa autoestima, depressão, ansiedade e prejuízo na relação interpessoal e dos parceiros. Doenças crônicas podem conduzir ao desinteresse sexual e à falta dessa atividade, por baixa autoestima e preocupação quanto à imagem corporal, por exemplo. A depressão também reduz a libido, deteriorando a qualidade do relacionamento sexual. Os pacientes, ansiosos sobre sua habilidade em satisfazer o parceiro, com o tempo desenvolvem ansiedade antecipatória e, pelo receio de falhar, acabam evitando o intercurso. Fadiga e estresse também acompanham as doenças crônicas, podendo contribuir para a disfunção sexual.",

Cerebral palsy affects two to three children per 1,000 live-born. Typological characteristics of the clinical image of cerebral palsy are the modified muscle tone characterized by muscular tension, altered body posture and disturbed motion. Cerebral palsy is a disorder of the central nervous system, so it affects the whole development and functioning of the physical psychomotor development of a child. It is accompanied by developmental disorders, sensomotor disorders, perceptual cognitive developmental disorders, socioemocional disorders and difficulties in functioning of everyday life, auditory - visual and other perceptual disorders, intellectual deficit, etc., and may be accompanied by epilepsy. Cerebral palsy, although a permanetn diagnosys, depending on the degree of damage, can be treated using different treatment methods and therapies such as kinesitherapy can which can significantly influence the overall functioning of the affected person. The key precondition is early detection and propercorrective and therapeutic or curative action. Kinesitheraphy as a motion treatment method can have a significant effect on treating a person, raising the body's psychomotor status and the quality of everyday life. Methods used, based on clinical kinesiology, and appropriate exercise and modification, kinesitherapy has positive effects in treating the condition of people with cerebral palsy",

Durante una consulta médica, muchos adultos mayores no mencionan sus dificultades para andar, algunos no se refieren a haberse caído ya porque consideran que éste es un problema normal que forma parte del envejecimiento y porque desconocen las intervenciones que puedan minimizar el problema. La inestabilidad postural es considerada un síndrome geriátrico con señales, síntomas propios y con etiología multifactorial. Una caída en un adulto mayor puede considerarse un evento centinela o una señal de alerta que anuncia un declive funcional, un cuadro infeccioso asintomático, o el efecto adverso de un medicamento o una patología subyacente sin señales y síntomas clásicos. El examen físico de un adulto mayor comienza incluso antes de su ingreso en el consultorio. El médico debe estar atento a la manera en la que él se levanta de la silla y anda, si necesita ayuda para levantarse o si usa algún aparato para ayudar a la marcha. La evaluación del equilibrio y de las alteraciones de la marcha, así como la investigación de la ocurrencia de caídas en adultos mayores debe ser muy cuidadosa; durante la entrevista clínica el médico debe preguntar abiertamente sobre los problemas de equilibrio, marcha y ocurrencia de caídas, así como conocer las circunstancias en que acontecieron. Habitualmente, las caídas son consecuencias de perturbaciones del equilibrio y de la marcha, algunas de éstas son típicas de patologías específicas, por esto, la observación cuidadosa de la marcha puede ayudar al médico a elaborar hipótesis diagnósticas más probables a fin de proponer intervenciones preventivas.",

Una persona puede sentirse profundamente afectada mientras que otra poco o nada presenta efectos adversos, es por ello que se cree pertinente reconocer el factor que desencadeno la crisis provocando vulnerabilidad que excede los recursos actuales del individuo y las estrategias previas de afrontamiento. Cuando no se puede asimilar, adaptar, poner en marcha nuevas formas de afrontamiento y control de emociones podria llegar a presentar un mayor deterioro y el desarrollo de conductas destructivas, entre ellas la conducta suicida. La conducta suicida es una de las principales causas de lesiones y muertes alrededor de todo el mundo, es un fenomeno complejo y multifactorial, conformada por ideas suicidas, autodano, crisis suicida, intento autolitico y suicidio; sin embargo la deteccion temprana de factores de riesgo y proteccion implicados permitiran abordar este problema bajo un meticuloso proceso. Se conoce que puede originarse en respuesta a una crisis de la vida cotidiana y a crisis psicopatologicas determinando el abordaje terapeutico. Las intervenciones basadas en evidencias incluyen procedimientos disenados para atacar directamente el riesgo suicida. Las intervenciones que han demostrado mayor eficacia segun varias revisiones sistematicas han sido todas aquellas de tendencia cognitivo conductual, entre ellas terapia dialectico conductual, de resolucion de problemas y mindfulness, debido a que han ayudado significativamente a la reduccion de pensamientos, desesperanza y la conducta suicida ademas las ganancias realizadas a menudo se han mantenido con el tiempo.",

      "title": "Theoretical Accounts of Gulf War Syndrome: From Environmental Toxins to Psychoneuroimmunology and Neurodegeneration",
      "abstract": "Non‐specific illness includes a wide variety of symptoms: behavioural (e.g., reduced food and water intake), cognitive (e.g., memory and concentration problems) and physiological (e.g., fever). This paper reviews evidence suggesting that such symptoms can be explained more parsimoniously as a single symptom cluster than as a set of separate illnesses such as Gulf War Syndrome (GWS) and chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). This superordinate syndrome could have its biological basis in the activity of pro‐inflammatory cytokines (in particular interleukin‐1: IL‐1), that give rise to what has become known as the ‘sickness response’. It is further argued that the persistence of non‐specific illness in chronic conditions like GWS may be (in part) attributable to a bio‐associative mechanism (Ferguson and Cassaday, 1999). In the case of GWS, physiological challenges could have produced a non‐specific sickness response that became associated with smells (e.g., petrol), coincidentally experienced in the Persian Gulf. On returning to the home environment, these same smells would act as associative triggers for the maintenance of (conditioned) sickness responses. Such associative mechanisms could be mediated through the hypothalamus and limbic system via vagal nerve innervation and would provide an explanation for the persistence of a set of symptoms (e.g., fever) that should normally be short lived and self‐limiting. We also present evidence that the pattern of symptoms produced by the pro‐inflammatory cytokines reflects a shift in immune system functioning towards a (T‐helper‐1) Th1 profile. This position contrasts with other immunological accounts of GWS that suggest that the immune system demonstrates a shift to a Th2 (allergy) profile. Evidence pertaining to these two contrasting positions is reviewed.",

      "abstract": "Zimeldine, the first selective neuronal serotonin (5-H1) reuptake inhibitor to be registered as an antidepressant was withdrawn from common use due to an acute flu-like adverse syndrome comprising fever, myalgia and/or arthralgia and signs of disturbed liver function. A few of these patients also developed a peripheral neuropathy, in the most serious form a Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS). The reaction was tentatively termed a hypersensitivity syndrome (HSS).Patients who had developed a HSS during zimeldine therapy (HSS-patients) were compared to control patients who tolerated the drug.No predictor to the HSS emerged concerning demographic data, psychiatric illness, previous medical history, medications with zimeldine or other drugs, other diseases, professional or nutritional circumstances. Nor was there any sign that HSS-patients who also developed neurological symptoms had a different profile of the HSS than other HSS-patients. Earlier zin1eldine treatment per se was not seen to predispose for development of a HSS or any other kind of adverse experience during subsequent therapy. The spectrum of adverse reactions was in agreement with those reported in previous studies and no new case of the GBS was revealed. The estimated frequency of HSS ranged from 0.63 to 3.4 % in spontaneous reports to the regnlatory authority and 1.4- 13% in a written inquiry. Among closely monitored inpatients 31 %developed a HSS. The mechanism for the HSS does not seem to be related primarily to the 5-HT reuptake inhibition as such. No HLA-associated disposition for the HSS was found. Nor was there any support for a HLA-associated disposition for depressive disorders. The pathogenetic mechanism for the HSS seems to involve an inlmunological response to antigens related to zimeldine.Zimeldine and its main primary metabolite norzimeldine both suppressed clinical signs of experimental allergic neuritis (EAN) in Lewis rats. Imrnunomodulatory effects in vitro of zimeldine, its metabolites norzimeldine and CPP 200 as well as of other monoamine reuptake inhibiting antidepressants were identified in the same EAN model.These observations call for further research on immunological mechanisms in the pathogenesis of mental disorders as well as on the potential role of drugs acting on the monoamine systems in the treatment of autoimmune diseases. The findings also justify a discussion on the application of immunological methods in the testing of new psychopharmacological drugs.Based on the presented results the tentatively used term for the adverse reactions to zimeldine, the hypersensitivity syndrome, seems justified.",

The same and other similar situations are everyday experiences for modern humans (1), whose various responses may be psychological and/or physical. Since stress can be caused by environmental as well as psychological factors, it is easy to perceive that there is a relationship between everyday stress and defense mechanisms and disease susceptibility and that the physical and psychological spheres are often both involved in the process. The result is a unitary concept of human pathology, and the problem is to determine the entity of the emotional component in any disease. The body (soma) and the mind (psyche)constitute a single unit, and physicians should do the utmost to consider and treat them as such.",

Reduplicative paramnesia (RP) is a specific phenomenon characterized by subjective certainty that a familiar place or person has been duplicated. Clinical evidences indicated that the patient with RP following right prefrontal damages showed the lack of emotional valence for the present hospital. This abnormal sense of familiarity triggered the deficits of the orientation of self to the outside world, that is, double orientation, resulting in the development of geographical reduplicative paramnesia. In line with the pathogenesis of CD and RP after brain damages, the delusion in schizophrenia may have a germ as developmental origins, which include the aberrant or salient perceptual experiences and abnormal sense of agency, and might be further aggravated by the impairment of causal reasoning process such as the jumping-to-conclusions bias.",

      "abstract": "Asphyxia in a forensic context refers to death by rapid cerebral anoxia or hypoxia due to accidental or nonaccidental injury. Death due to nondrowning asphyxia can occur with strangulation, suffocation, and mechanical asphyxia, each of which is categorized based on the mechanism of injury. Individuals dying due to various types of asphyxia may or may not have lesions, and even those lesions that are present may be due to other causes. The interpretation or opinion that death was due to asphyxia requires definitive and compelling evidence from the postmortem examination, death scene, and/or history. Beyond the postmortem examination, pathologists may be faced with questions of forensic importance that revolve around the behavioral and physiological responses in animals subjected to strangulation, suffocation, or mechanical asphyxia to determine if the animal suffered. While there is no prescriptive answer to these questions, it is apparent that, because of physiological and anatomical differences between humans and animals, for some mechanisms of asphyxia, consciousness is maintained for longer periods and the onset of death is later in animals than that described for people. Veterinary pathologists must be cognizant that direct extrapolation from the medical forensic literature to animals may be incorrect. This article reviews the terminology, classification, mechanisms, and lesions associated with asphyxial deaths in companion animals and highlights significant comparative differences of the response to various types of asphyxia in animals and people.",

      "abstract": "A dysmorphism is difference in a body structure. If the dysmorphia is truly the only abnormality that you see in the child, further evaluation is often unnecessary. Isolated dysmorphisms are typically caused by malformation (abnormal tissue development), deformation (distortion caused by a mechanic force), disruption (destruction of a normal forming structure), or dysplasia (anomaly of growth and differentiation). A patient with multiple dysmorphisms, however, typically requires further workup to arrive at the cause, which could be chromosomal, genetic, or environmental such as in utero exposure to teratogen or infection. 1 Making the diagnosis relies on recognizing the pattern of dysmorphisms. The 4 major patterns to consider are the following 2 : Association: Physical features that often occur together more often than would be seen by chance alone, but no single etiology is yet known to explain the pattern. Vertebral anomalies, anal atresia, cardiac defects, trachea esophageal fistula, renal anomalies, and limb anomalies (VACTERL) are examples of associations with no unifying etiology. Sequence: A group of defects that stem from a sequential set of events that began with one malformation. An example is Potter sequence with renal agenesis resulting in no fetal urine production, which leads to severe oligohydramnios with the consequences of lung hypoplasia and intrauterine constraint that cause limb deformities and compressed facial features. Syndrome: A cluster of anomalies that occur in a consistent pattern that has a unifying cause, known or unknown. Developmental field defect: A group of malformations caused by harm to a particular region of the embryo. An example is hemifacial microsomia, unilateral facial hypoplasia, and ear anomalies that come from anomalous development of the first and second brachial arch structures.",

In the writer's own case psychosis eventually encroached after real persecution, severe life stress and enhanced arousal and was prompted by an ascription of high distinctiveness to self and a low distinctiveness to others. The impact of coincidences generated and confirmed an interpretation of an externallocus of control. Abnormality ('illness') was reflected in a massive escalation of confirmation blas. It is argued that psychosis has its own intrinsic motivation; that life events must be understood in a developmental context; that cognitive factors, often critical, can sometimes be tied to emotional determinants and that gross damage to the self concept, with consequences for spiritual life, plays a causal role in psychosis. A genetic fragility, which biases ongoing emotional and cognitive life, is nonetheless strongly indicated.",

      "abstract": "In describing the symptoms arising from the derangement of the group of faculties last under consideration, namely, those termed moral, and with which man is specially endowed, as contrasted with the lower animals, it might have seemed natural to detail those morbid mental phenomena, which Prichard and others have so much dwelt upon when treating of moral insanity. But such a perverted condition of the moral sense is so almost invariably indicated, and often only discovered by the activity of the animal propensities, that it is more convenient to treat of it under the third class of mental disorders. It is likewise more consistent with our adopted principle of classification, which consists in referring each mental disorder to that group of faculties, the affection of which is essential to its manifestations. In homicidal mania, the animal propensities are of necessity called into action, whether the homicidal act be the result of their diseased action, in association with a healthy condition of the higher sentiments, or of their normal action when associated with, and therefore uncontrolled by, a state of the moral sense rendered powerless or feeble by disease; be it congenital or acquired, or the result of functional disorder or structural changes. We usually become cognizant of diseased mental conditions by positive, not by negative, symptoms; some overt act or explosion of passion will, in general, be the first proof of such disease of the moral sentiments, as involves their occlusion or inertness, when they ought to be in exercise. Should the disease be of such a nature as to increase the activity of these faculties, then we have an exhibition of religious excitement or ecstasy, a morbid condition already treated of.",

The differential diagnosis of OCD can be quite difficult since OCD symptomatology can occur as either primary or secondary phenomena. Comorbid depression or personality disorder is not uncommon in patients with primary OCD. Other comorbid conditions that occur with OCD can be divided into three major groups based on core features: (1) disorders of altered risk assessment; (2) incompleteness/habit-spectrum disorders; and (3) psychotic spectrum disorders. Such a categorization of core dimensions and comorbid conditions may prove useful in identifying distinct OCD subtypes that share underlying neurobiological or treatment response characteristics.",

Dalam kehidupan seseorang, menjadi sosok orang yang sempurna, dapat beraktivitas dan bersosialisasi secara baik dengan lingkungan dan orang lain tanpa adanya keterbatasan secara fisik adalah salah satu hal yang diinginkan setiap orang dalam hidupnya. Pada saat seseorang itu bisa melakukan itu semua dengan tanpa kendala atau keterbatasan fisik tersebut maka ia akan merasa sempurna secara fisik dibandingkan dengan orang lain yang mungkin memiliki kekurangan. Oleh karena itu, apabila ternyata terjadi sesuatu hal yang mengakibatkan seseorang itu harus kehilangan kebebasannya dalam beraktivitas dikarenakan keadaan fisik yang terganggu seperti pemasangan Ilizarov ini, ia akan merasa sedih dan setres. Hal tersebut dapat menjadi suatu stresor psikososial yang mempengaruhi jiwanya. Pada seseorang yang kurang kuat mentalnya, kejadian tersebut dapat sangat menggoncang jiwa sehingga ia dapat mengalami depresi. Tujuan penelitian ini untuk mengetahui gambaran depresi pada pasien dengan pemasangan Ilizarov di RSO Prof. DR. R.Soeharso Surakarta.

      "abstract": "Psychosomatic disorders in children and adolescents is a topic that covers a wide variety of illnesses and one which is difficult if not impossible to define accurately. In general, chronic emotional states, often nonspecific, serve as strong contributors to the development of a physical illness. The particular illness is often dictated by varying degrees of biological predisposition in one physiological system—i.e., such a predisposition in the respiratory system may lead to asthma or in the gastrointestinal system to ulcerative colitis. In some cases the biological factor is large and the emotional factor minimal, while in other cases the reverse is true. In the early days of research in psychosomatic disorders it was widely believed that each disorder was accompanied by certain specific emotional problems. Further study has shown this is not true. It was also felt that many, if not most of these disorders could be cured by psychotherapy, and this also has proven to be a fallacy. We have moved more and more to the team approach. Since both psyche and soma are involved, more than one specialist is usually required. In children and adolescents this may involve a child psychiatrist, a pediatrician, an allergist or gastroenterologist, a social worker and a psychologist. It requires time and patience to form an effective and smoothly functioning team in which all members respect one another's potential contribution. Some examples of team operation are presented and some of the problems outlined. In addition, there is attention given to the special problems of the adolescent and also the child with chronic nonspecific physical complaints as well as the child who requires hospitalization.",

Their proneness to somatization may result in medical overinvestigation that can add an iatrogenic component to their illnesses; and their ‘affect storms’ or difficulty in relinquishing unhealthy affect regulatory behaviours, such as alcohol abuse or binge eating, may lead to feelings of frustration, anger, and helplessness in their treating physicians, nurses, or psychotherapists.",

      "abstract": "There is a worse prognosis for psychosis and schizophrenia when onset is in childhood or adolescence. However, outcomes are improved with early detection and treatment. Psychotic symptoms can be associated with a variety of disorders including schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, drug-induced psychosis, personality disorder, epilepsy and autistic spectrum disorder. Positive symptoms include hallucinations and delusions. Negative symptoms include apathy, lack of drive, poverty of speech, social withdrawal and self-neglect. The DSM IV criteria for schizophrenia include two or more of the following: hallucinations, delusions, disorganised speech, grossly disorganised or catatonic behaviour and negative symptoms. Adults may raise concerns about social withdrawal, bizarre ideas, a change in behaviour or a decline in achievement. Most children and young people with psychotic symptoms will not go on to develop psychosis or schizophrenia. Direct enquiry may be needed to elicit suspected unusual beliefs or hallucinations. To distinguish unusual ideas from delusions the ideas should be tested for fixity. For example by asking: 'Are you sure? Could there be another explanation?' Mood and anxiety symptoms should be explored. The assessment should include a developmental history with particular attention to premorbid functioning. Failure to make expected progress whether personal, social or academic is significant. Better outcomes in terms of symptoms and social function are associated with a shorter duration of untreated psychosis. The detection of psychotic symptoms in primary care therefore warrants an urgent referral to secondary care mental health services for assessment and treatment.",

Stigmatization is related to prejudice, i.e. negative attitudes that are deeply rooted on false beliefs that schizophrenia cannot be treated. In principle, stigma is caused by combination of ignorance and fear which represents the basis of the creation of entrenched myths and prejudice. From a historical point of view, schizophrenia as a disease remains for public, one of the medical areas that are related to fear, a sense of discomfort, prejudice and avoidance. A combination of difficult mental disease, discrimination and stigmatization can be devastating for mentally disabled patients. Throughout history, stigma played significant role in patient's emotional and social isolation from other people deepening their suffering. A common consequence of stigma is discrimination which represents violation of basic human rights. Mentally disabled patients are often unjustifiably seen as dangerous, incapable, irresponsible which causes their isolation, homelessness and economic collapse. Thereby, possibilities for normal life, work, treatment, rehabilitation and social integration are decreased.",

      "abstract": "Physical fitness, achieved through regular exercise and/or spontaneous physical activity, confers resilience by inducing positive psychological and physiological benefits, blunting stress reactivity, protecting against potentially adverse behavioural and metabolic consequences of stressful events and preventing many chronic diseases. In this review, we discuss the biological mechanisms underlying the beneficial effects of physical fitness on mental and physical health. Physical fitness appears to buffer against stress-related disease owing to its blunting/optimizing effects on hormonal stress responsive systems, such as the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis and the sympathetic nervous system. This blunting appears to contribute to reduced emotional, physiological and metabolic reactivity as well as increased positive mood and well-being. Another mechanism whereby regular exercise and/or physical fitness may confer resilience is through minimizing excessive inflammation. Chronic psychological stress, physical inactivity and abdominal adiposity have been associated with persistent, systemic, low-grade inflammation and exert adverse effects on mental and physical health. The anti-inflammatory effects of regular exercise/activity can promote behavioural and metabolic resilience, and protect against various chronic diseases associated with systemic inflammation. Moreover, exercise may benefit the brain by enhancing growth factor expression and neural plasticity, thereby contributing to improved mood and cognition. In summary, the mechanisms whereby physical fitness promotes increased resilience and well-being and positive psychological and physical health are diverse and complex.",

The diseases Shohsa is found to be gradually increasing in the society, it has become one of the most common and challenging health problems.The diseases are affected by environment, occupation, psychology stress, dietary pattern, malnutrition, unnecessary fasting, addition and general debility. The disease Shosha is described in various Ayurvedic texts as well as non-medicalancient literature with its clinical features, pathology and treatment. Shosha have been described with its seven types according to tissue loss ( Dhatukshaya) by specific reasons and Kshaya of all functions of mind, body and speech are lost. This is the result of many other diseases, similarly many diseases also develops after them . Shosha is characterized mainly with Vyavaya, Shoka, Jara, Vyayama, Vrana, Adhwa, Upawasa and Urah-kshata , considering its features. It is found mainly primary and secondary. Secondary Shosha is a result of some other disease causing general emaciation of body. It is not necessary to label the Kshaya of all Dhatus as Shosha. Even the Kshaya of any individual Dhatu can cause this condition and can be considered as Shosha i.e. Primary. Shosha is a multisystem disease entity mainly with all the wasting complications, where the person gradually becomes a victim of Shosha . It is most common disorders affecting the population irrespective of age, sex, caste, occupation, socio-economic status etc. Shosha is a disease which is highly severe, difficult to diagnose and eliminate.

Pathological gambling destroys all aspects of life (bio-psycho-social); destroys family relationships, friendships, causing loss of job and integrity of an individual. Pathological gambling is 'calm', and often 'invisible problem', because individuals with pathological gambling problems don't have to show any visible signs or symptoms of a disease. This is why we can call it 'hidden disease', unlike alcohol which can be scent from a breath of a person. Family members react only during legal, financial and emotional crisis. Developed consequences put gambling into a group of public health problems; in 1980 the World Health Organization (WHO) define pathological gambling as a special mental disturbance, at which impulse control disturbance and/or behavior ( F-63) are developed. Family represents a primary support for development of an individual (from self-confidence till important interpersonal relationships), basic determinant of health which have influence on life of an individual and determine his/her health status and chance to survive. Pathological gambler can have a negative influence on other significant family members. Different researches have described negative social and health consequences of family members which have pathological gambling problems like: dysfunctional relationships filled with distrust, uncertainty and mutual accusations, loss of income, neglect of children, wife and commitments, and family violence and abuse. One segment of a National strategy must be focused on primary prevention - the earlier treatment of an individual and its family, as well as decreasing the negative impact caused by gambling. Initiative to open Family Counseling for pathological gambling problems represents an attempt to offer professional help to individuals and their family members in an early phase of a disease development, to identify and define problem, and to offer constructive solutions. In this text we will show data on some important indicators for family which ask for help.",

      "abstract": "Psychogenic gait is common in patients with medically unexplained neurological symptoms and provides significant challenges to healthcare providers. Clinicians may arrive at a correct diagnosis earlier if distinctive positive signs are identified and acknowledged. Psychogenic disorders of posture and gait are common and are the major manifestation in 8–10 % of patients with psychogenic movement disorders. Psychogenic movement disorders can present with varied phenomenology that may resemble organic movement disorders. The diagnosis is based on clinical evaluation with a supporting history and classic features on neurologic examination. In functional gait disorders, walking is often bizarre and does not conform to any of the usual patterns observed with neurologic gait disorders. Astasia-abasia, an inability to stand (astasia) or walk (abasia) in the absence of other neurologic abnormalities, was the term applied by investigators in the mid to late 19thcentury to describe certain patients with a frankly functional gait. Other descriptive terms include gaits that resemble walking on ice, walking a sticky surface, walking through water (bringing to mind excessive slowness), tightrope walking, habitual limping, and bizarre, robotic, knock-kneed, trepidant, anxious, and cautious gaits. Ancillary testing, such as imaging and neurophysiologic studies, can provide supplementary information but is not necessary for diagnosis.",

Cardiac diseases and especially myocardial infarction (MI) are among the diseases where psychiatric complications develop most often. In myocardial infarction, psychological problems as well as serious physical problems may appear in individuals who suffer from a disease which causes a threat for death and bodily image. Individuals, along with their personal characteristics, are influenced from such factors as depression, anxiety, stress, need for information related to disease, to manage disease under control and need for social support.

      "title": "Primera convulsión en apirexia",
      "abstract": "La informacion acerca de las caracteristicas del episodio critico generalmente es obtenida de un testigo casual, muchas veces un familiar, que vive el evento con mucha angustia y temor. Asimismo, los sucesivos interrogatorios pueden ir modificando el relato del episodio, afectando la calidad de la informacion obtenida. Por lo tanto, debe tenerse en cuenta la enorme importancia que tiene la realizacion de una historia clinica completa desde la primera consulta, en lo posible por un medico con conocimientos y experiencia clinica en el tema, y que la misma este orientada por el razonamiento clinico para poder formular los sucesivos diagnosticos en forma precisa. Cuando un nino tiene un episodio con manifestaciones clinicas que se inician y finalizan en forma mas o menos brusca, el mismo se clasifica como un evento paroxistico. Si se presume que dicho evento es el resultado de una descarga neuronal anormal y excesiva, se considera una crisis de mecanismo epileptico, diferenciandolo de otros tipos de eventos paroxisticos no epilepticos como los sincopes, los espasmos del sollozo, las migranas o las crisis psicogenas (conversivas o pseudocrisis). Cuando el evento paroxistico de mecanismo epileptico se caracteriza principalmente por contracciones musculares involuntarias, ya sean mantenidas (tonicas) o interrumpidas (clonicas), se le denomina crisis convulsiva o convulsion. Si las primeras manifestaciones clinicas de la convulsion orientan a que inicialmente se produjo una activacion neuronal anatomica o funcional de una parte de un hemisferio cerebral, la crisis se clasifica como parcial. Por el contrario, en las crisis generalizadas los primeros cambios clinicos indican un compromiso inicial sincronizado de ambos hemisferios, con perdida de conocimiento desde el inicio de la crisis, y no hay evidencia clinica, electroencefalografica o de otro tipo que sugiera un inicio focal o parcial. El siguiente paso es fundamental en la elaboracion diagnostica, y consiste en determinar si existe una probable causa aguda que pueda haber precipitado la convulsion. Estas causas agudas pueden ser neurologicas, como en el caso de los ninos que presentan una infeccion del sistema nervioso central (SNC) en curso (meningoencefalitis o encefalitis agudas), un tumor encefalico, o las crisis que ocurren en los siete dias siguientes a un accidente cerebrovascular o a un traumatismo craneoencefalico. Las crisis tambien pueden ser precipitadas por una causa sistemica como la fiebre en las convulsiones febriles, por causas metabolicas como las alteraciones electroliticas –que se pueden presentar, por ejemplo, en un lactante con una diarrea aguda–, u otras causas metabolicas como una hipoglucemia o la hipoxia, cualquiera sea su etiologia. Tambien puede precipitarse una crisis por la repercusion encefalica de la hipertension arterial, o por una intoxicacion que puede ser producida por medicamentos –teofilina, imipramina– o por drogas como el alcohol o la cocaina (o por su supresion brusca), o por exposicion a toxicos ambientales como el monoxido de carbono o los organofosforados. La presencia o ausencia de cualquiera de estas causas agudas permite clasificar las crisis en provocadas (tambien denominadas sintomaticas agudas u ocasionales) o no provocadas, respectivamente. Las crisis no provocadas pueden presentarse en ninos con una enfermedad neurologica previa que aumente sustancialmente el riesgo de crisis de mecanismo epileptico, como puede ser una encefalopatia no progresiva resultado de una lesion cerebral producida previamente por un sindrome hipoxico-isquemico, una meningoencefalitis o una encefalitis, una enfermedad cerebrovascular o un traumatismo de craneo grave. En estos casos, las crisis se denominan no provocadas o secundarias. Menos frecuentemente, las crisis no provocadas pueden presentarse en ninos portadores de un trastorno progresivo del SNC.

      "abstract": "The author fundamentally questions the traditional concept of the disease-entity (or several disease entities) of 'schizophrenia' and discusses an alternative concept, based on vulnerability and information-processing. According to this, schizophrenia-like psychotic phenomena develop in three phases. In the first, premorbid phase, combined biological (genetic and possibly other organic) and psycho-social influences lead to a premorbid 'vulnerability', characterised by a low tolerance of cognitive and emotional stress, corresponding to an insufficient capacity for the adequate processing of complex information. In the second phase, stressful life-events can lead to unique or repeated acute productive psychotic episodes. The third phase, that of long-term evolution, depends more on psycho-social influences than on biological factors. Under unfavourable conditions, it may lead to predominantly unproductive residual states of various degrees, which can largely be understood as regulatory mechanisms to restrict stressful over-stimulation. There is no clearly delimitable disease entity of schizophrenia with constant causes, psychopathological picture, or course, but rather a multi-conditioned life-process, occurring in people with a particular vulnerability, interacting with complex life-events and circumstances. This new concept has important consequences for therapy and prevention.",

Most people experiencing depression are treated in primary care. These treatments include various talking therapies and support to aid physical, psychological and social wellbeing. For people with moderate-to-severe depression, treatment with medication is recommended. This may be prescribed in addition to therapy and support. It is important that the person diagnosed with depression is monitored to assess how they respond to the antidepressants. A different type may need to be offered if response is poor or they have intolerable side effects.

Pseudodementia is a term used clinically to describe symptoms that resemble dementia but are caused by other conditions (most frequently depression), rather than being recognised as an official diagnosis. Pseudodementia is characterised by a cognitive impairment that mimics dementia but which does not have its origin in neurological degeneration, deriving instead from functional psychiatric conditions. This condition is more commonly observed in older adults (particularly those over the age of 50 or 60 years), and its risk factors overlap with those for depression. Pseudodementia is essentially characterised by deficits in memory, executive function and speech and, therefore, can easily be confused with dementia, although there are aspects that allow its differentiation. Diagnosing pseudodementia can be difficult, especially as there is significant overlap between its symptoms and those of other conditions. However, it is important to recognise characteristic aspects of this disorder, as its correct identification is essential for proper treatment.",

      "abstract": "Capgras syndrome is a distressing delusion found in a variety of neurological and psychiatric diseases where a patient believes that a family member, friend, or loved one has been replaced by an imposter. Patients recognize the physical resemblance of a familiar acquaintance but feel that the identity of that person is no longer the same. Here we describe a 73-year-old male with right posterior frontal and bilateral anterior-medial frontal damage from prior brain trauma with a similar delusion of an imposter replacing his pet cat. Misidentification syndromes for animals, as opposed to humans, have been rarely reported. Neuropsychological testing showed deficits in executive processing and memory retrieval with prominent intrusions and false positive responses. The delusional belief content in Capgras syndrome has been hypothesized to result from loss of an emotional or autonomic response to familiar stimuli, from theory of mind deficits, or from loss of self-environment distinctions. We instead propose that Capgras delusions result from a dysfunction in linking external stimuli with retrieved internal autobiographical memories pertaining to that object. This leads to an erroneously learned identity that persists as a specific delusional belief.",

      "title": "Various purposes of symptoms.",
      "abstract": "In medicine, a symptolTI is a condition that accompanies or results from a disease and serves as an aid to the diagnosis of such disease. The concept that a sympton1 may have a purpose is familiar to medicine. For example, the purpose of diarrhea is to expel the irritant from the digestive tract; of pain, to signify that something is wrong; of a cough, to remove foreign material from the trachea. Alfred Adler made the basic assumption that We cannot think, feel, will or act without the perception of some goal (I, p. 3). He considered the following statement an important proposition of Individual Psychology: Every psychic phenomenon, if it is to give us any understanding of a person, can only be grasped and understood if regarded as a preparation for some goal (I, p. 4). psychic symptom, like any other psychic phenomenon, has a purpose and can best be understood if its purpose is understood. It is sometimes easier to see symptoms as reactive behavior than as purposive. To illustrate, anxiety can be seen as a reaction to a perceived danger; depression, as a reaction to discouragement. However, in cases where such reactions are exaggerated or overly prolonged or inappropriate, this point of view does not give a clue to their understanding. Freud's point of view was that A symptom is a sign and a substitute for an instinctual gratification which has remained in abeyance; it is a consequence of the process of repression (6, p. 20). Sometimes the symptoms become valuable to the ego because they obtain for it, not certain advantages, but a narcissistic gratification which it would otherwise forego. Thus the obsessional uses his symptoms to feel better than others because he is specially cleanly or specially conscientious. Freud calls this the epinosic or secondary gain of the neurosis (6, p. 36). Thus, Freud also recognized that symptoms have a value to the patient, but he preferred to see them primarily as compromises with the instincts, and only secondarily as purpOSIve. In the eyes of the Individual Psychologist, the main significance of the symptom lies in its service to the individual in striving for his",

The term “functional” is beginning to replace “psychogenic” in many circumstances. This chapter discusses clinical features of functional neurological disorders in detail. Negative neurological symptoms like loss of consciousness, blindness, constriction of visual field, motor paralysis, and loss of pain sense are commonly seen in functional diseases, but positive symptoms like convulsion and involuntary movements are more common. Among others, functional movement disorders are not infrequent and have drawn particular attention in the recent years.

      "abstract": "Facial palsy is a neurological disorder triggered by dysfunction of the seventh cranial nerve, categorized as either central, between the cerebral cortex and brainstem nuclei, or peripheral, between the brainstem nuclei and peripheral organs. Central lesions cause impairment of the contralateral lower facial musculature with associated sparing of the forehead and ocular muscles. Conversely, peripheral lesions produce ipsilateral whole-sided facial hemiplegia including both forehead and ocular muscles. Facial palsy is diagnosed clinically, while imaging studies and additional subsidiary testing (e.g. electromyography, nerve conduction studies), serologies, and rarely biopsy can assist in confirming or refuting the working diagnosis. The differential diagnosis comprises Bell’s palsy (idiopathic), HIV infection, Ramsey Hunt syndrome, Lyme, sarcoidosis, amyloidosis, acoustic neuroma, parotid gland tumor, temporal bone biopsy, otitis media, Guillain-Barre syndrome, and brainstem infarct. Facial palsy is branded as Bell’s palsy if one of the aforementioned etiologies is not identified as the root cause. Herein, we report the case of a 58-year-old male, who presented with left facial weakness involving both the upper and lower face, posterior circulation symptoms in the setting of hypertensive emergency. Initial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was unrevealing for any acute process, however given lack of improvement repeat imaging was ordered. The patient was ultimately confirmed to have an acute versus subacute pontine infarct where the seventh and eighth cranial nerve exits at the cerebellopontine angle.

Conditions such as dementia raise the question of how much loss of memory and awareness there can be before there is, if ever, also a loss of the self. Syndromes such as Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID) or Multiple Personality Disorder (MPD) raise the possibility of a fragmentation of one self into a number of selves. Depersonalization disorder suggests a kind of diminution both of the sense of self and the reality of the world. Symptoms such as thought insertion suggest a different kind of fragmentation of the coherence of thought within a self.",

      "abstract": "The lack of “fit” between legal and medical concepts is perhaps best shown in the psychiatric disability of injured workmen. In the particular case discussed in this article, the problem is illustrated (1) in the long-standing preexistence of organic brain disease over many years, (2) in the occurrence of a heart attack from which the claimant recovered in “physical” terms. The heart attack forced a break in his employment and made his previously subclinical disability obvious to employer, wife, and the claimant himself. The resulting disability featured depression, anhedonia, and loss of identity, thus becoming primarily psychiatric in nature. No one of these disorders is “causally related” as a single entity; the problem is the outcome of a cumulative stress in a person made highly vulnerable through prior deterioration. Of particular import is the demonstration of “context-dependence”: workers depend for their own sense of identity and responsibility upon their occupation, and the loss of work becomes itself a “causal” factor.",

Women have a wide variety of responses when dealing with their own vulval pathology, which can range from apathy, ignoring neoplastic lesions for many years, to great anxiety about mild and benign symptoms. During the consultation with a patient with vulval symptoms, the physician should take note of nonverbal signs exhibited by the patient, which may indicate anxiety or other psychological issues. Questions about sexual satisfaction and desire can give valuable information and this could lead to the discovery of personal unresolved problems such as conflicts with the partner or preconceptions about their problem.",

      "abstract": "Stress is the body's response to any changes that might place it under mental, emotional, or physical strain and could either demand attention or prompt action. A stress reaction can be brought on by both internal and external factors. The conditions, demands, issues, and expectations you deal with every day are all regarded as external influences, as are your physical surroundings, your job, your contacts with others, your family, and all other related factors. The ability of your body to respond to and handle external stimuli depends on internal factors. Your ability to handle stress is influenced internally by your food habits, level of general health and fitness, mental health, and the amount of sleep and rest you get. Such demanding conditions could affect how certain stress hormone levels are regulated. Biomarkers such as mGlu2/3, 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), serum alpha-amylase, amygdala reactivity, neuropeptide Y (NPY), heat shock proteins, cortisol, and catecholamines are used to assess the hormone imbalance. Disease prevention, early detection, and therapy are all possible uses for biomarkers. In this review, we looked at a wide range of stress-related biomarkers that might cause different psychiatric illnesses and how those conditions can, over time, alter a person's lifestyle.",

Early identification of fall risk is likely to result in earlier implementation of intervention and to minimise development of secondary problems such as reduced confidence and activity levels. A comprehensive falls risk factor assessment should be performed for older people who present for medical attention after a fall, those who had more than one fall in the preceding year or those who have abnormalities of gait or balance. Falls are as a result of extrinsic risk factors, intrinsic risk factor or a combination of both. Syncope is defined as a transient, self limited loss of consciousness usually leading to a fall. Syncope and falls are often considered two separate entities with different aetiologies. Disorders affecting balance in the elderly are cerebral, cerebellar, spinal cord disorders; dementia; arrhythmias; postural hypotension; cerebrovascular disease; musculoskeletal/orthopaedic disorders; intervertebral disc disorders; psychological factors; visual impairment. Effective interventions include: (1) Health promotion and falls prevention. (2) Single interventions. (3) Medication review. (4) Exercise. (5) Home modifications. (6) To improve safety in the home. (7) To improve safety outside the home. Effective preventive strategies require better understanding of the causes of and risk factors for falling among elderly.",

Secondary movement disorders are conditions in which the movement disorder is an expression of an underlying disease that may include other signs and symptoms, and which may be due to an acquired injury, infection, toxin, or metabolic process. Most movement disorders in children are secondary. One of the particular complicating factors of movement disorders in childhood is that several different disorders may coexist in the same child, making diagnosis difficult. In addition, many different etiologies can lead to the same disorder, and the same etiology can lead to different movement disorders in different children, or in the same child at a different age. Nevertheless, a thorough understanding of the different types of movement disorder, their possible causes, and the different types of expression that may occur in children is essential to guiding clinical practice for both diagnosis and effective treatment.",

These symptoms affect perception (hallucinations), ideation, reality check (delusions), thought processes (lax associations), feelings (flat affect, inappropriate affect), attention, concentration, motivation, and judgment. There are no symptoms that alone are pathognomonic for schizophrenia. The characteristic symptoms of the disease are classified as positive, negative (or deficit) and disorganization. The lifetime prevalence of schizophrenia is estimated to be between 0.7 and 1.5%. It affects both sexes in a similar way.

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION Emotional disturbances may have a profound effect on the circulation, causing changes in the heart rate, cardiac output (1 and 2), blood pressure, tone of peripheral vessels, and the electrocardiogram (3). This is particularly true of the emotional state which may develop in persons who find themselves in a hazardous situation.
