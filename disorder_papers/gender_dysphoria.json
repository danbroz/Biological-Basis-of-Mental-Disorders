      "title": "[The sex of the child, the sex of the doll].",
      "abstract": "We wanted to describe the playful behavior of young children of both sexes from two and a half to six years of age who have been given a set of toys evoking motherhood. A girl doll or a boy doll was among the toys. Analysis points up two factors that allow us to explain the relative differences in behavior as noted in girls and boys while playing: The first factor is what we'll call the positive experience of mothering (girls play more than boys, older children are more involved than younger ones); a second factor, called a distant, defensive attitude, probably more closely characterizes boys with a girl doll (distance, aggressivity). The most positive \"mothering\" (various activities and outward tenderness) in a sub-group of older girls playing with a boy-doll. The doll's sex appears to be a determining element in child behavior. More general remarks are brought up regarding the theoretical questions of how the child perceives the beginning of the parents' role and how a sexual identity in the largest sense of the word are inter-related. The problem of a child's wants are also considered, inasmuch as they might come up in the cultural, social and psychological dimensions of childhood.",

      "abstract": "Male and female age-cohorts resemble each other quite clearly in their sport involvement. The greatest differences between men and women are shown to be in organized and competitive sports mainly practiced by men, and in so-called \"untied\" movement (i.e. physical exercise that does not require any pre-arrangements), more of a female domain. The various age-cohorts differ in sport involvement from each other more among men than among women. This is examined from several angles: as a question of role or gender expectations, of different life-situations and possibilities, of different meanings and contents of sport and movement, and of different sport cultures and myths.",

      "abstract": "\"Little boys play with dump trucks and little girls play with dolls.\" A stereotype for sure, but persistent because children do seem to display sex-based toy preferences, though, of course, some girls prefer dump trucks and some boys prefer dolls. At an early age, these role reversals are often discouraged—girls and boys may be verbally or physically bullied when they don't conform to what other children (and adults) think they should play with. Parental permission must be secured, and in some instances, a parent or guardian may be required to be with the child during the experiment. Another consideration is realizing the natural limitations of children (in terms of boredom, fatigue, energy level, etc.). Hormones may affect toy choices indirectly, perhaps through an influence on activity level, motor skills, abilities, or temperament. Further, natural variations in levels or availability of testosterone among normal males and females might contribute to individual differences in sex-typed behavior.",

      "title": "Israeli kindergarten children's gender constancy for others' counter-stereotypic toy play and appearance: the role of sibling gender and relative age",
      "abstract": "Abstract To test divergent theoretical predictions as to the impact of having a younger or older, same‐sex sibling or opposite‐sex sibling on other gender constancy, Israeli kindergarten children in two‐child families responded to a gender constancy task in which a male and female picture target engaged in counter‐stereotypic toy play and adopted counter‐stereotypic appearance. Children were also asked whether the target child could change sex at will and to explain the difference between boys and girls. Relative age of sibling, both independently and in interaction with participant sex, was associated with greater gender constancy in the face of counter‐stereotypic toy play. Relative age of sibling and sibling sex was independently associated with greater gender constancy in the face of counter‐stereotypic appearance. In both cases, children with a younger sibling evidenced greater gender constancy. Boys, especially ones with a male sibling, referred most explicitly to target's birth sex in accounting for his or her being unable to change sex at will. Genital and anatomical differences between boys and girls were cited more often by children who referred explicitly to target's birth sex and had a younger sibling. The results were discussed in the context of theories of gender development and the socialization of gender within the family. Copyright © 2008 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.",

      "abstract": "Abstract: Children ages 6–7 and 9–10 and emerging adults ( n = 115) judged whether a character should approach a group of peers when they had a gender-neutral, gender-norm-consistent, or gender-norm-inconsistent activity. They also provided justifications and judgments about whether the character would be teased. Approaching peers with a gender-norm-inconsistent activity was judged as unacceptable, and participants also anticipated the protagonist would be teased. Justifications indicated that all ages tended to consider gender norms when activities were gendered, but personal preference when activities were gender neutral. Participants anticipated that friends would be less likely to tease than strangers. Girls/women and the youngest age groups (6–7) were most likely to indicate that being teased would prevent the character from engaging in the activity in the future.",

The Relationships of Parental Expectations and Preschool Children's Verbal Sex Typing to Their Sex-typed Toy Play Behavior. CHILD DEVELOPMENT, 1980, 51, 266-270. Parents of 52 preschool-age children predicted how frequently their children would play with each of 12 adultdefined sex-typed and neutral toys. Each child played 10 min with the toys; 32 of the children verbally rated the toys as to sex appropriateness. Children sex-typed the toy groups in the expected cultural directions but with lower agreement than adults; younger children assigned fewer toys exclusively to the opposite sex than did older children. Girls played longer with neutral and equally long with feminine and masculine toys; boys played longer with masculine and equally long with feminine and neutral toys. With increasing age, both sexes played longer with feminine toys; no age differences were found for masculine and neutral toys. The children were highly concordant in their verbal sex typing and play; younger children played with a smaller proportion of self-defined sex-inappropriate toys, but there were no age differences in proportion of playtime spent with these toys. Parents expected their children to play with culturally defined sex-appropriate toys, but in general their predictions were not accurate.",

      "title": "Academic and Behavioral Problems of Boys in Elementary School",
      "abstract": "The development of a boy's sex role begins shortly after birth when he is assigned certain colors due to his gender. By the time the boy is eighteen months old, adults are expecting clear sex differences in his behavior. Subtle and not so subtle pressure is put on the child to produce sex differences. The pressure is from a wide variety of sources such as type of toys purchased, clothing provided, decoration of his room, and his interactions with family members and other significant adults. Consequently the boy's preference for guns, wheeled toys, running, and aggressive play appears at or before age three. By the time the boy enters elementary school at age six, he has a strong notion of the masculine behaviors expected of him. Modification of sex roles to accommodate the expectations of the school is one of the more difficult tasks facing elementary school aged boys. As they enter school, boys are required to assume a second role, that of a student. However, the behaviors implicit in many boys' sex roles are oppositional to the behaviors required in the student role. The conflict results in the boy not successfully assuming the student role, and may result in the boy being identified as having an academic and/or behavioral problem. Considerable research indicates that a large percentage of boys are experiencing difficulties in the schools. The present article will explore the reasons boys are involved in such frequent problems in school, and will make recommendations for persons working with elementary school aged boys.",

People with low overall trait self-control and/or whose self-control strength had been depleted by recent, nonsexual acts were less likely than other people to stifle inappropriate sexual thoughts and to resist the temptation to engage in sexual activities with someone other than their primary relationship partner. They also engaged in more extensive sexual activity in the laboratory with their dating partner and they reported more undercontrolled or impulsive sexual behavior generally. Furthermore, there was some evidence that the effects of diminished self-control were strongest among those with the strongest sexual desires (men and sexually unrestricted individuals) and among couples with less sexual experience.",

Children (mean age = 52 months) were observed during their free play. Data revealed that boys' same‐sex play was more active‐forceful, further from adults, and more stereotyped than girls' play, and that this pattern was generally exaggerated in groups versus dyads. Children rarely played only with children of the other sex (other‐sex peers), but about one fourth of their interactions involved children of both sexes (mixed‐sex peers). Compared with same‐ or dyadic other‐sex play, mixed‐sex play was more likely to occur near adults, and was intermediate in active‐forceful and stereotyped activity choices. Findings confirmed that children's experiences in peer groups vary depending on the sex of the child and sex of play partners.",

      "title": "Chance, Time Allocation, and The Evolution of Adaptively Flexible Sex Role Behavior",
      "abstract": "An alternative to classic sexual selection hypotheses for sex differentiated pre-mating behavior is that time available for mating-as individuals experience it-along with fitness differences among alternative potential mates, induces choosy versus indiscriminate mating behavior. This alternative hypothesis says that selection has acted so that all individuals flexibly express fitness-enhancing choosy, indiscriminate, and competitive mating behavior, induced by time-varying life histories, environmental and social cues. Key predictions of DYNAMATE, the formal model of adaptively flexible sex role behavior of individuals of both sexes within dynamically changing populations, include: (1) All individuals regardless of sex assess likely fitness outcomes from mating with alternative potential mates before expressing choosy or indiscriminate behavior. (2) Males and females express adaptively flexible, choosy and indiscriminate behavior so that individuals may change their behavior-from moment to moment-to fit dynamically changing circumstances. (3) Indiscriminate behavior of males and (4) choosy behavior of females would often be maladaptive even in species with greater female than male parental investment, when females have longer latencies to receptivity to re-mating than males, and when the relative reproductive rate of males is greater than in females. (5) Whether or not females show choosy behavior will not affect whether or not males exhibit choosy or indiscriminate behavior, and vice versa. (6) When other model parameters are equal, the proportion of individuals of a given sex expressing choosy or indiscriminate mating behavior is a function of the distribution of fitness ratios (a distribution of all fitness differences that would be conferred on an individual by mating with any two sequentially or simultaneously encountered alternative potential mates). (7) Whether same-sex individuals behaviorally compete is a function of the fitness that would be conferred if the strategist won access to a potential mate, but not a function of relative reproductive rate or its proxy, the operational sex ratio. We call for re-evaluation of sex differences in choosy, indiscriminate, and competitive behavior under strong experimental controls that level the ecological playing fields of males and females, i.e., under experimental conditions informing the mechanisms of phenotypic expression. We end with comments on the classic question of questions: why are the sexes as they are?",

      "abstract": "At around their third birthday, children begin to enforce social norms on others impersonally, often using generic normative language, but little is known about the developmental building blocks of this abstract norm understanding. Here, we investigate whether even toddlers show signs of enforcing on others interpersonally how “we” do things. In an initial dyad, 18‐month‐old infants learnt a simple game‐like action from an adult. In two experiments, the adult either engaged infants in a normative interactive activity (stressing that this is the way “we” do it) or, as a non‐normative control, marked the same action as idiosyncratic, based on individual preference. In a test dyad, infants had the opportunity to spontaneously intervene when a puppet partner performed an alternative action. Infants intervened, corrected, and directed the puppet more in the normative than in the non‐normative conditions. These findings suggest that, during the second year of life, infants develop second‐personal normative expectations about their partner's behavior (“You should do X!”) in social interactions, thus making an important step toward understanding the normative structure of human cultural activities. These simple normative expectations will later be scaled up to group‐minded and abstract social norms.",

      "title": "The psychosexual development of urban lesbian, gay, and bisexual youths",
      "abstract": "An examination of cognitive sexual orientation, sexual partner activity, and sexual identity was conducted among 76 lesbian/bisexual female youths and 80 gay/bisexual male youths (age range of 14–21 years) recruited from community‐based or college organizations for lesbian / gay youths in New York City. Self‐identification as lesbian / gay or bisexual changed over time; more than half the youths who identified as lesbian / gay at the interview had considered themselves bisexual in the past, and vice versa. A modal developmental sequence of cognitions and behaviors was found: Most youths first became aware of a cognitive sexual orientation (e.g., attractions and fantasies) toward the same or other sex, then considered a lesbian / gay or bisexual identity, and finally felt certain of a lesbian / gay or bisexual identity. Age at initiation of sexual activity with females or males was inconsistently related to this pattern. Significant gender differences indicated that females were older than males when they first considered (M years of 13.9 and 12.5, respectively) or were certain of (M years of 15.9 and 14.6 years, respectively) being lesbian/gay. The majority of youths had a history of sexual activity with the same sex (88% of females and 95% of males) and the other sex (80% of females and 56% of males). The youths became sexually active during the early adolescent years, both with the same sex and the other sex. Their sexual practices, with the same and other sex, followed an initiation sequence beginning with manual (i.e., hand‐genital) sex during the early teens and ending with anal practices during the middle and late teens. No significant gender differences were found in lifetime prevalence rates or ages at initiating sexual practices with the same sex. Gender differences were found for other‐sex partners: Females became sexually active at an older age than did males, and more females than males engaged in heterosexual activity. No significant differences in the psychosexual variables were found among Black, Hispanic, White, and youths of other ethnic backgrounds.",

The children's emotional, behavioural and overall play responses were rated Whilst the dolls’ difference from other dolls was dearly noticed, they did not traumatize the children, most of whom incorporated the dolls in imaginative play. Only five children's play with the dolls showed any sexualized quality, in three the source of sexual knowledge becoming apparent. Whereas the absence of sexualized play does not reliably exclude abuse, we suggest that explicit sexual play with the dolls may well arise from previous exposure: to explicit sexual information or activity.",

      "abstract": "The onset and development of preschoolers' awareness of sex role stereotypes, gender labeling, gender identity, and sex-typed toy preference were explored in 26-, 31-, and 36-month-old children. Gender labeling, gender identity, sex-typed toy preferences, and awareness of adult sex role differences were observed in significantly more 26-month-old children than would have been expected by chance. Verbal gender labeling was observed in a majority of 26-month-olds, while verbal and nonverbal gender identity were observed in a majority of 31-month-olds. Nonverbal gender labeling and awareness of adult sex role differences were observed in a majority of children by 36 months. No evidence of awareness of sex differences in children's toys was found in the majority of children at any age. Awareness of sex role differences in children's toys was not related to awareness of adult sex role differences. Brighter children were more aware of adult sex role differences. Sex-typed toy preference was not related to awareness of sex role differences but was related to gender identity. Predictors of sex role development included the mothers' employment, and the father's personality traits, attitudes toward women, and sex-typed activities in the home. Implications for theories of early sex role development are discussed.",

Children directed more social behavior-both positive and negative-to same-sex playmates than to opposite-sex ones. Girls paired with boys were more likely to stand passively watching their partners, or to withdraw toward their mothers, than boys in any pairing or girls playing with girls. Sequential analysis disclosed that boys were unlikely to respond to the vocal prohibitions of girls, while partners did respond to such prohibitions in other pairings. Statistical issues in measuring dyadic interaction are discussed, as are the implications of the findings for children's self-segregation by sex in play groups.",

      "abstract": "The following three devices were used with a sample of 226 children: (1) The 'Ideal Person' Test, where the child names the person he would most wish to be like and gives reasons for his choice; (2) The 'Moral Wickedness' Test, where the subject describes what he considers to be the most 'wicked' deeds; (3) The 'Moral Incidents' Test, where ten hypothetical situations, involving honesty, loyalty, responsibility and punishment, are presented together with alternative methods of meeting them. The results were analysed in relation to sex and intelligence as assessed by the Stanford‐Binet Scale. The majority of children chose as their ideal characters personally unknown to them. Both sexes tended to choose male figures but boys mentioned a relatively greater proportion of characters associated with war, adventure, politics and sport, whereas girls chose a higher proportion of people distinguished because of moral or religious qualities. Less able children more often named as their ideal someone from their immediate circle of relatives or friends and gave fewer reasons for their choice than the more intelligent group. The most frequently mentioned 'wicked deeds' were murder, physical cruelty, stealing and cruelty to animals. Though the sexes showed considerable unanimity in their list of wicked actions, a higher proportion of girls than boys considered stealing, cruelty to animals, lying and swearing to be wicked. The most intelligent group produced a greater number and variety of morally wicked actions. The findings from the 'Moral Incidents' Test suggest that straightforward moral issues are readily understood by children but that the duller child's moral judgment is prone to become confused or blurred in the face of complexity or subtlety.",

Measures of sexual nonrestraint and sexual expression are compared for boys and girls in childhood and adolescence. A measure of sexual freedom was created by summing sexual expression and sexual nonrestraint. The authors predict and show that measures of sexual behavior in childhood and adolescence will have a stronger correlation in societies where differentiation from childhood is low. Most societies impose more restraint in later childhood than in earlier childhood and in adolescence rather than in childhood matching restraint with physiological maturation of children. Most societies show no sex differences in sexual freedom but those which do generally show more freedom for boys than girls. Societies tend to have greater differentiation from childhood to adolescence for boys than for girls. In other studies not limited to adolescence sexual freedom in adolescence was highly correlated with measures of premarital sexual behavior.",

      "abstract": "The syndrome of male transsexualism is characterized by a life-long preference for the feminine role, predicated on the conviction of belonging to the female sex. This conviction is held and persists despite the painfully obvious fact of normal male anatomy and genitalia, before and after puberty, and in the absence of delusional ideation or psychosis in the majority of transsexuals studied. He is disgusted with the development of his primary and secondary sexual characteristics, to the point where the male transsexual frequently contemplates and occasionally performs self-mutilation of his genitalia. He prefers normal, heterosexual men as sexual partners, and rejects homosexual men or the idea that his sexual activity is homosexual. Feeling he belongs to the female gender, he considers it appropriate to have a love relationship with a man, and he feels “unnatural” in a relationship with a woman, considering this “homosexual.” There is some evidence that sex or overt sexual activity, whether it be considered homosexual or heterosexual, plays a minor or secondary role. The transsexual may decide to pass and become accepted as a female, either before or after sex reassignment surgery, depending upon individual circumstances. The postoperative results of 121 male transsexuals who have obtained sex reassignment surgery are reviewed. A satisfactory outcome, as indicated by improved social and emotional adjustment, is 10 times more likely than an unsatisfacory result. Improvement is enhanced if the transsexual has functional use of an artificial vagina, obtains a legal change of gender status and freely passes in society as a member of the opposite sex. At the present time one is impressed with the lack of success in attempting to alter gender identity, once established, by traditional psychotherapy. This fact, together with the apparent success of sex reassignment surgery, compels one to accept the surgical treatment of transsexualism on an experimental basis until the initial results can be verified or contradicted or until alternative treatment procedures prove successful.",

      "title": "Compulsive sexual behaviour disorder in the ICD‐11",
      "abstract": "During the last decade, there has been heated debate regarding whether compulsive sexual behaviour should be classified as a mental/behavioural disorder. Compulsive sexual behaviour disorder has been proposed for inclusion as an impulse control disorder in the ICD-111. It is characterized by a persistent pattern of failure to control intense, repetitive sexual impulses or urges, resulting in repetitive sexual behaviour over an extended period (e.g., six months or more) that causes marked distress or impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning. The pattern is manifested in one or more of the following: a) engaging in repetitive sexual activities has become a central focus of the person's life to the point of neglecting health and personal care or other interests, activities and responsibilities; b) the person has made numerous unsuccessful efforts to control or significantly reduce repetitive sexual behaviour; c) the person continues to engage in repetitive sexual behaviour despite adverse consequences (e.g., repeated relationship disruption, occupational consequences, negative impact on health); or d) the person continues to engage in repetitive sexual behaviour even when he/she derives little or no satisfaction from it. Concerns about overpathologizing sexual behaviours are explicitly addressed in the diagnostic guidelines proposed for the disorder. Individuals with high levels of sexual interest and behaviour (e.g., due to a high sex drive) who do not exhibit impaired control over their sexual behaviour and significant distress or impairment in functioning should not be diagnosed with compulsive sexual behaviour disorder. The diagnosis should also not be assigned to describe high levels of sexual interest and behaviour (e.g., masturbation) that are common among adolescents, even when this is associated with distress. The proposed diagnostic guidelines also emphasize that compulsive sexual behaviour disorder should not be diagnosed based on psychological distress related to moral judgments or disapproval about sexual impulses, urges or behaviours that would otherwise not be considered indicative of psychopathology. Sexual behaviours that are egodystonic can cause psychological distress; however, psychological distress due to sexual behaviour by itself does not warrant a diagnosis of compulsive sexual behaviour disorder. Careful attention must be paid to the evaluation of individuals who self-identify as having the disorder (e.g., calling themselves \"sex addicts\" or \"porn addicts\"). Upon examination, such individuals may not actually exhibit the clinical characteristics of the disorder, although they might still be treated for other mental health problems (e.g., anxiety, depression). Additionally, individuals often experience feelings such as shame and guilt in relationship to their sexual behaviour2, but these experiences are not reliably indicative of an underlying disorder. The proposed diagnostic guidelines also assist the clinician in differentiating compulsive sexual behaviour disorder from other mental disorders and other health conditions. For example, although bipolar disorder has been found at elevated rates among individuals with compulsive sexual behaviour disorder3, sexual behaviours must be persistent and occur independently of hypomanic or manic episodes to provide a basis for a possible diagnosis of the disorder. A diagnosis of compulsive sexual behaviour disorder should not be made when the behaviour can be explained by other medical conditions (e.g., dementia) or by the effects of certain medications prescribed to treat specific medical conditions (e.g., Parkinson's disease)4 or is entirely attributable to the direct effects of illicit substances on the central nervous system (e.g., cocaine, crystal methamphetamine). Currently, there is an active scientific discussion about whether compulsive sexual behaviour disorder can constitute the manifestation of a behavioural addiction5. For ICD-11, a relatively conservative position has been recommended, recognizing that we do not yet have definitive information on whether the processes involved in the development and maintenance of the disorder are equivalent to those observed in substance use disorders, gambling and gaming6. For this reason, compulsive sexual behaviour disorder is not included in the ICD-11 grouping of disorders due to substance use and addictive behaviours, but rather in that of impulse control disorders. The understanding of compulsive sexual behaviour disorder will evolve as research elucidates the phenomenology and neurobiological underpinnings of the condition7. In the absence of consistent definitions and community-based epidemiological data, determining accurate prevalence rates of compulsive sexual behaviour disorder has been difficult. Epidemiological estimates have ranged up to 3-6% in adults8, though recent studies have produced somewhat lower estimates of 1 to 3%9. The more restrictive diagnostic requirements proposed for ICD-11 would be expected to produce lower prevalence rates. In general, men exhibit the disorder more frequently than women, although robust data examining gender differences are lacking. Additionally, higher rates of the disorder have been noted among individuals with substance use disorders. Among treatment seekers, the disorder negatively impacts occupational, relationship, physical health and mental health functioning. However, systematic data are lacking regarding the prevalence of the disorder across different populations and associated socio-cultural and socio-demographic factors, including among non-treatment seekers. Growing evidence suggests that compulsive sexual behaviour disorder is an important clinical problem with potentially serious consequences if left untreated. We believe that including the disorder in the ICD-11 will improve the consistency with which health professionals approach the diagnosis and treatment of persons with this condition, including consistency regarding when a disorder should not be diagnosed. Legitimate concerns about overpathologizing sexual behaviours have been carefully addressed in the proposed diagnostic guidelines. We posit that inclusion of this category in the ICD-11 will provide a better tool for addressing the unmet clinical needs of treatment seeking patients as well as possibly reduce shame and guilt associated with help seeking among distressed individuals. The proposed diagnostic guidelines will be tested in international multilingual Internet-based field studies using standardized case material, which will help to assess the generalizability of the construct across different regions and cultures, and clinicians' ability to distinguish it from normal variations in sexual behaviour and from other disorders. Additional field studies in clinical settings will provide further information about the clinical utility of the proposed diagnostic guidelines for the disorder among clinical populations. Shane W.

      "abstract": "Abstract The purpose of this research was to identify behaviors in addition to those of an explicitly sexual or romantic nature that men and women define as unfaithful acts in the context of committed dating relationships. We also sought to identify possible gender differences in the proportions of men and women who have engaged in these unfaithful behaviors while in dating relationships. We examined 219 college men's and women's reported involvement in sexual behaviors, romantic attachments, sexual and nonsexual fantasies, sexual attraction, romantic attraction, flirting, and social participation in dyads and groups with someone other than their current or past dating partner. A sizable proportion of both men and women reported engaging in one or more of the behaviors at some point in their dating history. Proportionately more men than women indicated having engaged in sexual fantasies of various types about someone other than their primary partner and reported \"hitting on\" someone else while in a dating relationship. No other gender differences emerged. A unique aspect of this study is that we asked young men and women to determine what kinds of behaviors they considered to be unfaithful rather than only examining sexual and emotional behaviors as has been the case in past research. Further, the few significant gender differences we found indicates that the convergence of men's and women's attitudes about sexuality may now be show in their behavior.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Child sexual abuse is typically defined as any sort of sexual contact between a child and an adult (or significantly older teenager), including sexual solicitation of, or exposure to, a child by an older person. It may include unwanted and inappropriate physical contact with the child's genitals; sexual touching, manipulation, or fondling; penetration in terms of vaginal, oral, or anal intercourse or attempted intercourse; as well as exposing children to sexual images or forcing them to watch pornography or to witness adult sexual acts. Child sexual abuse can vary along a number of dimensions, including pattern, frequency, duration, age at onset, and relationship of victim to perpetrator. Experience with and exposure to sexual abuse in childhood are particularly associated with long‐term psychological effects and profoundly shape victims' lives well into adulthood by increasing the probability of negative psychological outcomes such as poor self‐esteem, lack of a sense of control or agency, and associated mental disorders. The level of harm may be affected by multiple factors such as duration and frequency of abuse, use of force, and penetration, and the social stigma of child sexual abuse often compounds the psychological harm to children.",

      "abstract": "Sex assignment of children born with ambiguous genitalia is a difficult and responsible decision based on limited empirical evidence regarding future development of gender identity/role, sexual orientation, and sexual functioning. Sex of assignment and rearing has appeared to be a prognosticator of future gender identity, usually better than the other criteria of sex (chromosomes, gonadal tissue, prenatal and postnatal hormonal profiles). The decision to assign a sex is guided by the prognosis of the ``optimal'' sex for the newborn, of which the elements are an overall sex-appropriate appearance with a stable gender identity; good sexual function, preferably combined with reproductive function if attainable; minimal medical procedures; and a reasonably happy life given the limitations. The limited follow-up studies indicate that this is a reasonable policy, although a limited number of subjects will experience gender dysphoria later in life and will cross over to the other sex. This is more often the case in subjects assigned to the female sex with considerable prenatal or postnatal androgen exposure. Children in this predicament must receive guidance well into adulthood. It may be difficult to engage in sexual relations when the anatomy of the genitalia (often operated upon) is not fully normal.",

      "abstract": "A majority of the men interviewed were predominantly attracted to <italic>women</italic>, not men. They described complicated situations and feelings that reworked sex with men as necessary and compatible with straight identification and masculinity. Several reported having sexual kinks for penises but not sexual attractions to men. About three quarters reported unintentional changes to their sexual attractions or desires as they grew older. Additionally, over a third reported that their wives lost interest in sex, sometimes because it became painful or uncomfortable. Most preferred women for romantic partnerships, but were wary of casual hookups with women. The trait they felt made women better romantic partners—emotional compatibility—also made many uncomfortable with women as hookup partners, as they felt that women would become too attached. This was especially true for married men, most of whom did not want to threaten their marriage by having sex with another woman. Others had sex with men specifically to form nonromantic connections with men, such as to relieve loneliness or satisfy a need for touch. Several had sex with men to relieve the pressures of masculinity. Having another man penetrate them allowed some men to experience pleasure without having to be in control.",

Physical aggression in girls is much less common, and other behavioral predictors of rejection in girls have not been well documented. We investigated the relationship between three behaviors (physical aggression, relational aggression, and prosocial behaviors) and three social outcomes (peer rejection, acceptance, and reciprocal friendships) in thirdand sixth-grade girls and boys. Significant gender differences in physical aggression and prosocial behaviors were found at both grade levels. Regression analyses demonstrated the gender-specific role of relational ag gression. Among girls, but not boys, relational aggression explained variance in rejection beyond that explained by overt aggression. We further found that most children, even the most aggressive, had at least one reciprocal friend.",

      "title": "Men’s Intrasexual Competition",
      "abstract": "Sex differences in obligatory parental investment and reproductive potential cause human females to desire high-quality men as partners. For men, this means that to achieve reproductive success, they must 1) combat other men to gain access to or retain mates, and to guard the resources women need for reproduction and child care, and/or 2) attract women by displaying (sexual) ornamentations or direct provision of resources. These pressures have shaped men’s physiology, as well as mating-related and other behaviors, and result in intense male–male intrasexual competition. In this chapter, I provide an overview of men’s intrasexual competitiveness, first detailing several important concepts, before focusing on the major domains of these competitions. The research reviewed shows that physical formidability and social status are central to human male–male competition – although qualitatively different, these dimensions are intertwined, such that formidable men are more likely to excel in physical combat and competition, and as a result attain higher social status and, ultimately, increased reproductive success. Men use an array of tactics to compete with same-sex rivals, ranging from direct aggression and physical contests (e.g., in sports or fights) to (verbal) competitor derogation, and the conspicuous flaunting of possessions, leisure activities, and helping behaviors. Finally, yet importantly, research on the context-dependent fluctuations in men’s testosterone levels sheds light on the underlying processes of male intrasexual competition. Specifically, increases in testosterone are observed both in preparation for and as a result of male–male competitions, and a sharp decline in testosterone after entering in a long-term romantic relationship or during fatherhood suggest a down-regulation of these competitive tendencies.",

      "abstract": "Many theories about play and the “reasons” investigators give for children’s play have slighted sex or gender differences to focus on the linguistic/cognitive and social skill developmental advantages that play offers. Play helps young children clarify and articulate similarities and differences in concepts and categories. Parental expectations from birth onward provide powerful incentives, both as direct reinforcers and models, for sharply divergent gender-role behaviors. The meaning of sex differences in play becomes profound for promoting divergence in developing interpersonal skills in contrast to skillful manipulation of objects in the physical world. Some theorists suggest that cognitive growth during the early years is deeply implicated in the marked separation by sex in play groups. Girls, compared with boys, also engage in different kinds of pretend or sociodramatic role-play. Sexual play that involves dominating or assaulting another child must be firmly forbidden, discussed, and handled by adults who establish clear boundaries and keep children safe from hurt.",

This study devised a scale to measure consensual unwanted sex and explored its relationship with several characteristics (i.e., sexual self-efficacy, sexual assertiveness, sex refusal skill, sex motives, and conflict style) that may contribute to consenting to sex contrary to one's desire. Participants recalled sexual compliance in adolescent dating relationships. Results revealed that decreased consent to unwanted sex was related to increased sexual self-efficacy, sex refusal, partner approval, and an obliging conflict style in females. For males, consensual unwanted sex in adolescence was associated with younger age at sex initiation and having sex for physical gratification.",

Yet little research has examined sexual and emotional satisfaction outside of the committed relationship context. Further, most satisfaction research has focused exclusively on heterosexual samples. The present study aimed to investigate sexual and emotional satisfaction derived from seven sexual relationship contexts and note similarities or differences based on gender and sexual orientation. Data were drawn from an online survey of 6,955 sexually diverse participants. Sexual satisfaction was stronger than emotional satisfaction within casual sex contexts (one night stand, first date, sex with a friend, and hookups) than within more committed contexts (married, living together, committed unmarried relationship). Men found all contexts except for sex in a committed unmarried relationship significantly more sexually and emotionally satisfying than women. Emotional and sexual satisfaction were significantly different across sexual orientation groups in casual sexual relationship contexts but not in more committed relationship contexts. Gay men reported gaining the most sexual and emotional satisfaction out of casual sex contexts, with lesbian women reporting the least out of casual sexual contexts. Overall, this research found that a wide variety of relationship contexts, including casual sexual contexts, can be a source of both sexual and emotional satisfaction.",

They were asked first what they would like to be when they grew up and second what they would like to be if they were members of the opposite sex. An examination of the traditionality of occupational choices revealed that significantly more females than males stated personal preferences for nontraditional occupations (i.e., occupations socially identified with the opposite sex of the S or with neither sex). Moreover, when projecting choices for the opposite sex, females generally selected traditional occupations for males, while a significant number of males nominated nontraditional occupations for females. The findings suggest that children of both sexes assume that males will enter careers that are sex-typed, while females may enter either sex-typed or non-sex-typed careers.",

Extending prior work highlighting differences in SSS between discrete sexual orientation identity groups, we investigated associations between multiple aspects of SSS and attraction patterns among 602 young adults with a range of sexual orientations. Generally, there were more similarities than differences in SSS across individuals with monosexual vs. bisexual patterns of attraction. However, a few significant effects emerged, with significant differences across sex/gender. For women, the greatest differences were seen between romantic self-schema in women with asexual vs. non-asexual patterns of attractions, while women with bisexual attractions were relatively similar to those with monosexual attractions (either exclusively heterosexual or same-sex/gender attracted). For men, however, the greatest differences were seen between open/liberal self-schema in exclusively same-sex/gender attracted men vs. either bisexual or heterosexually attracted men. Broadly, these findings point to subtle sex/gender differences in how bisexual attractions interact with one’s conceptualization of one’s sexual self. Also, a non-trivial portion (22%) of participants reported attractions to gender non-binary people, and these attractions significantly predicted different SSS, suggesting the need to measure attractions outside of the gender binary.",

      "abstract": "Four males with idiopathic sexual precocity and 14 males with sexual precocity secondary to virilizing adrenal hyperplasia were seen in a longitudinal study of psychosexual development for up to 18 years. The distinguishing psychological traits of sexual precocity in the male so far uncovered are: a tendency to high IQ, as previously reported by Money and Lewis (17) and Money and Meredith (18); increased energy expenditure, especially in infancy; a possible increased incidence (by no means universal) of behavior tantrums and impulsive anger; early occurrence of the capacity for frankly sexual imagery in dreams and daydreams, its content, however, determined by cognitional experience; and early establishment of the capacity for erotic and sexual arousal in relation to visual imagery and visual perception as well as tactile sensation. It is possible, though not proven, that by influencing development of central nervous system pathways in utero, or by a triggering mechanism later in pubertal childhood, androgen may be responsible for these various traits. The psychological maturation of males with physical sexual precocity otherwise keeps in step with that of boys of the same chronological and/or social age. Accelerated social maturation may be deliberately fostered in order to bridge the gap between chronological age and physique age.",

It is not synonymous with gender identity (the knowledge of being male or female) or gender role (outward expression of maleness or femaleness). Gender identity and gender role generally are defined by anatomic and chromosomal gender in both heterosexual and homosexual individuals. Sexual orientation also is not synonymous with sexual activity; many homosexual individuals, especially during adolescence, participate in heterosexual behavior and relationships,1,2 and many adults who identify themselves as heterosexual report homosexual activity during adolescence.3-5 It is difficult to know with certainty the number of people who identify themselves as exclusively or predominantly homosexual. It is more difficult still to estimate the number who have questions about their sexual orientation during adolescence because of the well-known fluidity and complexity of sexual attractions and activities during this period. The original Kinsey study of sexuality reported that from puberty to age 20, 28% of boys and 17% of girls had one or more homosexual experiences. The same survey reported that 37% of adults have had homosexual experiences and that 10% consider themselves to be predominantly homosexual.3,4 In a somewhat more recent cross-sectional study of 13- to 19-year-olds, 11% of boys and 6% of girls reported at least one homosexual experience, with 17% of boys aged 16 to 19 reporting such activities.6",

      "title": "“Boys Love Boy Toys”: a qualitative study exploring the role of fathers in young boys’ gendered toy preferences",
      "abstract": "Abstract Children come to understand the concept of gender and learn to differentiate roles and norms on the basis of gender in early childhood. By interacting with individuals in their social contexts (i.e., family and peers), children are taught about gender norms and expectations, and as a result, learn to negotiate their own identities within different contexts. Parents have an especially important role in how children come to understand their own gender identity, as they have the ability to shape their childrens’ behaviors by endorsing certain gender stereotypes (e.g., girls wear pink, and boys play with trucks). For young boys, their fathers are a key socialization agent in their gender development, as they convey both implicitly and explicitly, gender-appropriate ways of being. Fathers may endorse ideas of traditional masculinity, which constrain boys to conform to the expected male norms, and discourages them from engaging in perceived feminine behaviors, such as cross-gender play. Accordingly, young boys are often expected to prove their manhood by marking their masculinity against femininity, in a power struggle where they are trying to get their gender right. Based on established and current literature in the field of gender identity development and masculinity in early childhood, this qualitative study aimed to explore young boys’ existing working schema of masculinity and the role that their fathers play in shaping it. Participants included six father–son pairs, with boys (ages 4–6) and their fathers (ages 34–37). Fathers were first asked to complete an adapted version of the Child-Rearing Sex-Role Attitude Scale , which assessed their attitudes and beliefs about gender-related toys, activities, and behaviors. Semi-structured interviews were then conducted with the father–son pairs, where they participated in a series of toy-preference activities in a virtual game. Descriptive coding and content analysis were used to analyze the responses boys provided for their toy preferences. Boys reported having a more stereotyped definition of “girl toys” than of “boy toys”, as reflected in their choices of toys that they felt that only girls would like to play with. Fathers’ self-described beliefs reported on the Child-Rearing Sex-Role Attitude Scale were similarly reflected in their behaviours and comments during the interviews with their sons, such that fathers who shared stereotypical beliefs about gender-related behaviours and activities on the scale, engaged in behaviours which corresponded to their beliefs when interacting with their sons. Implications for families and educators are discussed.",

      "abstract": "Belief in gendered social power imbalance (i.e. males are more powerful than females) leads to undesirable gender disparities, but little is known about the developmental origins of this belief, especially in Eastern cultures. We investigated the development onset of this belief by focusing on 4–7-year-old Japanese children while considering another belief (females are nicer than males) for comparison. In the dyadic context tasks, children saw pairs of animated characters depicting powerful–powerless or kind–unkind postures and judged the characters' gender (boy or girl). Results suggested both ‘nice = female’ and ‘powerful = female’ gender stereotypes in children. In the collective context tasks, children were presented with stories in occupational contexts, including multiple unspecified people and verbal cues, describing more explicitly the powerful and nice traits of the protagonists. The results replicated the ‘nice = female’ gender stereotype. Moreover, early ‘powerful = male’ gender stereotypes were seen in 6-year-old boys but not among girls in general. These findings demonstrate that Japanese children's beliefs regarding gender differences in power vary depending on the context in which male–female interactions are presented. Additionally, the study reveals that signs of the ‘powerful = male’ social power gender stereotype emerge around the age of 6.",

      "title": "Appearances deceive: female “resistance” behaviour in a sepsid fly is not a test of male ability to hold on",
      "abstract": "Female rejections of males are crucial events in sexual selection by female choice and sexually antagonistic coevolution, but there are few detailed studies of the process of rejection. Female struggles when mounted by males are often assumed to function to dislodge the male. But this study, in which female receptivity was manipulated by using females of different ages, showed that this \"dislodgement\" males. Mounts in Archisepsis diversiformis often failed, but males were nevertheless seldom thrown off; instead, they almost always dismounted while the female was quiet. Males also showed signs of being in control of dismounts, as they dismounted more quickly if the female had recently been mounted by another male. Predictions from two other hypotheses for the function of female resistance behaviour also either failed or were not consistently supported: (1) females resist in order to filter males with respect to their ability to hold on to the female or outlast her resistance, or to court while mounted (\"male endurance/female exhaustion\" hypothesis); (2) females resist in order to sense the male's grip on her wings and thus filter males with respect to their species-specific clamps or to elicit other male courtship (\"male screening\" hypothesis). Several predictions of a further possibility, that (3) females resist in order to communicate their lack of receptivity to the male, and to induce him to leave (\"communication\" hypothesis), hypothesis is incorrect in a group (sepsid flies) in which energetic female shaking behaviour was previously interpreted as female attempts to dislodge were confirmed. Although one type of data did not fit easily with the communication hypothesis, overall it was the most likely explanation for female shaking behaviour. Our results call into question conclusions from previous studies regarding male-female conflict in this and other groups, and suggest testable alternative hypotheses. A survey of behaviour in other flies (which are presumably indicative of other animals in this respect) indicates that female \"resistance\" behaviour probably has a variety of functions. In sum, facile interpretations of a forceful resistance function should not be accepted without careful analyses.",

However, bisexual people's dating choices are limited by non-bisexual people's reluctance to date bisexual people. Studies have indicated that some heterosexual, gay, and lesbian people are reluctant to date bisexual people, particularly bisexual men. We extend current understandings of gendered anti-bisexual bias through investigating heterosexual, bisexual, gay, and lesbian people's reported willingness to date within and outside of their sexual orientation groups. Participants (n = 1823) varying in sexual orientation completed measures regarding their willingness to engage in a romantic relationship with heterosexual, bisexual, gay, and lesbian individuals. Heterosexual and gay/lesbian people were less willing to date bisexual people than bisexual people were to date them, consistent with anti-bisexual bias rather than mere in-group preference. Preferences against dating bisexual men appeared particularly strong, even among bisexual women.",

      "abstract": "Comparing surveys from successive periods demonstrates that elderly people now enjoy a better and more varied sexual life than previous generations. The proportion of older people who remain sexually active has significantly increased, and the practices of masturbation or oral sex have spread considerably. The generation effect has an incidence upon sexual behaviour: older people's repertoire of sexual practices differs from that of younger people, in the sense that it focuses less on sexual intercourse and oral sex. Women and men, beyond the common trends towards sexuality characterised by a more open repertoire of sexual practices, differ in terms of sexual interest and subjective sexual wellbeing. The cessation of sexual activity by individuals who had previously been sexually active is often the result of a cascade of reactions, such as the occurrence of a sexual dysfunction in one or both partners, anticipation of failure, increased anxiety, lack of adaptation of sexuality and/or avoidance behaviour.",

Disgust is one of the most powerful turn-offs in a mating context. Here, we explored which disgust domain −pathogen, sexual, or moral − is considered the most damaging for self-image. We also revisited the importance of various positive traits in a potential partner. The participants (N = 1,017) played a date-simulation game. They chose which one of five positive characteristics, and which one of three disgust norm transgressions they want to manifest. We analysed the influence of one's biological sex, sexual orientation, and culture on self-presentation during a date. Women more often manifested morally disgusting behaviours and artistic abilities than men, while men more often manifested pathogenically disgusting behaviours and kindness. Homosexual orientation predicted lower frequency of admitting to moral disgust transgressions, and higher frequency of exhibiting artistic abilities.",

      "abstract": "Sexual consent refers to people's internal willingness to engage in sexual activity with another person-as well as their external communication of that willingness. Internal and external sexual consent can vary by type of sexual behavior; however, previous research on sexual consent has primarily only assessed \"typical\" sexual behaviors such as genital touching, oral sex, and vaginal-penile sex without providing further context or acknowledging people's sexual diversity. Therefore, we provided an initial account of people's sexual consent-and lack thereof-for a broader array of sexual behaviors and contexts in which they occur. Using an online cross-sectional survey of participants in the United Kingdom and the United States (N = 658, 50.5% women), we examined event-level internal and external sexual consent for 20 sexual behaviors or contexts. Women reported significantly lower levels of sexual consent feelings than men for 12 of the 20 sexual behaviors and lower levels of active consent communication for 7 of them. Almost a third of participants (31.0%) had experienced at least one of the listed sexual behaviors against their will. Of those, participants on average reported nonconsensual experiences with 3.1 of the 20 types of sexual behavior listed, ranging from 1 to 11. More women reported at least one nonconsensual experience with one of the sexual behaviors assessed compared with men (47.9% versus 22.3%, respectively). We discussed several behavior-specific findings regarding sexual consent and the lack thereof. We also made recommendations for initiatives aimed at promoting healthy sexual consent practices: embrace sexual diversity, emphasize sexual agency, and encourage active consent communication.",

      "abstract": "We tested a model of prosocial development, which predicted that prosocial action might decline, not increase, throughout childhood, becoming increasingly selective, individual, gender-related, and linked to emotional dysregulation. Sixty-six focal children at 18, 24, or 30 months of age were observed at home with familiar peers and then again 6 months later. Episodes of peer interaction were analysed for instances of sharing. The predicted decline in sharing with age was qualified by cohort differences and many associations with gender. Most children shared less as they grew older, but the oldest girls slightly increased their rate of sharing over time. As peer relationships developed, girls were more likely to share with other girls; boys were more likely to show reciprocity in sharing. Individual differences in sharing were moderately stable over time and linked to another form of prosocial action, sensitivity to the peer's distress. As predicted, children who shared at higher rates were rated more negatively by their mothers. The positive relationship between prosocial action and mothers' ratings of negative personality traits was especially strong for boys.",

It is not synonymous with gender identity (the knowledge of being male or female) or gender role (outward expression of maleness or femaleness). Gender identity and gender role generally are defined by anatomic and chromosomal gender in both heterosexual and homosexual individuals. Sexual orientation also is not synonymous with sexual activity; many homosexual individuals, especially during adolescence, participate in heterosexual behavior and relationships,1,2 and many adults who identify themselves as heterosexual report homosexual activity during adolescence.3-5 It is difficult to know with certainty the number of people who identify themselves as exclusively or predominantly homosexual. It is more difficult still to estimate the number who have questions about their sexual orientation during adolescence because of the well-known fluidity and complexity of sexual attractions and activities during this period. The original Kinsey study of sexuality reported that from puberty to age 20, 28% of boys and 17% of girls had one or more homosexual experiences. The same survey reported that 37% of adults have had homosexual experiences and that 10% consider themselves to be predominantly homosexual.3,4 In a somewhat more recent cross-sectional study of 13- to 19-year-olds, 11% of boys and 6% of girls reported at least one homosexual experience, with 17% of boys aged 16 to 19 reporting such activities.6",

However, most research studies and conceptual papers have misread, ignored, devalued, or scrutinized the gendered ways Black boys engage in play. This idea is particularly true for Black boys who may not play within the monolithic gendered expectations of childhood play. Drawing from [Connell, R. W. (1995). Masculinities. Berkeley: University of California Press] notion of multiple masculinities, I propose what I call the performance of 'multiple masculinities of Black boys' childhood play' to embrace the ways some Black boys engage in play activities, which may not fit within the performance of hegemonic and Black masculine norms and expectations. In so doing, I call for educators to broaden how we view Black boys, and our definition of Black masculinity so that embracing what might be traditionally called 'less masculine' and/or stereotypically feminine could be valued male traits. Recommendations are provided for early childhood educators to support the confluence of ways Black boys engage in play experiences.",

Some sex in some of these vertical relationships, I propose, ought to be proscribed, whether or not the person subordinated in the relationship consents (although force, coercion, and/or nonvoluntariness might aggravate the crime). If that sounds draconian, let me put it this way: just as consent is not a defense to having sex with an eleven-year-old and as consent is not a defense to eating and murdering someone for sexual gratification, consent should not be a defense for sex between a minor and the intimate partner of the minor’s parent.",

      "abstract": "Young women (N = 64) and men (N = 52) were asked to imagine discovering that their romantic partner had been sexually unfaithful. Fewer men than women gave positive endorsements to sets of aggressive actions against the unfaithful partner and against the rival. Gender differences did not appear in the motive for taking action against the rival, but more men than women endorsed releasing frustration as the motive for aggressive action against the partner. The genders appeared equally interested in maintaining the relationship with the unfaithful partner, preventing future infidelity, and attracting another partner. More men than women said they were uncertain about their partner's sexual fidelity. The results were interpreted as evidence that women are devalued more than men by an act of sexual infidelity, resulting in men's greater frustration with the partner's transgression but relative behavioral indifference to both the transgressing partner and rival. Men's greater uncertainty about a partner's infidelity may provide the basis for, as suggested by other data, men's greater tendency to ensure that a partner's infidelity and consequent devaluation never occur. © 1994 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",

Results showed that, among gay men with high (but not low) internalized stigma, self-ascribed masculinity was positively related to preferences for an ideal partner with stereotypically feminine traits. Preferences for partners with gender complementary traits did not emerge among women, or among men high in self-ascribed femininity. Contrary to predictions, internalized stigma was not associated with preferences for a gender-complementary division of household chores. Instead, internalized stigma was associated with the avoidance of tasks that are stereotypically gender incongruent—women high (vs. low) in stigma preferred for the partner (vs. self) to do so-called masculine (but not feminine) chores, whereas men high (vs. low) in stigma preferred for the partner (vs. self) to do stereotypically feminine (but not masculine) chores. Study 2 also included an experimental manipulation to test whether these effects were influenced by societal exclusion or acceptance, but there was no evidence of this.",

      "abstract": "The contrast between the potent, aggressive male and the impotent female is so widespread that when anything gives a male a sense of weakness, inadequacy, or incompleteness, he seizes upon the contrast and begins to suspect that he is lacking in virility, a thing so unendurably disgraceful that his whole life becomes one intense, unremitting effort to prove to himself and all the world that this is not so. That is the and when one is obsessed with it, he soon develops the neurotic constitution--always determined to be the superior male, always tense and overbearing except when he is exhausted, and, of course, always subject to the physical symptoms that such a purgatorial life involves. When suspicion or accusation of inferiority leads to a protest in women, it is by no means always a masculine protest. An uncomfortable sense of inferiority is very common, indeed, with women. Its victims attribute it to a variety of causes. They care about all kinds of social relations; they want to be like other girls they admire; and their self-respect is not so steeped in thoughts of worthy masculinity that it is marked. The dominant thoughts and impulses of youthful human beings are more social than sexual, and their social ambitions are not all couched in terms of brute force.

Also, while most games tend to feature consensual sex, they do not always model explicit communication or enthusiastic consent; this is partly due to the cultural stereotype that consent involves plaintive questioning (\"may I do X?\") as opposed to more erotic or collaborative models. Enthusiastic consent (i.e., not just \"okay\" but \"HELL YES!\") should be explored through verbal and nonverbal communication, with scope for branching choices about what characters want to do, or alternatives they suggest instead. Reluctant consent, where the character participates only due to present circumstances rather than interest, should be avoided unless the whole point of the games is to explore such events; in which case, this intent should be clearly signaled. The workshop questions invite players to analyze consent in existing games and model consent in their further works.",

      "abstract": "Human asexuality has been defined as a lack of sexual attraction to others, although its nature is not well understood. Asexual men's genital and subjective sexual arousal patterns were compared to sexual men's to better understand asexual men's sexual response patterns. Using a penile plethysmograph to measure genital arousal, 20 asexual, 27 heterosexual, and 22 gay cisgender men (M age = 28.28, SD = 9.41) viewed erotic films depicting sexual activity or masturbation, and a subsample engaged in sexual fantasy of their choosing. Questionnaires assessing sexual function and behavior were also completed. Asexual men scored lower on sexual desire and orgasmic function, higher on sexual aversion, and did not differ on overall sexual satisfaction. Compared with gay and heterosexual men, asexual men demonstrated lower genital and subjective sexual arousal to the erotic films but displayed similar sexual arousal when engaging in sexual fantasy. Asexual men's lower levels of sexual excitation rather than their higher levels of sexual inhibition were associated with lower responses to the erotic films. These findings suggest asexual men have preferred sexual stimuli that differ from sexual men and have a similar capacity for sexual arousal as sexual men. Collectively these findings add to a growing literature aiming to understand the nature of asexuality.",

An online community sample of lesbian, gay, and bisexual individuals (n = 111) were recruited for a study about attitudes toward relationships. Results show that sexual minority men and women hold similar attitudes toward CNM and similar levels of desire to engage in these types of relationships. Additionally, there were no differences between male and female sexual minorities’ desire to engage in sexual and romantic types of consensual non-monogamy (polyamory) or sexual-oriented types of consensual non-monogamy (swinging). There were also no differences in preference for specific types of love styles among LGB individuals. In sum, it is not just gay men who express interest in these types of relationships.",

      "title": "Sexual Motivation",
      "abstract": "Across cultures, gender plays a significant role in sexual motivation and the pursuit of either short‐ or long‐term mating strategies. Perhaps the most basic motivation for sexual behavior is the reproductive imperative (though this is not necessarily a conscious motivation). From an evolutionary perspective, men have developed an adaptive desire for sexual variety, in order to maximize their reproductive success. Because the minimum parental investment required of men (a single insemination) is much lower than that required of women (internal gestation), men can increase their reproductive capacity significantly by mating with multiple women. This desire for sexual variety is reflected in findings that men seek short‐term mates much more than women do, men prefer to have more sexual partners than women do, and men require a shorter period of acquaintanceship before engaging in sex than women do. Under some circumstances, women require a shorter period of acquaintanceship than is typical for the gender. Women with declining fertility think more about sex, have more frequent and intense sexual fantasies, are more willing to engage in sexual intercourse, and report actually engaging in sexual intercourse more frequently than women of other age groups. Evidence also suggests that women sometimes preferentially engage in short‐term mating relationships. They may be motivated to engage in these short‐term sexual relationships for a number of reasons, including immediate acquisition of resources and an effort to determine the partner's potential suitability for a long‐term mateship. It is also not uncommon for women to find a replacement mate before terminating an existing mateship.",

The views of adults were obtained for comparison. The children tended to see more activities as suitable for one sex only than did adults. Boys and men tended to see sex roles as more differentiated than did the girls and women respectively. ‘Doing car repairs’, ‘doing woodwork’ and ‘enjoying war films’ all emerged near the top of the list for ‘men only’ whether it was boys, girls, men or women giving their views. For ‘women only’, ‘mending clothes’, ‘wearing jewelry’, ‘being a ballet dancer’ and ‘talking about clothes’ came near the top in all cases. It is suggested that, for whatever reason, it has become part of the cultural fabric that men and women should do different things, and that a young child acquires a stereotyped and exaggerated view of what is appropriate for the sexes.",

      "title": "Romance Is Difficult: Choice, Agency and the Sexual Identity of NPCs in BioWare’s Dragon Age: Inquisition",
      "abstract": "Romance is not only difficult in primary reality but also in the secondary reality of videogames. It especially applies to writing and designing interactive romances in a believable way that allows for a realistic rendering of a character’s romantic life and sexual identity. This chapter will reflect on the player’s possibilities for romantic interactions with non-player-characters (NPCs) in videogames. It will also discuss the lack of risk of failure when conquering someone’s heart. As Mitu Khandaker-Kokoris states this is not only ethically questionable, but also a flawed representation of the real world. BioWare’s most recent role playing game (RPG) Dragon Age: Inquisition (DA:I) seeks out a new approach to simulating romances and flirting, as NPCs are given their own sexual identities. While other games, like Mass Effect 3, have already done that, they mostly prevent any romance options right away if the NPC is not interested. In DA:I, NPCs express and (to some extent) live their sexual identities. When talking to a non-interested NPC, the player is still given dedicated romance-options during conversations. However now it is possible that the player character’s advances are refused, even though the NPC might be romanceable by a different main character. For what seems to be the first time, players are exposed to an extensive pool of romantic and sexual choices while their agency is consciously limited.",

Does endorsing HS negatively bias perceptions of women's behavior and, in turn, create animosity within intimate relationships? Committed heterosexual couples reported on their own behavior and perceptions of their partner's behavior five times across a year (Study 1) and daily for 3 weeks (Study 2). Men who more strongly endorsed HS perceived their partner's behavior as more negative than was justified by their partner's reports. Furthermore, more negative perceptions of the partner's behavior mediated the links between men's HS and feeling more manipulated by their partners, behaving more negatively toward their partners, and lower relationship quality. This indicates that men who endorse HS behave more negatively toward intimate partners and experience lower relationship satisfaction because their antagonistic attitudes toward women in general permeate the way they perceive those partners.",

The proportion of older people who remain sexually active has significantly increased, and the practices of masturbation or oral sex have spread considerably. The generation effect has an incidence upon sexual behaviour : older people’s repertoire of sexual practices differs from that of younger people, in the sense that it focuses less on sexual intercourse and oral sex. Women and men, beyond the common trends towards sexuality characterised by a more open repertoire of sexual practices, differ in terms of sexual interest and subjective sexual wellbeing. The cessation of sexual activity by individuals who had previously been sexually active is often the result of a cascade of reactions, such as the occurrence of a sexual dysfunction in one or both partners, anticipation of failure, increased anxiety, lack of adaptation of sexuality and/or avoidance behaviour.",

Responses to infertilityIn response to being unable to conceive, many people feel emotions such as anger, panic, despair, and grief, and these may affect sexual activity.The stress of infertility and its treatment may also cause sexual difficulties for both men and women.Intercourse may be avoided, with patterns of behaviour established so that one or other partner is not reminded of the fertility problem.Post-coital tests or repeated need to provide semen samples may result in a man feeling under pressure to perform, which can adversely affect his erectile or ejaculatory ability.For some men, one or two failures during intercourse begin a vicious circle of fear of failure, with anxiety leading to further failures.Partners may also develop arousal difficulties because of anxiety or distress.Some people feel that their partner wants them only when there is a chance of conception, and sexual activity can then become a battleground for issues of power and control.Such stresses conspire to alienate couples from the recreational aspects of sexual expression and focus them, often obsessively, on the procreative aspect of sexual intercourse.",

To describe the main forms of CSREs, a latent profile analysis was performed on single and sexually active men and women aged from 18 to 30 years old who described their last casual sexual experience. Five profiles were identified: 1) the one-time sexual encounter; 2) the ex-romantic partnership, in which one still has sexual contact after ending their romantic relationship; 3) the mostly about sex partnership, in which contacts are primarily sexual, whether or not a friendship exists; 4) the intimate and sexual partnership, a hybrid of friend and romantic partner with whom one has frequent sexual and social interactions without commitment or intent to form a couple; 5) the friendship first partnership, a friendship to which sex is added, where social activities and friendly interactions dominate. Participants across profiles differed according to the number of sexual partners in the past year, their intention of having other sexual contacts with the partner, being under the influence of alcohol or drugs during the most recent sexual encounter with their partner and their type of sexual exclusivity agreement. This research contributes to a better description and understanding of CSREs among young adults and to further specifying its area of investigation.",

Specifically, we examined whether traditional gender-role endorsement, belief in male sexuality stereotypes, and age predict sexual compliance among heterosexual men. Participants (N = 426 men) completed a brief demographic questionnaire, measures of gender-role beliefs and male sexuality stereotypes, as well as a modified measure investigating motives for consenting to unwanted kissing, sexual touching, oral sex, and/or penetrative sex. The reported incidence rate of mild sexual compliance (i.e. consenting to unwanted kissing at least once) in heterosexual men was 61.3% over the past 12 months. Results suggest that sexual compliance in heterosexual men may be predicted by their endorsement of traditional gender-role beliefs and male sexuality stereotypes. Moreover, men may be motivated to be sexually compliant due to motives of altruism, intoxication, sexual inexperience, peer pressure, popularity, and sex-role concerns.",

While there have been many investigations into gynephilic men’s and androphilic women’s (i.e., heterosexual men/women) sexual response, there has been less investigation into the specificity of sexual response of androphilic men and gynephilic women. Given the complex nature of sexual stimuli that are used in sexual response research, it is often unclear to what extent contextual cues (e.g., cues other than the sexual actor’s primary and secondary sex characteristics, such as physical attractiveness, sexual activity, etc.) influence participants’ sexual response patterns. As such, the current study examined genital, discrete self-reported, and continuous self-reported responses of androphilic men ( n = 22) and gynephilic women ( n = 10) to prepotent sexual features (stimuli thought to elicit automatic sexual arousal: erect penises and exposed vulvas), non-prepotent sexual features (flaccid penises and pubic triangles) and neutral stimuli (clothed men and women). Both samples exhibited a gender-specific pattern of genital, self-reported, and continuous self-reported sexual arousal. Similarly, all measures of sexual arousal were generally found to be greatest to “prepotent” sexual cues. Implications for understanding gender specificity of sexual response are discussed.",

We tested Gilligan's (1982) expectation that more of males' play would be group activities played in public places, whereas more of females' games and sports would be home-based play in “intimate” dyads. Results showed that sex similarities and differences varied as a function of kind of play. For both sexes, games tended to be home-based and individual or dyadic play, however sports tended to be group, public-based play. Whereas team sports play was most frequent in childhood for both sexes and decreased in frequency from childhood into adulthood, the decrease in team, as compared to individual and dyadic, sports was significantly more dramatic for girls than for boys. The data indicated that whereas girls participate in a variety of types of play, boys' sports play is dominated by team activity across development. Thus, sex differences in the types of sports play provided the strongest support for Gilligan's hypothesis that socialization in team play may foster a reliance upon rights-based moral reasoning in boys.",

It is also pointed that hypoactive sexual desire can be caused by: long-term sexual abstinence; response to a sexual disorder of one’s male/female spouse (male/female partner); psychological response to another sexual dysfunction in the other person. Besides, weak sexual desire can be revealed in homosexual men and women, who have not accepted their sexual orientation to the end. The article gives data about influence of cultural/religious factors on the frequency of sexual desire. For example, noticeable differences exist in the levels of incidence of low desire in different cultures: from 12.5% in men from Northern Europe to 28% in men from South-East Asia at the age of 40-80. The association between the East Asian ethnicity and sexual desire in men can be mediated by feeling of guilt. Lower values of sexual desire were detected in women from East Asia versus women of the Canadian origin.",

In the present work, we investigate the relation between children’s own prescriptive gender stereotypes and their perceptions of others’ prescriptive gender stereotypes within three groups of children previously shown to differ in their prescriptive stereotyping—6- to 11-year-old transgender children ( N = 93), cisgender siblings of transgender children ( N = 55), and cisgender controls ( N = 93). Cisgender and transgender children did not differ in their prescriptive stereotypes or their perceptions of others’ prescriptive stereotypes, though the relationship between these variables differed by group. The more cisgender control children believed others held prescriptive stereotypes, the more they held those stereotypes, a relation that did not exist for transgender children. Further, all groups perceived the stereotypes of others to be more biased than their own stereotypes.",

      "title": "The function of female resistance behavior: intromission by male coercion vs. female cooperation in sepsis flies (Diptera: Sepsidae).",
      "abstract": "Female resistance behavior that occurs prior to intromission does not by itself imply forced copulation. Such behavior may function instead as a test of the male in order to favor some males over others, or to induce the male to desist. Thus, male persistence and forcefullness may sometimes be better described as persuasion rather than coercion. Under the persuasion hypothesis, the male only gains intromission due to an active response of the female. Under the coercion hypothesis, male and female are opposed in a physical battle which the female loses if copulation occurs. In species in which males are morphologically incapable of forcing intromission without active female cooperation (I argue here that this is probably a very common situation), data on the behavioral and ecological context in which resistance occurs can distinguish between the two possibilities. Partially congruent functions of resistance, seen from the female point of view, are female resistance to screen (male persuasion), and female resistance to avoid males non-selectively (male coercion). Sepsis flies illustrate these ideas. Females often struggle energetically in apparent attempts to dislodge mounted males and to prevent intromission, and males grasp females with powerful species-specific structures on their front legs and genitalia. This suggests the possibility of coerced intromission. But behavioral and morphological evidence demonstrate that active female cooperation occurs at the moment of intromission, and that males are probably dependent on this cooperation because they are not morphologically equipped to force their genitalia into those of an uncooperative female. Despite the impression from previous publications, male insects in general may seldom be able to achieve intromission by genitalic force. The species-specific forms of the grasping genitalia of male sepsis are probably not the result of an evolutionary arms race between coercive males and unselectively resistant females.",

Our findings revealed that importance placed on appearance, involvement in the LGBTQ community, and pornography use and less restrictive affectionate behavior between men were uniquely related to sexually objectifying other men. In addition, older men were more likely than younger men to sexually objectify other men, and gay men were more likely than bisexual men to sexually objectify other men.",

      "abstract": "As many as one third of all women have experienced sexual victimization as juveniles, and a range of emotional, inter-personal, and sexual problems appear to be frequent among these victims. On the current evidence, it is not possible to determine the extent to which these problems are a direct result of the exploitive sexual encounter or of other circumstances in the victims' lives. Nor can the incidence rates for various problems among victimized and non-victimized women be stated with any certainty, the samples on which estimates are made being biased and limited in many ways. Emotionally, the problems of guilt, low self-esteem, and depression, are extremely common among victims, especially those who seek treatment. The interpersonal relationships of many victims are characterized by feelings of isolation, alienation, and difference from other people, together with much mistrust and insecurity. There is some conflict of evidence over the prevalence of hostile or fearful attitudes towards men. Some victims do appear to avoid a lasting relationship with a man and many engage in a series of more transient and casual relationships. Prostitution also seems to be associated with sexual victimization in childhood. Among victims there appear to be tendencies to oversexualize all relationships with men, to engage repeatedly in ill-matched and punitive partnerships, and to exhibit a fear of intimacy. The evidence is contradictory on the incidence of homosexuality among women victims. Sexual problems, and more particularly sexual dysfunctions, appear to be more frequent among victimized compared to non-victimized women, The dysfunctions exhibited include lack of motivation, sexual phobias, vaginismus, impaired arousal, difficulty in reaching climax, dyspareunia, and sexual dissatisfaction. There is wide variation in adjustment between women victims, and among the factors that may contribute to these individual differences are the age of the child victim, the duration of the victimization, the nature of the sexual activity involve, and the perception of the woman concerning her feelings at the time of the victimization and its effects on her.",

      "title": "Sexual Coercion",
      "abstract": "Males of many species increase their reproductive success by obtaining multiple copulation and insemination; contrarily females avoid such matings due to high parental investment efforts. The disparity in parental investment leads to more reproductively active males than females at a given time. Thus, females become selective while choosing a mate; however, opposite holds true for males. Due to a lack of alignment in reproductive strategies and interest of males and females, sexual conflict may occur. The sexual conflicts among two sexes are considered as a major cause for evolution of certain traits involved in reproduction to maximize reproductive fitness. As a result of sexual conflict, alternative tactic used by males to ensure maximum mating and high reproductive fitness at a lower cost to themselves is sexual coercion. There are three main forms of sexual coercion: (i) forced copulation, where a male uses superior speed or strength to catch and physically restrain a female while he copulates with her by force; (ii) harassment, where males try to copulate repeatedly that impose some costs to females which induce them to mate immediately; and (ii) intimidation, where males punish females when refuse to mate with them, thereby raising chances that they will accept them as mates at some stage in future. The reduction or avoidance of forced copulation, harassment, and intimidation can have important evolutionary consequences for female movements, mating preferences, and social relationships, as well as for evolution of female morphology.",

Most of these adults did not exhibit a special sexual orientation: they would also have sex with women, and would typically abandon sex with boys when, or not long after, they were married. An untypical minority of ‘inveterate’ sodomites, many of whom never married, continued to have sex with boys in their later decades. A very small minority of adults had sex with other adults. Those who were by preference passive adults sometimes exhibited effeminate behaviour. Mutual masturbation played only a minor role; evidence of group sex is very rare. A small minority of men felt a strong emotional commitment to the boys they had sex with; loving relationships between men of the same age were very rare.",

The sequalae to adult castration in human beings are ambiguous. Some patients describe pronounced and fairly prompt reduction in erotic responsiveness and capacity for sexual performance. Other castrated men claim that normal libido and potency are retained for several decades (Lange 1934, Daniels and Tauber 1941). This extreme variability might be due to any one of several causes. (1) It is possible that individuals vary endocrinologically, and that extragonadal androgens are in some cases sufficient to support an essentially normal sex life. (2) Claims for continued virility may be false. (3) The patient’s expectations and desires may exert a powerful control over his sexual capacities with the result that castration provides a welcome excuse for inactivity or, in contrast, that hormonal deficiencies are compensated by increased “psychic” (cerebral) stimulation.",

      "title": "Gender Dysphoria",
      "abstract": "Persons who experience persistent, clinically significant distress about their anatomic sex or assigned gender role have been recognized since antiquity. In DSM-5 (American Psychiatric Association 2013), these individuals can be diagnosed with gender dysphoria. The DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for gender dysphoria in adults appear in Box 39- . Persons with presentations that meet diagnostic criteria for gender dysphoria in DSM-5 would have received a different DSM diagnosis—usually either transsexualism or gender identity disorder (GID)—prior to 2013. Consequently, some expert recommendations and empirical studies relevant to the treatment of adults with gender dysphoria refer instead to persons with transsexualism or GID. A brief explanation of these terms is therefore indicated. DSM-5 Diagnostic Criteria for Gender Dysphoria in Adolescents and Adults 302.85 F64.1 A marked incongruence between one's experienced/expressed gender and assigned gender, of at least 6 months' duration, as manifested by at least two of the following: A marked incongruence between one's experienced/expressed gender and primary and/or secondary sex characteristics (or in young adolescents, the anticipated secondary sex characteristics). A strong desire to be rid of one's primary and/or secondary sex characteristics because of a marked incongruence with one's experienced/expressed gender (or in young adolescents, a desire to prevent the development of the anticipated secondary sex characteristics). A strong desire for the primary and/or secondary sex characteristics of the other gender. A strong desire to be of the other gender (or some alternative gender different from one's assigned gender). A strong desire to be treated as the other gender (or some alternative gender different from one's assigned gender). A strong conviction that one has the typical feelings and reactions of the other gender (or some alternative gender different from one's assigned gender). The condition is associated with clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. Specify if: With a disorder of sex development (e.g., a congenital adrenogenital disorder such as 255.2 [E25.0] congenital adrenal hyperplasia or 259.50 [E34.50] androgen insensitivity syndrome). Coding note: Code the disorder of sex development as well as gender dysphoria. Specify if: Posttransition: The individual has transitioned to full-time living in the desired gender (with or without legalization of gender change) and has undergone (or is preparing to have) at least one cross-sex medical procedure or treatment regimen—namely, regular cross-sex hormone treatment or gender reassignment surgery confirming the desired gender (e.g., penectomy, vaginoplasty in a natal male; mastectomy or phalloplasty in a natal female). When disorders involving distress about anatomic sex or assigned gender role first entered DSM in 1980 (DSM-III; American Psychiatric Association 1980), they appeared under the superordinate category gender identity disorders. Their defining feature was said to be \"an incongruence between anatomic sex and gender identity\" (p. 261), where gender identity referred to a person's fundamental sense of being male or female. Adults with persistent discomfort about their anatomic sex and a desire to live as members of the opposite sex could receive a diagnosis of transsexualism in DSM-III and DSM-III-R (American Psychiatric Association 1987). They can still receive this diagnosis in the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10th Revision (ICD-10; World Health Organization 1992). Males and females with transsexualism are often referred to as male-to-female (MtF) and female-to-male (FtM) transsexuals. In DSM-IV and DSM-IV-TR (American Psychiatric Association 1994, 2000), the diagnosis of transsexualism was replaced by the diagnosis of gender identity disorder ; as a result, this term applied to both the superordinate category and a specific diagnosis within that category. It has long been recognized that not all adults with GID (the superordinate category) have presentations that meet full diagnostic criteria for transsexualism or GID (the specific diagnosis). Accordingly, both ICD and DSM have consistently provided one or more residual diagnoses for persons with nonclassical or nontranssexual types of GID. These diagnoses could be applied to individuals whose presentations fulfilled some but not all diagnostic criteria for transsexualism or GID (i.e., who were subthreshold for these diagnoses) or who had alternative gender identities but did not identify as the opposite sex (e.g., men who identified as eunuchs and sought only castration, not complete sex reassignment; Johnson et al. 2007). In the DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for gender dysphoria, the new term experienced/expressed gender —a neologism for gender identity —encompasses a wider range of identities than just the opposite sex. Consequently, it appears that many persons who would previously have been diagnosed with residual or nontranssexual forms of GID would now be diagnosed with gender dysphoria. DSM-5 nevertheless includes two residual diagnoses for persons whose presentations do not meet full criteria for gender dysphoria: other specified gender dysphoria and unspecified gender dysphoria. The DSM-5 descriptions of these diagnoses appear in Boxes 39- and 39- . DSM-5 Other Specified Gender Dysphoria 302.6 F64.8 This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of gender dysphoria that cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for gender dysphoria . The other specified gender dysphoria category is used in situations in which the clinician chooses to communicate the specific reason that the presentation does not meet the criteria for gender dysphoria . This is done by recording \"other specified gender dysphoria\" followed by the specific reason (e.g., \"brief gender dysphoria\"). An example of a presentation that can be specified using the \"other specified\" designation is the following: The current disturbance meets symptom criteria for gender dysphoria, but the duration is less than 6 months. DSM-5 Unspecified Gender Dysphoria 302.6 F64.9 This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of gender dysphoria that cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for gender dysphoria . The unspecified gender dysphoria category is used in situations in which the clinician chooses not to specify the reason that the criteria are not met for gender dysphoria, and includes presentations in which there is insufficient information to make a more specific diagnosis. Because the diagnosis of gender dysphoria is so broadly encompassing, it is useful to distinguish between adults with gender dysphoria who experience transsexualism and those who experience nontranssexual forms of gender dysphoria. These terms are relatively unambiguous and remain widely used both in clinical settings and in the scientific literature (e.g., Hembree et al. 2009), even though transsexualism has not been a formal DSM diagnosis since 1994. The term transgender can be used to denote persons with significant cross-gender identification or gender-atypical feelings or behaviors, whether or not they meet diagnostic criteria for gender dysphoria.",

      "abstract": "Most children at some time or other pick up swear words and go through a phase of using them profusely and, all too often, in inappropriate situations. Most, however, pass quickly through this phase and although, like most adults, they may continue to swear they do so mainly to relieve feelings of tension and frustration and only then in situations where such language is uncensured and inoffensive to those present. There is, indeed, a developmental pattern to the swear words that children use. Between the ages of around four to seven years children tend to use words associated with excrement (even indirectly in some cases; e.g., knickers). Often the delight in using them stems not only from the knowledge that they are forbidden, but also from a fairly precise knowledge of their meaning. The next stage is the use of sexual obscenities and the delight in using these stems from their reference to forbidden things or their power to affect or provoke adults, rather than from an awareness of their precise meaning. Finally, older children may use blasphemies widely and openly; e.g. Jesus Christ! There is much disagreement among adults as regards the use and nature of such blasphemies and a whole area of uncertainty surrounds them. When using these words older children are often testing out their positions vis-à-vis adults within an area of perceived controversy, but it frequently represents a growing awareness of what is or is not acceptable.",

This study investigated romantic love in a cross-cultural sample of heterosexual, homosexual, and bisexual young adults (N = 783) experiencing romantic love. We analyzed differences between sexual orientation groups on six variables pertaining to different aspects of romantic love. These variables included number of times ever in love; the timing of falling in love relative to starting a romantic relationship; intensity of romantic love; obsessive thinking about a loved one; commitment; and frequency of sex per week. Homosexual females reported a significantly lower frequency of sex per week than heterosexual and bisexual females. Bisexual males reported a greater number of times ever in love than heterosexual males. Other variables revealed small or very small differences between sexual orientation groups. This study provides initial findings indicating that romantic love manifests in somewhat different ways across sexual orientation groups.",

      "abstract": "Fifteen-year-old British adolescents of both sexes were presented with success or failure story cues, in sex-appropriate and sex-inappropriate fields of endeavour. Responses were analysed to establish the extent and nature of 'motive to avoid success'. The effects of cue variables (sex appropriateness, success versus failure), sex-role attitude, locus of control, social class and maternal employment were explored. It was found that boys were generally more negative, predicting failure and demonstrating anxiety in various ways. Girls were generally more positive, more likely to predict success outcomes, and tended to treat the obstacles to girls' achievement as challenges to be overcome. They tended to show a realistic appreciation of the problems likely to be encountered rather than anxiety or a motive to avoid success.",

Few empirical investigations have been conducted on the preferences of adolescent boys and girls, despite the fact that this developmental period represents a time of awakening romantic and sexual interest. The authors asked 46 teenage boys and girls (average age = 15.09 years) to indicate their preferences for various characteristics in an ideal long-term romantic or short-term sexual partner (randomly assigned). Both sexes emphasized attributes related to physical appeal (e.g., attractive physical appearance, sexy appearance) and sexual drive (e.g., sexual passion, high sex drive, sexual responsiveness) when evaluating a casual sexual partner. Conversely, participants focused more upon intellect and other mentally appealing attributes (e.g., intelligence, humor) when considering a romantic partner. No sex differences were found, suggesting that teenage boys and girls share a similar conception of the “perfect” partner.",

To test this hypothesis, two measures of cooperative behavior were administered to 30 4- and 5-yr.-old children. When interpreted dichotomously (cooperative vs competitive), the results support traditional findings: girls were more cooperative than boys on one measure while younger children were more cooperative than older children on both measures.

      "abstract": "Gender is one of the central categories organizing children’s social world. Clear patterns of gender development have been well-documented among cisgender children (i.e., children who identify as a gender that is typically associated with their sex assigned at birth). We present a comprehensive study of gender development (e.g., gender identity and gender expression) in a cohort of 3- to 12-y-old transgender children ( n = 317) who, in early childhood, are identifying and living as a gender different from their assigned sex. Four primary findings emerged. First, transgender children strongly identify as members of their current gender group and show gender-typed preferences and behaviors that are strongly associated with their current gender, not the gender typically associated with their sex assigned at birth. Second, transgender children’s gender identity (i.e., the gender they feel they are) and gender-typed preferences generally did not differ from 2 comparison groups: cisgender siblings ( n = 189) and cisgender controls ( n = 316). Third, transgender and cisgender children’s patterns of gender development showed coherence across measures. Finally, we observed minimal or no differences in gender identity or preferences as a function of how long transgender children had lived as their current gender. Our findings suggest that early sex assignment and parental rearing based on that sex assignment do not always define how a child identifies or expresses gender later.",

      "abstract": "The sex drive refers to the strength of sexual motivation. Across many different studies and measures, men have been shown to have more frequent and more intense sexual desires than women, as reflected in spontaneous thoughts about sex, frequency and variety of sexual fantasies, desired frequency of intercourse, desired number of partners, masturbation, liking for various sexual practices, willingness to forego sex, initiating versus refusing sex, making sacrifices for sex, and other measures. No contrary findings (indicating stronger sexual motivation among women) were found. Hence we conclude that the male sex drive is stronger than the female sex drive. The gender difference in sex drive should not be generalized to other constructs such as sexual or orgasmic capacity, enjoyment of sex, or extrinsically motivated sex.",

The goal of this dissertation is to examine the underlying functions related to the emergence of risky adolescent “behaviors,” broadly defined to include both physical risks (e.g., drinking or physical fighting) and psychological risks (e.g., anxious or depressive symptoms). In this paper I (1) present a manuscript reviewing and synthesizing the relevant evolutionary theories, which bears testable hypotheses regarding sex differences in risky adolescent behavior, and (2) empirically assess these predictions in two separate but theoretically and conceptually related studies that test for theoretically-based hypothesized relations: one specific to males, one to females. Specifically, I test the proposition that males should be more likely to engage in physically risky behavior than females, and that females should be more likely to engage in affective risks (assessed as sensitivity to social evaluation). These hypotheses are generally supported, but shed light on important environmental factors that are associated with the prevalence of risk-taking, including the degree of closeness within the family, timing of pubertal development, and social status. In general, an early pubertal development and low social status are associated with risk-taking, while closeness to family buffers against the likelihood of engaging in later risky behaviors.",

El objetivo de este estudio fue comparar niveles de prejuicio sexual en participantes heterosexuales que vieron o leyeron una historia con personajes gay y quienes imaginaron un encuentro con una persona gay o una desconocida. A través de un diseño experimental, se puso a prueba la hipótesis de que el prejuicio sexual (prejuicio alto o prejuicio bajo) variaría en función de la historia (ficticia o imaginada) y del país de origen de los participantes (El Salvador o Reino Unido). En comparación con participantes del Reino Unido, participantes de El Salvador puntuaron significativamente más bajo en Dominancia social, más alto en Autoritarismo e Identificación heterosexual, y reportaron menoracuerdo con las uniones legales de parejas del mismo sexo. No se encontró asociación entre estos factores y puntajes de prejuicio sexual. Se discuten posibles explicaciones a estos resultados y direcciones futuras para el uso de narrativas en la reducción del prejuicio hacia minorías sexuales.",

      "abstract": "Developmental theories of the biological basis of sexual orientation suggest that sexually differentiated psychological and behavioural traits should be linked with sexual orientation. Subgroups of gay men delineated by anal sex roles differ according to at least one such trait: gender expression. The present study assessed the hypothesis that handedness, a biologically determined sexually differentiated trait, corresponds to differences in subgroups of gay men based on anal sex role. Furthermore, it assessed whether handedness mediates the association between gender nonconformity and male sexual orientation. Straight and gay men (N = 333) completed the Edinburgh Inventory of Handedness and the Recalled Childhood Gender Nonconformity Scale. Gay men also completed measures of anal sex role preference. As in previous studies, gay men showed greater non-right-handedness and gender nonconformity than straight men. Also, among gay men, bottoms/versatiles (i.e., gay men who take a receptive anal sex role, or who take on both a receptive and insertive anal sex role) were more gender-nonconforming than tops (i.e., gay men who take an insertive anal sex role). In support of the hypothesis, bottoms/versatiles were more non-right-handed than tops and handedness mediated the male sexual orientation and anal sex role differences in Recalled Childhood Gender Nonconformity. Together, these findings suggest that developmental processes linked to handedness underpin variation among men in sexual orientation and gender nonconformity as well as variation among subgroups of gay men that are delineated by anal sex roles.",

      "abstract": "Men's sexual overperception bias-where men tend to perceive greater sexual interest in women's behavior than actually exists-is a well-documented finding in previous research. All of the existing research, however, has tested this effect in the context of initial encounters or for fictitious or unknown targets. No research currently exists on how people perceive their romantic partner's sexual desire in the context of ongoing, intimate relationships. In 3 dyadic studies, we provide evidence that men in established romantic relationships err in the direction of the opposite bias and underperceive their romantic partner's sexual desire. We also demonstrate that this underperception bias is functional (particularly for men) in that it is associated with their partner feeling more satisfied and committed to the relationship. In addition, people are particularly likely to underperceive their partner's desire on days when they are motivated to avoid sexual rejection, and men's underperception bias is, in part, accounted for by men's higher general levels of sexual desire than women. The current studies extend previous findings on sexual perceptual biases and demonstrate the important role of context in men's judgments of a partner's sexual interest. (PsycINFO Database Record",

We propose a queer paradigm to study relationship diversity grounded in seven axioms: intimacy may occur (1) within relationships featuring any combination of cisgender, transgender, or nonbinary identities; (2) with people of multiple gender identities across the life course; (3) in multiple relationships simultaneously with consent; (4) within relationships characterized by consensual asymmetry, power exchange, or role-play; (5) in the absence or limited experience of sexual or romantic desire; (6) in the context of a chosen rather than biological family; and (7) in other possible forms yet unknown. We review research on queer relational forms, including same-sex relationships; relationships in which one or more partners identify as transgender, gender nonbinary, bisexual, pansexual, sexually fluid, \"mostly\" straight, asexual, or aromantic; polyamory and other forms of consensual nonmonogamy; kink/fetish relationships; and chosen families. We argue that a queer paradigm shifts the dominant scientific conception of relationships away from the confines of normativity toward an embrace of diversity, fluidity, and possibility.",

Sex differences can result from differential postnatal experiences (interaction with parents, environment) or from biological factors (hormones and genes) acting pre- or postnatally. The first option is often favored to explain sexual orientation although it is supported by little experimental evidence. In contrast, many sexually differentiated behaviors are organized during early life by an irreversible action of sex steroids. In particular, the preference for a male or female sex partner is largely determined in rodents by embryonic exposure to sex steroids. The early action of these steroids also seems to affect sexual orientation in humans. Indeed, clinical conditions associated with major endocrine changes during embryonic life often result in an increased incidence of homosexuality. Furthermore, multiple sexually differentiated behavioral, physiological, or even morphological traits that are kn...",

In females, regardless of chronotype, the greatest need for sex occurred between 18:00 and 24:00, but a secondary peak appeared only in morning types at 6:00–9:00. In males, the greatest need for sex occurred either in the morning or evening hours: in evening types at 9:00–12:00 and 18:00–3:00; in neither types at 6:00–9:00 and 18:00–24:00; in morning types at 6:00–12:00 and 18:00–24:00. Considering time of day when subjects were undertaking sexual activity most frequently, this appeared between 18:00 and 24:00 for all the participants, and prolonged until 3:00 at night in evening type males. Morningness preference was more strongly related to the timing of need for sex than to the timing of actual sexual activity (r = −0.275 vs. r = −0.174), while the timing of desire and the timing of sexual activity were positively, but moderately related (r = 0.320).",

He probably makes large sacrifices to defray the cost of a ‘good education,’ and is liable finally to sacrifice his boy’s chances of happiness and success by an injudicious decision about his future. His difficulties may be increased, curiously enough, by his failure to realise that conditions of entry into a career are radically different from what they were thirty or forty years ago. He perhaps is still sufficiently romantic to talk about, and even to believe in, the ‘self-made man’ ideal, although the impracticability of it in these days of combines and over-population is surely manifest. Or he is likely to adopt one of two favourite attitudes; either, that his personal experience of the exigencies of his own calling determines him not to allow his son to follow it, or that the only reasonable thing for a son to do is to step into his father’s shoes and continue the work built up for him. If he is neither romantic nor obstinate, he will consult his son’s inclinations and, in all probability, he will find them either fantastic or completely unformed. A normal boy rarely shows a marked aptitude for one particular business or profession in his early or middle school-days, and if he forms an opinion about his future it is usually much influenced by a limited knowledge of his father’s occupation.",

Traditional masculine ideologies (TMIs) could play a role in motivating enticing or resentful responses. TMIs often emphasize superiority, encompassing power, control, dominance, and frequent sexual activity. When individuals adhering to TMIs face sexual rejection, they may experience feelings of inferiority and respond with enticing or resentful behaviors to reassert superiority. Objective Explore links between TMIs and the use of enticing and resentful responses following experiences of sexual rejection. Methods A German-speaking sample of 351 cisgender men and 345 cisgender women (age: M = 28.11, SD = 8.05) were randomly assigned to read one of two hypothetical stories in which participants should imagine being sexually rejected by their partner (rejection condition), or engaging in sexual activity with their partner (no-rejection condition). Afterward, participants had to report how they would react to sexual rejection. TMI was assessed with the Conformity to Masculine Norms Inventory. Results Compared to cisgender women, cisgender men more often would react with enticing tactics (β = .77, p &amp;lt; .001). Compared to participants who were rejected, participants who were not rejected more often would react with enticing tactics (β = .43, p &amp;lt; .001). Participants with higher levels of TMIs (being a playboy, dominating women, holding heterosexual self-presentation) more often would react with enticing tactics (β = .18, p &amp;lt; .001; β = .15, p &amp;lt; .001; β = .11, p &amp;lt; .001, respectively). Compared to men with higher levels of TMI (heterosexual self-presentation), women with higher levels of TMI (heterosexual self-presentation) more often would react with resentful responses (β = .68, p &amp;lt; .001). This effect was reinforced through sexual rejection, as opposed to no sexual rejection (β = -.63, p &amp;lt; .001). Conclusions When sexual rejection hasn’t occurred men are more inclined to enticing behaviors. This tendency may stem from potential misunderstandings about desires and consent after initial sexual intercourse. Conversely, when sexual rejection does occur, resentful responses are more common among women adhering to a heterosexual self-presentation. Heterosexual self-presentation might align with adherence to traditional sexual scripts in which men are not expected to decline the sexual advances of a desiring woman. Consequently, rejection may be perceived as a direct challenge to their identity as a woman, triggering feelings of resentment. Therapists can apply these findings to better assist individuals or couples in their sexual relationships. By examining how adherence to traditional gender norms and scripts influences reactions to sexual rejection, therapists can help clients recognize these influences and promote respectful responses that honor all partners’ desires and boundaries.

      "abstract": "Conditions of life for women in the ancient world followed from one major fact and one major assumption. The fact is that women bear children. Menstruation, pregnancy, labour, and lactation are wearing and restrict activity; contraception varied (as it did until the 1960s) from moderately reliable pessaries and spermicides to mere superstition. But women do not spend all (or, for some women, any) of their lives bearing children. The assumption was that even when they are not doing so, they must lead a domestic life under male protection, for they are not suited to independence. Women were seen as more emotional than men (a question still in dispute), more gullible, more likely to yield to impulse or desire, less rational - generally less in control of their reactions than men are. Much of this, to modern observers, is self-fulfilling prophecy. If you restrict women (or unemployed men) to domestic life, they will lack experience of the world, develop compliance not self-confidence, and have too much time to brood.",

      "abstract": "Parasocial interactions and relationships, one-sided connections imagined with celebrities and media figures, are common in adolescence and might play a role in adolescent identity formation and autonomy development. We asked 151 early adolescents (Mage = 14.8 years) to identify a famous individual of whom they are fond; we examined the type of celebrities chosen and why they admired them, and the relationships imagined with these figures across the entire sample and by gender. Adolescents emphasized highly salient media figures, such as actors, for parasocial attention. While different categories of celebrities were appreciated equally for their talent and personality, actors/singers were endorsed for their attractiveness more so than other celebrity types. Most adolescents (61.1%) thought of their favorite media figures as relationship partners, and those who did reported more parasocial involvement and emotional intensity than those who did not. Gender differences emerged in that boys chose more athletes than girls and were more likely to imagine celebrities as authority figures or mentors than friends. Celebrities afforded friendship for girls, who overwhelmingly focused on actresses. Hierarchical parasocial relationships may be linked to processes of identity formation as adolescents, particularly boys, imagine media figures as role models. In contrast, egalitarian parasocial relationships might be associated with autonomy development via an imagined affiliation with an attractive and admirable media figure.",

      "abstract": "Few investigations of sexual attitudes have restricted their focus to individuals' preferences for specific behaviors within a heterosexual relationship. None have examined gender differences in a broad and multidimensional array of such behavioral particulars. As part of an effort to develop a measure of preferred scripts in heterosexual couples, 258 men and women reported how much they agreed or disagreed with 74 statements of preference. A reduced and factor analyzed questionnaire included 38 items and was administered to a second sample (N = 228). Results offer qualified support that, compared to women, men are more erotophilic and show a stronger preference for incorporating erotic materials as well as drugs and alcohol into sexual relations with their partner. These results were more robust in the second sample, in which almost half of the subjects were tested in same-sex groups. Across both samples, women showed stronger preferences for activities reflecting romanticism. No gender differences were evident in sexual conventionality or in preference regarding the general use of contraceptives. However, results suggest that both sexes respond more favorably to a partner-focused or unspecified contraceptive method than to a self-focused method.",

      "abstract": "Sexual dysfunctions comprise heterogeneous disorders that are characterized by disturbed sexual responsiveness, reduced sexual desire, or problems in experiencing sexual pleasure. Women more frequently have problems in experiencing sexual arousal and pleasure, whereas men more often suffer from erectile dysfunction or dysfunctional ejaculation. From an evolutionary point of view, many sexual dysfunctions are caused by conflict relating to intra- and intersexual competition or cultural practices of controlling sexual activity of the opposite sex. Suppression of sexual interest in women may, for example, occur in patrilocal societies, where curbing one’s daughter’s sexual activity before her arranged marriage may eventually increase the parents’ reproductive success. Evolutionary hypotheses of female orgasm suggest that the function of orgasm in women could signal satisfaction and fidelity to their male partners. Premature ejaculation in men may relate to performance anxiety. Finally, hormonal contraceptives impact on the experience of sexual pleasure and mate choice in relevant ways.",

Ontmoet het mannetje sexe-genoten in dit milieu, dan reageert het agressief en raakt nu en dan in gevecht met de andere mannetjes. Hierbij heeft het grotere en sexueel sterker gemotiveerde mannetje de grootste kans als overwinnaar uit het duel tevoorschijn te komen, Zijn gedrag verschilt dan duidelijk van dat van de verliezer. Zolang het mannetje niet heeft gecopuleerd blijft de kans, dat het wint van een bepaalde rivaal, die eveneens niet heeft gecopuleerd, betrekkelijk constant. Als het mannetje verliest bij het eerste treffen sluit dit nog niet uit, dat het van het andere mannetje kan winnen. Het zoekgedrag, dat na agressieve contacten wordt gemodificeerd tot marionettengang brengt het mannetje in de onmiddellijke nabijheid van vrouwtjes. Zoekgedrag wordt dan beeindigd en visuele prikkels (misschien ook olfactorische) richten het baltsgedrag op het vrouwtje.\r\nHet vrouwtje is waarschijnlijk bij de eerste ontmoeting nog niet tot paren bereid; de agonistische contacten tussen mannetjes duren dan voort. De grotere en sexueel sterker gemotiveerde dieren hebben daarbij de meeste kans de directe omgeving van het vrouwtje bezet te houden. Bepaalde factoren uit bet baltsgedrag waarschijnlijk vooral het ritme van bewegingen en vibraties immobiliseren het vrouwtje tenslotte, ten gevolge van aanraken door het mannetje of op grond van visuele prikkels treedt kanteling van het abdomen op. \r\nDan kruipt het mannetje op vormprikkels, afkomstig van het vrouwtje spelen hierbij een rol en de copulatie vindt plaats. Vrouwtjes, welke niet worden bevrucht, kunnen na drie maanden nog op de hierboven beschreven wijze tot paren bewogen worden. Bij bet mannetje daalt na een periode van sexuele activiteit de agressiviteit ten opzichte van andere mannetjes. Komt het in dit stadium tot een agonistisch contact tussen dit mannetje en een ander, dat nog geen periode van sexuele activiteit heeft doorgemaakt, dan treedt het laatste mannetje als winnaar op.\r\nVeldwaarnemingen zullen het hierboven getekende beeld nog moeten bevestigen. Net name de regels, welke voor het agonistische gedrag beschreven zijn kunnen met elkaar een belangrijk selectie-mechanisme vormen, waarbij selectie plaats vindt in de richting van sexueel sterker gemotiveerde dieren en misschien in de richting van grotere dieren. Het is van belang te weten, of dit mechanisme in de natuur inderdaad werkzaam is, of dat misschien het potentiele effect ervan door andere factoren in de leefwijze en het gedrag van Pardosa amentata wordt geneutraliseerd.",

Some cultures implicitly support a man's right to have affairs, or even several wives, while others have a moral stance against infidelity. Severe marital strain may precipitate extra-marital liaisons or affairs.

A man or woman using the internet for sexual interest may be spending time on internet sites and finding heterosexual or homosexual internet partners for emotional exchange and/or for internet sex. For one couple, having a normal but oedipally sexualised child will feel like an attack on the same-sex parent, while for another couple the developmental sexualisation of a teenager threatens. Long-standing sexual difficulty or inactivity pose risks. These surface factors then trigger unconscious issues.",

These negative feelings and negative self-images are exploited so as to appease the superego in the face of one's hostile aggression: that one is justified, that there are extenuating circumstances for one's hatred and destructiveness. The \"oral\" clamor of deprivation and entitlement, together with dependency, submissiveness, and defensive uncertainty, serve a screening function for hostile aggressive wishes, from any developmental level. Typically, attitudes of entitlement are contradictory, unclear, and wavering, because of conflict between differing ego ideal images, and conflict between superego, and ego and id, about the sadistic extractiveness in these attitudes. Attitudes of entitlement are contributed to by past trauma, deprivation, abuse, teasing overstimulation coupled with neglect, or alternating indulgence and deprivation, as well as identification with certain parental attitudes--exploitation and extractiveness--and denial of the need for the superego to assess reality accurately.",

Results Only certain gender traits are linked to specific gaming motivations. Negative masculinity increased competence and relatedness while negative femininity decreased autonomy. Similar results were found for sexual orientation. LGB people showed less competence and intuitive control motivations. Additionally, LGB people spent more time playing video games than non-LGB people. They reported playing puzzles more as well. No other differences were found for game genre selection. Discussion The lack of differences based on sexual orientation and gender traits shows that video games offer an environment for everybody and thus have the potential to bring people together.",

Characteristics of the postpartum sexual abstinence include: 1) 4-6 years of abstinence 2) consistent observation by the Dani of the abstinence 3) lack of explanation of the custom or the enforcement of sanctions by the Dani 4) lack of other sexual outlets in the society such as masturbation homosexuality beastiality or overt polygymy and 5) no signs of unhappiness or stress. The behavior and attitudes of the postpartum abstinence are described in detail. Low levels of emotional energy invested in sexuality are also observable in other activities of the Dani such as the rate of birth extramarital sex homosexuality child-rearing practices initiation rites use of the penis sheath or gourd teenagers play interpersonal interaction intelligence as reflected in abstract thinking and the expression of art and adaptation to change and health. In all but one of these activities e.g. teenagers play there is always a low expression of energy; teenagers songs drawings and string figures often illustrate explicit sexual actions. In comparison of the two views of sexual energy the relativistic and the more common Freudian ones Heider concludes that the Danis sexual behavior is culturally derived and fits closely with the view of Dani society as a low level energy system. Using comparative examples causes of low energy sexuality are suggested to be a result of the lack of seasonality in the region or more likely the low stress and stimulation of infants. However no causal factors seem sufficient enough to explain the phenomena of low level sexuality.",

      "abstract": "Sixty‐seven female and 54 male college students participated in a study of sexual disagreements in which the man desired to engage in a higher level of sexual activity than did the woman. Participants kept an ongoing record of dates and disagreements and provided descriptive information about some of these. We had three goals: (a) to determine how frequently this type of disagreement occurs in dating relationships; (b) to determine the types and frequencies of the various strategies that men use when their partner indicates that she is unwilling to engage in a particular sexual activity; and (c) to describe the characteristics of disagreement situations and relate these to male compliance with the woman's refusal. One or more disagreements were reported by 47% of participants, but disagreements occurred on only 7% of reported dates. In 61% of the disagreement situations, the man complied with the woman's refusal without question. Verbal and/or physical coercion was reported in 25% of the disagreement situations. These results suggest that although sexual coercion is a part of some dating relationships, it does not characterize our dating system to the degree suggested by Clark and Lewis (1977). Characteristics of the disagreement situation and their relationship to male compliance are reported and discussed.",

Gendered school uniform policies are also problematic, not only because they send clear messages about difference, but also because often the female options are often impractical and uncomfortable.

      "abstract": "Positive and negative effects of play behavior are modeled in a life-historical cost-benefit framework in order to derive predictions about optimal age-dependent scheduling of play. The model predicts that not all animal species will exhibit play behavior, that play should be more frequent in K-selected species than in r-selected species, that younger animals should tend to devote more time and energy to play than older animals, that adults of some species should play, and that in the ontogeny of animals exhibiting play, behavior patterns required in adulthood should appear in play as soon as or soon after they appear in the animal's general behavioral repertory. Alternative optimal strategies, one or more including play and one or more excluding play, may frequently evolve in different subpopulations of the same species in the same environment. These theoretical results indicate that the role of random processes in the evolution of life-history strategies and life-table schedules, and in the evolution of play and perhaps of other social behaviors, may be substantially greater than supposed heretofore. Data on play behavior in additional species are of interest in the context of these predictions.",

      "abstract": "Dean's Alienation Scale (DAS) was administered to 137 Korean immigrants, aged sixty years or older, who had resided in the United States for at least one year but not more than fifteen years. The study was made in order to determine the relationship of alienation to the independent variables of place of residence (an ethnically homogeneous Korean community in Los Angeles vs. ethnically heterogeneous communities in Oklahoma), gender, age, years of education, time in the United States, living with or without children, and living with or without a spouse. Significant relationships (p less than .01) were found between one or more of the subscales of the DAS (powerlessness, normlessness, social isolation, and total alienation) and place of residence, age, time in the United States, and whether living with or without a spouse. Simultaneous regression analyses were performed to determine the relative contribution of the independent variables to each of the subscales.",

      "abstract": "In some species, female condition correlates positively with preferences for male secondary sexual traits. Women's preferences for sexually dimorphic characteristics in male faces (facial masculinity) have recently been reported to covary with self-reported attractiveness. As women's attractiveness has been proposed to signal reproductive condition, the findings in human (Homo sapiens) and other species may reflect similar processes. The current study investigated whether the covariation between condition and preferences for masculinity would generalize to 2 further measures of female attractiveness: other-rated facial attractiveness and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR). Women with high (unattractive) WHR and/or relatively low other-rated facial attractiveness preferred more \"feminine\" male faces when choosing faces for a long-term relationship than when choosing for a short-term relationship, possibly reflecting diverse tactics in female mate choice.",

      "abstract": "Lemah dalam berkomunikasi dan gagal dalam mengungkapkan pendapat atau apa yang ada dalam pikiran seseorang akan membuat individu tersebut merasa tertekan dan menimbulkan masalah dalam berhubungan sosial dengan orang lain. Kemampuan berkomunikasi dan penyesuaian diri yang baik dan efektif terutama sangat diperlukan oleh para remaja. Hal ini sesuai dengan salah satu tugas perkembangan masa remaja yang tersulit yaitu berhubungan dengan penyesuaian sosial. Masa remaja dikenal sebagai usia bermasalah, remaja dituntut berperilaku sesuai aturan kelompok, dimana aturan tersebut seringkali berbeda dengan cara, kebiasaan dan norma yang diterapkan oleh keluarga. Remaja harus cermat dalam membedakan yang benar dan salah. Aturan kelompok kadangkala memaksa sehingga remaja perlu berperilaku asertif untuk melindungi diri dari pergaulan yang tidak baik. Lebih dari 200 remaja perempuan meninggal setiap hari disebabkan komplikasi pengguguran, perilaku seks pranikah itu cenderung dilakukan karena pengaruh teman sebaya. Dari berbagai dampak yang ada dapat dilihat bahwa kerugian terbesar dialami remaja perempuan. Remaja perempuan kurang dapat berpikir logis disaat mendapat bujukan atau rayuan dari pacarnya, remaja perempuan juga perlu bersikap tegas terhadap bujukan atau pengaruh laki-laki untuk melakukan hubungan seks sebelum menikah. Tujuan penelitian ini adalah untuk mengetahui perbedaan asertifitas remaja ditinjau dari jenis kelamin.\r\nPenelitian ini merupakan penelitian kuantitatif. Sampel penelitian adalah remaja yang berusia antara 14-15 tahun, sedang menempuh pendidikan di tingkat SMP kelas III berjumlah 120 orang yang di ambil dengan menggunakan teknik quota sampling. Sedangkan metode pengumpulan data yang digunakan adalah skala likert yaitu skala perilaku asertif. Pengambilan data dilakukan pada tanggal 22 - 25 Februari 2011. Adapun metode analisis yang digunakan dalam penelitian ini adalah Independent sample t-test dengan program SPSS 13.00 for windows.\r\nBerdasarkan hasil penelitian yang dilakukan, diperoleh kesimpulan bahwa ada perbedaan asertifitas remaja yang sangat signifikan ditinjau dari jenis kelamin, laki-laki (157.78) sedangkan perempuan (147.63). Hasil uji hipotesis menunjukkan t = 2.925; p = 0.004. Dengan demikian hipotesis di terima, hasil ini menunjukkan bahwa terdapat perbedaan yang sangat signifikan asertifitas remaja laki-laki dan remaja perempuan. Dimana remaja laki-laki lebih asertif daripada remaja perempuan. Sedangkan pada tiap aspeknya, berdasarkan uji t-test diperoleh bahwa pada aspek mengungkapkan perasaan positif (t = 2.296; p = 0.023) menunjukkan adanya perbedaan yang signifikan antara laki-laki dan perempuan dalam mengungkapkan perasaan positif. Perbedaan yang sangat signifikan antara laki-laki dan perempuan terdapat pada aspek afirmasi diri (t = 2.810; p = 0.006) dan aspek mengungkapkan perasaan negatif (t = 3.178; p = 0.002).",

Men and women (N = 78) role played the part of a parent who has placed an advertisement for a full-time babysitter. They received information about a male or female, heterosexual or homosexual applicant (randomly assigned). Although participants preferred to hire (and felt more comfortable leaving their children with) a heterosexual woman than any other type of applicant, they believed that homosexual men and women were as knowledgeable about aspects of child care, e.g., nutrition, first aid, as their heterosexual peers. The least preferred child care worker was a heterosexual man, perhaps because such a target is inconsistent with traditional sex-role expectations.",

Despite sample differences and differences in sources of information and in the variables used to measure both childhood predictors and adult outcomes, some striking replications appear with respect to childhood predictors of adult antisocial behaviour. All types of antisocial behaviour in childhood predict a high level of antisocial behaviour in adulthood and each kind of adult antisocial behaviour is predicted by the number of childhood antisocial behaviours, indicating that adult and childhood antisocial behaviour both form syndromes and that these syndromes are closely interconnected. Also confirmed across studies are: (1) adult antisocial behaviour virtually requires childhood antisocial behaviour; (2) most antisocial children do not become antisocial adults; (3) the variety of antisocial behaviour in childhood is a better predictor of adult antisocial behaviour than is any particular behaviour; (4) adult antisocial behaviour is better predicted by childhood behaviour than by family background or social class of rearing; (5) social class makes little contribution to the prediction of serious adult antisocial behaviour.",

      "title": "A social-cognitive appraisal of sex-role development",
      "abstract": "AbstractDuring the past decade there has been a proliferation of research on the topic of sex-role development. This paper presents a comprehensive, cognitively based approach to sex-role development with reference to the recent literature on social cognition. This approach uses methods that enable a better appraisal of the cognitive bases of sex-related information in even very young children. By employing research methods more relevant to the everyday experiences of young children, it is demonstrated that they are more cognitively and socially competent than the more traditional research and theories of sex-role development suggest. Thus, it is unnecessary to resort exclusively to biological proclivities to explain the early emergence of sex-typed behaviour in young children. It is also shown that boys and girls follow different developmental paths in the acquisition of sex-typed behaviour and knowledge. Boys and girls are parallel in their knowledge and performance of sex-appropriate activities. The major difference in development between boys and girls is in their knowledge and performance of activities more usually associated with the opposite sex. Thus, (a) boys imitate male models and reject female models (except when female models behave in accord with the male sex role); girls imitate both female models and, to a lesser extent, male models; (b) boys know little about girls' activities; girls are well informed about girls' and boys' activities.",

      "abstract": "Abstract There is little empirical research on the sport experiences of gay and lesbian recreational athletes in Germany and their existence and needs within organized, non-professional sports have largely been ignored. Based on twelve in-depth interviews with self-identified male gay and female lesbian adults, this paper explores how queer recreational athletes experience sport in German sports clubs and which particular challenges or discriminatory situations they are confronted with. Findings show that study participants do not experience much discrimination on an explicit level in the sports clubs. Nevertheless, many respondents try to hide their sexuality in the sports context to prevent possible discrimination and questions about their sexuality. After all, it is mainly the discussion about and reduction of their sexuality that is being experienced as problematic. Five main stressors have been identified: (1) the necessity of an outing, (2) the sports club typical mode of communication, (3) the heteronormative pre-structuring of the sports, (4) the feeling of otherness and the assigned special role, (5) the implicit fear of discrimination. The findings point to the need for increased reflection on and reduction of heteronormative structures in German sports clubs.",

      "abstract": "Based on semistructured interviews with 56 women who had at least one same-sex relationship prior to age 30, I conclude that sport both nurtures, and to a lesser degree hinders, development of these relationships. Homophobia on particular teams, sometimes triggered by the masculine reputation of sport, often hindered the development of these women’s same-sex attractions/relationships. In contrast, sport often nurtured these attractions/relationships due to its: sex-segregation, demonstration of women’s capabilities, lack of heteronormative climate, emotional intensity, time-consuming nature, and similarity-inducing tendencies. In addition, sport more often nurtured these attractions/relationships when lesbian/bisexuals were present, teams were accepting of same-sex relationships, and the sport was perceived as gender neutral. I discuss the occupation of coaching, and the sport of softball, relative to these more general trends.",

      "abstract": "The goal of the present study was to identify whether children recognize the gender stereotypes prevalent within the increasingly popular princess, prince, and superhero characters. Interviews with 126 children from the northeast region of the Unites States (3–11 years old) indicated that children recognized the gender-typed personality traits of princesses, princes, and superheroes, with older children holding more gender-typed cognitions about the characters. Children's own-schemas (i.e., beliefs that apply to themselves) and superordinate schemas (i.e., include beliefs about others' preferences and behaviors) for the characters were mostly gender typed and congruent. Older children gender-typed princesses as for girls more than younger children, whereas older children considered superheroes to be for boys and girls more than younger children did. Older children also considered the characters to be for them less, potentially reducing the negative implications of exposure to gender-typed messages associated with the characters. Individual differences exist in children's perceptions of these fictional characters, with children's own androgyny being positively correlated with their perceptions of princesses' androgyny levels. Further, girls were more flexible in their stereotyping of princesses, noting they were \"for girls and boys\" more. The authors discuss the results' practical and theoretical implications.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Sexual dimorphisms in weaponry and aggression are common in species in which one sex (usually males) competes for access to mates or resources necessary for reproduction – sexually dimorphic weaponry and aggression, in other words, are frequently the result of intrasexual selection. In snapping shrimp, the major chela (snapping claw) can be a deadly weapon, and males of many species have larger chelae than females, a pattern readily interpreted as resulting from intrasexual selection. Thus, males might be expected to show more sex‐specific aggression than females, and be more aggressive overall. We tested these predictions in two species of snapping shrimp in a territorial defense context. Neither of these predictions was supported: in both species, females, but not males, engaged in sex‐specific aggression and females were more aggressive than males overall. These contrasting sexual dimorphisms – larger weaponry in males but higher aggression in females – highlight the importance of considering the function of weaponry and aggression in contexts other than direct competitions over mates. In addition, species differences in the degree of sexual dimorphism in chela size were due to differences in female, not male, chela size, and the species with greater sexual dimorphism in weaponry was significantly less aggressive overall; also, while paired and solitary males did not differ in residual chela size, for the species with greater sexual dimorphism, females carrying embryos had smaller residual chela sizes. These results suggest that understanding the sexual dimorphisms in weaponry and aggression in snapping shrimp requires understanding the relative costs and benefits of both in females as well as males.",

      "abstract": "Previous work has documented adolescents’ gender stereotype endorsement, or the extent to which one believes men or women should embody distinct traits. However, understanding of gender stereotype endorsement in gender diverse adolescents—those who identify as transgender, nonbinary, and/or gender nonconforming—is limited. Gender diverse adolescents’ experiences with gender raise the question of whether they endorse gender stereotypes with the same frequency as cisgender adolescents. In this study, we investigated three primary research questions: (1) if gender diverse (N = 144) and cisgender (N = 174) adolescents (13–17 years) and their parents (N = 143 parents of gender diverse adolescents, N = 160 parents of cisgender adolescents) endorse gender stereotypes; (2) whether these groups differed from one another in their endorsement of gender stereotypes; and (3) whether parents’ gender stereotyping was related to either their adolescents’ stereotyping and/or their adolescents’ predictions of their parents’ stereotyping. We found (1) that participants showed low amounts of stereotyping; (2) there were no significant differences between gender stereotype endorsement in gender diverse and cisgender adolescents (or between their parents), though parents endorsed stereotypes slightly less than adolescents; and (3) there was a small positive association between adolescents’ stereotyping and their parents’ gender stereotyping. We discuss the limitations of our methods, and the possibility that rates of explicit stereotype endorsement may be changing over time.",

      "title": "Sex Differences in Desired Characteristics of Short-Term and Long-Term Relationship Partners",
      "abstract": "This investigation compared women's and men's desired characteristics in partners for typical short-term ('dating someone more than once' without an expectation of a short- or long-term relationship) and long-term ('dating someone for a long time' with the possibility, but not certainty, of marriage) relationships. Results indicated that (a) both women and men are more selective when selecting a long-term rather than a short-term relationship partner, and (b) women and men differ in their desired characteristics for short-term relationship partners and long-term relationship partners. The preferred characteristics of each sex support a qualified differential parental investment perspective: men see `reproductive value' (e.g., physical attractiveness) as important for potential female partners, and women look at `resource acquisition ability' (e.g., earning capacity) as important for potential male partners. While there were significant differences between men and women in their desired characteristics in short- and long-term relationship partners, there were many similarities in what they seek, such as the desire for children in long-term partners and an exciting personality in short-term and long-term partners.",

      "abstract": "Empirical research on the origins of kinky erotic desires (e.g., sadomasochism, bondage, domination/submission, roleplaying, sexual fetishism, etc.) has been limited and rarely rooted in the narratives of kinky people themselves. Among a sample of 260 self-identified kinky users of a kink-oriented social networking website living in 21 countries, we examined self-reported narratives of the origins of kink desires. An inductive coding process by four independent coders yielded 20 categories of responses, organized into five broad discourses about the origins of kinky desires: identity (e.g., personality, personal taste, and role exploration; 72.7% of responses), nurture (e.g., both traumatic and non-traumatic life experiences; 38.1% of responses), negation (e.g., disavowing or doubting a particular idea about the origins of their kink interests; 24.6% of responses), nature (e.g., biology and genetics; 22.7% of responses), and uncertainty (e.g., not being able to identify an origin of kinky desires; 10.4% of responses). Fewer than 19% of participants mentioned any kind of trauma in their responses. We discuss implications for scientific understandings of kinky sexual desire within the umbrella of sexual diversity.",

Index subjects are significantly more likely than controls to have a history of<i>role redefinition in family of origin</i>, and this is seen as being causally related to a motivational structure which predisposes them to risk unwanted pregnancy. Principal components of role redefinition are: (1) the daughter taking over some elements of her mother's role as wife or housekeeper; (2) the daughter's alienation from the mother; and (3) intimacy between the father and daughter which excludes the mother. The etiology appears to be distance and hostility in the parents' marriage. In addition to some combination of these circumstances having been present during adolescence, index subjects differ from controls in saying that their most important relationships have been with men, in disliking sex, and in receiving inadequate support from female friends and relatives.",

      "abstract": "Fear of missing out (FoMO) creates a strong urge to stay continuously connected and informed about peers’ activities, identified as a risk factor for problematic social media use and risky behaviors. Sexting is generally defined as the exchange of sexually suggestive or explicit photos, videos, or text messages through cell phones or other technologies. Despite its social relevance, the link between FoMO and sexting remains underexplored. This study examines their relationship in young adults—an understudied group compared to adolescents—while controlling for age, sex, and sexual orientation. The study surveyed 911 Italian young adults (18–30 years, Mage = 22.3, SDage = 2.57, 74% women, 70.4% heterosexual) through an online questionnaire. The results indicate that FoMO predicts only risky sexting behaviors (sexting under substance use and sexting for emotion regulation) while not influencing experimental sexting (sending one’s own sexts). Additionally, the link between FoMO and sexting for emotion regulation is stronger among LGB individuals. Therefore, FoMO has proven to be strongly related to the two kinds of risky sexting but not to experimental sexting. Understanding this relationship can inform prevention and intervention programs on relationships, online communication, and sexting in young adults.",

The purpose was to examine relationships between specific forms of early abuse and later adult sexuality, and to assess potential gender and ethnic differences in these associations. Independent of other forms of abuse, sexual abuse in females was significantly positively related to sexual drive and experience, range of sexual fantasies, liberal sexual attitudes, frequency of intercourse and masturbation, and likelihood of engaging in unrestricted sexual behaviors and fantasies, and was negatively related to virginity status. Among males, emotional abuse was significantly associated with poor body image and sexual dissatisfaction, independent of the other forms of abuse. There were no significant differences in associations between early abuse and sexuality between persons of Southeast Asian and European ancestry.",

Es gibt aber auch körperlich gesunde Männer, die in ihrem Leben bei einem versuchten Koitus keine Erregung hatten. Ihre sexuelle Reaktion ist derart gehemmt, daß sie daran zweifeln, jemals sexuelle Befriedigung mit einem Sexualpartner zu finden. So kann zum Beispiel ein Junge von einer besitzergreifenden Mutter erzogen worden sein, die ihm niemals gestattete, sich selbstständig zu entwickeln. Oder es wurde ihm beigebracht, daß Sexualität etwas schmutziges, gefährliches sei. Versagt er dann beim ersten Koitus, so kann er unfähig werden, die negative Erfahrung zu überwinden. Ein anderer Mann verspürt möglicherweise homosexuelle Tendenzen; dieser zu bewältigende Konflikt kann zum Versagen führen. In diesen Fällen ist eine intensive Sexualtherapie erfolgversprechend, denn der Betroffene benötigt mehr Hilfe als er von seiner Partnerin erwarten kann. Tritt eine Sexualstörung vorübergehend auf, sind die Partner am besten beraten, zunächst die Situation zu akzeptieren und sich klar zu machen, daß ein Mann nicht zwingend eine Erektion benötigt, um die Partnerin zu befriedigen. In den meisten Fällen wird ein Mann ein anderes Mal, unter günstigeren Bedingungen, wieder eine Erektion bekommen.",

In Study 1, an American sample of participants (N = 407, ages 18-64) completed a 12-item survey on perceptions of sex differences in deception. In Study 2, a Korean sample (N = 197, ages 19-58) completed the same survey. Men from both cultures and Korean women perceived no difference regarding which sex tells more white (i.e., relatively harmless or low-stakes) lies. American women perceived that women tell more white lies. Women from both cultures and American men perceived that men tell a greater number of serious (i.e., nonwhite or high-stakes) lies. Korean men perceived no difference regarding which sex tells a greater number of serious lies. Both sexes from both countries reported a perception that (1) men are more likely to lie about height, income, and sexual infidelity, (2) women are more likely to lie about weight and age, and (3) women are better at lying. The findings were mixed regarding perceptions about emotional infidelity. Results are interpreted in light of sex-different challenges to mating and parenting.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Paraphilia or deviance is sexual stimulation or action that deviates from normal sexual behavior, but is necessary for some people to experience arousal and orgasm. People with paraphilia have unusual sexual interests, including inanimate objects, places, or individuals (children and corpses), and animals. Another paraphilic disorder involving a disapproving individual is characterized by a persistent and intense pattern of atypical sexual arousal manifested by sexual thoughts, fantasies, compulsions, or behavior in which the focus of the arousal pattern involves the other person being unwilling or unable to consent. However, it is not specifically described in any of the other so-called Paraphilic Disorder categories (e.g., arousal patterns involving corpses or animals). CASE REPORT: Here, we report a case of a male patient aged 37 years, unmarried status, his last education graduated from elementary school, the patient complained that he had frequent contact with cows, he had been experiencing it for 2 years, he felt lonely and had no close friends. As a child, he was often scolded and beaten by his father. He is also often teased by his friends. CONCLUSION: Zoophilia is another paraphilic disorder involving disapproving individuals characterized by a persistent and intense pattern of atypical sexual arousal manifested by sexual thoughts, fantasies, drives, or behaviors in which the focus of the arousal pattern involves the animal. This case is rarely reported because sufferers think their actions are not harmful, lack of parental attention and supervision may be one of the causes of this disorder.",

Several themes emerged from the data. First, males’ and females’ judgments of what members of the opposite-sex seek were generally accurate. Second, males and females both feel that they fall short of perceived opposite-sex expectations in a few areas. Third, both males and females desire an ideal partner better than themselves, but this is especially true for females.

We suggest that moral opposition to these behaviors may partly stem from their perceived effects on men’s sexual responses. We hypothesized that (a) people would stereotype men as having relatively less control of their sexual urges (i.e., lower sexual self-control) compared to women and that (b) stereotypes about men’s sexual self-control would uniquely predict attitudes about women’s mundane (but potentially sexually arousing) behaviors. Five studies show that (a) people stereotyped men (vs. women) as lacking sexual self-control (Study 1) and (b) endorsement of this stereotype was associated with opposition to public breastfeeding and immodest clothing (Studies 2-5). The effects hold even after controlling for potential confounds and seem specific to relevant moral domains, although women (vs. men) tend not to view these behaviors as moral issues.",

      "title": "Contest Competition for Mates and the Evolution of Human Males",
      "abstract": "Abstract Accumulating evidence suggests that the phenotypes of human males were shaped by contest competition, the mode of sexual selection in which mating opportunities are obtained by using force or threat of force to exclude same-sex competitors. Phylogenetic, paleontological, and archaeological data indicate a great antiquity for male–male violence in our lineage, and human males possess a constellation of traits that suggest specialization for contest competition. Relative to females, males exhibit greater stature, muscle mass, strength, speed, aerobic capacity, ability to dissipate exercise heat loads, craniofacial robusticity, pain tolerance, risk-taking, behavioral displays of physical prowess and acuity to the formidability of same-sex conspecifics, outgroup discrimination, and a propensity to participate in dyadic and coalitional violence. Parallel evidence suggests that some characteristics that distinguish hominins from the other great apes increase formidability in fights (e.g., handheld weapons, habitual bipedalism, and proportions of the hand and face) or function to increase perceptions of dominance (e.g., low vocal frequencies). Many of these traits are consistent with having been shaped by contest competition over mates: they develop or elaborate at sexual maturity and predict success in male contests, mating, and reproduction. Although alternative evolutionary explanations for some of these sexually dimorphic traits are possible, the most parsimonious explanation is that they have been preserved by selection because they aided in contest competition among males throughout human evolutionary history. The evolutionary roots of much of the aggression, intolerance, and violence that plagues modern societies may ultimately lie in the selection that shaped our mating system.",

The first hypothesis, rooted in life history theory, is that the sex differences develop among children who experience adverse environmental conditions (e.g., harsh parenting). The second hypothesis, grounded in gender self‐socialization theory, is that the sex differences develop among children who identify confidently with their gender collective. Data from an ethnically/racially diverse sample (443 girls, 420 boys; M age = 11.1 years) supported the second hypothesis: Sex differences were evident mainly among children who felt gender‐typical, were content with their gender, or felt pressure to avoid cross‐sex behavior. Further, sex differences were generally smaller rather than larger among children experiencing adverse environments.",

In general, the parents of the normal adolescents expected their sons to be more achieving, dominating, and enduring than the parents of the other adolescents, which is consistent in regard to the personality traits that differentiated the adolescents from each other. The results suggest that the possession of certain traits, such as dominance and endurance, appear to be important for adequate functioning in adolescent males.",

      "title": "SEX DIFFERENCES AND SIMILARITIES IN FREQUENCY AND INTENSITY OF SEXUAL DESIRE",
      "abstract": "Only within the past decade have social scientists commonly recognized the phenomenon of sexual desire as a distinct and vital component of human sexual response. Of the various factors believed to be associated with sexual desire, gender (biological sex) is presumed by many theorists to be one of the most important. Limited empirical work suggests that men experience desire more frequently than do women; however, sex differences in intensity or level of desire have yet to be examined. This study explored both the self-reported frequency and intensity of sexual desire among an ethnically diverse sample of 676 men and women. As hypothesized, men reported experiencing a higher overall level of sexual desire than did women. Sex differences also were found with respect to frequency of sexual desire. Men reported experiencing sexual desire more often than did women and, when asked to estimate the actual frequency with which they experienced desire, men's estimated frequency (37 times per week) was significantly higher than women's (9 times per week). These results do not imply that men always feel desire or that women lack sexual desire. In fact, virtually every participant in this study reported feeling sexual desire on a regular basis. This suggests that desire may be the most universal sexual response experienced by both men and women.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Rejection sensitivity is the disposition to anxiously expect, readily perceive, and intensely react to rejection by significant others. A model of the role of this disposition in male violence toward romantic partners is proposed. Specifically, it is proposed that rejection sensitivity is a vulnerability factor for two distinct maladaptive styles of coping with intimate relationships. Rejection‐sensitive men may attempt to prevent anticipated rejection by reducing their investment in intimate relationships. Alternatively, they may become highly invested in intimate relationships in search of an unconditionally supportive partner. Their low threshold for perceiving and overreacting to rejection, however, heightens their risk of responding aggressively to their partners’negative or ambiguous behavior. Cross‐sectional data from 217 male college students supported predictions derived from the model. Among college men who reported relatively high investment in romantic relationships, anxious expectations of rejection predicted dating violence. Among men who reported relatively low investment in romantic relationships, anxious expectations of rejection predicted reduced involvement in discretionary close relationships with friends and romantic partners and, more generally, increased distress in and avoidance of social situations.",

      "abstract": "Deviance is defined by negative reactions enacted by audiences to behaviour, expressed beliefs, and/or the possession of undesirable characteristics. Audiences vary in their reactions; what’s wrongful in one audience may be acceptable in another—hence, deviance is relative to audience, society, subgroup, context, and historical time. Typically, reactions express negative attitudes toward the violations of a strongly-held norm. Such reactions are varied, and include condemnation, withdrawing from the presence of the offender, and the unwillingness to join in interaction with the offending party or parties. Most members of the society can perform a mental experiment to picture what these reactions are likely to be for a range of audiences. The researcher conducted a survey among 60 park-goers to determine what is considered wrongful in the park. In the park, multiple parties put on performances of extremely eccentric or deviant behaviour. Felonious crime is very rare in the park; milder forms of deviance are common, however, including offensive staring and selling marijuana. Public gay sex, which used to be common, has all but disappeared there.",

      "abstract": "Separate lines of research show that men overestimate the extent of male peers' sexual activity, and independently, that sexually aggressive men believe that other men approve of coercive behavior. This study examined the intersection of these lines of inquiry, testing whether the degree of male participants' misperception of other men's sexual behavior differs as a function of perpetrator status. In a national sample, we presented heterosexually active men (n = 497) with sexual scenarios varying in sexual acts, partner types, and circumstances. Results showed that participants significantly overestimated the typicality of all types of sexual situations for other men. Participants also misjudged the desirability of scenarios consistent with a traditional masculinity sexual script to other men; these scenarios reflected an adversarial perspective on relationships and an impersonal approach to sexuality – a known risk factor for sexual aggression. Further, sexually aggressive men overestimated the desirability of these traditional masculinity scenarios to a greater extent than non-aggressive peers. Findings suggest that interventions that provide accurate knowledge about social norms, or \"typical\" sexual desires and behaviors among other men, may reduce pressure to live up to perceived but perhaps inaccurate masculine ideals, as well as reduce social norm-related risks for sexually aggressive behavior.",

The effects of familiarity with children on adults' sex-typed perceptions of those children were examined by manipulating the amount of exposure to 6-year-old boys playing in a variety of environmental settings. 197 men and women (18-28 years old) were assigned to 1 of 3 exposure conditions (0, 2, or 6 settings). Compared to subjects who observed the boys in a limited number of settings, those who had the maximum exposure displayed less adherence to sex-stereotypes, describing them as having not only more masculine, but also more feminine personality traits and interests.

      "title": "Contextual Information Shifts Young Children’s Understanding of Gender Constancy",
      "abstract": "Children's understanding of the stability of gender over time has long been recognized as a hallmark of early childhood cognitive development. Prior research has argued that until roughly age 6, children do not understand that a person’s gender identity remains consistent if the person undergoes a change in gendered behavior or appearance. However, this prior work has generally not given children any context as to why the behavior or appearance change is occurring. The present study showed 3-to-5-year-olds a character (e.g., “Johnny”) undergo such a change that occurred because of external factors (e.g., “Johnny is wearing his sister’s dress because all his clothes are dirty”); we asked whether children would indicate that the character’s gender was the same pre- and post-change. Children (N = 124, 52% girls, 66% non-Hispanic White) as young as 3 demonstrated understanding of gender consistency and were significantly more likely to endorse gender consistency when they were, versus were not, given context for the change (p &amp;lt; 0.001, Cohen’s d = 0.88). Results suggest that children take context into account when conceptualizing others’ genders and believe that gender is generally consistent across transformations in behavior or appearance by age 3. We discuss the implications of these findings in light of a broader literature about children’s understanding of gender constancy as well as contemporary understandings of gender that sometimes accommodate the idea that a person’s gender can change.",

Results of a study using the empathic accuracy paradigm and signal detection analyses revealed that the greater the husbands’ bias to overattribute criticism and rejection to the thoughts and feelings of women they had never met, the more the husbands reported behaving in a verbally aggressive way toward their own wives. This finding discourages the conclusion that maritally aggressive men are uniquely provoked by their own female partners, and instead suggests that they are biased to overattribute criticism and rejection to women in general. The strength of this overattribution bias correlated negatively with the men’s accuracy in inferring the actual content of the women’s thoughts and feelings. On the other hand, the husbands’ thematic accuracy (their ability to accurately specify which of the stimulus women’s thoughts and feelings really were critical or rejecting) was associated with their self‐reported marital satisfaction.",

These schema interpret and organize sexual information and attitudes, and can guide sexual behavior. This study examined how plurisexual attractions may interact with gender to predict SSS. I surveyed 602 young adults about their gender, patterns of attractions to men, women, and gender non-binary people, and SSS using the validated SSS Scale. In this sample, SSS were similar across participants with monosexual vs. plurisexual patterns of attraction. However, a few significant effects emerged. Cisgender women with low attraction to any gender reported significantly lower romantic/passionate self-schema relative to women with at least some attraction to one or more genders. In contrast, cisgender men with exclusively same-gender attractions reported higher open/liberal self-schema relative to men with either exclusively other-gender or plurisexual attractions. Novel to this study, 22% percent of participants reported attractions to gender non-binary and gender non-conforming people, and these attractions significantly predicted SSS. These findings point to subtle gender differences in how attractions interact with young people's conceptualization of their sexual selves.",

Examples of the same sort of phenomena described by Kluft are repeatedly observed in therapy with members of this population, but usually not in a dramatic form. As might be anticipated, in order to survive, when an individual is closely attached to a long-term and extreme abuser, the sort of enduring ambivalence carried by the victim towards their primary abuser is manifested in compartmentalized states that wish their abuser dead, while other states in equally compartmentalized ways maintain the attachment via the use of sex-by continuing to be sexually involved with their primary abuser (usually their father), by fantasizing about sex with their abuser, by being sexually involved with those who co-abused with their father, or by staging reenactments with individuals whose sexual behavior re-evokes the abuse by the absent (or deceased) father. The process of healing means that inevitably some manifestations of the responses to such abuse spill over into therapy.",

      "abstract": "Abstract This book discusses cases where it’s unclear whether a person’s consent to sex should count as valid consent, the kind of consent that makes it permissible for the person they give consent to to have sex with them. Clear cases of coercion, for example, involve the threat of significant physical harm. But what should we say about cases involving the threat of harms that are relatively insignificant or that involve no physical harm at all? Impersonating someone’s spouse to trick them into saying yes to sex is clearly seriously wrong, but what about the more mundane kinds of lies people tell when they’re trying to meet someone? It’s wrong to have sex with someone who says yes when they’re so drunk they’re about to pass out and not wrong if they say yes after having a few sips of beer. What, though, should we say about the more difficult cases in the middle where it’s genuinely unclear whether they’ve had too much to drink? What’s the most reasonable view about other forms of incompetent consent to sex, like those involving young children, elderly dementia patients, or people born with severe and permanent cognitive impairments? And what about cases of problematic sexual consent that don’t involve coercion, deception, or incompetence at all? Can a patient give valid consent to sex with their therapist? Can the offer of a large amount of money in exchange for sex invalidate the sexual consent the offer elicits? This book addresses these and related questions.",

No differences were found between aggressive boys and non-aggressive boys, suggesting that aggressive perceivers do not necessarily “project” their own characteristics onto others. However, learning disabled boys both aggressive and non-aggressive, found all scenes more unfriendly.

We find, however, women often describe fantasy sports as a male/masculine space in which they are highly visible and have their ability to compete like men questioned, largely because of gendered assumptions regarding sports knowledge. Women’s attitudes and behaviors frequently reproduce traditional gender dynamics, although women also engage in behaviors and assert definitions of themselves that are potentially transformative—implicitly and explicitly pushing the boundaries of what females are expected to be and accomplish in sport. Often, however, they simultaneously reproduce and resist men’s dominance and women’s marginalization, exercising (1) “mediated agency” by using men to improve their fantasy sports experience and play or (2) “conflicted agency” by reinforcing or accepting gender stereotypes about women while using those stereotypes to their advantage or positioning themselves as atypical women to whom the stereotypes do not apply.",

Specifically, LGBTQ+ refers to individuals who may identify as lesbian (L), gay (G), bisexual (B), transgender (T), queer (Q), or other sexual and/or gender identities (+). Given that many individuals live in heteronormative and cisnormative societies, the LGBTQ+ community experiences unique stressors specific to their traditionally marginalized identity/identities; such experiences are defined as experiences of <italic>minority stress</italic>. Aspects of minority stress, including stigma, prejudice, and discrimination, generate stressful social environments for LGBTQ+ individuals and these experiences are often negatively associated with individual and relationship well-being. For example, if an individual experiences harassment for their sexual and/or gender identity, they may experience feelings of distress and be more reserved with public displays of affection with their partner. As such, one romantic partner’s experience of minority stress can impact both they and their partner’s experiences. Relationship maintenance behaviors, such as communicating and coping with the stress together with one’s partner (dyadic coping), have been identified that may help mitigate minority stress’ deleterious effects. Dyadic coping is a process that conceptualizes how partners cope with stress in the context of their relationship, identifying how partners communicate their stress and the respective coping behaviors. Finally, there has been an insurgence of relationship education programs designed to help LGBTQ+ couples identify and cope with experiences of minority stress. For example, the Couples Coping Enhancement Training–Sexual Minority Stress incorporates the unique experiences of sexual minority couples to help couples improve (minority) stress management; enhance their ability to cope as a couple; sensitize both partners to ideas of mutual fairness, equity, and respect; improve communication; and improve (emotional) problem-solving skills.",

      "title": "[Psychological aspects of voluntary induced abortion among fathers drafted into military service].",
      "abstract": "This work examines the symptomatology of 4 young men recently drafted into military service in France who had negative reactions to their partner's abortions. The men ranged in age from 19-21 years. In all cases there was frank depression, accompanied or not by activity illegal in the eyes of the military (unauthorized leave) or of the common law (theft, use of drugs). The abortion was either a pretext for a rapid decompensation of a pathological personality, or it occasioned a crisis in personalities previously relatively well adapted despite immaturity, psychopathology, or weakness. The organization of the couples tended to be recent, unstable, precarious, and without a promising future either affectively or socioeconomically. Either the woman decided to seek an abortion herself and presented the father with an accomplished fact, or the couple tacitly made a joint decision to seek an abortion, in which case the subsequent illegal activity of the father tended to be more serious. Each of the men had conflictive family relationships with their fathers especially perceived as hostile and rejecting. All of the men had attempted suicide or had considered it. Induction into the army has traditionally been seen as a rite of passage to adult life, but in some cases the emotional distances it causes and the socioeconomic difficulties it aggravates prevent the man from undertaking the responsibilities of fatherhood. In these cases it is as if social maturity can be acquired only at the expense of fatherhood; the 2 states cannot coexist. Frustration and sacrifice of fatherhood nevertheless may occasion loss of the social maturity stemming from military service. The abortion is followed by guilt, psychic suffering, and behavioral problems leading to expulsion from the military. On the symbolic level the man does not become either man or father. Another point is that depression, anxiety, and guilt are an affective expression of the idea of death; the embryo is thought of as an infant when in fact it is only potentially an infant. On the unconscious level the father may identify with the aborted fetus in the belief that his own parents may have wanted to destroy him. The abortion may also contain a suicidal element to the extent that the fetus represents a prolongation of the parent. The anxiety and guilt of the father find expression also in auto- and heteroaggressive acts. Through a mechanism of projection, responsibility of the army is substituted for that of the individual.",

At one occasion they mated without any interference of the experimenter and at another they were handled approximately twice a minute. The older males, although sexually less vigorous than the younger males when copulating under non-handling conditions, when handled became quite as active as the younger males. It was concluded that the mating activity is determined not only by sexual stimuli but by non-sexual stimuli as well, and that the decrease in sexual activity characteristic to the old rat can be compensated for by an increase in the non-sexual sensory stimulation of the animal.",

Goals: Revise the inclusion criteria for hormone therapy and sex reassignment surgery in gender dysphoria. Expose the multidisciplinary approach. Make differential diagnosis with other psychological disorders. Case report: A 25 years old female patient, biological male. Results: It reported favorably to start hormone treatment after completing the eligibility criteria: > 18 years old; knowledge of the effects of hormones; and more 3 months documented real-life experience. Laboratory tests are done every 3 months during the first year and then, every 6 months. Conclusions: ?Is the Gender Disphoria a pathology? The EU recommends a reclassification as no pathological disorders in ICD-11.The treatment of gender dysphoria is necessary, and there is no reason to postpone it.The main difficulty is the differential diagnosis; there may be comorbidity with others mental disorders which are not exclusive (psychotic disorder, OCD, personality disorders and other disorders of gender identity).",

      "title": "Pornographic Films and Unconscious Homosexual Desires: An Hypothesis",
      "abstract": "The possibility that heterosexual behavior may serve to gratify unconscious homosexual desires has been noted. Blanchard (1959) , for example, discussed group rape and noted that the sharing of a female for sexual purposes in one another's presence might well gratify unconscious homosexual desires of the males cornmicting the sexual assault. Men who have certain heterosexual preferences (such as anal intercourse or female partners who have masculine characteristics) may also be gratifying unconscious homosexual desires. The purpose of this paper is to suggest that a similar inference could be made about males who habitually attend heterosexual pornographic films. In a typical cinema in which pornographic films are shown, the audience is usually completely male, alchough no studies of the composiuon af audiences have been p u b lished. Most likely, a man watches these films in the presence of other men. If there is a period of live entertainment (dancing or sexual intercourse), the men typically move closer to the front for this, thereby sitting in close proximity. The content of pornographic films emphasizes close-up views of penises. Fellatio is prominent. All ejaculations are shown and the semen visible. There are also close-up views of the genital areas during intercourse. Aside from a few views of the female face and breast, the content is very similar to that of homosexual films, in which views of fellatio and intercourse also comprise most of the film. Heterosexual films also contain episodes in which one female services several males at one time, with a combination of fellatio, vaginal intercourse, and anal inrercourse. In these scenes, several men are sharing the same female, much as occurs in group rape, but of course without the use of force on an unwilling female. The audience, though not active participants, may be seen as passive participants. The theme of heterosexual pornographic films is that the males get pleasure. The females, though supposed to be enjoying the sexual activity, are used for male gratification. The films may be conceptualized as gloriFying the male penis and the male orgasm If it is correct to suspect that heterosexual pornographic films do gratify unconscious homosexual desires, then it might be hypothesized that males who habitually watch such films would give evidence of unconscious concerns as manifest, for example, in sexual impotency or on objective tests of unconscious homosexual desires that have been devised (Lester, 1974). Such studies have not yet been conducted.",

      "abstract": "Responses to conflict were studied in samples of college students from a highly collectivistic society (China, n = 207) and a highly individualistic society (United States n = 209). As predicted, the collectivistic society reported more conflict-reducing behaviors and less verbal or physical aggression. However, the effect of individualism/collectivism was moderated by both the ingroup/outgroup status of the target and gender of the participant. Chinese and US women did not differ on any measure. However, of the four groups, Chinese men reported the most conflict-reducing behaviors and the least physical aggression, whereas US men reported the fewest conflict-reducing behaviors and the greatest physical aggression. As predicted, conflict-reducing behaviors were more common in the ingroup condition and both verbal and physical aggression was more common in the outgroup condition. However, the latter were moderated by gender of the participant. US men reported greater physical aggression than any other group. Neither gender nor society had any effect on the level of indirect aggression. There were no gender or individualism/collectivism effects on indirect aggression. Observed gender effects were attributed to differences in how collectivistic and individualistic societies conceptualize masculinity. The effect sizes associated with the ingroup/outgroup condition were consistently and substantially larger than effect sizes associated with individualism/collectivism or gender. Aggr.

Some bisexual individuals internalize society's negative attitudes, resulting in an experience of self-stigma. Consequently, many bisexual individuals report a reduced sense of belonging. The current study explored whether self-stigma mediates the association between experiences of anti-bisexual prejudice and a sense of belonging within a bisexual sample (n = 529) while also identifying how experiences of anti-bisexual prejudice vary as a function of participant gender (man, woman, non-binary) and the source of prejudice (gay/lesbian or heterosexual). Self-stigma fully mediated the association between anti-bisexual experiences and a sense of belonging. Women and non-binary individuals reported more frequent anti-bisexual experiences than men, and all participants reported more frequent anti-bisexual experiences from heterosexual versus gay/lesbian sources. Efforts to improve a sense of belonging among bisexual individuals should focus on reducing anti-bisexual prejudice and anti-bisexual self-stigma.",

However, little empirical research has directly tested the role of sexual avoidance in samples of men with sexual problems. The goals of the current study were to A) assess the association between sexual avoidance, sexual function, and subjective sexual well-being, and B) explore possible predictors of sexual avoidance, including insecure attachment, activation of negative sexual schemas, and trait experiential avoidance. One hundred and fifty eight men with self-identified impairments in sexual function (low desire, erectile function, and/or premature/delayed ejaculation) completed validated self-report measures in a secure online survey. Sexual avoidance was uniquely predicted by most aspects of sexual function, and was correlated with poorer subjective sexual well-being. Higher levels of attachment avoidance and activation of negative schemas uniquely predicted more frequent sexual avoidance. Alternatively, interaction models suggested that impaired erectile function was less likely to be associated with sexual avoidance for those with high levels of attachment anxiety and for those with high levels of trait experiential avoidance. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.",

In this paper, we theorize that same-sex sexuality could be associated with either shorter or longer marital duration, and we use data from the 2011–2013 National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG) to examine the associations between three aspects of same-sex sexuality and marital duration among those who married and divorced once (N=617). Among the once-married/divorced, same-sex sexuality substantially reduces marital duration by approximately 18–24 months, on average, net of other variables. Supplemental analyses indicate that these associations do not differ by sex/gender but do differ in nuanced ways for individuals who are bisexually attracted (identified) compared to those who report, respectively, same-sex only or different-sex only attraction (heterosexual, bisexual and lesbian/gay identity). Between-group differences in age at marriage exert a substantial influence on the associations between same-sex sexuality and marital duration documented in the supplemental analyses of bisexuality. We discuss our findings in relation to the extant literature, the limitations of available data, and directions for future research.",

      "title": "Premarital Sexual Behavior and Religious Adolescents",
      "abstract": "Freshmen attending 8 colleges affiliated with the churches of Christ responded to questions about their religious behaviors, religious motivations, and premarital sexual behaviors. It is argued that a religious sample may be able to give us information about the relationship between religiosity and sexuality that more general samples could not. The religious and sexual characteristics of this conservative Christian sample are described, and are found to differ markedly from most samples studied in this area. In addition, a number of relationships are tested and discussed. The wellsubstantiated relationship between religious and sexual behavior is replicated, with some interesting points raised by the fact that this sample is more religiously active than any others reported to date. The relationship between religious orientation and premarital sexual activity is documented for the first time, and is found to be as strong a correlate as is religious behavior. Religious orientation and behavior are so highly related in this sample as to prove no more predictive of sexual activity when considered together than they do when taken separately. Finally, it is shown that, whereas the religious variables function to identify virginal adolescents with great accuracy (virgins are homogeneous in regard to religiosity), they do very poorly in identifying non-virginal adolescents (non-virgins are heterogeneous in regard to religiosity). It is suggested that there are third factor influences at work on non-virginal adolescents that have not (as yet) impacted virgins. The adolescent of today is faced with many behavioral choices, not the least of which involves whether and when the transition into premarital sexual activity will take place. Few topics are more controversial or more discussed than this; yet equally few topics are more important to the study of adolescence, the family, and society itself. A great deal of research effort has been expended in an attempt to understand that transition and the variables which influence the adolescent's decision about the matter.",

      "title": "Characteristics of Adolescents' Sexual Partners and Their Association with Use of Condoms and Other Contraceptive Methods",
      "abstract": "While a number of studies have examined the association between individuals' characteristics and their contraceptive use, few studies have examined the influence of partners' characteristics on individuals' contraceptive use.Using nationally representative data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, multiple logistic analyses were conducted to identify associations between the demographic characteristics of adolescents' heterosexual partners and adolescents' use of condoms or other contraceptive methods.The partners of white and black adolescents were likely to be similar to them, while the partners of Latino adolescents and of adolescents of \"other\" race or ethnicity were more likely to be of a different racial or ethnic group. Differences in age between adolescents and their partners were notable in all racial and ethnic groups. As adolescents age, the characteristics of their partners become more heterogeneous. The less similar adolescents and their partners are to one another--whether because of a difference in age, grade or school--the less likely adolescents are to use condoms and other contraceptive methods.Many adolescents have relationships with partners whose characteristics differ from theirs and with whom they are less likely to use condoms or other contraceptive methods. This behavior is more common as adolescents grow older. To provide appropriate counseling, sexuality educators and family planning providers need to consider the ways in which adolescents' relationships change as they age and discuss with them the dynamics of relationships involving partners who differ in age or other characteristics.",

      "title": "Western Sport and Spiritualism",
      "abstract": "Abstract Sport activity of achievement-oriented (professional, Olympic, spectacular character) is first of all exposition of rivalry and striving for variously understood sports success (resulting from measurable or discretionary criteria). It refers to winning a competition or taking another expected place as well as to other forms of satisfaction, such as financial gratification or social (political, ethnic, professional) recognition. Spirituality is here neither an aim, nor an expected value - it constitutes rather an additional or redundant quality. A competitor focuses his/her attention first of all on the main aim assumed in planned or current rivalry. Emotional sensations which are experienced by athletes before, during or after competitions testify to mental and emotional stress which accompanies sports combat. It is also difficult to associate spirituality or spiritualism with sport for all - like, for example, that of health-oriented character - sport of the disabled, physical education, sport of playful character or physical recreation. That difficulty results from the fact that neither spiritualism, nor spirituality inspires for physical activity in the abovementioned fields; neither spiritualism, nor spirituality is the outcome of activity in the realm of sport for all. Exceptions are constituted by ancient Olympic Games as well as by some experiences connected with recreational forms of tourism mediated through achievement-oriented sport (also by pre-Columbian Native American societies and Maoris aboriginal population of New Zealand). For example Hellenic Olympic Games were a highly spiritualized form of sports rivalry - including also rivalry in the field of art, and especially in the field of theatre. They were one of numerous forms of religious cult - of worshipping chosen gods from the Olympic pantheon. On the other hand, during mountain hiking and mountain climbing there can appear manifestations of deepened spirituality characteristic for the object of spiritualization of non-religious, quasi-religious or strictly religious qualities. I would like to explain - at the end of this short abstract - that spiritualism (which should not be confused with spiritism) is - generally speaking - first of all a philosophical term assuming, in ontological and axiological sense, that spiritual reality, self-knowledge, consciousness or mental experiences are components of the human being - components of a higher order having priority over matter. They constitute, in the anthropological context, beings of a higher order than the body. Spiritualism according to its popular interpretation means spirituality. Qualities which are ascribed to that notion in particular societies can be determined on the basis of empirically oriented sociological research. They make it possible to determine various ways of interpreting and understanding that notion as well as views or attitudes connected with it.",

      "title": "ATTITUDINAL DISTINCTIONS OF SOLO SEX ENGAGERS AMONG OLDER ADULTS",
      "abstract": "Abstract Solo sex gets little attention in the research on sexual activity of older adults as most studies frame definitions around partnered sexual behaviors. This does not reflect the reality of many older adults who lack active sexual partners due to death, dysfunction, or serious illness. When solo sex is included in studies, they rarely go beyond frequency. The aim of this study was to determine how sexually active older adults view solo sex, its importance, and attitude distinctions between solo sex engagers and non-engagers through survey research with a sample over age 60 (N=556). The majority (58%) of older adults engage in solo sex with men more likely (67%) than women (53%). As expected, solo sex engagers are twice as likely to use sexual toys and to be interested in using them if they currently do not. More solo sex engagers (70%) view orgasms as being extremely/very important for a good sexual experience than non-engagers (55%). Positive sexual outlooks correlate with solo sex as 80% of engagers anticipate an unlimited number of future orgasms compared to 65% of non-engagers. The most striking attitude distinction is 72% of engagers believe solo sex can be “great sex” compared to only 39% of non-engagers. Solo sex has psychological and physiological benefits for older adults and this study demonstrates solo sex correlates with positive sexual attitudes. The findings of this study highlight the need for further attention to the importance of solo sex for older adults and how it relates to positive sexual health.",

CHILD DEVELOPMENT, 1986, 57, 396-404. The present study tested a distinction between inferring new categories on the basis of property information (predicted to be difficult) and inferring new properties on the basis of category information (predicted to be easier). One group of preschoolers learned new properties for specific boys and girls and was asked to say which property a new child would have, given a gender label that conflicted with the child's appearance. Other children saw the identical stimuli but were to classify them as boy or girl when given a sex-linked property that conflicted with appearance. All children were also tested on gender constancy. As predicted, children performed poorly on gender constancy and the classification task but accurately inferred many sex-linked properties on the basis of category membership, ignoring conflicting perceptual information. Control conditions support the claim that these effects are not due to differential memory demands in the different conditions. Future research should distinguish between using a category as the basis for making property inferences and the developmentally later skill of classifying an object by using property information. Preschoolers can ignore conflicting perceptual information much more easily on the former than on the latter task.",

      "abstract": "Little research has investigated children’s perceptions of gender ambiguous individuals who are not part of a binary gender category. Five- to 8-year-olds were tested to determine whether appearance or conceptual information (i.e., occupation information, trait information) was prioritized when grouping a gender ambiguous target with other people. Children heard two stories with verbalized or no verbalized gender information. The target shared conceptual qualities with a character of stereotypical gender appearance (conceptual match) and appearance qualities with a character of gender ambiguous appearance (appearance match). Participants were asked which character the target should be friends with and which character’s novel activity preference the target shared. Results indicated that the inclusion of verbalized gender information did not systematically change children’s response patterns. However, older children prioritized trait information over appearance information, while younger children valued trait and appearance information equally. For the occupation story, children did not overwhelmingly prioritize occupation information, indicating that they might not regard occupation information as much as trait information when making predictions about gender ambiguous people. Implications include a better understanding of children’s beliefs about individuals who exist outside of strict social categories, which can inform ways to combat negativity and promote acceptance of people who deviate from group-based expectations.",

      "abstract": "While a few studies have investigated the sexual fantasies of adults reporting sexual attraction to minor, none, to the best of our knowledge, have focused on the specific types of content of these fantasies. In this qualitative study, we conducted content and thematic analyses of the sexual fantasies reported by an international sample of 112 adults reporting sexual attraction to minors recruited online. Seven themes were found: Minor-focused fantasies, Other paraphilic fantasies, Unrealistic fantasies, Incestuous fantasies, Adult-focused fantasies, Promiscuous fantasies, and Group sex fantasies. The sexual fantasies of adults reporting sexual attraction to minors exhibited diversity both in terms of the individuals involved and in the range of sexual practices imagined. However, much of the sexual fantasy content shared by participants was predominantly of a paraphilic nature. Approximately one-third of the fantasies involved minor as sexual partners, romantic partners, or featured participants imagining themselves as minors. Additionally, nearly half of the disclosed sexual fantasies referenced other paraphilic sexual interests, such as violence, fetishism, exhibitionism/voyeurism, body fluids, and zoophilia. Results of our research highlight the possibility of co-occurring paraphilic interests in adults reporting sexual attraction to minors.",

To address this gap, I use data from 61 in‐depth interviews with working‐ and middle‐class cohabiting men to examine their stated preferences should their partners experience an unplanned pregnancy. For some men, the decision appears to be a relatively stable personal or political one, but most draw on their current relationships and/or financial or maturational situations when noting their desires. A subsample of 22 men from this group who have experienced pregnancies is used to explore men’s actual roles in negotiating whether a conception was terminated or carried to term. Despite the fact that most men would like to have input into decisions to abort or carry a pregnancy to term, the majority were not actually involved in making decisions with their partners (especially the decision to abort) when pregnancies occurred. Results are interpreted in light of social class differences in family formation processes.",

It was possible to overcome the psychologic handicap of their elective mutism, espe cially by the use, initially, of drawing, writing and modeling. These cases illustrate the general rule that proper weighting must be given to psychosexual differentiation and the sense of gender identity before a decision for or against sex reassignment can be valid. A sex reassignment can be success fully undertaken if it resolves incongruity between gender identity and assigned sex, or if the gender identity is ambivalently noncommittal.

There was evidence of relatively high levels of sexual activity, with some members of all groups engaging in risky sexual behaviour. Anglo‐Australians were more sexually active and informed about AIDS, with more equality between the sexes in these respects than the other groups. There was a distinction made between behaviours regarded as safe with regular and casual partners, but the meaning attributed to regular partnership differed. Greek‐ and Italian‐Australian young men endorsed monogamy for their regular partners but not necessarily for themselves, and Anglo‐Australians accepted a relationship of shorter duration as regular. Greater knowledge was not related to safer sexual behaviour, but discussion about a regular partner's previous sexual history correlated with more risky sexual behaviour. Overall, risk levels were not high but the casual‐regular partner distinction, together with the greater use of relatively unrealistic strategies for dealing with AIDS in association with risky behaviour in the non‐Anglo groups, gives cause for concern.",

      "abstract": "Humans are motivated to connect with others and are sensitive to social exclusion—intentionally leaving out others. This ability to detect social exclusion is suggested to be evolutionarily adaptive, biologically hardwired, and an important feature of social-cognitive development. Yet it is unclear when children start to independently detect social exclusion. Previous developmental research on social exclusion has focused on children older than 4 years of age, but recent infancy research has suggested younger children may be able to process complex social interactions such as social exclusion. The present study is the first to examine whether 2- to 3-year-old children detect social exclusion and if they prefer to affiliate with individuals who have been excluded over individuals who exclude others. Across 2 experiments, 2- and 3-year-old children (N = 140) viewed exclusive group interactions, in which 2 agents unjustly excluded 1 agent, and children were asked to choose whether they preferred to play with an excluded agent or an exclusive agent. Three-year-old children consistently preferred to play with the excluded agent, whereas 2-year-old children showed no preference. Three-year-old children did not show a preference among agents engaged in inclusive interactions and did not prefer an agent who refused to engage with a group, showing that 3-year-old children distinguish unjust exclusion from other types of interactions. Together, these findings suggest 3-year-old children detect social exclusion and are motivated to affiliate with unjustly excluded agents over those who exclude others, whereas these capacities are still developing in 2-year-old children.",

      "abstract": "Imaginative pretend play is often thought of as the domain of young children, yet adults regularly engage in elaborated, fantastical, social-mediated pretend play. We describe imaginative play in adults via the term “pretensive shared reality;” Shared Pretensive Reality describes the ability of a group of individuals to employ a range of higher-order cognitive functions to explicitly and implicitly share representations of a bounded fictional reality in predictable and coherent ways, such that this constructed reality may be explored and invented/embellished with shared intentionality in an ad hoc manner. Pretensive Shared Reality facilitates multiple individual and social outcomes, including generating personal and group-level enjoyment or mirth, the creation or maintenance of social groups, or the safe exploration of individual self-concepts (such as alternative expression of a players sexual or gender identity). Importantly, Pretensive Shared Reality (both within the specific context of table-top role-playing games, and other instances) are primarily co-operative and co-creative. We draw on multiple examples, and focus on Table-Top Role Playing games (TTRPG) – and specifically, the most popular and enduring table-top role-playing games, Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons (D&amp;amp;D) – as a primary example of such play. Our conception of “pretensive shared reality” links the widespread existence and forms of adult imaginative play to childhood pretense, places it within a developmental and evolutionary context, and argues that pretensive shared realities – which underpin many forms of imaginative culture – are an important topic of study unto themselves, and may be utilized to provide methodological insight into a variety of psychological domains.",

      "abstract": "Gender differences in the specificity of sexual response have been a primary focus in sexual psychophysiology research, however, within-gender variability suggests sexual orientation moderates category-specific responding among women; only heterosexual women show gender-nonspecific genital responses to sexual stimuli depicting men and women. But heterosexually-identified or \"straight\" women are heterogeneous in their sexual attractions and include women who are exclusively androphilic (sexually attracted to men) and women who are predominantly androphilic with concurrent gynephilia (sexually attracted to women). It is therefore unclear if gender-nonspecific responding is found in both exclusively and predominantly androphilic women. The current studies investigated within-gender variability in the gender-specificity of women's sexual response. Two samples of women reporting concurrent andro/gynephilia viewed (Study 1, n = 29) or listened (Study 2, n = 30) to erotic stimuli varying by gender of sexual partner depicted while their genital and subjective sexual responses were assessed. Data were combined with larger datasets of predominantly gyne- and androphilic women (total N = 78 for both studies). In both studies, women reporting any degree of gynephilia, including those who self-identified as heterosexual, showed significantly greater genital response to female stimuli, similar to predominantly gynephilic women; gender-nonspecific genital response was observed for exclusively androphilic women only. Subjective sexual arousal patterns were more variable with respect to sexual attractions, likely reflecting stimulus intensity effects. Heterosexually-identified women are therefore not a homogenous group with respect to sexual responses to gender cues. Implications for within-gender variation in women's sexual orientation and sexual responses are discussed.",

In still more neutral conditions, the children followed a norm of equality that was introduced into the experimental situation.

      "title": "Sexual Stimuli Cause Behavioral Disinhibition in Both Men and Women, but Even More So in Men",
      "abstract": "Abstract In our society men are considered more impulsive than women, especially in the violent and sexual domain. This correlation of sex and impulsivity might trace back to enhanced male impulsivity in general or a domain specific effect of emotions on impulsivity. The evidence for sex differences in the interaction of emotional or sexual stimuli and impulsivity has been relatively inconclusive so far. In this study, we investigated the effects of various emotional stimuli on responsivity in a Go/No-Go task. Participants had to respond quickly to a visual cue and withhold their response to another visual cue, while different emotional pictures were presented in the background, including sexual stimuli, non-sexual positive stimuli and negative stimuli. Both men ( N = 37) and women ( N = 38) made most commission errors in the sexual condition, indicating a disinhibiting effect in both genders. On top of this, men made even more commission errors than women, specifically in the sexual condition and not in other conditions. Men rated sexual stimuli as more positive, but did not differ from women in arousal ratings and pupil dilation. These findings may partly indicate increased impulsive behavior under sexual arousal in men, most likely driven by enhanced approach motivation due to more positive value but not higher arousal of sexual stimuli. The results are consistent with the theory of evolutionarily based concealment of sexual interest in women.",

      "title": "[Is the adolescent psychologically prepared to have children?].",
      "abstract": "Although the belief persists that sexuality is an adult concern, not to be spoken of with children and adolescents lest such discussions awaken desires and prompt early sexual initiation, in reality adult inhibitions and repressions have created a problem of adolescent sexuality where none need exist. A pregnant adolescent is immediately rejected by friends, family, and teachers, although later on she is again accepted. She has 2 alternatives: carrying the pregnancy to term or abortion. A 1981 study of adolescents aged 10-23 years indicated that the majority had had some type of sexual interaction such as caressing or kissing, but only minority had experienced coitus. The majority of the young people believed that virginity was desirable for both sexes. Few of the boys who had had intercourse had done so with prostitutes. 62% said that females took the initiative equally with males in sexual matters. The majority had heard of contraceptives and knew where to obtain them, but only 11% had ever used a method. Half did not know how their parents would react if they knew about their children's contraceptive usage, and 1/4 feared they would be expelled from the house or subjected to some other violent reaction if their parents found out. Only 18% thought their parents would have a sympathetic attitude. Half thought abortion was a crime but the rest had a range of attitudes reflecting the diverse attitudes of the general population. Various organizations in the Dominican Republic provide much-needed sex education which prompts the creation of conditions of equality and mutual respect in the family. The Adolescent Center of the Dominican Association for Family Welfare provides training in sex education for selected groups of adolescents, who spread their knowledge among their peers. In the past 3 years, 110 such adolescents, called multipliers, have been trained. 42 talks, 6 round tables, 4 intensive and 8 general courses in sex education have been provided for 8900 adolescents. 8 meetings attended by 200 parents of adolescents, 5 workshops attended by 169 teachers were held, 50 clients received psychological counseling, and a sex education manual was prepared.",

      "title": "The Concept of the Superego: A Reformulation",
      "abstract": "1. The superego is a group of compromise formations, all having to do with morality, which originate, in large part, in the oedipal phase of development. 2. Once formed as a consequence of conflict, the superego functions as a major component of (subsequent) conflicts. 3. Its role in conflict is diverse. It functions now as defense, now as the equivalent of a drive derivative arousing unpleasure, and now as a calamitous unpleasure to be avoided or mitigated. 4. For a young child \"moral\" equals approved by parents, while \"immoral\" equals the reverse. The crucial moral questions at the time of life when the superego is largely formed are, \"What will win or forfeit parental approval?\" and \"What will rouse or dissipate parental wrath?\" 5. From the side of ego functioning, superego formation involves much more than identification with parental superego demands and prohibitions. Any aspect of ego functioning which furthers parental approval and/or avoids disapproval and punishment can and does participate in superego formation. 6. From the side of the drives, both libido and aggression are involved in superego formation. Hence masochism plays a role in normal superego formation and functioning as well as in those pathological cases which Freud called moral masochism. 7. Superego pathology is not to be understood, as it has been generally understood by analysts until now, in terms of defective or incomplete development. Everyone has a fully formed superego. Superego pathology must be understood on the same basis as is the pathology of any compromise formation.",

      "abstract": "Tactics used to perpetrate sexual violence may be crucial to understanding when and why sexual violence occurs. Moreover, most sexual violence occurs between people who know each other—including in the context of dating or sexual relationships. Little is known about the context of sexual violence that occurs with non-romantic partners. To address these research gaps, we examined online survey data from 786 young adults (weighted n = 763) aged 19 to 27 years, living across the United States. Findings suggest that 60% of sexual assault, 40% of attempted rape, 42% of rape, and 67% of coercive sex were perpetrated against a romantic partner, defined as a current or ex-boyfriend, girlfriend, spouse, or domestic partner. Contextual differences were noted by relationship type: Those who perpetrated against romantic partners were more likely than those who targeted non-romantic partners to report that it occurred because they were feeling sad or angry. They were also more likely to say that the other person was completely responsible for what happened. Conversely, those who aggressed against non-romantic partners were more likely to say that someone else found out about what happened. Making the other person feel guilty was the most common tactic for both groups. The most frequently endorsed reason for perpetrating sexual violence was “feeling really horny,” although feeling “good” or being drunk/high were also common reasons noted by aggressors. Afterward, many said they felt guilty or ashamed and were worried about the other person’s feelings. Fear of getting caught was universally absent. Findings support the importance of building emotion regulation and emotional awareness skills in sexual violence prevention programming. Prevention programs should also discuss coercion as a violence tactic, since perpetrators may not always recognize this to be sexual violence. More generally, violence prevention programs should also address healthy relationships, consent, and taking responsibility.",

      "title": "Affirmative sexual consent? Direct and unambiguous consent is rarely included in discussions of recent sexual interactions",
      "abstract": "Sexual activity typically follows an implicit sexual script or a normative sequence of behaviours that are involved in a sexual interaction. It is unclear whether or how affirmative sexual consent is incorporated in individual sexual scripts and interactions. The current research explores how sexual consent may be expressed and verified as part of individuals’ sexual interactions. Undergraduate participants from an Ontario university ( N = 92; 58 males, 34 females) completed a series of open-ended questions that asked them to describe their sexual experiences with a new and long-term partner from beginning to end. Analysis of presence of consent-related behaviours in participants’ accounts were assessed on the basis of a priori themes and extensions of these themes. Thematic analyses identified the following themes: 1) Sex proceeding with escalating intensity of nonverbal sexual behaviour, 2) Passive behaviours that do not indicate unwillingness to have sex, 3) Indirect verbal communication of interest in sex, 4) Indications that sex “just happened,” 5) Descriptions of the context in which sex occurred, and 6) Direct discussions relevant to sexual consent. Results indicated that direct discussion of sexual consent was exceedingly rare and that most sexual interactions included indirect, veiled, and coded behaviours that require inference of sexual consent or non-consent. Consent-related themes varied as a function of both participant gender (male versus female) and nature of relationship (new versus long-term). The findings of this study have implications for sexual health education, sexual assault prevention interventions, and public policy development.",

Age as an index of physical, cognitive, and social development has been found to be related to childhood sexual behavior both qualitatively and quantitatively. For example, a study of 2- to 7-year-olds found that older children were significantly more knowledgeable about aspects of sexuality such as sexual behavior, pregnancy, and sexual abuse prevention. Meanwhile, genital manipulation and masturbatory behaviors are more prevalent among boys, suggesting behavioral differentiation by gender. Factors other than gender and age that influence sexual expression in childhood have been investigated in only a few studies. Liberal parental attitudes regarding sexuality have been found to be associated with specific behaviors such as increased masturbation, frequency of touching parents' genitals, and frequency of sexual behavior overall.",

Friendship was found to be the most widely used courtship script across all age groups, followed by the sexually explicit and romance scripts, with friendship and romance scripts being preferred. Unique aspects of lesbian dating cited by participants included freedom from gender roles, heightened intimacy/friendship, the rapid pace of lesbian relationship development, and the effects of prejudice. Friendship was found to be differentiated from romance by two main criteria: emotional intensity and sexual energy or contact. Verbal declarations of interest and nonverbal behaviors were the primary means of communicating sexual attraction. Few lesbians adhered to traditional gender roles in dating, and those who reported assuming the feminine reactive role nevertheless rejected the traditional notion that women should limit sexual contact. Overall, midlife lesbians were more purposive in their dating and more free from gender roles. Specifically, they were more concerned about the \"attachment-worthiness\" of a prospective partner and were significantly more likely than young adults to view dating as having a serious goal, to proceed at a rapid pace, to ask for a date, and to initiate physical intimacy.",

      "abstract": "Engaging in sex is a common practice, however, some adults may choose to not have sexual experiences for normative reasons. Asexual adults, in particular, may hold negative attitudes about sex and are less likely than allosexual adults to engage in sex. Less is known about whether adults' motives to not have any sexual experiences differ based on sexual orientation. We use qualitative to explore asexual and allosexual adults' intrinsic and extrinsic motives for not having sexual experiences. From a larger study, 129 adults with no sexual experiences (52.7% allosexual, Mage = 22.0, 47.3% asexual, Mage = 25.4; 61.2% women, 28.7% men, 10.1% transgender/gender non-conforming) responded to an open-ended question about sexual motives. Using thematic analysis, we developed five themes: (1) Lack of interest, (2) Morals or personal values, (3) Disgust or aversion, (4) Not feeling ready, and (5) No opportunity. Our findings suggest that asexual adults are more likely to report motives related to intrinsic experiences, such as negative feelings, whereas allosexual adults are more likely to report motives related to intrinsic personal beliefs. Overall, these findings expand our understanding of asexual and allosexual adults' motives for not having sexual experiences, and provide insight into diverse experiences of sexuality.",

      "title": "When Exoneration Seems Hopeless: The Special Vulnerability of Sexual Abuse Suspects to False Confession",
      "abstract": "This chapter considers sources of vulnerability among innocent sexual abuse suspects to police-induced false confession. We suggest that sexual abuse suspects may be particularly vulnerable to false confession, primarily as a result of their enhanced sense of hopelessness that they might be believed or be able to establish their innocence. Moreover, we suggest this sense of hopelessness derives largely from two factors: first, their perception of the evidentiary situation they face; and, second, stereotypes associating fathers, step-fathers, priests, boy scout leaders, day care personnel and others with sexual abuse. That is, we suggest sexual abuse claims are often characterized by (1) seemingly credible claims of one or more victims, (2) against a suspect whose social category is consistent with stereotypes of sexual abusers, (3) lack of concrete physical evidence that could exonerate the suspect, and (4) testimony of professional and nonprofessional witnesses in seeming support of the occurrence of the abuse and/or the suspect’s guilt that likewise cannot be refuted by concrete evidence. Sexual abuse suspects may therefore be less likely than most other innocent suspects to expect (a) that their claims of innocence will be believed in the absence of concrete proof of innocence, (b) that there will be a way to prove their innocence, or even (c) that there will be a way to effectively cast doubt on the validity of the alleged victim(s)’ claims of guilt or other apparently abuse supportive testimony. A primary goal of interrogation tactics is to instill in suspects such a sense of hopelessness, which then makes it easier for the interrogator to convince the suspect that confession will result in better legal outcomes than denial. For many sexual abuse suspects this goal may have been effectively met before they enter interrogation.",

Principal findings are the following: (1) sexual initiative and satisfaction appear to be greater among feminists than others, (2) there is no difference between groups in frequency of coitus in a present (or most recent) sexual relationship, but (3) there is a tendency for feminists to have had less stable first marriages than control subjects. These findings do permit more than one interpretation: the greater sexual satisfaction combined with marital instability among feminists may reflect their energy and willingness to change an unsatisfactory condition, or, in addition, the more general proposition that personal power is associated with positive sexual response in both men and women, so that there is minimal complementarity along this dimension. Both cultural and biologic factors appear to contribute to the relative instability of feminists' marriages.",

      "title": "Shame and Male Gender Identity.",
      "abstract": "The literature on the male gender role portrays as lacking weakness, need, doubt, or any of the female values such as sympathy, concern, or empathy. It is contended that Western society develops, reinforces, and maintains gender roles by the emotion shame; many males are motivated in part by an effort to avoid or escape shameful feelings. Shame is basically the felt variation between one's self and one's idealized self--the feeling of not measuring up. Shame arises in early childhood, before the development of certain language skills, so shame may not be readily accessible to verbally organized adult cognitions. Ironically, certain avoidance behaviors maintain many masculine stereotypes: (1) strong and brave; (2) competitive; (3) emotionally unexpressive; (4) problem solver; (5) isolated; (6) sexual, not sensual; (7) dynamic, decisive, and aggressive; (8) controlling; (9) tough and autonomous. These attributes of real men are desirable to some degree but when they are positioned as absolutes and are maintained by shaming and avoidance of shame then these behaviors become dysfunctional and destructive. The author argues for a removal of the limits on behavior and feeling and the re-incorporation of the so called non-male parts back into men's psyches.

      "abstract": "There has been an increase in research on sexual activity in later life, yet far less is known about the actual perceptions and experiences of older adults who refrain from sexual activity. In the current study, a thematic analysis was conducted to identify patterns in semi-structured interviews with 47 older adults, aged 60-91. The analysis yielded seven themes that describe why older adults refrain from sex: 1) avoiding confronting sexual dysfunctions, 2) avoiding confronting the aging body, 3) avoiding performance anxiety, 4) being uninterested in sexual activity, 5) taking time to grieve the loss of a partner, 6) avoiding judgment, and 7) seeing sexuality as evolving and changing. Themes were organized according to the bio-psycho-social perspective and based on the axis of personal (self-focused) and interpersonal (partner-focused) motives. It is perfectly acceptable for people to refrain from sexual activity for their own reasons. However, if older adults want to remain sexually active, they should receive complete information about the many possibilities of treating different sexual problems in later life and about the many ways, beyond sexual penetration, one can enjoy sexual activity even in old age.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Considerable progress has been made in behavioral genetics toward providing theoretical accounts of individual differences One theoretical task, however, has been largely neglected—that of constructing evolutionary accounts of behaviorally relevant genetic variance We attempt to address this task with respect to the genetic variance underlying sociosexuality, that is, the differences in the implicit prerequisites (in terms of time, attachment, commitment, etc) to entering a sexual relationship Specifically, we argue that genetic variance on this trait for females could have been maintained through frequency‐dependent selection In our evolutionary past, restricted females‐those who require relatively more time, attachment, and commitment‐could have benefited through paternal investment in their offspring Unrestricted females—those who require relatively less time, attachment, and commitment—could have benefited through the quality of their mate's genes passed on to their sons Moreover, the value of these alternate „strategies” could have been frequency‐dependent One prediction that follows from this evolutionary history is tested and supported in three studies Those females genetically predisposed to be unrestricted are found to produce relatively more sons than females predisposed to be restricted Additional predictions are offered and alternative accounts are discussed",

      "abstract": "Primates and dolphins exhibit comparable examples of all categories of non-conceptive sexual behaviors, including sexual interactions involving immature individuals, those involving individuals of the same sex, and copulation during the non-conceptive period. Although mammals of other taxa also perform non-conceptive sexual behaviors, the fact that there are so many reports of non-conceptive sexual interactions among higher primates and dolphins suggest a link between the nonreproductive use of sexual behaviors and high intelligence. This link might be because the greater role of learning in sexual behavior expands the possibility for sex to be incorporated into a variety of non-conceptive functions. Non-conceptive sexual behaviors seem to reflect or be influenced by important social factors, including affiliative relations and alliance between individuals of the same or different sex, high social status of females, within-group or between-group tension resolution, mate selection, and infanticide prevention. Animals may employ non-conceptive sexual behaviors to control various important aspects of their relationships with others which they cannot control with other social behaviors, which suggests that instances of non-conceptive sexual behaviors may serve as keys to understanding important aspects of the social relationships or social structure of the species.",

In its extreme form jealousy can be pathological, when the belief which may be a delusion, obsession or an overvalued idea, is held on inadequate grounds and is unaffected by rational discussion. Morbid jealousy differs from normal jealousy in its intensity or rationality. It can be thought of as hypersensitive jealousy since jealous reactions are experienced at a much lower threshold than in average individuals. Morbid jealousy is a disorder in which an individual believes that their partner is, or will be, sexually unfaithful. Morbid jealousy can occur when a partner is in fact being unfaithful, provided that the evidence for the infidelity is incorrect and there is an excessive or irrational response to such evidence. The preoccupation with the partner's infidelity is often triggered by vivid mental images of their partner's past or present relationships.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The affiliative interaction patterns of the immature members of a group of rhesus monkeys at the Yerkes Regional Primate Research Center reflected a strong bias toward matrilineal kin, although this effect was modified by age and sex variables. Association with kin decreased with age, particularly for males. Juvenile males showed less of a kin bias in their behavior than did juvenile females, especially for grooming. Juvenile males also exhibited a preference for interaction with other males. The diminished association with kin and the same‐sex bias may be reinforced in adolescence as adult males begin to aggressively target adolescent males involved in agonistic encounters with females or immatures. Adolescent males did not decrease their levels of social interaction relative to those of adolescent females; however, these males preferentially associated with other males (predominantly their own age‐sex class) and specifically avoided females and younger animals, both kin and nonkin. Avoidance may diminish conflicts with females or immatures which could result from association, thereby decreasing the potential for selective aggressive interference by adult males. Juvenile and adolescent females maintained strong ties with their kin and preferentially associated with other females and immatures. The breadth of interaction of females with other females may facilitate the establishment of dominance relationships as females mature. Familiarity and predictability may also decrease the necessity of more severe agonistic interaction.",

Subjects completed a questionnaire comprised of the 24-item Personal Attributes Questionnaire of Spence and Helmreich, a 6-item scale of hand preference and a self-rating of sex-role identity. Afterwards, each subject's carrying style was covertly observed and recorded. Most subjects carried their materials in a sex-typical way or in book bags (for which no sex-typed carrying styles were discovered). As in previous studies, men in this study scored higher than women on masculinity and androgyny and lower on femininity. Hand preference was not related to sex-role status. Carrying style was not significantly correlated with any of the predictor variables for men, perhaps because almost no variance in carrying style was observed among them. Women who used masculine carrying styles tended to be older, have greater instrumentality, and a more masculine identity.",

We used multidimensional scaling (MDS) analysis to connect young adult participants’ (N = 128) self-descriptions of twelve identities to their sexual motivations and ideals. Identities clustered along two semantically distinct dimensions: Dimension 1 was anchored by family identities on one side and non-family identities on the other; Dimension 2 was anchored on one side by friend/romantic relationships and achievement-based social identities on the other. Those who cited intimacy (e.g., sex as an expression of love) and enhancement (e.g., gratification; to feel good) sexual motivations were more likely to describe their sexual identities and gender identities as distinct from other identities, especially for women. Idealizing physically passionate relationships was positively linked to a higher distinction between sexual and non-sexual identities, and between gender and personal identities and family identities. The mental structuring of identities may inform sexual relationship motives, ideals, and expectations.",

One hundred eight couples (36 gay male, 36 lesbian, and 36 heterosexual) were drawn from the community, matched for age and length of relationship, and compared on the scales of the Styles of Conflict Inventory (SCI). To distinguish those conflict patterns that were orientation or gender specific, styles of conflict resolution between the men in same‐ and other‐sex relationships and between the women in same‐ and other‐sex couples were also compared. Results indicated that most couples across type of relationship reported a high degree of relationship satisfaction and moderately low amounts of conflict. Overall, heterosexual, gay, and lesbian couples were fundamentally similar, and common stereotypes of each couple were not verified. Women in lesbian relationships reported significantly greater relationship satisfaction, greater hope for conflict resolution, and several more constructive conflict‐resolution styles than either gay male couples or heterosexual couples. Differences appeared to be correlated with social gender role factors and common differences in relationship lifestyle features, such as the presence of children in the home.",

Overall, children did not categorise more perceptually salient (ambiguous) toys than less distinguishable (neutral) toys to their own gender. Colour was the most frequently used reason for the toys' gender assignment. The findings also showed that with age, girls' play complexity increased linearly, whereas boys' scores did not. A play substitution scale measuring play creativity or maturity showed no gender differences.

      "abstract": "Abstract Sexual desire is typically viewed as an interest in sexual objects or activities. Although sexual desire is often confused with sex drive, these are fundamentally different constructs. Whereas sex drive represents a basic, biologically mediated motivation to seek out sexual activity and/or sexual gratification (and hence is traitlike in nature), sexual desire is a specific state of sexual interest that typically has a specific target and/or trigger. Sexual desire can be elicited by a large variety of cues and situations, private thoughts, feelings, and fantasies, erotic materials (such as books, movies, photographs), and a variety of erotic environments, situations, or social interactions. Researchers have increasingly come to acknowledge that there are different forms of sexual desire. One useful distinction, first advanced in the context of research on nonhuman primates, is that between proceptivity and receptivity. Proceptivity refers to a basic urge to seek out and initiate sexual activity and is regulated by gonadal hormones (e.g., testosterone in men and estrogen in women). Receptivity, sometimes called arousability, represents the capacity to become sexually interested or aroused upon exposure to certain environmental or situational stimuli. Unlike proceptivity, arousability is not hormone‐dependent; in fact, even individuals with no circulating gonadal hormones show arousability to erotic stimuli, although they are not typically motivated to seek out sexual gratification.",

In the mid-1960s, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and the International Amateur Athletics Federation (IAAF) encountered a rash of female athletes who were decidedly masculine. Transsexuality exists when a person identifies strongly with the sex opposite their birth sex, and seeks to adopt a new sexual identity and phenotype.",

Another explanation using theory from evolutionary biology is suggested: children show evolved, sensitive-period learning in early childhood which is linked to mother's pair-bond status or to mother's attitude toward males. As a result of children's perceptions a developmental track is established, which influences expression of reproductive strategy in adulthood. Male children born into matrifocal households exhibit at adolescence a complex of aggression, competition, low male parental investment, and derogation of females and feminity, while females show early expression of sexual interest and assumption of sexual activity, negative attitudes toward males, and poor ability to establish long-term relationships with one male. Male children reared in father-present or nuclear households show less interest in competitive dominance with other males and more interest in manipulation of nonhuman aspects of the environment, while females show delayed sexual interest and activity and a mating strategy directed at locating a male who will invest in her and her offspring.",

However, because sports are typically sex-segregated, this athletic continuum is rarely seen but provides a potentially powerful mechanism of transformation relative to views of female athletes and women’s sport. In women’s intercollegiate basketball, it is common for teams to practice against a male scout team. We used Kane’s continuum theory to examine the effects of integrated playing experiences on male practice players’ attitudes towards female athletes and women’s sports. Data from interviews revealed divergent first-order themes (‘Acknowledgement of the Sport Continuum’ and ‘Maintenance of Traditional Gender Stereotypes’) and several related second-order themes. The divergent themes reflect the complexity of gender relations in sport as the men simultaneously experienced and articulated a gender continuum while reinforcing a gender binary, which kept their own power and privilege in sport intact.",

Repressed or forgotten abuse may manifest itself in adult life symptomatically by out-of-control behaviors which are abusive of self and/or others. Such compulsive behaviors reflect an attempt to gain mastery over the original abuse and the abuser. Keeping promiscuous behavior secret reinforces lhe original abuse pattern and leads to guilt, shame, and isolation. Countertransference issues facing the therapist are discussed.

Participants reported their personal expectations, experiences, and beliefs about the sexual expectations of the \"average woman\" and \"average man\" in relationships with or without strong physical attraction and emotional involvement. Results show that, in general, men expect sexual intercourse after significantly fewer dates (approximately 9–11) than women do (approximately 15–18). In addition, expectations were related to actual experiences for women, but not men. Participants also tended to exhibit pluralistic ignorance about sex, believing in a norm for the average person of their gender that was considerably more permissive than were their own standards. The average man and woman were perceived as expecting sex earlier within a relationship and irrespective of physical attraction or emotional involvement. In contrast, most men and women only expected sex when they were attracted to a partner, although men were more likely than women to expect sex in the absence of emotional closeness. Implications of pluralistic ignorance and gender differences in sexual expectations are discussed.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Psychological adaptation underlies all human behavior. Thus, sexual coercion by men could either arise from a rape-specific psychological adaptation or it could be a side-effect of a more general psychological adaptation not directly related to rape. Determining the specific environmental cues that men's brains have been designed by selection to process may help us decide which these rival explanations is correct. We examine six testable predictions against existing data: (1) Both coercive and noncoercive will be associated with high levels of sexual arousal and performance in men. (2) Achieving physical control of a sexually unwilling woman will be sexually arousing to men. (3) Young men will be more sexually coercive than older men. (4) Men of low socioeconomic status will likewise be more sexually coercive. (5) A man's motivation to use sexual coercion will be influenced by its effects on social image. (6) Even in long-term relationships men will be motivated to use coercion when their mates show a lack of interest in resistance to sex because these are interpreted as signs of sexual infidelity. Current data support all six predictions and are hence consistent with the rape-specific hypothesis, but this does not eliminate the side-effect hypothesis, which is likewise compatible with the findings, as well as with the further evidence that forced matings increased the fitness of ancestral males during human evolution. We suggest some research that may help decide between the two hypotheses.",

      "title": "SEX-ROLE PREFERENCE IN OKINAWAN PRE-SCHOOL CHILDREN",
      "abstract": "RYllkyusD. G. Brown (1) has investigated the problen1 of the early occurrence of sex-role development in relation to personality adjustment in terms of a technique known as the \"It Scale for Children\" (ITSC).Results based on the use of the scale with middle-class kindergarten childr.!n, ages 5-4 to 6-4, were as follows: (a) relatively dichotomous sex-role patterns existed in young children; (b) about twice as many girls as boys indicated acceptance of components of both the male and female roles; (c) more girls than boys showed a strong opposite sex-role preference.As factors functionally related to the above results, Brown (1, 2) pointed out: (a) the Freudian theory, which emphasizes the anatomical difference between males and females;(b) the Adlerian theory, which emphasizes socio-cultural advantages that the male enjoys compared to the female; (c) culturally determined conflicts in sex-role adjustment that are more frequent and pronounced in girls than in boys in the United States.The general problem posed for the present paper is the investigation of sex differences in the acceptance of sex-roles in Okinawan children.Brown's study and the present study make cross-cultural comparisons possible. METHOD SlIbjtets:Two hundred and seven children, 103 boys and 104 girls, whose ages ranged from 5-2 to 6-10 with a mean age of 6-0, who were enrolled at the Josei Kindergarten of Naha-city, participated as Ss of the present study.The present sample is made up largely of middle-class or lower middle-class children.Living in a better cultural environment than other children in Okinawa, the sample for the study may not be representative of the general child population ofOkinawa.Eighty-seven per cent of the boys' fathers have their occupations outside the home, and 78% of the girls' mothers are engaged in housekeeping.",

      "abstract": "Among factors identified as being statistically associated with child abuse, we can broadly distinguish those related to characteristics of the child itself and those related to family characteristics, bearing in mind that parents are the perpetrators of child abuse in the vast majority of cases. Observed among children are: young age (abuse begins very early in life); male sex, as concerns shaken baby syndrome and lethal violence; the presence of mental disability and/or behavioural disorders; and particularly frequently, prematurity, especially if it requires neonatal hospitalisation. In fact, any circumstance that makes early attachment between the newborn and its parents difficult or impossible, such as prematurity or postpartum depression, constitutes a situation of risk for subsequent child abuse. Among parents, psycho-affective factors take precedence over socio-economic factors, which play no role. Child abuse is found in all social classes, as is the transgenerational transmission of violence, with those parents having suffered from abuse as children being more at risk than others of becoming abusive themselves.",

This study presents a qualitative analysis of adolescents' comments after reading a teen-friendly article on sexual consent as part of a web-based sexual health promotion intervention. The sample was comprised predominantly of female adolescents recruited from a Midwest urban region in the United States. Adolescents varied with respect to self-efficacy to request, provide, and deny consent, as well as the perceived need to ask for consent in the context of established relationships. Many adolescents perceived that nonverbal methods of communication were sufficient to request, provide, or deny sexual consent. Factors that make it difficult to discuss sexual boundaries and say \"no\" to unwanted sex included low self-efficacy and an underlying desire to nurture or preserve a relationship. Cultural norms must be changed to support verbal, affirmative sexual consent. In addition, adolescents must be aided in the development of skills to request sexual consent, say \"yes\" to specific activities, and say \"no\" to others. Without supportive norms and skills to enhance self-efficacy, adolescents may be unwilling to engage in verbal communication about sexual consent and boundaries.",

      "abstract": "Infertility may interact with a couple's or individual's sexuality and sexual expression in two main ways. Sexual problems may be caused or exacerbated by the diagnosis, investigation, and management of infertility (or subfertility), or they may be a contributory factor in childlessness. Any examination of a couple's difficulty in conceiving must include overt and clear questioning about their sexual activity. ### Responses to infertility In response to being unable to conceive, many people feel emotions such as anger, panic, despair, and grief, and these may have several effects on sexual activity. The stress of infertility and its treatment may be a cause of sexual difficulties for both the prospective father and mother. Intercourse may be avoided, with patterns of behaviour established, so that one or other partner is not reminded of the fertility problem. Postcoital tests or having to provide semen samples may result in a man feeling under pressure to perform, adversely affecting his erectile or ejaculatory ability. For some men, one or two failures during intercourse begins a vicious circle of fear of failure, with anxiety leading to further failures. Partners may also develop arousal difficulties because of anxiety or distress. Some individuals feel that their partner seems to want them only when there is a chance of conception, and sexual activity can then become a battleground for issues of power and control. #### Useful questions to elicit information",

      "abstract": "When children exhibit unusually intense or persistent sexual interests or behavior, this is an indication that they have been exposed to more than the expectable amount of sexual experience, Although sexualized behavior and/or statement is a symptom of sexual abuse, it is not necessarily an indication of sexual abuse. The possibility of false allegation needs to be considered, particularly if allegations are coming from the parent rather than a child, if parents are engaged in dispute over custody or visitation, and/or if the child is a preschooler. False allegations may arise in other situations as well, such as the misinterpretation of a child's statement or behavior by relative or caretakers. And children may make false statement in psychiatric evaluations. A case of false allegation of sexual abuse made by mentally retarded 10 year-old girl who has been located in an institute is presented. During her evaluation process, it was clinician's diagnostic impression that she had no been sexually abused but sexually stimulated in some way, and most of what she said was a fantasy lie. Its pathological mechanism is discussed in terms of pseudologia fantastica along with the review of literatures.",

      "title": "The Instability of Sexual Preference",
      "abstract": "Abstract Whether an explanation for sexual preference is biological, psychological, or sociological, the basic presumption usually is that sexual preference is set early and changes little through life. In this view, any changes in sexual feelings, sexual behaviors, or romantic feelings are especially unlikely after adulthood. Further, it would be sexual feelings that would be least likely to change because they are assumed to be the most basic element of sexual preference. Despite these presumptions, evidence of substantial change in an individual’s sexual preference does exist. For example, one recent study noted the effect of the feminist movement on women’s sexuality, teaching some women that relating both emotionally and sexually to other women is an option.1 Another study focused on a group of women who were all heterosexual in behavior and identity before participating in swinging.2 As a response to their husbands’ wishes and their observations of other women, they became involved in sex with other women, and all of them eventually identified themselves as bisexual. Their bisexuality, moreover, was an addition to their previous heterosexual interest, and they still preferred heterosexual sex.",

The research aims to determine the level of sex typing in Italian television advertising directed to children. The analysis reveals a considerable difference in the portrayals of boys and girls, though more nuanced than in the past. Boys outnumber girls and are depicted in both major and minor roles, involved mostly in competitive group activities, accompanied only by male voice-over. They are dressed in various colours, are mainly in bright outdoor locations and play mostly with action figures, built games, and transportation and construction toys. Girls, instead, are still mostly dressed in pastel coloured clothes, are indoors and play mainly with dolls and animals, in collaborative interactions. They only build things in the presence of boys and are sometimes accompanied by a male voice-over. However, they are also more active, independent and in major roles than the boys. Hence, there are some differences in the representation of girls and boys compared to the findings of earlier studies. A, the portrayals of male and female characters in Italian commercials are still quite differentiated and are used to give gendered meaning to products, characters and viewers.",

      "abstract": "Although there is much debate about the positive effects of active sporting pursuits for the young, in reality many young people are still excluded or deterred from taking part as much as they would like. There are still particular bodily performances which are considered more suitable for taking part in mainstream sport, and invariably one of the determining factors relates to gendered performances which extol competitive, aggressive masculinity. Sporting activities during childhood and school are often considered either enjoyable or unpleasant depending upon the individual's success, or not, in 'making the grade' during sporting activities through their ability to perform appropriate masculinity or 'exclusive masculinity'. The article draws on recent research into body practices, masculinities and sport. A range of men who actively participated in mainstream and gay tennis clubs were interviewed about their experiences of sporting activity throughout their lives. A factor which emerged from their adult readings of their childhood experiences of sport was the uniform enjoyment of engaging in physical activity. However, the men's ability to participate fully was more reliant upon specific bodily performances which were considered an essential aspect of mainstream sport and physical education. The article aims to highlight the importance of recognising the social factors which shape the way in which individuals are allowed to approach sport and ultimately, enjoy their bodies to the best of their abilities.",

      "title": "The Mate Switching Hypothesis for Infidelity",
      "abstract": "Abstract Infidelity toward obtaining a new partner is commonly abetted by the tendency, especially during the peak reproductive years, to continually assess other potential companions’ mate value, suitability, and availability. The strategy of maintaining a relationship while seeking other partners can be adaptive for several reasons: (1) Whether in service of finding a new partner or not, infidelity offers the male more potential childbearing partners and provides the female a means to obtain genes from a partner with a superior phenotype, (2) extradyadic sex potentially creates a bond with a new partner and can add to one’s perceived security in a relationship while paradoxically easing leaving it, and (3) infidelity can act to mitigate the financial or emotional risks of leaving a partner who has become less desirable. Mate switching infidelity is abetted by many intrinsic factors such as males’ tendency to reflexively attend to those with salient sexual features and females’ propensity to remain vigilant for new partners who offer superior genes, status, and resources. This chapter details these and several other cultural and evolutionary forces that underlie the mate switching hypothesis of infidelity. It also presents case studies to illuminate the psychological and clinical implications of this practice.",

      "title": "An examination of disengagement among elderly people in a low income public housing facility",
      "abstract": "Six general hypotheses guided the development of the study: The older person experiences progressive disengagement from society resulting in feelings of isolation, depression, frustration, and despair; the aging person is dissatisfied with the degree of this process of social disengagement; the aging person gains satisfaction by participating in activities which lead to individual growth and/or benefit to others; the aging person lacks capacity and/or desire to participate in many activities or to continue the full-time roles of parent, job holder, and citizen; the aging person would like to choose his activities according to his desires and needs; and the aging person will more likely participate in activities if he is able to obtain adequate health care and has financial security. Descriptive and statistical inferential tests were used to analyze the data. A relatively small percentage of possible disengagement in the recreational, occupational, and family life areas occurred during the individual's life span from age 40 to age 70. The percentage of possible disengagement in these areas increased dramatically in the life span from age 70. Most of the respondents rejected loneliness and depression and felt in good spirits most of the time. A tendency toward less and less contact with others was seen. Statistically significant differences were found between activities which were presently enjoyed which were basically individual and passive in nature; and activities respondents would plan for themselves, which were of a significantly more social nature involving them in rewarding activity with others. Statistically significant differences were found between interest in the activity program available at Northwest Tower, basically recreation and entertainment; and the activities respondents would include in their program, mainly designed for self-enhancement or benefit to others. Statistically significant differences were also found between the number of activities available and the smaller number desired. The findings suggested that the preponderance of the respondents desired to withdraw from major responsibilities outside their household. Of those who desired responsibilities such as occupation, family or civic, they were prevented from assuming them most of the time because of their increasing age, deteriorating health, and lack of money. These were also the main factors operant in restricting their activity and preventing them from enjoying satisfactory ways of living. The majority of opinions as to society's responsibility to the aging suggested that intervention was necessary to provide financial security, health care, and better and cheaper methods of transportation. The findings of the study suggested the importance of more intensive research in planning programs directly related to meeting the individual needs of elderly people.",

      "abstract": "Past research suggests that heterosexual men show a category-specific pattern of sexual arousal, showing greater arousal to stimuli depicting women than those depicting men.Gender is not, however, the only factor affecting sexual arousal in men. Research has shown that men regard relationship context as an important factor in sexual arousal.Additionally, men show greater sexual arousal to novel than to familiar sexual stimuli. Sociosexuality, the preference for committed or uncommitted sexual relationships,affects behaviour and partner preferences. The current study investigates the relationship between sociosexuality, gender cues, relationship context cues, and sexual arousal in menby assessing 25 heterosexual men’s genital and subjective sexual arousal to 18 audio narratives describing sexual or neutral encounters with female and male strangers,friends, or long-term relationship partners. I expect that heterosexual men will show greater subjective and genital arousal in response to stimuli depicting a sexual encounter with a woman than to stimuli depicting a sexual encounter with a man, replicating previous research. I hypothesize that there will be an interaction between gender cues and relationship context, such that men will show greater sexual arousal to stimuli depicting novel female sexual partners (strangers and friends) than to stimuli depicting familiar female sexual partners (long-term partners). I predict that higher sociosexuality scores, indicating a greater preference for uncommitted sexual relationships, will correlate with greater sexual arousal to uncommitted relationship contexts (strangers or friends), whereas lower sociosexuality scores, will correspond with greater sexual arousal to the committed relationship context (long-term partner).",

Case summary: A 17-year-old male from low socioeconomic status presented with repeated inclinations to be dressed up and move like a female for the past 11 years and for past 3 months with sleep disturbance, low mood and loss of interest in surroundings, and occasional passive death wishes. There was no physical ambiguity regarding his male sex at birth. During early age, he preferred to play with girls and enjoyed the role, wearing their traditional clothes without getting any sexual pleasure in doing so. Due to this behavior, he was criticized continuously by his father and faced strong opposition from all his relatives when he expressed his wish to become a transgender. He was diagnosed with Gender dysphoria in adolescents and adults with mild depressive episode and treatment was initiated. Discussion: GD occurs when an individual strongly believes that he or she was born with the body of the wrong sex. People suffering from GD were prone to serious illnesses ranging from emotional distress, depression, isolation, and in worst cases, suicide. Hence, there is an urgent need to create awareness to perceive gender expression as a continuum reducing the burden of mental health problems associated with GD. Conclusion: GDD is a difficult condition to deal and treat, especially in individuals with orthodox and low socioeconomic backgrounds.",

      "title": "Deception in 3-year-olds.",
      "abstract": "Children's ability to deceive was examined in order to determine whether they are able to hide their emotional expression intentionally. Three-year-oids were instructed not to peek at a toy while the experimenter left the room. When asked, the great majority either denied that they peeked or would not answer the question. Facial and bodily activity did not differentiate the deceivers from the truth tellers. Boys were more likely than girls to admit their transgression. These results indicate that very young children have begun to learn how to mask their emotional expressions and support the role of socialization in this process. Deception is a frequent activity in the life of individuals. It may take the simple form of agreeing with someone with whose opinion, in fact, we do not agree (e.g., saying we like the color of a tie when we do not) or other forms such as lying about a serious transgression. Deception can be directed toward the self as well, as in the case where we deny that we have a certain feeling when, in fact, we do feel this way (Lewis, in press). Moreover, cultures may have display rules that encourage masking negative emotion (Ekman, Friesen, & Ellsworth, 1972; Izard, 1977). Deception can be observed in all age groups, but the questions of how old a child must be in order to be able to deceive and how well a child can succeed in the deception are largely unexplored.",

      "abstract": "Male and female research participants self-disclosed to a male or a female confederate with whom they anticipated or did not anticipate further interaction. Women disclosed more intimately, with increasing emotion, and displayed more topical responsiveness with female than with male targets. But as anticipated by gender socialization theory, only the highly masculine men reliably disclosed more to female than to male targets, and then only when they expected further interaction with their partners and could foresee the possibility of cultivating a deeper heterosexual relationship. Moreover; highly masculine men who anticipated further interaction with female targets expressed several of the relationship concerns that gender socialization theory anticipates in their postdisclosure impressions. Neither dispositional masculinity nor femininity reliably predicted the disclosures of women, who may have favored female targets due, in part, to a belief that other women are more appropriate outlets for intimate self-disclosure.",

The most frequent sexual disorder reported by spouses of patients with dementia is sexual indifference related to apathy and blunted affect. Increase of sexual demands is rare and many behaviors considered as inappropriate or expressing hypersexuality actually express affective needs or result from cognitive disturbances. Permanence of sexual activity is most often a factor of adjustment for married dementia sufferers and their caregivers. However, some sexual behaviors are stressing for the spouses, mainly women spouses. In nursing homes or long term care facilities, expressing sexuality by demented subjects and dealing with inappropriate sexual expression are source of concerns for the nursing staff, other residents, and families.

      "title": "Perceived discrimination experiences and social well-being among midlife and older adult men who have sex with men from the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study",
      "abstract": "Many men who have sex with men (MSM) in midlife (40-64 years) and older adulthood (65+ years) have survived a lifetime fighting and advocating for equality given exposures to social discrimination attributed to stigmatized social identities (e.g., sexual orientation, racial/ethnic minority, and HIV-positive status). Few public health research efforts have given attention to how MSM’s exposure and salience of social discrimination across the life course have shaped social well-being in midlife and older age. Three studies were conducted using a cross-sectional healthy aging sub-study of the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS). Study 1 explored whether older adulthood, racial/ethnic minorities, and HIV+ serostatus were associated with higher prevalence of any lifetime, any sexuality-related, and multifactorial (number of discrimination types) discrimination. Non-Hispanic Blacks were associated with greater any lifetime discrimination (aOR=1.42, p<0.001) and associated with less sexuality-related discrimination (aOR=0.56, p=0.001) compared to Non-Hispanic Whites. There was a statistically significant interaction associated to multifactorial discrimination between Non-Hispanic Black identity and HIV serostatus (aOR=0.46, p=0.019). Interestingly, no statistically significant differences in discrimination were observed by age cohort. Study 2 examined current internalized homophobia by discrimination exposure and salience. We observed no statistically significant differences in internalized homophobia by any discrimination or salience variables. Study 3 assessed differences in six indicators of social well-being (attachment, social integration, guidance, reassurance of worth, reliable alliance, and opportunity for nurturance) by discrimination exposure and salience. Though the mean scores for social well-being indicators were high overall, both any lifetime discrimination and multifactorial discrimination were negatively associated with indicator scores except opportunity for nurturance. Sexuality-related discrimination was negatively associated with social integration only. Across all discrimination salience variables, participants who reported discrimination and no/low salience exhibited lower scores on social well-being indicators than participants who reported no discrimination. Study 3 extended the public health literature on aging MSM, elucidating the role of salience on discrimination’s relationship to social well-being and that despite social adversity, these men have been able to maintain or achieve high social well-being. Future research should continue exploring midlife and older adult MSM’s resiliencies to identify factors that interrupt the deleterious impact of discrimination on health.",

      "title": "“What a Girl Wants”: What Can We Learn From Animal Models of Female Sexual Motivation?",
      "abstract": "Sexual motivation is notably different than other motivations such as hunger and thirst, because it lacks homeostatic drive. Sexual motivation poses no threat to physical well-being; individual survival is not at stake. Nevertheless, sexual motivation is a powerful drive and is critical for species survival. Understanding the complexity of sexual motivation has the potential to advance our understanding of other motivations, even pathological motivations, such as those associated with substance abuse. The study of motivation that is unique to females has often been neglected. A number of paradigms have been developed to investigate female sexual motivation beyond measuring only the lordosis reflex. Lordosis is a reflexive posture displayed by female mammals in response to male sexual stimulation to facilitate intromission. The lordosis reflex is essential, but studying the drive to mate is compromised in the absence of robust lordosis. Therefore, appetitive measures of sexual behavior (e.g., preferences, solicitation behaviors) are more specific and more sensitive indicators of sexual motivation than lordosis alone. Paradigms designed to study female sexual motivation often provide a female subject with the choice to interact with a sexually vigorous male or either a non-sexual partner (i.e., female, castrated male) or to remain alone. The study of appetitive measures of sexual motivation has elucidated the role of hormones in female sexual motivation, as well as the underlying neural pathways. The present review describes methods for studying female rats to advance our understanding of sexual motivation and sexual dysfunction.",

In the Oregon troop: i. Males' social interactions with the young go through two overlapping phases, one before and one after the birth of the year's new babies. Only the dominant males participate in the second phase which involves proximity with mothers and neonates. 2. Adult male Japanese macaque social behavior is strongly seasonal, and variations in male parental behavior are partly a ramification of a more general change in behavior. The view that the males' behavior is a response to distress produced in the young when the mother abandons them upon the birth of a newborn is not upheld by the Oregon data. 3. Male-young affiliative and play interactions are not likely to be an important contribution to the socialization of the young, since at all seasons the overwhelming majority of a young monkey's play and affiliative interactions are with his mother, siblings, and agemates. On the other hand, adult dominant males are responsible for virtually all of the attacks on a neonate under the age of 3 months. This may have an important effect on the social development of the young monkey.",

      "abstract": "41 years-old; biological male; divorced; father of five children; university degree. Regret following male-to-female sex-reassignment surgery (SRS) and facial plastic surgery; requesting sexreconversion operation. Compulsive, high-risk sexual behaviour, triggered by traumatic life-events during puberty (death of father and departure of mother at the age of 14). Symptoms evolved throughout adolescence and adulthood with persistent identity diffusion, intense abandonment fears, feelings of chronic emptiness and guilt, mood swings, unstable and intense interpersonal relationships, impulsivity and self-destructive behaviour. Gender history and transition: No evidence of gender nonconformity, gender dysphoria, gender-role discomfort or cross-gender identification. Uncertainty regarding male's role and identity diffusion, persisting since puberty. An impulsive decison for SRS and facial plastic surgery at the age of 40 (performed abroad), without a recommendation letter, motivated by the urge to resolve identity confusion and diminish compulsive sexual behaviour. He subsequently acknowledged his male identity, which led to relief of symptoms and request for sex-reconversion surgery. Gender history and clinical presentation confirmed that the patient did not sufficiently meet criteria for Gender Identity Disorder, but rather for Borderline Personality Disorder. The authors are highly aware that this topic is significantly connected to issues of the human right to free choice; however we would wish to impose a medical obligation for a rigorous psychiatric assessment for origin of gender identity diffusion and discomfort. Psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy should be the first treatment choices before any radical surgery interventions are undertaken.",

      "abstract": "Despite a large body of literature on the development of sexual orientation, little is known about why some men who marry women have (or develop) a homosexual orientation. In the current study, a selfselected sample of 43 never-married gay men and 26 gay men who were married to a woman completed a self-report questionnaire. As well as obtaining descriptive information from the 26 men about their marriages and reason for marrying, hypotheses were tested, based on five possible explanations for gay men’s marriages: (a) internalised homophobia; (b) religious intolerance (c) confusion created because of childhood/adolescent sexual experiences; (d) poor psychological adjustment; and (e) differences in strength of sexual preference. The two most frequent reasons for marriage were that it “seemed natural”, and a desire to have children and “family life”. The attitudes to gay men and lesbians held currently by the married group were significantly more positive than their reports of their attitudes around the time their marriage commenced, and the level of childhood sexual experiences with adults or older adolescents was significantly associated with the extent of their unsafe sexual practices with men (prior, during and/or after marriage). Marrieds described their families’ religious beliefs as more fundamentalist than never-marrieds. Family adaptability and family cohesion and the degree to which respondents reported having experienced child maltreatment did not distinguished between marrieds and never-marrieds, however these variables did predict the level of self-depreciation. No differences were found between marrieds and never-marrieds’ ratings of their sexual orientation and identity, homophobia, or self-depreciation. The results highlight how little is understood of the reasons why gay men marry, and the need to develop an adequate theoretical model.",

      "title": "Removal of older males increases extra-pair siring success of yearling males",
      "abstract": "In animals, reproductive performance typically improves over time early in life. Several ultimate and proximate mechanisms may contribute to such an age-related improvement and these mechanisms can act in a relative or in an absolute sense. Low performance of young individuals may be the consequence of a comparison or competition with older individuals (relative), or it may be due to specific traits of young individuals and be unrelated to the presence of older competitors (absolute). Here, we perform a test to disentangle whether the effect of age class (yearling or older) on male extra-pair siring success is relative or absolute. Male age is the most consistent predictor of male extra-pair siring success across bird species, yet the mechanisms underlying this pattern are not well understood. Low extra-pair siring success of yearling males may be a consequence of the presence of older (“adult”) males (hypothesis 1), because adult males are more successful in intra- and intersexual interactions or because females prefer to copulate with adult males when available (relative preference). Alternatively, low extra-pair siring success of yearlings may be independent of the presence of adult males (hypothesis 2), for example, if yearling males on average invest less in extra-pair behavior or if females avoid them as extra-pair mates, independent of the availability of older males (absolute preference). To distinguish between these 2 hypotheses, we experimentally manipulated the age structure of a nest-box-breeding population of blue tits ( Cyanistes caeruleus ) by removing almost all adult males, and compared patterns of extra-pair paternity in the experimental year with those from the preceding 15 “control” years. Removal of adult males resulted in a substantial increase in the extra-pair siring success of yearling males compared to the “control” years, but did not affect the population-level frequency of extra-pair paternity or its spatial patterns. Our results provide clear evidence that extra-pair siring success of yearlings can increase and that it depends on the presence of older males in the population, indicating a relative effect of age on reproductive performance. These results suggest that older males outcompete yearling males in direct or indirect interactions, in sperm competition or as a result of differences in attractiveness to females.",

Mature males would sometimes lure weaker males to them by assuming the female position, only to spring at the intended victim as soon as the homosexual bait brought the latter close enough to make escape impossible. During immaturity, the balance between homosexual and heterosexual tendencies is so nearly even in the male monkey that his erotic impulses can find satisfying expression in sexual plays with fellow males. In the compulsive alcoholic, homosexuality has a demonstrably defensive motivation, but this in turn is feared and repressed. Psychoanalysis offers the most productive of all research techniques for teasing out the detailed psychodynamic structure of overt homosexuality. Female homosexuality is likewise a defensive against incest, but it has a more complex determination, and post-infantile factors, such as the sexual aggressions of brothers or the too erotically tinged affection of fathers, usually play an important role.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Disorganized attachment is most prevalent among high-risk populations, such as maltreated children. Recent attachment literature has demonstrated that one of the best predictors of attachment disorganization is an “Unresolved” parental state of mind regarding a loss or an abuse in the parent's own attachment history. However, although classification in the Unresolved (U) category is always accompanied by specification of the type of trauma that is unresolved (loss, physical abuse, or sexual abuse), much of attachment research has focused on unresolved attachment as one category. The current paper reviews the empirical literature on the parenting outcomes associated with different subtypes of U. The literature demonstrates that parents who have experienced loss or abuse in childhood, which remains unresolved, exhibit atypical care-giving behaviors. Specifically, a history of loss or childhood sexual abuse is found to be associated with more passively withdrawn parental interactions, whereas a history of physical abuse is related to increased negative and hostile interactions. In addition, there appears to be differences in caregiving behaviors between parents whose underlying attachment state of mind is secure versus insecure.",

Questionnaire responses of 138 college students' attitudes toward seven sexual situations were analyzed by respondents' sex, class standing, attitude toward divorce, courtship status, and perception of parents' marital happiness. Results provided support for each of the theoretical explanations. Permissiveness varied by each of the independent variables and by specific sexual behaviors (e.g., premarital sexual intercourse, cohabitation, communal living, the nexus between pre‐ and extramarital sex and marital happiness, and the connection between each spouse's infidelity and divorce). Thus, simple theoretical explanations of permissiveness or its absence appear to be unwarranted. Behaviors must be specified and background variables must be taken into account.",

      "abstract": "Although rates of sexual aggression are high among college men who engage in heavy drinking, little is known regarding how often heavy drinking college men initiate unwanted sexual advances towards women that could lead to a potential sexual assault or the reasons why these advances stop or proceed. The present study describes heavy drinking college men’s ( N = 210) initiation of unwanted sexual and social advances towards women, as well as outcomes of these interactions, including how often these behaviors continue, and men’s perception of what stopped the behavior over a 3-month period. Men indicated whether they were in a situation where a sexual partner noted that she does not want sexual activity to proceed further, initiated unwanted sexual contact, initiated unwanted sexual intercourse, attempted to give a woman alcohol when she did not appear to want to drink, or attempted to take a woman to an isolated location when she did not appear to want to go. These unwanted sexual and social advances most often stopped because of women’s verbal resistance (i.e., saying “stop” or “no”), or because men engaged in a discussion regarding the women’s limits or choices. Given that none of the unwanted sexual or social advances stopped because of bystander intervention, the present study highlights the importance of raising awareness of the effectiveness of women’s resistance tactics and continuing to train bystanders to notice and take action to address risky situations.",

      "abstract": "The study examined the importance of gender, ethnic identity and ethnic salience for two case studies of youths’ identification of major soccer motives. First, gender differences were found among the “Canadian” youths’ identification of major soccer motives. Major soccer joining motives cited by the boys included influenced by father and to learn and/or improve skills, the girls included to be with friends and/or meet new people and to improve body image. Soccer engagement-enjoyment motived cited by the boys included winning and to learn and/or improve skills; the girls included to improve body image. Soccer engagement-dislike motives cited by the boys included unqualified officials; the girls included gender inequalities in the program’s basic structure and/or organization. Soccer disengagement motives cited by the boys included teams unbalanced in strength; the girls included did not get along with teammates. Second, the results revealed ethnic differences among the boys’ identification of major soccer motives. While major soccer joining and engagement-enjoyment motives cited by the “German-Canadian” and “Dutch Canadian” boys included it is a family tradition and to perfect the sport, the “Canadian” boys included influenced by father, to refine soccer skills and it gives me something to do, and the “Portuguese-Canadian” boy cited influenced by father and to perfect the sport. Similarly, while major soccer engagement-dislike motives cited by the “German Canadian”, “Dutch Canadian” and “Portuguese-Canadian” boys included inadequate practice conditions, the “Canadian” boys included teams unbalanced in strength, a too competitive coach, insensitive parents and unqualified officials. The major soccer disengagement motives varied between the ethnic subgroups. Third, the results revealed that a low or moderate ethnic salience score did not appear to influence the “Canadian” youths’ identification of major soccer motives (Abstract shortened by UMI).",

      "title": "Culture influences the development of children's gender‐related peer preferences: Evidence from China and Thailand",
      "abstract": "Current understanding of how culture relates to the development of children's gender-related peer preferences is limited. To investigate the role of societal acceptance of gender nonconformity, this study compared children from China and Thailand. Unlike China and other cultures where the conceptualization of gender as binary is broadly accepted, individuals who identify as a nonbinary \"third\" sex/gender have been highly visible and tolerated in Thai society for at least several decades. Chinese and Thai 4- to 9-year-olds (N = 458) viewed vignettes of four hypothetical peers who varied on gender (i.e., boy vs. girl) and gender-typed toy play behavior (i.e., masculine vs. feminine), and were asked to give a friendship preference rating for each peer. Chinese, compared with Thai, children evidenced gender-related peer preferences that emerged earlier, remained more stable across age groups, and were relatively more biased against gender-nonconforming behavior. The only cultural similarity was in children's preference for peers who were of the same gender and/or displayed same-gender-typed behavior. Thus, while preference for peers who are of the same gender and/or display same-gender-typed behavior is common among children across cultures, the developmental onset and course of these preferences vary by culture. Moreover, societal acceptance of gender nonconformity might be key to limiting children's bias against gender-nonconforming peers.",

      "abstract": "Introduction: Within the construction of personality, relationships between equals are increasingly meaningful, a trend reinforced by the incorporation into \nthe school environment from an early age. This school environment is essential for the processes of adaptation and personal adjustment where gender is built. \nThe present work is focused on the playground as a space and time that takes place during school hours and facilitates both coexistence and interpersonal \nrelationships. Objective: to determine if gender influences the acceptance and rejection relationships that occur during recess in primary and secondary schools, \nboth when choosing and / or rejecting their peers, and in the motivations that justify said choice and / or rejection. Methodology: Mixed, centered on the \ninterpretive paradigm that combines quantitative and qualitative analysis. Results: Girls and boys choose girls and boys respectively, both in the first and second \noption respectively, to interact during recess due to personality (fun, friendly, funny), friendship (best friend) and play reasons. Regarding rejection, there is \na significant relationship with gender, but in a different sense than expected. Both girls and boys reject in first and second place mostly boys. The reasons \nare related to the personality of the rejected partner, affective characteristics, and differences in the type of games. Conclusions: Acceptance relationships in \nthe playground are related to gender. This pattern, however, is not manifested in the rejection, that occur mainly for reasons of personality, affection, and \ndiscrepancies in the type of game. These motivations induce theoretical and practical implications regarding the reorganization of the playground and \nthe utility of a socio-emotional intervention programs on gender equality, cooperation, and interpersonal relations and promotes social and educational \ninclusion.",

      "abstract": "This study of 679 social science students in an Ontario university attempts to up grade and retest some of the notions in the literature about male-female relations in dating. Specifically, the approaches of Walter, Lowrie, and Burgess and Wallin were tested in this sample using semantic-differential items. Dating experiences for these students were positive and reflected values and experiences consonant with current beliefs; females were close to males in scoring their dating as sexual and hedonistic, while the general pattern involved high ratings of dating as pleasant, educational, cooperative and growth oriented. Inexperienced daters saw their dating as more positive than experienced daters. For most in the sample, dating was an end in itself and was not status or competition exploitation oriented—at least for the most part, even though these elements have not notably disappeared. Males were seen as less often cooperative in dating than females, while men registered more feelings of exploitation. While few of the respondents rated their dating as sexually aloof (less than ten percent), men were seen as too sex-oriented and women as immature. Men less often perceive their dating experiences as growth oriented while women see men as more crude and less often genteel. The relatively heavy emphasis on sensuatity and sexuality by both males and females is seen as indicating some change in dating patterns.",

Those desiring no children reported more stereotypically male traits and less female ones but did not see their careers as more important than the group wanting to establish a career then have children. In other words career was not the substitute for children as a source of satisfaction. Voluntarily childless women scored higher on dependence and other traits deviating from the female norm. This supports a hypothesis that those with more traditionally male traits will be more inclined toward goals of success dominance aggressivity and independence. Achievement scores were fairly equal among the 3 groups. Those wanting to delay childbearing did not score higher on dominant traits nor lower on socioemotional traits than those not delaying children. These findings support a personality predisposition toward childlessness.",

      "title": "Mating Decisions in the Absence of Physical Attraction",
      "abstract": "Abstract Objective Mates high in physical attractiveness are in short supply, which means that not all people are able to find mates who are sufficiently attractive. Threshold models of mate preferences suggest that when physical attractiveness minimums are not reached, other traits possessed by a potential partner may play a lesser role in mate choice. However, few studies have sought to understand mating decisions when those minimums are not met. Methods In this experiment ( N = 186), participants rated images of (pre-rated) unattractive opposite-sex others for long-term and short-term relationships after learning dealbreaker or dealmaker information. Results While participants did not find targets highly desirable or physically attractive (as a stimulus check), men were more willing than women to have casual sex, and that men and women reported similar desirability ratings towards long-term partners. Learning dealbreakers was associated with less desire for the targets than dealmakers, but women’s lack of interest was insensitive to mating context, whereas men found the target especially undesirable in the long-term context. Additionally, men were willing to consider a long-term relationship with a physically unattractive partner who possessed dealmakers, but not one who possessed dealbreakers. Conclusions Our discussion focuses on men and women’s mating decisions when potential partners fail to meet minimum thresholds for physical attractiveness. Future research is needed to explore the magnitude of the effect of meeting or failing to meet one’s minimum thresholds for physical attractiveness.",

They are intelligent, gifted and usually untroubled by the variations of their sexual drives, or the occasional fleeting interest in people of their own sex. Their femininity, only faintly noticeable to others, is as a rule well integrated and often put to good use in their professional lives. On the debit side, although they are capable of fairly lasting and deeply satisfying relationships with women, we find a high divorce rate and frequent changes of partners. Some of them can be exceptionally promiscuous, exploiting their capacity to attract women in a wholly effortless manner. Their promiscuity has a striking oral quality, in so far as they give the impression of being sexually insatiable, thus confirming the psychoanalytic observation of the equation penis=mouth. Many of them are little affected by an orgasmic incompetence which is hidden by a reasonable sexual performance. All these men are incapable of a full homosexual contact, though some have experimented with boys in childhood or early adolescence, but never intensely.",

      "abstract": "In contemporary psychology, normal development is contingent on the establishment of a coherent, universal, stable and unitary 'core gender identity'. The present study assessed the perception of gender identity in 'normative' individuals in Israel using the newly constructed Multi-Gender Identity Questionnaire (Multi-GIQ). The Multi-GIQ includes 32 items assessing gender identity (Feeling like a woman, Feeling like a man, Feeling like both a man and a woman, Feeling like neither), gender dysphoria (Contentment with affirmed gender and the wish to be the 'other' gender, Contentment with one's sexed body) and gender performance (Compliance with gender norms in clothing and language). Of the Men (n = 570) and Women (n = 1585) that participated in the study, over 35% felt to some extent as the 'other' gender, as both men and women and/or as neither. Although such feelings were more prevalent and on average stronger in Queers (n = 70), the range of scores for all measures of gender identity was highly similar in Queers and non-Queers. A similar pattern was obtained for measures of gender dysphoria and gender performance. Sexual orientation was not a major contributor to the perception of gender identity in both Men and Women. We discuss our results in view of the current debate around the terminology and diagnostic criteria of gender dysphoria (a substitutive category for Gender Identity Disorder) in DSM-V. We conclude that the current view of gender identity as binary and unitary does not reflect the experience of many individuals, and call for a new conceptualisation of gender, which relates to multiplicity and fluidity in the experience of gender.",

      "title": "Sex Differences in Aggression: A Rejoinder and Reprise",
      "abstract": "A meta analysis of observational studies of peer-directed aggression by children aged 6 and younger yields a highly significant sex difference. Out of 32 studies, z values reflected higher male aggression in 24, no difference in 8, higher female aggression in none. Furthermore, boys' aggression is most often displayed in the presence of male partners. Evidence is presented that the sex difference is probably not merely an artifact of higher rates of male activity or social interaction. Existing cross-cultural evidence also shows higher rates of male aggression, as does most of the work on free-living primates. Specifically, the 3 observational studies of chimpanzees show considerably more aggression in males. Evidence for a hormonal contribution to male aggression is clear in animals and inconclusive in human beings, although the existing human findings are consistent with such a contribution. Recent evidence on the differential socialization of boys and girls supports our earlier view: that boys do not receive more reinforcement for aggression than girls, and that rates of punishment are also similar once the differential base rates in aggression are taken into account. The role of self-socialization (including choice of same-sex models) is discussed, and the view is expressed that this probably depends upon the development of certain cognitions about sex identity which normally do not develop until a later age than the age at which a consistent sex difference in aggression first appears.",

      "abstract": "Children's social preferences are influenced by the relative status of other individuals, but also by their social identity and the degree to which those individuals are like them. Previous studies have investigated these aspects separately and showed that in some circumstances children prefer high-status individuals and own-gender individuals. Gender is a particularly interesting case to study because it is a strong dimension of social identity, but also one of the most prevalent forms of social hierarchy, with males conceptualised as superior to females, by adults and children alike. Here we directly asked how children's social preferences are influenced by status (winner or loser of a zero-sum conflict) and winner gender (female or male) in different scenarios (same or mixed-gender). In Experiment 1, children saw same-gender conflicts between two females or two males and they displayed an overall preference for winners. In Experiment 2, participants watched two mixed-gender conflicts, one where the female prevailed and one where the male prevailed. In this case, children chose the winner, but only when they had the same gender as themselves. Experiment 3 confirmed that children preferred own-gender individuals in the absence of conflict or status. Overall, children are sensitive to the relative status of other individuals and use this information to make social decisions. However, preschoolers do not prefer just any individual who wins access to a resource. They preferred dominant individuals, but only when they were of their own gender. This suggests that children's dominance evaluations are modulated by children's social identity.",

Yet, little is known about which behaviors people might experience as compulsive. Using YouGov America, a non-probability sample was collected, matched to U.S. representative norms, stratified, and weighted based on sample characteristics to ensure representativeness (N = 2,806; Mean Age = 48.9, SD = 17.3). Participants reported if they had experienced any concerns about their sexual behaviors being either \"out of control\" or \"an addiction.\" Participants who endorsed such concerns were then asked to indicate which behaviors had led to such concerns, using a checklist of 11 potentially overlapping sexual behaviors (e.g. frequent casual sexual encounters, using apps to find sexual partners). Men—both heterosexual and gay/bi/other–were more likely to report concerns that their sexual behaviors were an addiction, relative to heterosexual women. Relative to heterosexual women, men of any sexual orientation were more likely to report pornography use as a specific behavior of concern, and less likely to report partnered sexual behaviors. More religious participants were more likely to endorse masturbation as a behavior of concern and less likely to endorse frequent casual sexual encounters.",

This may lead to episodes of sexual miscommunication, which in turn sometimes result in sexual aggression. The study aimed to identify how following prevalent sexual scripts facilitates clear sexual communication or alternatives leads to miscommunication between Russian young adults. Individual in-depth interviews were conducted with 14 women and 11 men aged 19-25 years living in St. Petersburg (Russia) who had had at least one sexual partner of the opposite sex. Data were analysed thematically. Four themes were developed from the interviews: (1) endorsing (or not endorsing) traditional sexual scripts, (2) the presence or absence of sexual compliance, (3) softening refusal of sexual contact or intercourse, (4) the belief that asking for consent is unusual. Findings indicate that patterns and clarity of sexual communication differ depending on the type of relationship (serious, casual, and other), its stage, and partners' beliefs. Study findings underscore the need for sex and sexuality education for young people in Russia.",

      "title": "Boys who became offenders",
      "abstract": "Future offenders have more ratings than controls on variables indicating psychopathology. The characteristics which most consistently and significantly discriminate between preoffenders and controls, and which also turned out to be the best predictors of future criminality, are those which previously have been observed in subjects with serious mental disorders. The results indicate that the high degree of psychopathology in subsequent offenders is associated with distortion of body image and with poor reality orientation, i.e. that the most prominent characteristics of future offenders are related to a weakness of the ego. Future offenders seem to have a sufficiently developed ego to handle common tasks. However, their ego fails when they are confronted with unfamiliar and frustrating situations. The inability of subsequent offenders to complete a task properly, with failure on difficult and provocative tasks, shows that they have not developed adequate defence mechanisms and that they have a low tolerance for frustration. They are emotionally immature, instable and impulsive. In short, they are dominated by id impulses. There is no indication of gender confusion (homosexuality) in subsequent offenders. However, there are marked differences between the drawings by cases and by controls regarding characteristics related to sexuality. These findings are interpreted as an exaggeration of masculinity and an abnormal preoccupation with sexuality combined with anxiety for the opposite sex. It is possible that severe criminality, contrary to milder forms of lawbreaking, is associated with elevated self-esteem and extroversion. There are indications that ultimate offenders experience human beings (others or themselves) as deviant, monstrous and inhuman, features which indicate that distorted self-concept and distorted self-perception are characteristics of preoffenders. The findings regarding aggression are inconsistent, just as they were in prior projects. The Draw-A-Person Test (DAP) and Colour Slide Test (CST) findings indicate that preoffenders are more aggressive and destructive than controls, whereas the Hand Test (HT) shows neither more aggression nor more acting-out tendencies in future offenders than in controls. The literature offers conflicting findings regarding depression. The CST results indicate that depression is more common in preoffenders than in controls.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

      "abstract": "Lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) older adults may be more vulnerable to elder abuse (EA) due to prior marginalization and trauma, lifelong discrimination, and health disparities. While characteristics of both victims and perpetrators can modify the risk for EA, few studies have focused on perpetrators. This study examined the number and type of perpetrator-victim relationships and perpetrator profiles for EA experienced in the prior year, by abuse type and sexual orientation and gender identity of the abused. Data are from community-dwelling Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging participants aged 65 or older at follow-up 1 (n = 23,466). Heterosexual men and women reported being abused psychologically and physically most often by spouses or partners. Gay and bisexual (GB) men reported being abused psychologically most often by non-family, non-friend “others”. Lesbian and bisexual (LB) women reported psychological and financial abuse most often by siblings or other family members, and physical abuse by non-family, non-friend “others”. Heterosexual women were abused financially most often by their children, and both heterosexual and GB men reported more financial abuse by “others” or friends. Overall, 15% and 5% of participants reported abuse by multiple perpetrators of psychological and financial abuse respectively. LB women experienced more EA overall (18.8%), by multiple perpetrators (31% for psychological abuse, 66.5% for financial abuse) including by their siblings and other family members. These results have important implications for mitigation and preventive measures. They also highlight the need for further research concerning sexual minorities experiencing multiple abuse types and/or abuse by multiple perpetrators.",

      "abstract": "Using the eye gaze of others to direct one's own attention develops during the first year of life and is thought to be an important skill for learning and social communication. However, it is currently unclear whether infants differentially attend to and encode objects cued by the eye gaze of individuals within familiar groups (e.g., own race, more familiar sex) relative to unfamiliar groups (e.g., other race, less familiar sex). During gaze cueing, but prior to the presentation of objects, 10-month-olds looked longer to the eyes of own-race faces relative to 5-month-olds and relative to the eyes of other-race faces. After gaze cueing, two objects were presented alongside the face and at both ages, infants looked longer to the uncued objects for faces from the more familiar-sex and longer to cued objects for the less familiar-sex faces. Finally, during the test phase, both 5- and 10-month-old infants looked longer to uncued objects relative to cued objects but only when the objects were cued by an own-race and familiar-sex individual. Results demonstrate that infants use face eye gaze differently when the cue comes from someone within a highly experienced group.",

      "abstract": "We replicated and extended (N = 495) what is known about the relationships between the Dark Triad traits (i.e., narcissism, Machiavellianism, psychopathy) and a wider range (than previously reported) of sociosexuality including risky sexual behaviors (e.g., lack of condom use) and sexuality in relation to dating applications like Tinder, in general, in men and women, and above agreeableness. Machiavellianism and psychopathy were linked to most sociosexual behaviors and attitudes. In men, Machiavellianism was linked to various sociosexual outcomes, in women those outcomes were associated with psychopathy instead. Agreeableness was hardly correlated with sociosexual outcomes. The Dark Triad traits were more strongly correlated with the studied outcomes even after controlling for agreeableness or for the dark core. Unexpectedly, men who were Machiavellian and agreeable reported the most sex partners in different contexts, but not psychopaths. In contrast, women who were psychopathic not only had more sex partners in general, but they also engaged in more unprotected sex, and one-night stands than men did. These findings build on prior research on the Dark Triad traits and their associations with sociosexuality and help to draw a more nuanced and modern picture of those relationships.",

Moreover generally, women (wives) tend to conduct an affair with the emotional reasons and jealousy because more women will respond to any indications of emotional commitment among partners with others. Women who are involved in the affair are looking for a relationship that gives them emotional intimacy. Deficiencies found in self-life couples that make a woman decides to get what no other man gained in this research aims to reveal the affair is done by women who have been married more than 10 years, contributing factor and the description of the components in love with a woman who married more than 10 years. This research was conducted by case study, which in this study using the interview method is very general and systematic method of observation. This research subject is a woman who had been married for more than 10 years, conducting an affair for at least one last year. Based on the research that we can know that the subject had an affair during the first last year with fitness friends, the reason for having an affair subject to retaliation, and feeling lonely, the component of love with my husband changed the subject.",

This article tests the multifactorial approach by measuring variables in every area by questionnaire and videotape in a sample of undergraduates. Bivariate correlations and factor analysis reveal a robust factor linking occupations and leisure interests for both men and women. Women's gender-related attributes show little coherence outside this factor. Men display a “male dominance” factor connecting low expressiveness, sports interest, male friends, sitting with knees wide apart, and conservative attitudes toward feminism. The results support a multifactorial approach but also uphold a link for men between masculine attributes and more traditional attitudes toward gender roles.",

      "title": "Teenage pregnancy: the nonuse of contraception.",
      "abstract": "Despite their increasing knowledge and the availability of contraceptives and sex education programs teen-agers often do not use contraceptives. Factors affecting their nonuse of contraception include the following: 1) conscious or unconscious desires of young women to become pregnant without necessarily wanting a child; 2) the confirmation of masculinity for a young man by impregnating a woman; 3) the desire for security achieved by gaining peer support and feeling like 1 of them; 4) the feeling particularly of young women that planning for sex acknowledging its possibility and arranging for birth control makes them calculating loose and possibly immoral; 5) the impulsiveness and intensity of feelings of adolescents; 6) the widespread pressure to have sexual intercourse; 7) the myths and misconceptions about contraceptives; and 8) the difficulties in making information counseling and contraceptives easily available. If the use of a contraceptive is opposed by prevailing adolescent norms or represents a conflictual declaration of sexuality by the teen-ager the problem of contraceptive use increases. If contraceptives are offered without any examination or counseling problems also arise for the methods may be used incorrectly or may constitute an ecouragement of sexuality which the teen-ager may not be ready to handle. What the teen-ager often wants is help in sorting out feelings about a relationship or sex. Sometimes she/he may be asking for help in saying no because of ambivalence anxiety or a sense of not being ready. In relationships between young men and women it is often unclear as to who is to take responsibility for contraception. A psychiatrist can help the teen-ager develop the capacity to deal with her/his feelings and to predict behavior maximizing the possibility of planning. It is also important that the psychiatrist focus on family influences and issues without suggesting punitive or critical implications.",

Affection and contentment become crucial dimensions in experiencing sexuality. Psychophysiological reactions (erection, ejaculation) are protracted and less impetuous. Sexual disorders of elderly people can also be of psychogenic origin. Causative factors are conflicts, loss of interest in the partner, misinterpretation of physiological changes due to age, fears of physical illness through sexual activity, fear of failure towards younger more active female-partners and the like.

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Is young people's sexuality becoming more fluid and less tied to steady, stable identity patterns? Are we developing into a society where sexual relationships between individuals of the same sex are no longer reserved for the small minority of gay men and lesbian women? Adherents of so-called queer theory have promulgated such views. Using a population-based sample of young adults (aged 19 to 26, N 2753), we investigated homosexual experiences, desire and identity. We found that levels of prevalence of homosexuality were primarily a function of the criteria we used. Using the most restricted (\"narrow\") definitions, we found that about one percent of both genders reported \"exclusive\" homosexual interest and identity. Using the most inclusive criteria, we found that one of ten young men and one of four young women reported having some homosexual experience, interest or identity. Still, the most striking finding involved the substantial gender-specific differences: homoerotic activity and interest are far more interwoven with heterosexual activity for women. There are strong indications that homosexuality is a lot more threatening and potentially in conflict with traditional male gender roles than we find to be the case for women. In other words, while there may be signs of more fluid sexual identity categories, this phenomenon primarily applies to women.",

It refers to the maintenance of fixed beliefs and attitudes of male superiority, associated with overt or covert depreciation of women. Challenging chauvinist attitudes often results in anxiety or other symptoms. It is frequently not investigated in psychotherapy because it is ego-syntonic, parallels cultural attitudes, and because therapists often share similar bias or neurotic conflict. Chauvinism was found to represent an attempt to ward off anxiety and shame arising from one or more of four prime sources: unresolved infantile strivings and regressive wishes, hostile envy of women, oedipal anxiety, and power and dependency conflicts related to masculine self-esteem. Mothers were more important than fathers in the development of chauvinism, and resolution was sometimes associated with decompensation in wives.",

Unlike alcohol or drug abuse, suppression of sexual behavior is not an option, only compulsive character must be suppressed in order to allow a full and satisfying sexuality. The purpose of this observation is to explore the psychological and physical consequences of sexual addiction. We report the case of a patient with sexual addiction, in order to describe the impact of this addiction on his psychological and physical health. Mr. JG is 28 a years old man, he has no particular habits and no significant pathological history. He was addressed by his general practitioner for \"excessive masturbation\". His sexual history is characterized by: - An excessive interest in pornographic films since the age of 13, - An extremely rich fantasy life, - Frequent compulsive masturbation, going up to ten times a day. Through the years, this hyper sexuality has become more important, and masturbation more frequent, which resulted in: - Permanent feeling of embarrassment and shame, - Ideas permanently focused on sexual thoughts, - Fatigue and chronical physical exhaustion, - Constant muscle pain and headache, diminished visual acuity. - Relationship difficulties, and social maladjustment, - Depression and suicidal thoughts. The evaluation by the Carnes scale found a score of 16/25, which corresponds to a severe sexual addiction. The boundary between normal and pathological depends on the models and taboos of society, but for physicians, the major criteria for sexual addiction are mental suffering, social maladjustment, and demand of care.",

For example, a common trope in television, film, and other media is that women who engage in casual sex have low self-esteem. Despite robust work on prejudice against women who engage in casual sex, little empirical work has focused on the lay theories individuals hold about them. Across six experiments with U.S. adults ( N = 1,469), we found that both men and women stereotype women (but not men) who engage in casual sex as having low self-esteem. This stereotype is held explicitly and semi-implicitly; is not driven by individual differences in religiosity, conservatism, or sexism; and is mediated by inferences that women who have casual sex are unsatisfied with their mating strategy—yet the stereotype persists when women are explicitly described as choosing to have casual sex. Finally, the stereotype appears to be unfounded; across experiments, the same participants’ sexual behavior was not significantly correlated with their self-esteem.",

      "abstract": "Objectives: Although sexuality is valued throughout the lifespan, older women's sexual expression can be influenced by physical, mental and social factors, including attitudes and stereotypes held by younger generations. By gaining an understanding of what influences negative attitudes toward sexuality and beliefs about sexual consent capacity, the stigma associated with sexuality in late life may be reduced. Method: Using vignette methodology in an online survey, we examined older women's health and young adults' (N = 606; mean age = 18.86, SD = 1.42, range 17–36) general knowledge and attitudes toward aging and sexuality, personal sexual behavior, religious beliefs and perceived closeness with an older adult on attitudes towards sexual behavior and perceptions of consent capacity among older women. Results: The health status of older women proved important in determining young adults' acceptance and perception of sexual consent capacity regarding late-life heterosexual/autoerotic and homosexual behaviors. Specifically, young adults expressed lower acceptance and more doubt regarding capacity to consent to sexual expression when the older woman was described as cognitively impaired. Additionally, young adults' personal attitudes toward late-life sexuality, but not knowledge, predicted acceptance toward sexual expression and belief in sexual consent capacity. Conclusion: Attention toward the influence of older women's cognitive health and young adults' attitudes toward late-life sexuality may prove beneficial in designing interventions to decrease the stigma associated with sexual activity in later life.",

In addition, it seems likely the child's interest in and attitudes toward his peers are functions in part of the relations with his parents that develop out of the triangular interactions of parent, child, and sib. Since the psychological literature has not given the playmate problem much attention in considering the effects siblings have directly and indirectly upon each others' attitudes and interests, we have selected for study the question of the relation between certain characteristics of the associates or playmates of young children from two-child families and the relative age as well as sex of their sibs. Sex differences in playmate patterns were also given some attention. To be more specific, in addition to the sex of the child, the independent variables in the study are the child's ordinal position in his sibship, the age difference which separates him from his sib, and the sex of the latter. The dependent variables are the age and sex of the children",

      "title": "Just What Are Sex and Gender, Anyway? A Call for a New Terminological Standard",
      "abstract": "The terms sex and gender have come to be used as synonyms in the social sciences literature. However, nothing has been gained by the use of the term gender except confusion. This article identifies five meanings for which social scientists often use the terms sex or gender and proposes a distinct term for each of those five meanings. The terms proposed are (1) sex: to refer to the biological function; (2) biologically sex-linked: to refer to traits or conditions that are causally biologically related to being male or female; (3) gender-linked: to refer to traits or conditions that are causally linked with maleness or femaleness but are culturally based as opposed to biologically based; (4) sex- and gender-linked: to refer to traits or conditions that are causally related to both a biological component and a cultural component; and (5) sex-correlated: to refer to traits or conditions that are related to being male or female without asserting a causal relation to either biology or culture (because we do not wish to make such an assertion or cannot do so confidently). It is hoped that adopting a terminological standard will reduce the confusion resulting from nonspecific language use.",

Participants’ beliefs about the acceptability and legal regulation of these relationships were assessed, along with their judgments and beliefs about excluding someone because of his or her sexual orientation and the origins of same‐sex attraction. Older participants evaluated same‐sex romantic relationships more positively and used more references to personal choice and justice/discrimination reasoning to support their judgments. Younger participants were less critical of a law prohibiting same‐sex relationships and were more likely to believe it was not acceptable to violate this law. Beliefs about origins of same‐sex attraction showed age‐specific patterns in their associations with evaluations.",

      "abstract": "Abstract This study uses questionnaire data from 301 terminated romantic relationships to investigate hypotheses concerning the conditions under which a quality that is initially appealing in a partner is later disliked (i.e., a “fatal attraction”). Individuals are expected to be prone to fatal attractions when they are attracted to a quality in a romantic partner that is “different” in any of three ways: (1) different from the individual's own qualities (i.e., dissimilar); (2) different from average (i.e., extreme, or unique); or (3) different from normative expectations (i.e., gender atypical). Such attractions are less likely, however, when individuals are drawn to similarity in another. Findings from a logistic regression analysis provide support for four of the five hypotheses. Fatal attractions are significantly more likely when an individual is drawn to partner characteristics seen either as “dissimilar” from her or his own, as “unique,” or as “extreme” in nature. When these characteristics are viewed as “similar,” disenchantment is less likely. Fatal attractions are neither more, nor less, probable, however, when partner qualities contradict gender stereotypes. A qualitative analysis of open‐ended questionnaire responses provides further support for these attraction patterns. The findings have implications for diverse theories, including those of mate selection and dialectics.",

      "abstract": "Sports and male masculinity have an innate bond with each other. The advent of sports as recreational activity and the manliness that goes with sports have an imbalance from the time memorial which has existed to this day. Sports and games to determine masculinity and judge a fine body has been a practice of sorts from ancient times. The swayamvara(in ancient India, a practice of choosing a husband, from among a list of suitors, by a girl of marriageable age. Swayam in Sanskrit means self and vara means groom in this context) stated in epics where sports competition would be the most appropriate way to judge or select a prospective groom or the medieval tourneys,based on similar lines where sports were played by a gender to win another gender is something common across cultures. When women entered sports first as distant spectators and much later as active participants, issues deeply engraved in the patriarchal mindset of sports have time again emerged as serious fault lines of sorts. There have been problems and issues with female participation in sports , the codes and rules governing them and also the media representation of women in sports over the years. The paper aims to discuss some of the critical issues with regards to female representation in sports by media. The representation has been based on some preconceived notions about the very existence of sports.

      "abstract": "Deze studie kadert binnen het Procrustes-project en baseert zich op gegevens van meer dan 5000 leerlingen uit 55 Vlaamse secundaire scholen. Er wordt onderzocht of jongens vaker dan meisjes een B- of C-attest krijgen na hun eerste jaar secundair onderwijs. De genderkloof in het onderwijs wordt ruimer bekeken dan enkel in termen van verschillen tussen jongens en meisjes. Jongens en meisjes worden blootgesteld aan genderstereotypen die hun ideeen omtrent mannelijkheid en vrouwelijkheid beinvloeden. Jongens en meisjes die van zichzelf vinden niet aan te sluiten bij de dominante visies op enerzijds mannelijkheid en anderzijds vrouwelijkheid, identificeren zichzelf als gender-a-typisch. Leerlingen die zichzelf als genderatypisch beschouwen, omdat ze zich anders voelen dan hun geslachtsgenoten, zouden zich wel eens minder thuis kunnen voelen op school. Dit kan hun schoolresultaten negatief beinvloeden. Jongens hebben ongeveer dubbel zoveel kans op een C-attest als meisjes, onder controle van andere kenmerken (bv. migratie-achtergrond, socio-economische status). Er is geen geslachtsverschil in het krijgen van een B-attest. Wie zich als minder gendertypisch identificeert, loopt meer kans op een C-attest dan wie zichzelf eerder als een typische jongen of meisje beschouwt. Dit geldt zowel voor jongens als voor meisjes. Leerlingen hebben dus meer kans om een jaar te moeten blijven zitten als ze zichzelf eerder als ‘anders’ beschouwen dan het beeld dat ze zelf hebben van een typische jongen of meisje. Genderatypische leerlingen voelen zich minder verbonden met school en dit verklaart deels waarom ze meer kans maken op een C-attest. Aandacht voor de mate waarin jongens en meisjes zich verbonden voelen met hun school is nodig, al zeker voor die jongens en meisjes die van zichzelf vinden niet te passen binnen het dominante beeld van de typische jongen of het typische meisje. Genderstereotypen dienen doorbroken te worden, ook binnen de schoolmuren. Bovendien is er niet enkel sprake van een jongensprobleem in het Vlaamse secundair onderwijs. Ook de schoolloopbaan van sommige meisjes verloopt niet vlot. Een schoolbeleid dat genderstereotypen doorbreekt en leerkrachten ondersteunt bij het versterken van hun gendersensitiviteit in hun interacties met jongens en meisjes in de klas lijkt welgekomen en nodig.",

      "abstract": "As has been the pattern worldwide, the provision of donor insemination (DI) - and\r\nsubsequently other forms of donor conception - in the UK has traditionally been\r\ncharacterised by withholding the identities of donors and recipients and of donors\r\nand their donor-conceived offspring from each other. Furthermore, recipients of\r\ndonor gametes were frequently advised not to tell anyone, including their children,\r\nof their recourse to donor conception.1 Inter-related factors promoting such practices\r\ninclude:\r\n• the dubious legal and moral status of donor conception (including explicit\r\ndisapproval from several major world religions) – with consequent concerns\r\nabout the impact on the child and other family members if knowledge of\r\ndonor conception became “common knowledge”.2\r\n• suspicions about sperm donors’ personality and motivation.3\r\n• recipients’ ambivalence about the use of donor conception – especially DI.4\r\n• uncertainties about the impact on the child of knowledge of the circumstances\r\nof their conception (or assumptions that such knowledge would be\r\ndamaging).5\r\n• uncertainties about the donor’s legal or financial responsibilities towards the\r\nchild and to protect them from unintended/undesired contact or responsibilities.\r\n6\r\n• uncertain legal status of the child – and fears of prosecution/conviction for\r\nfalsification of birth registration information.7\r\n• stigma associated with male infertility in particular and families desires - and\r\nthe opportunity - to “pass as normal”.8\r\n• potential consequences of the parents’ imbalanced genetic relationship with\r\nthe child and fears of the child’s rejection of the non-genetic parent.9\r\n• fears of unwanted intrusion by the donor in family affairs.10\r\n• initial reliance on fresh sperm, requiring management of the geographical\r\nand temporal proximity of donor and recipient.11\r\n• parents’ uncertainties about the timing and method of telling their child and\r\nthe lack of information to give the child, making “not telling” – at least superficially\r\n- an easier option.12\r\n• physicians’ concerns about their potential exposure to critical external scrutiny,\r\nincluding risk of claims of unprofessional/illegal practice.13\r\n• need to maintain donor services in the face of the assumed adverse impact\r\nof disclosure on supply.14",

      "abstract": "The present study, utilizing a modified version of the It Scale for Children, investigated sex-role preferences of 10 boys and 10 girls each in Grades 1, 3, and 5 from a rural community in the eastern United States. Boys showed a stronger preference for masculine toys and activities than girls for feminine ones. Girls' scores were significantly greater in variability which may suggest greater variability and latitude allowed females in this society in adopting or prefering masculine activities, toys, and roles. It may also imply that sex-appropriate behaviors may be more narrowly defined for males than females. The masculine role may be perceived as one of higher status, encouraging boys to maintain sex-appropriate behavior while influencing girls to adopt some masculine traits. A test for the equality of two proportions shows there is no significant difference between the percentages in the present analysis and in Brown's (1957) study. The sociocultural environment and lifestyle of a small rural community may be more consistent and traditional in defining and maintaining traditional sex-role stereotypes. Also discussed is the need to socialize children in an androgynous fashion.",

      "title": "The Universality of Emotional Child Abuse.",
      "abstract": "Emotional child abuse is virtually inevitable in the context of the traditional nuclear family and often has a more detrimental effect on children than other, more widely publicized forms of maltreatment. Clinical, statistical, and empirical evidence shows that normative child-rearing practices in Western culture have pathogenic properties and effects. Parental abuse in the traditional nuclear family often results in the personal suffering, limitation, and maladjustment of children. Manifestations of this abuse include: (1) behavior based on parental hostility such as verbal abuse, sadistic socialization, and lack of respect for a child's boundaries, spontaneity, and individuality; (2) destructive practices including permissiveness and inconsistency; (3) overly restrictive or harsh moral codes; and (4) defenses and addictive patterns which tend to transmit from parents to children. A number of factors are involved in the psychodynamics of emotional maltreatment: (1) parents' ambivalent feelings toward themselves and their children; (2) their projection of their negative traits Onto their children; (3) a confusion of emotional hunger with love; (4) the exclusivity of traditional couplings; and (5) the utilization of the child as a symbol of immortality. The more parents were deprived or abused during their formative years, the greater the impairment of their parental functions. The nuclear family is not inherently detrimental to human mental health, but it has evolved into a destructive institution. Only by dealing with the issues that make families dysfunctional can family life be made more supportive and constructive for children. (Contains 118 references.)

Here we use cross-cultural approach to find out whether some traits could be labelled as highly prevalent or nearly universal. We further employed comparative perspective to analyze whether these traits are unique in humans or whether they are shared with our evolutionary relatives. This led us to formulate eight broad spheres which are reported cross-culturally. These include 1) building long-term sexual relationships and expected or enforced sexual exclusivity; 2) sexual activities not restricted to fertile period and 3) prevalent through the year which suggest other than reproductive functions of the sex in humans; 4) in contrast to chimpanzees attractiveness is relatively stable across the cycle; 5) humans appear to be the only species with exclusive male homosexual orientation; 6) similarly, presence of menopause is unique to human females, which was linked to relatively risky delivery and extreme altriciality of human children; and finally, 7) humans do not commonly perform sexual activities in the presence of others. All of the addressed phenomena are interpreted in the evolutionary perspective.",

      "abstract": "Due to differences in access to sexual information, some people may be more likely to endorse sexuality myths, which could be linked to poorer sexual and relational outcomes. The goals of this study were to: 1) investigate predictors of sexuality myth endorsement; 2) examine links between endorsing myths and sexual and relational outcomes; and 3) assess whether group membership strengthened associations between myth endorsement and sexual and relational outcomes. A large and diverse sample of undergraduate students (N = 1,077) and community adults (N = 3,359) completed an online survey assessing their demographics, sexuality myth endorsement, and sexual and relational outcomes. Being assigned male at birth, identifying as cisgender, identifying as heterosexual, being younger, holding more conservative political views, being more religious, living in an urban locality during childhood, and not receiving sex education predicted greater sexuality myth endorsement. Greater sexuality myth endorsement predicted lower sexual satisfaction, lower sexual function (among people with vulvas), higher sexual distress, and lower relationship satisfaction. Generally, the strength of associations between myth endorsement and sexual and relational outcomes did not differ across demographic factors. Overall, findings provide insight into groups more likely to endorse sexuality myths, who thus may be at risk of poorer sexual and relational outcomes.",

In four studies ( n = 261) we tested the hypothesis that heterosexual men with a greater propensity to be threatened by homosexuality would react to egalitarian norms by endorsing biological theories of sexuality. Heterosexual men, but not women, with narrow prototypes of their gender in‐group endorsed biological theories the most (Study 1). Heterosexual men with higher gender self‐esteem, with heterosexist attitudes, who endorsed traditional gender roles, and with narrow prototypes of their gender in‐group, endorsed the biological theories more when egalitarian norms rather than anti‐egalitarian norms (Studies 2 and 3) or pro‐minority ideologies that emphasized group differences (Study 4) were made salient. These findings show group‐level reactive distinctiveness among members of a high‐status group in a context of threat to the unique privileges that they once enjoyed.",

The girls were more willing to offer detailed, serious reflections, whereas the boys' contributions were shorter and more jokey, with a greater use of sexual slang. The family was the main source of sexual information for the girls, but friends and the media for the boys. The boys were more interested in contraception, abortion and the mechanics of intercourse and childbirth, whereas the girls were more interested in relationships and more aware of the pain that could be caused by loss of children and early pregnancy. The girls had clearer and more realistic aspirations than the boys in terms of both career and family life, and understood the dangers which drugs, alcohol and violence could pose to relationships; the boys, on the other hand, sometimes appeared insecure in their self-image, and tended, albeit in a joking manner, to link violence and sex. These findings are rich in implications both for policy and practice in sex education and more generally for an understanding of the way that a differentiated sexual identity develops in boys and girls.",

Multi-partner behaviour among men, which is frequent, often simultaneous and ongoing, appears to be closely linked to conflict and violence in couples, but the probability of being a victim to such violence is partly rooted in childhood difficulties and violence suffered in a family context. The latter is characterised by significant residential proximity, complex family configurations, and the composite sibling configurations that result therefrom. Female single-parent households show particular characteristics depending on whether the mother has visitingpartner relationships, is separated from the father or fathers of her children, or has never had sustained love or sexual relationships.",

However, cross-cultural ethnographic and observational studies with humans indicate that, beginning after age 5 years, males and females form differing social structures with unrelated individuals in a community. Specifically, compared with females, human males exhibit greater tolerance for and form larger, interconnected groups of peers which we term \"gregariousness.\" To examine sex differences in gregariousness early in life when children first interact with peers without adult supervision, 3- to 6-year-old children were given the choice to enter one of three play areas: an empty one, one with an adult, or one with a familiar, same-sex peer. More males than females initially chose the play area with the same-sex peer, especially after age 5 years. Sex differences in gregariousness with same-sex peers likely constitute one facet of human sociality.",

The diminished capability associated with disease may be gradual and spotty, a grey zone that can last for years. Other, non-medical factors are also significant: vulnerability arises by reason of an individual's total life situation, including relationships, education, experience, personality, and connection to society. Protecting the interests of the vulnerable but capable has been considered in terms of protection from abuse, and/or in terms of capacity. Each approach has significant conceptually structural problems. Unless a very narrow definition of is used (essentially replicating the criminal offences dealing with assault and theft) adult protection legislation has inappropriately paternalistic aspects; older adults are entitled to make objectively foolish choices, take risks, or prefer new, disreputable friends over older, staider ones. Older adults do not require protection from the consequences of their own choices, freely made. A finding of incapacity would resolve the difficulty by simply re-categorising the vulnerable person as incapable, a response that will often be excessive and result in an unwanted and unnecessary loss of independence. Modern least-intrusive adult guardianship legislation attempts to modify that all or nothing outcome through a scheme of graduated capacities. In reality neither paradigm - abuse or capacity - realistically captures or appropriately responds to the range of situations in which the vulnerable but capable adult requires the assistance and support of the law. Those situations are most accurately understood with reference to the conceptual framework of equitable fraud.",

      "abstract": "Bullying is harmful to both the victim and the bully, but in teen sports, one of the main causes is jealousy. If your child is a competitive athlete, the bully may be on the same team, or in a solo sport like figure skating, may be a friend. In either case, the friendship or team‐player attitude can dissolve under the powerful emotion of jealousy. And the bullying can take on a vicious aura because it is so taboo to sabotage your teammate or competition — unsportsmanlike to the nth degree — so it's not overt.",

For the youngest age group, a similar level of risk-taking of the different orientation groups suggests uniform sociocultural influences.",

      "title": "Personality and sexual relations.",
      "abstract": "This investigation examined the links between self-monitoring propensities and orientations toward sexual relations. A factor analysis of behavioral and attitudinal survey data revealed that high selfmonitoring individuals tend to establish an unrestricted orientation toward sexual relations (such that they may engage in sex with others to whom they are not necessarily psychologically close), whereas low self-monitoring individuals tend to establish a restricted orientation (such that they will engage in sex only with partners to whom they are psychologically close). At the behavioral level, high relative to low self-monitoring individuals indicated that they had a larger number of different sexual partners within the preceding year, could foresee themselves having sex with a larger number of different partners within the next 5 years, and were more likely to have engaged in sex with someone on only one occasion. At an attitudinal level, low relative to high self-monitoring individuals indicated that they would be more reluctant to have sex with someone to whom they were not committed, and that they would be more uncomfortable with, and less likely to enjoy engaging in, casual sex with different partners. Possible origins and implications of these contrasting orientations are discussed. Throughout the ages, it has been a matter for contemplation, debate, and personal statement: Given human nature, what is the role of love, closeness, and commitment in sexual relations between consenting partners? Are and commitment necessary prerequisites for sexual relations? Is the sexual experience empty and meaningless without psychological closeness between the partners? Or can sex be a comfortable, enjoyable, and even enriching experience for partners who, although attracted to each other, are not psychologically close? If one samples literary, academic, or personal statements made on this issue, one is likely to find pronounced disagreement. Compare and contrast, for instance, the views of Bertrand Russell, Civilized people cannot fully satisfy their sexual instinct without love (1929), and Adrienne Rich, I'd call it if love/ didn't take so many years/ but lust too is a jewel (1966). Indeed, at least within Western cultures, there may be reliable and substantive differences in orientations toward sexual relations. Some people believe that—at least for themselves—sexual relations need not be restricted to relationships in which they and their partners are psychologically close. They may claim, for instance, that if they were attracted to someone, they would feel comfortable and at ease engaging in sex with that person, even if they did not know him or her well. Such people may be said to",

      "abstract": "CONSIDERABLE evidence supports the view that the patterns of sexual behavior displayed in response to hormonal stimulation are related to the character of the soma or substrate on which the hormones act rather than to the amount of hormone, provided a certain threshold quantity is present (Young, Dempsey, Myers and Hagquist, 1938; Boling, Young and Dempsey, 1938; Young and Fish, 1945; Grunt and Young, 1952, 1953; Riss and Young, 1954). More recently it has been shown for the male guinea pig that patterns of sexual behavior are formed as the result of an interaction of experiential and genetic factors. Contact with other animals plays an important role in the acquisition of the mature copulatory pattern, but the amount of contact that is required varies depending on the genetic strain to which the individual belongs (Valenstein, Riss and Young, 1955).",

Free descriptions of a same-sex liked peer written by third to sixth grade boys (N = 254) and girls (N = 254) were studied from a cognitive-developmental perspective and with regard to content. Boys' and girls' descriptions did not differ in ego-centrism, level of abstraction, or level of organization. Girls' descriptions, however, were cognitively more complex (i.e., more diverse in content). This might be related to girls' more intense dyadic forms of relationships with liked peers. Content analysis revealed that boys tend to focus on the peers themselves (content categories: achievements, preferences and aversions, personality characteristics) as distinct from their environment, whereas girls tend to perceive their liked peers as embedded in their contexts (background information, family, and kinship). This difference seems to reflect the more instrumental character of boys' relationships with peers and the more personalized character of girls' relationships.",

Any disturbance in one of the components can be a disaster in sexual life. Erectile dysfunction is a disability to get an erection or to maintain the erection well enough for a sexual intercourse, which persists or recurs at least three months conse-cutively due to either psychogenic or organic disturbances, or both. Some psychogenic dis-turbances especially depression, anxiety, and relational distress, play some important roles in ED. Besides that, aging, low testoteron level, physical diseases, and some certain medicines have to be included. Key words: erection, erectile dysfunction, sexual stimulus, depression. Abstract: Fungsi seksual yang normal merupakan suatu proses biopsikososial yang berkaitan langsung dengan kualitas hidup. Adanya gangguan pada salah satu komponen dapat menjadi malapetaka bagi kehidupan seksual. Disfungsi ereksi dapat dedefinisikan sebagai suatu keti-dakmampuan untuk ereksi atau mempertahankan ereksi yang cukup untuk melakukan hu-bungan seksual yang memuaskan, yang menetap atau berulang paling tidak selama tiga bulan berturut-turut.

Part 1 investigated the effect of race of model and S on imitation of behavior. Part 2 investigated the effect of paternal status on choice of a male or female model and masculine sex-role preference. The Ss were exposed to filmed models. Black Ss expressed a significant preference for the black model, but for Chicano Ss no significant preferences among the black, white, and Chicano models were obtained. Father-present Ss had a significantly higher male sex-role preference score as compared to father-absent Ss. Both father-absent and father-present Ss imitated the male model significantly more than the female model, but these scores did not correlate significantly with the sex-role preference score. By age seven, masculine preference appeared well-established, but it was more marked for father-present Ss.",

To examine these trajectories in early childhood, 229 children (African American, Mexican American, and Dominican American) were followed annually from age 3 to 5 years, and gender‐stereotypical appearance, dress‐up play, toy play, and sex segregation were examined. High gender‐typing was found across ethnic groups, and most behaviors increased in rigidity, especially from age 3 to 4 years. In addressing controversy surrounding the stability and structure of gender‐typing it was found that from year to year, most behaviors showed moderately stable individual differences. Behaviors were uncorrelated within age but showed more concordance in change across time, suggesting that aspects of gender‐typing are multidimensional, but still show coherence.",

      "abstract": "Nearly half of U.S. high school students (9th-12th graders) have had sexual intercourse and over 60 percent report having had sex by the time they graduate. This demonstrates that many adolescents are confronted at some point during their teen years with choices about whether or not to have sex and if they do whether or not to use condoms and/or other contraceptives. Many factors affect those choices. Parents educators and other adults working with youth have learned that they cannot directly control the sexual behavior of teens. While parents might wish to monitor their sons or daughters 24 hours a day to prevent them from having sex or at the very least unprotected sex they cannot do this. Instead parents and others concerned about youth can only try to affect those factors that in turn affect the sexual decision-making of young people. For example they might try to affect factors such as the teens values about sexual behavior their perceptions of family values and peer norms about sex their attitudes about condoms and other forms of contraception their educational and career plans or their connection to their parents their schools and their faith communities all of which are likely to affect whether or not teens have sex and whether or not they use protection against pregnancy and sexually transmitted disease (STD). Understanding important factors related to sexual behavior is important not only to change that behavior; it is important to identify those teens who are most at risk of having sex and unprotected sex. First people can use these factors to identify those teens at greater risk; then they can address the important factors affecting their behavior. This report identifies many of these factors and explains their implications for those working to help youth avoid risky sexual behaviors and potential consequences. (excerpt)",

      "abstract": "In most animals, members of one sex compete more intensely for mates than members of the other sex, and show a greater development of secondary sexual traits. The relative intensity of mating competition in the two sexes depends on the operational sex ratio (OSR) (the ratio of males that are ready to mate to females that are ready to mate) at the site and times when mating occurs. The extent and direction of biases in the OSR is closely related to the potential rates of reproduction that individual males and females can achieve, although the distribution of the two sexes in space and time, sex differences in development time or life expectancy, and biases in the sex ratio at birth or hatching can also be important. The potential rates of reproduction in the two sexes are, in turn, affected by the proportion of time and energy expended by male and female parents on their progeny, though other factors may constrain reproductive rate in one or both sexes. We outline a simple model of the factors affecting the OSR, where relative parental expenditure by the two sexes and the adult sex ratio are fixed, and a more complex model where the adult sex ratio varies in relation to the reproductive activity of the two sexes. This framework for relating sex differences in mating competition to the OSR, potential reproductive rates, and parental expenditure differs from Triver's concept of the relation between parental investment and mating competition in three ways: first, it identifies the OSR as the immediate factor determining which sex completes most intensely for mates; second, it recognizes that factors other than the future fitness costs of rearing offspring can affect the potential reproductive rate of the two sexes; third, it suggests an empirical measure (potential reproductive rate) that can be estimated in natural populations and used to predict the distribution of mating competition.",

Some men of an advanced age, feeling that their sexual ability is at stake, can be even more exposed to the compulsive risk of regressing to phallic defences by entrusting their own identity and self-esteem to their possibility of performing the sexual act. Mature genital organisation—that is, full recognition of oneself and of the other in his or her entirety—is an ideal for men as it is for women. Perhaps for a woman the problem, although equally as crucial, can be less obvious since she can easily dissimulate to herself and to her partner because she does not have to \"show\" or \"demonstrate\" anything at the concrete level about her ability to enjoy or give pleasure.",

These notions were examined by exposing male and female subjects to same‐sex or opposite‐sex stimulus persons varying in their proportion of heterosexual/homosexual experience and self‐rated sexual orientation. All persons were evaluated with regard to likability, work partner desirability, intelligence, morality, and adjustment, and rated along a number of dimensions assessing perceptions of sexuality. Results were that exclusive heterosexuals were seen as more likable, moral, and well‐adjusted than all persons with homosexual experience, but bisexuals with less than half total homosexual outlet were regarded as more likable and as more desirable work partners than persons with more homosexual experience. Exclusive heterosexuals, and bisexuals with up to half of their total sexual outlet being homosexual outlet, were rated higher on factors tapping perceived sexual desirability and sexual activity than persons with a greater proportion of homosexual experience. Results were discussed with respect to the meaning of homosexual experience in interpersonal perception.",

      "title": "Sex, gender and gender identity in Australian sport",
      "abstract": "Western society has stereotypical expectations of how men and women should behave, think, and act. Women are expected to be gentle, sensitive, emotional, and talkative; men to be competitive, independent, unemotional, and objective (Fiebert & Meyer, 1997). Women who violate these cultural norms may be punished or threatened with psychological isolation, economic hardship, and social ostracism (Unger & Crawford, 1996). In the sporting context however such violations are encouraged and deemed necessary for athletic success to be achieved. For example to be a successful female athlete it is necessary to possess the same traits, characteristics, and behaviours as male athletes (Anshel, 1994; Cote & Salmela, 1996). Hence what is considered appropriate outside of sport may not be considered appropriate within sport, and vice-a-versa. Researchers of gender issues within sport psychology have assumed the existence of stereotypical notions of sex and gender in sport without first establishing if these stereotypical notions are context specific. They have not investigated the particular construction of sex, gender, and gender identity within sport. By not investigating the existence of stereotypical constructs, researchers risk propagating old myths in a new context. This paper addresses the questions of what is male and female, masculine and feminine in sport? How are these notions constructed? Furthermore how do these influence sporting performance? This paper critically explores sex, gender, and gender identity in sport. It examines sport in Australia as a separate and unique social context that may produce and reproduce engendered behaviour.",

      "title": "Contextual Information Shifts Young Children’s Understanding of Gender Constancy",
      "abstract": "Children's understanding of the stability of gender over time has long been recognized as a hallmark of early childhood cognitive development. Prior research has argued that until roughly age 6, children do not understand that a person's gender identity remains consistent if the person undergoes a change in gendered behavior or appearance. However, this prior work has generally not given children any context as to why the behavior or appearance change is occurring. The present study showed U.S. three-to-five-year-olds a character (e.g. \"Johnny\") undergo such a change that occurred because of external factors (e.g. \"Johnny is wearing his sister's dress because all his clothes are dirty\"); we asked whether children would indicate that the character's gender was the same pre- and post-change. Children (N = 124, 52% girls, 66% non-Hispanic White) as young as 3 demonstrated an understanding of gender consistency and were significantly more likely to endorse gender consistency when they were, versus were not, given context for the change (p < 0.001, Cohen's d = 0.88). Results suggest that U.S. children take context into account when conceptualizing others' genders and believe that gender is generally consistent across transformations in behavior or appearance by age 3. We discuss the implications of these findings in light of a broader literature about children's understanding of gender constancy as well as contemporary understandings of gender that sometimes accommodate the idea that a person's gender can change.",

      "title": "“Terrible Twos” and “Terrible Teens”: The Importance of Play",
      "abstract": "In the process of individuation, toddlers and their adolescent parents share similar dynamics; that is, both are involved with anxiety-laden preoccupations about difference and separateness and about bodily changes, loss of control, and containing aggression. Both experience internal struggles between emotional vulnerability and a sense of invincibility; both make fierce self-assertive bids coupled with a powerful need for guidance. When synchronized, such teen-toddler similarities can create a bond of mutual excitement; when their intentions clash, however, a terrible battle of wills erupts, fuelled by furious frustration or intense despair. It is suggested that play can provide an essential bridge between teen parent and toddler, enabling each to work through his/her anxieties and passionate reactions of love and hate. Joint play increases reciprocal understanding. However, a teen deprived of play in childhood, or one who resents her/his own playtime being curtailed by parenthood, may become intrusive or controlling, projecting disowned aspects of her/his self into their mutual play. The parent thus breaks the play frame, creating confusion in the child between pretence and reality. By providing a safe space to explore conflictual feelings through joint play, thoughtful practitioners can foster better emotional awareness and mentalization in troubled young parents and their toddlers.",

      "abstract": "From a historical perspective, sport is considered a male domain and heteronormative societal field. Although societal change has happened, in most sports, male, heterosexual athletes, as well as stereotypical masculine behaviour and appearance are still being privileged. Based on heteronormativity and assumed male physical superiority, mindsets about typical and appropriate gender expression permeate sporting environments. Athletes who do not meet these socially constructed, gendered expectations often experience barriers, exclusion and discrimination. Against this background, the study analyses the prevalence of (non-)conforming gender expression and its relevance for experiencing negative episodes in sport, considering the athletes' sex and the gender-typing of sports practised. The sample consists of lesbian, gay and bisexual + individuals actively participating in sport in Europe (n = 2232). The findings suggest that gender non-conformity is less prevalent among male than female LGB+ athletes, particularly in stereotypically masculine sports. Significant correlations between non-conformity to socially constructed expectations of typical feminine or masculine expression and negative episodes in sport occur. The results indicate that LGB+ athletes use different strategies to avoid 'homonegative bias' and that sport needs to be rethought on individual, organisational and societal levels.",

Although our findings do not speak for adolescent and adult male and female behavior, they should caution the social scientists and animal ethologists who are interested in possible evolutionary and survival theories not to underestimate the effect of learning environments. These learning environments may well be responsible for the behavior frequently attributed to the innate characteristics of male and female primates as inherited by their human descendants.",

      "abstract": "In Freud's theory of the origins of femininity in females, there is a stage unaccounted for in the chronology of the little girl's development: the first many months of life are not considered. We know by now that castration anxiety, penis envy, and the traumas and frustrations of oedipal conflict are easy to demonstrate; but if the first stage in female development is different from Freud's description-if a fundamental, fixed sense of being rightfully a female is established in earliest childhood-then our psychology of women needs repair. The factors that make up this stage, with examples, are reviewed: (1) a biological \"force\": the effect of circulating fetal sex hormones on the brain of the fetus; (2) sex assignment: the announcement at the time of birth to the parents that they have had a boy or a girl (or a hermaphrodite); (3) parental attitudes: the effects of the sex assignment on parents, then reflected back onto the infant; (4) \"biopsychic\" phenomena: early postnatal effects caused by certain habitual patterns of handling the infant-conditioning, imprinting(?), or other forms of nonconflictual learning; (5) developing body ego: sensations, especially from the genitals, that define the child's dimensions. I suggest that one can divide the development of femininity in females into two phases, both of which lead to adult femininity, but each of which contributes in a different manner. The first, nonconflictual in origin, contributes a sense of femaleness and some of what allows for one's looking feminine; the second, the result of conflict, especially oedipal, produces a richer and more complicated femininity, not merely one of appearances, but one enriched by desires to perform with the substance, rather than just the façade, of femininity.",

      "abstract": "Emotional expression plays a vital role in men’s mental health. However, emotionality is still perceived as a feminine response and its restriction is enmeshed in male identity. Gay men’s supposed relationship to femininity infers they are less emotionally restrictive. This paper offers evidence and theory that counters this. A quantitative study (n = 300) was undertaken on self identified heterosexual and gay adult men contacted through targeted social media websites. Research questions explored if there were differences in emotional restriction in gay and heterosexual men, and if stereotypical gender characteristics (masculinity, femininity) influence these variations. Constructs and corresponding scales measured conflicted gender roles, restricted emotionality and gender role scores. Findings revealed no statistical emotional restriction differences between gay and heterosexual men. However, there were significant differences in their gender roles. Specifically, heterosexual men’s emotional restriction was dictated by a combination of high masculinity and low femininity scores (which calculates a masculine category), and the avoidance of femininity suggested by low femininity scores. Gay men’s higher femininity scores and reduced frequency in the masculine category would (mistakenly) suggest lower emotional restriction scores. The findings suggest that gay men construe femininity differently to heterosexual men, affecting their emotional expression.",

Boys completed significantly more words in groups than in dyads, whereas girls' performance was similar in the 2 social structures.

      "abstract": "The attachment of the infant to the mother can be seen in open parkland when an infant is set free for exercise and play. In an area of safe space, a mother has little cause to restrain her child, nor, owing to other attractions around, to entertain or otherwise divert him. In order to deduce which of the women and infants make up kinship pairs, the observer postulates criteria for recognizing a pair; attachment is then conceived of as factors which identify a mother and her infant in field conditions. The infant detaches himself from his mother but he maintains proximity to her, particularly around the age of 2 years, when his proximity- and contact-seeking are at their height. Yet, at this age, the infant shows most alertness to remote events. From 2 years old onwards, the presence of age-mates competes for the infant's proximity. Hence, the statistical data presented below is from observations which were made when the likelihood of interruption by neighbouring people was minimal. Proximity to the mother can be defined as the child's being at rest beside her, or as his playing in her vicinity, or as a pattern of exploratory locomotion with the mother the centre of the territory he covers. In each of these aspects, the behaviour of 1-, 2- and 3-year-olds is distinguished by typical distances from the mother. The infant's responsiveness to unexpected sights or sounds is inferred from the orientation responses he makes to them. In his postures and the distances he takes up from the mother, his feeling-states of alertness, fear, anger, uncertainty, fatigue and conflict are expressed; when thus activated, he tends to relate himself to his mother.",

In those ways, they are like more ordinary sexual preferences, generating sexual impulses that are insistent. Individuals are strongly tempted to act on them, alternatives to satisfying them are unfulfilling, and complete long-term control of such impulses is unlikely. Yet, since individuals with sexual preferences for inappropriate objects or activities are neither morally nor legally permitted to act on them, they find themselves in a terrific bind. The public is, to some extent, correct to not trust the individuals with such preferences and to attempt to monitor or control them. However, most such efforts appear ineffective and counterproductive. Recidivist sex offenders are particularly worrisome. The possibility of voluntary castration for such offenders, in lieu of preventive detention or other more restrictive measures, is explored.",

It was proposed that sex role perception could be described on two levels. The first level entailed a sex role enactment based upon superficial understanding, whereas the second level involved a sex role taking based upon a deeper understanding. The measuring device consisted of a standardized interview of 20 narratives, 10 covering the first level 10 the second level. Each narrative described the objectively observable behavior (level 1) or the supposedly constant personality characteristics (level 2) of a typical boy or girl. The subjects, 8‐ and 12‐year olds, listened to each story and then were asked whether a typical boy, girl, or both would have performed the behavior or expressed the personality quality. The results suggest that both 8‐and 12‐year‐old children understand the superficial as well as the deep aspects of sex roles. However, the younger children accept the sex role differences, whereas the older children are starting to question them. There was also evidence of a developmental difference in experiencing sex roles between boys and girls. The 8‐year‐old girls in the study most strongly recognized the sex role differences and therefore were the most rigid in their sex role conceptions. The 12‐year‐old girls were the most liberal group in their approach to sex roles. The boys fell in‐between, with small developmental differences.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Recent research has indicated that with age, children are decreasingly individualistic and that girls are more individualistic than boys. Previous research, however, has been based on very small numbers of children and/or small numbers of choice situations. The present investigation tested for sex, age, and cultural differences in individualism among 500 Anglo-American and Mexican-American children of 6 to 11 years. Children made choices on a large array of three-alternative choice cards which systematically varied the absolute gains, absolute advantages, relative gains, and relative losses associated with the individualistic alternative. There was a robust tendency for all children to avoid options that awarded more points to a peer than to themselves, and that tendency was greater among older compared to younger children. The expected sex difference in individualism was not observed, and the expected tendency for decreasing individualism with age was observed only among Anglo-Americans at the oldest ages. Ten- and 11-year-old Mexican-American children selected more individualism options than the younger Mexican-American children. The discrepancy between the present and previous findings is interpreted as probably due to sample and method differences; researchers are cautioned against generalizations based on small numbers of Ss and/or limited numbers of choice situations.",

El flirteo e insinuaciones a terceros es la ASO interactiva más común en hombres (55.1%) y mujeres (45.1%). Los hombres tienden a preferir aquellas ASO interactivas que buscan establecer contacto sexual offline, mientras que las mujeres presentan preferencia por el cibersexo online. Sin embargo, las diferencias de género solo son estadísticamente significativas para la búsqueda de pareja sexual online (χ2= 3.870; p=.049). El consumo de cibersexo interactivo es muy común en personas con una relación estable (89.5%-92.9%), de forma que no se aprecian diferencias estadísticamente significativas respecto a los solteros para ninguna ASO. Este trabajo nos ha permitido demostrar que el género se constituye como un claro factor modulador en el uso y la selección de ASOs para conocer a gente con fines sexuales y/o románticos. No obstante, parece que el hecho de tener o no pareja estable no es un factor explicativo de este uso.",

      "abstract": "There are two main themes underpinning most research and writing on gender, sexuality and youth sports: a concern with social inequalities based on gender and sexuality, and a concern with sport as a site where limiting gender norms are (re)produced for boys, girls, young women and men.The two themes are not distinct but are often intertwined in discussions of gender and sexuality in relation to youth sports.For example, girls' limited access to and different experience of sports, such as the different codes of football, are not only about fewer resources or opportunities but about the ways the practices associated with football as a traditional male sport celebrate and train for particular forms of [hegemonic] masculinity, thereby putting at risk the claim to being appropriately female of those girls and women who might want to play.In addition, such practices also work to exclude and put at risk those boys who do not demonstrate socially valued forms of masculinity in their performance of the game, or who choose not to play the game.These themes have been explored in relation to school sports, community and club youth sports, contemporary and action sports and from the perspectives of sociology of sport and cultural studies.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Women's mate choice criteria were examined experimentally in the contexts of long‐term and extra‐pair mateship scenarios. In long‐term mateships, women may benefit by pairing with males who provide material resources and assistance in child rearing. In contrast, in extra‐pair mateships, women may benefit in other ways, with such benefits outweighing the potential costs imposed by a primary mate who discovers the relationship. One benefit, or evolutionary function, of extra‐pair mateships may be to replace a primary mate, in which case mate preferences should look similar across long‐term and extra‐pair contexts. However, another function of extra‐pair mateships may be to obtain high quality gametes (Le., “good genes”), in which case women should be differentially attracted to cues of heritable phenotypic quality, such as physical attractiveness. By using detailed verbal and pictorial descriptions of men and requiring participants to trade off physical attractiveness for good character (i.e., being a good cooperator and parent), it was possible to determine whether women's criteria for partners varied across experimental contexts. Findings suggest that extra‐pair mateships may have served the evolutionary function of obtaining “good genes,” because attractiveness was more important in extra‐pair mateships to the detriment of good character. This effect was maintained even when characteristics of the female participants (age, parity, marital experience) were covaried. In addition, the preference for physical attractiveness was specific to the sexual context; it did not generalize, in a second experiment, to choices among short‐term male coworkers.",

      "abstract": "Summary The research reported in this paper looks at the relationship between perception of school subjects as masculine or feminine and other attitudes towards sex roles and sex traits, motivation and subject choices at A‐level of boys and girls in coeducational comprehensive schools in England and Wales. The pupils' perceptions of subjects confirmed earlier findings, in that the sciences were seen as masculine and arts and languages as feminine, although a majority of pupils believed that both sexes were equally good at most subjects. A sex‐stereotyped view of subjects was associated with sex‐stereotyped attitudes towards occupations and roles. It was hypothesized that pupils whose attitudes were stereotyped and who saw themselves conforming to traditional notions of masculinity and femininity would be more likely to choose sex‐appropriate subjects. This hypothesis was confirmed in the case of boys but not for girls. Boys showed much more bias in their subject choices and those choosing exclusively masculine subjects were much more likely to support traditional sex roles and to conform to traditional notions of masculinity. No such pattern was found for girls. Girls doing feminine subjects were more likely to have non‐stereotyped views than those doing masculine subjects and were equally unlikely to conform to traditional notions of femininity.

      "title": "Normal feline behaviour: … and why problem behaviours develop",
      "abstract": "Practical relevance: Cats are descended from a solitary, territorial ancestor, and while domestication has reduced their inherited tendency to be antagonistic towards all animals larger than their typical prey, they still place more reliance on the security of their territory than on psychological attachments to people or other cats, the exact opposite to dogs. Many feline problem behaviours stem from perceived threats to this security, often due to conflicts with other cats. Others are more developmental in origin, often caused by inadequate exposure to crucial stimuli, especially people, during the socialisation period. Strongly aversive events experienced at any age can also contribute. A third category comprises normal behaviour that owners deem unacceptable, such as scratching of furniture. Evidence base: This review identifies three areas in which basic research is inadequate to support widely employed concepts and practices in feline behavioural medicine. First, classification of cats’ problem behaviours relies heavily on approaches derived from studies of their behavioural ecology and, to some extent, extrapolation from canine studies. Few studies have focused on cats in the home, the environment in which most behavioural disorders are expressed. Secondly, cats’ chemical senses (olfactory and vomeronasal) are far more sensitive than our own, making it difficult for owners or clinicians to fully comprehend the sensory information upon which they base their behaviour. Thirdly, although the concept of psychological distress is widely invoked as an intervening variable in behavioural disorders, there are still no reliable measures of distress for pet cats in the home. Global importance: Psychological distress of some kind is the primary cause of many of the behavioural problems presented to clinicians, but surveys indicate that many more cats display the same clinical signs without their owners ever seeking help. The welfare of this ‘invisible’ group could be improved by veterinarians taking a more proactive approach to educating their clients about the behavioural needs of pet cats.",

As will be discussed, certain lesions are highly specific for sexual abuse while others may be nonspecific or more consistent with a medical disorder or accidental injury. It is important to remember that the vast majority of children disclosing sexual abuse do not have physical evidence of injury or infection on examination. Sexual abuse describes involvement of children and adolescents in developmentally inappropriate sexual activities to which they are unable to consent and which they cannot comprehend. Violent assault causing severe injuries is the exception in child sexual abuse, as sexual abusers often exploit the power differential between victim and perpetrator to manipulate children into complying with sexual activity.",

No claim is made that the models are either realistic or good — the models have been constructed to show certain aspects of EXPRESS-G rather than to illustrate information modeling in general. Here is a summary of what the model in Example 20.1 says: a person must be either a male or a female. Every person has some defining characteristics, such as first and last names, date of birth, type of hair, and may also have zero or more children (which are, of course, also people). A male may be married to a female, and vice-versa. The partners in a marriage must be unique — this model is only appropriate for monogamous societies. There is one particular piece of information about females that does not apply to males; a female may have a maiden name. The Age of a person is a derived attribute that is calculated through the function years, which determines the number of years between the date input as a parameter and the current date. A Person has an inverse attribute which relates people who are children to their parents.",

These individuals were paired with people without such conditions. Each pair was left alone on a pretext and covertly videotaped. Pairs were then separated; each member spontaneously recalled information about her partner and the experimental room and provided a record of her thoughts and feelings during the interaction. As hypothesized, all master status Ss were particularly likely to be mindful in social interactions; they recalled detailed information about the situation and often took their partner's perspective during the interaction. The positive or negative connotations of the master status conditions were irrelevant in predicting Ss cognitions (mindfulness) but were critical in determining Ss behaviors (interaction strategies).",

Using data from a 28-day diary study with 208 bi+ individuals, we found that bi+ visibility attempts were concurrently associated with more positive affect, higher identity affirmation, less depressed/anxious affect, as well as more anti-bisexual experiences and rejection sensitivity. Prospectively, the likelihood of consuming alcohol (but not marijuana) was higher the day after making a visibility attempt, and positive affect was higher the day before making an attempt. Making visibility attempts in contexts that may have been more supportive (e.g., with friends, partners, and lesbian/gay individuals) was associated with more positive outcomes (e.g., more positive affect), while making attempts in contexts that may have been less supportive (e.g., with family, strangers, people who are unaccepting of bi+ identities, and heterosexual people) was associated with more negative outcomes (e.g., higher rejection sensitivity and more discrimination). These findings suggest that the contexts in which visibility attempts are made may play an important role in the impact that bi+ visibility attempts have on stigma-related stress and wellbeing.",

The sexual activities ranged from low (e.g., cuddling), moderate (e.g., kissing), to high (e.g., sexual intercourse) intensity. We found that most adolescents having sexual activities of low-to-moderate intensity with same-sex individuals also had them with other-sex individuals, and adolescents having other-sex contacts of low intensity often reported them nonexclusively. Furthermore, other-sex and same-sex sexual activities did not reliably distinguish between sexual orientation identities. Sex differences in these phenomena were absent or small. These findings suggest that many adolescents have low-intensity nonexclusive sexual behaviors.",

An adapted life story interview was conducted with seven participants between the ages of 20 and 47 years. Life stories were analysed using content analysis. \r\nThe study found that non-masculinity was defined in different ways and that social context, including threat, impacted on gender expression. Non-masculinity was strongly associated with male homosexuality. Homophobic verbal and physical abuse was portrayed alongside negative appraisals of non-masculinity. This may be indicative of internalised anti-effeminacy values.\r\nMarginalisation in gay communities was also portrayed, including romantic rejection. Intersections of gender-expression and ethnicity or age were important in evaluations of sexual attractiveness. Conversely, masculinity was often eroticised or regarded as aspirational. Positive qualities associated with non-masculinity included expressiveness, humour and flexibility in working with power demonstrations of others. These reinforce the assertion that effeminate and androgynous men bypass facets of gender-role conflict.",

Inappropriate sexual behavior (a common cause of disruption among children who are hospitalized for psychiatric disorders) may be caused either by hypersexuality or by simply ill-regulated behavior: a definition of hypersexuality is proposed that can be applied at the bedside (namely, sexual behaviors or fantasies that have abruptly increased in frequency by comparison with a previous baseline, are of sufficient excessiveness to disrupt expected or usual social, academic, or occupational functioning, or constitute a source of distress), so that this distinction can be made promptly, and we present a differential diagnosis for hypersexuality to direct its evaluation. Virilization does not seem to be a common cause of hypersexuality in children and adolescents, but it should not be overlooked when it does exist.The differential diagnosis of hypersexuality in adults, which we present for comparison, is much larger than it is in children.",

In the first survey, subjects show that they have different expectations of opposite gender’s favorable game style where both genders have exactly same favorite styles. In the second survey, we investigate how members of hostile sexism community groups choose teammates in Overwatch game if they have privilege to select teammates for specific roles. Ilbe and Womad as two far extreme misogyny and misandry groups show hostile sexism in teammate selection. The result implies that hostile sexism and gender stereotype shown in game playing may be induced from other social factors than the amount of the game playing experiences. &lt;/span&gt;",

      "abstract": "Adolescence can be a burly period of human growth and can have greatly affects on the later behavior in life. The period of adolescence is, therefore, a very fragile period in which every young person puts a certain tune. This is often the trick of playing video games, whose excessive consumption of children and young people can become addictive. Dependence on a video game implies hysteria and anger attacks when a person is trying to move away from the computer. Often with addiction of playing video games comes a lot of psychological difficulties and disruptions such as anxiety disorder that can occur in young people. One of the major problems with increased separatist anxiety is the child's absurdity for natural social development and socialization. Starting from the assumption that the difference between the sexes in video games is obvious and therefore unsatisfactory, we have confirmed this with a questionnaire surveyed by students of the seventh and eighth grades. Through 120 copies of the questionnaire, we concluded that there are many differences in playing video games between boys and girls, where boys spend much more time playing games than girls do. Also, boys play much more demanding, games, often strategic and warlike, lacking violence and aggression. Likewise, all of these are influenced by their defense mechanism expressed through negation, as most primitive form of defense mechanism, and regression. Based on our research we have proved two hypotheses: a) At both sexes there is a connection between the success of development overcoming and adolescent crisis and the levels of their addiction to the video games. b) There is a difference between girls and boys in the young adolescence, in the way of overcoming the separation crisis and getting addicted to video games.",

Responses were categorized as Characteristics of Communication (nature of interactions participants had at home about sexuality) and Major Message Content (actual themes of those conversations). Commonly reported characteristics were trouble talking with parents; most conversations happened with mothers; participants feared parents’ reactions; and among lesbian, gay, bisexual groups, feared parents’ discovering their nonheterosexual orientation. Commonly reported message content included use protection and, among women, wait. Women reported messages that were at best, mixed, and at worst, threatening or moralistic. Men reported fewer conversations, and those recalled were more neutral or encouraging, especially from fathers. Parental messages to males and females differed qualitatively, reflected stereotypical assumptions about gender roles, desire, and appropriate conditions under which to have sex, and lacked support for nonheterosexual orientations.",

      "abstract": "Studies have found that audiences are often presented with characters that conform with traditional gender roles but there to date has been no empirical investigation into these characters from the actors' perspective.We investigated the extent to which actors (n = 318) are required to conform to traditional gender roles in the course of their work and the disparity between their acted and ideal characters.We found that both male and female actors were required to portray traditional gender roles but that men were required to conform with these traditional notions of gender to a greater extent, resulting in the broadcast of a masculinized ideal.Both male and female actors indicated they would prefer to portray characters that conform less with traditional gender roles than their most recent character.Our findings support calls from audience driven research for movement away from the portrayal of traditional gender roles within the arts.",

      "abstract": "Dominant accounts of sexual prejudice posit that negative attitudes toward nonheterosexual individuals are stronger for male (vs. female) targets, higher among men (vs. women), and driven, in part, by the perception that gay men and lesbian women violate traditional gender norms. We test these predictions in 23 countries, representing both Western and non-Western societies. Results show that (1) gay men are disliked more than lesbian women across all countries; (2) after adjusting for endorsement of traditional gender norms, the relationship between participant gender and sexual prejudice is inconsistent across Western countries, but men (vs. women) in non-Western countries consistently report more negative attitudes toward gay men; and (3) a significant association between gender norm endorsement and sexual prejudice across countries, but it was absent or reversed in China, India, and South Korea. Taken together, this work suggests that gender and sexuality may be more loosely associated in some non-Western contexts.",

It focuses on sports and physical activity as well as nutrition. The chapter also focuses on the aspects of sexual life directly linked to health; however, one should never forget that adolescents who are not sexually active are still sexual beings, and sexual experience and intercourse is just one aspect or dimension of sexuality among those teenagers who are sexually active. The development and acknowledgement of sexual orientation plays an important role in the formation of adult identity. Adolescents suffering from chronic diseases and/or disability often face difficulties in integrating a defective body within their sexual development.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Sexual motivation strongly influences mate choice and dating behavior and can be triggered by merely viewing sexually arousing visual images, such as erotic pictures and movies. Previous studies suggested that men, more than women, tend to search for sexual cues that signal promiscuity in short-term mates. However, it remains to be tested whether sex differences in the motivation to view sexual cues can be observed by using robust and well-controlled behavioral measures. To this end, we employed a pay-per-view key-pressing task. Japanese self-identified heterosexual male and female participants viewed images of men, women, or couples with two levels of sexual arousal (sexual vs. less sexual). Participants could alter the viewing time of a presented image according to their willingness to keep viewing it. Male participants were the most eager to view sexually arousing images of the opposite sex, whereas female participants were more strongly motivated to view less sexual images of couples. Such sex differences may reflect differentiated reproductive strategies between men and women in terms of men’s motivation toward promiscuity and women’s motivation toward long-term relationships.",

      "abstract": "Sexual orientation is a complex area. It is unclear to date how people precisely establish their preferred sexual objects. This paper presents two cases, whose heterosexual preference were changed in late adolescent age after a severe psychological event, to draw attention to the study of the possible underlying mechanism. Case 1, one identical male twin, was seriously punished at age 12 years, as he loved a girl in his classroom. Afterwards, he feared to contact with girls, and became attracted to young men at age 17 years, and kept same-sex sexual behaviors since then. However, his twin brother is always heterosexual. Case 2, a girl at age 16 years, was unexpectedly betrayed by her boyfriend, she bore great pain and distress in the beginning. Since then, she had a definite opinion that men were unbelievable, and gradually turned her heterosexual preference and had same-sex sexual behaviors with a girl classmate more than 3 years. Our case presentation indicates that severe frustration of primary heterosexual desires or behaviors and the successive cognitive regulation might lead susceptible adolescents into reorienting their sexual preference. The role of prefrontal cortex and related neuromodulatory pathways were discussed.",

For example, men show a more stationary, linear sexual desire, more often separate sex-life from love-life, engage in heterosexual or homosexual one-night-stands and more often buy sex from a prostitute. Some sexual deviations manifest themselves only in males. Most sexual offences are committed by mean. Sexual assaults are, of course, unacceptable. But sexual offences are often a token of powerlessness when failing in relation to oneself and/or other people. Thus not only victims of sexual assaults, but also the perpetrators need help in order to prevent further sexual assaults. In the paper some experiences with therapy of sexual offenders in Denmark and Germany are discussed.",

Although the right action under this belief is to choose \"die\" most people chose to be with the majority. Both men and women tended to make this mistake, but women's propensity to err in this particular experiment was stronger.

      "abstract": "Abstract Although watching movies is typically enjoyable, they also can elicit discomfort. The present studies investigated what makes some moviegoing experiences emotionally uncomfortable. Using autobiographical memory (Study 1) and scenarios/vignettes methodology (Study 2), young adults remembered watching a movie that had made them uncomfortable or responded to scenarios about watching a particular type of movie with particular co‐viewers (e.g. violent movie with one's spouse). Movies eliciting discomfort were most often dramas (39%) or comedies (26%). Discomfort most often arose from content, particularly fairly explicit sex or violence, and secondarily from the presence of co‐viewers. Often the two interacted, for example, being uncomfortable watching explicit sex with one's parents. In terms of dealing with the discomfort, women were overall more direct and men more avoidant. A sizable minority was glad they had seen the film, in spite of the discomfort, and was open to seeing it again. Arguing from converging evidence, these different methodologies produced consistent results. Copyright © 2010 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.",

According to the results of the factor analysis, the determining features of the axio-psychological design of the life achievements of the individual in the period of early adulthood of the female gender were determined, represented by the following integral psychological characteristics - 10 factors: disposition of self-efficacy, disposition of perfectionism, attribution of responsibility, overcoming obstacles, use of unproductive coping, \"futile efforts\", combination of androgyny with femininity, benevolence, desire for success, lack of adequate mental age assessment. Instead, representatives of the male gender of early adulthood are distinguished by the following integral psychological characteristics - 10 factors: traits of the male gender in achieving success, overcoming obstacles, helplessness, lack of externally regulated perfectionism, failure, lack of independence as a lack of result, understanding of the situation, reward for what has been achieved, duality of externally regulated perfectionism , affective-conative complex. Gender-based differences between the factors of axio-psychological projection in early adulthood have been revealed: in women, this process is motivated by the disposition of self-efficacy and perfectionist guidelines, and in men by masculinity traits and the desire to overcome obstacles.",

However, it is not clear whether those who are the most biased in one domain (e.g., gender) are also the most biased in other domains (e.g., ethnicity). This study addressed the issue using multiple measures of prejudice (negative bias) in 3 domains: gender (male, female), ethnicity-language (French Canadian, English Canadian), and body type (overweight, normal weight). The flexibility of attitudes (i.e., the belief that people from different categories can possess similar traits) was also assessed. A total of 254 children (127 boys, 127 girls) in kindergarten to Grade 6 participated. Children demonstrated clear biases against groups to which they did not belong, although attitudes became more flexible and prejudice declined somewhat with age. There was little predictive power across domains; that is, there was no evidence that prejudice represents a general characteristic that differentiates children.",

This study examined influences of gender beliefs on sexual self-labeling identification and criteria for a romantic partner's sexual role, along with the related mechanism (N = 543). Gender beliefs were represented through gender roles attitude and gender values regarding couples. Individuals endorsing traditional gender beliefs and having high internalized homophobia were more likely to identify as tops. However, individuals with internalized stereotypical gender-roles were more likely to have fixed self-labeling (e.g. exclusively tops and exclusively bottoms) rather than flexible self-labeling (e.g. versatiles). Gender beliefs indirectly affected sexual self-labeling via internalized traditional gender-roles and internalized homophobia. Gender beliefs directly impacted requiring a partner to be complementary, and indirectly affected this element through internalized traditional gender-roles. The results demonstrate that gender beliefs affect sexual self-labeling identification and partner choice by way of internalized, stereotypical gender beliefs in relation to sexual self-labeling. This study implicated the heteronormative culture's influences on patterns in same-sex relationships among Chinese gay and bisexual men.Lay summary This study examined the influences of gender beliefs on self-labeling (top, bottom, and versatile) and partner choice in gay and bisexual men in China.

      "abstract": "Twenty-one heterosexual women who were or had been married to bisexual or homosexual men and had children by them responded to a 28-page questionnaire that explored their experiences as wives and mothers. All of the married women expected a lasting, monogamous marriage. Only three had partial knowledge of their husband's sexual orientation before marriage. All of them went through a painful grief reaction when they learned that their husbands had emotional or sexual, or both, attachments to other men. The suffering was aggravated by feeling deceived or stupid for not having guessed the truth. What made it difficult for them to seek support from family and friends was the fear of encountering social disapproval or ostracism. They were afraid for themselves, their husbands, and their children. At the time of the study 11 of the 21 women were still married and living with their husbands, but most of them felt unsure that the marriage would last. Ten were in transition, separated, or divorced. Only three of the still married wives had complete confidence in the future stability of their relationships. These marriages were characterized by good communications, husbands who considered themselves bisexual, and an open marriage contract whereby wives could have heterosexual affairs. Findings cannot be generalized from this small convenience sample, but will hopefully encourage further research. The writers are also soliciting more subjects to enlarge the sample.",

      "title": "Women's Competition and Aggression",
      "abstract": "Abstract For female mammals, the rewards of aggression (such as increased rank) rarely outweigh the costs (injury or death). These costs exert a stronger effect on natural selection in females than males because offspring survival depends more strongly on maternal than paternal survival. To support the proposal that greater avoidance of aggression (and other risky activities) by women is mediated by a more reactive fear system, experimental, psychometric, hormonal, and neuroimaging studies are reviewed. Evidence suggests that monogamy, characteristic of the Homo line for over a million years, has resulted from sexual conflict (reproductive advantage accruing to women more than men) rather than sexual selection (within‐sex advantage to men who remained with a single mate). However, monogamy means that women as well as men must compete for the best mates. This competition is usually expressed through intersexual strategies in which women advertise those traits favored by men or through low‐risk indirect forms of within‐sex aggression (e.g., stigmatizing, ostracizing). Ecological factors including age, early menarche, operational sex ratio, extreme variance in male resources, and local cultural norms can decrease the threshold for women's use of direct physical aggression.",

      "abstract": "Four phases of normal human male courtship behavior may be differentiated: location and initial appraisal of a potential partner; pretactile interaction (e.g., smiling at, posturing for, or talking to a prospective partner); tactile interaction (e.g., embracing, petting); and effecting genital union. A particular class of erotic anomalies may be seen as distorted counterparts of the four normal phases: voyeurism; exhibitionism and obscene telephoning; toucheurism and frotteurism; and the preferential rape pattern. Data from male samples are presented that show that two or more of these anomalies are often found in the same individual. These data suggest the existence of a discrete syndrome which may be described as a courtship disorder.",

Agency is characteristically and is represenced by such atrributes as objectivity. self-assertion, mastery, and repression; communlon IS and is represented by subjectivity, interpersonal relatedness, cooperation and openness. Fifty male and 50 female introductory psychology studencs (M.,. = 20.2 yr.) described their actual and ideal selves on 10 specially selected semantic differential scales. Analyses of variance on each scale yielded a significant (9 < .05) main effect of se!f-description. For both men and women the mean actual and ideal self-descriptions were different for each of the 10 dimensions (exce~t for dominating-submissive). Ideallv. both men . A . , and women wanted to be more relaxed, calm, outgoing, active, rational, imaginative, tough, unconventional, and humorous. There were significant main effects of sex for the scales tough-tender and rational-emotional. For both actual and ideal selves men described themselves as tough and women described themselves as tender. For both actual and ideal selves men described themselves as mote rational than did the women. There was a significant effect of sex and an inreraction of self-description by sex for the dimension of dominating-submissive. Subsequent t tests indicated men described themselves as more dominating than did women on both the actual and ideal selves; ideally, the men wanted to be even more dominating, in contrast to [he women who showed no shift in chis dimension between their actual and ideal self-descriptions. Of the 40 self-description means 27 (68%) were significantly (I, p < .05) different from a theoretical mean of 4.0, semantic neutrality. The men described their actual selves as slightly active. tough, rational, and dominating. The women described their actual selves as slightly tender, active, conventional, and tense. The men described their ideal selves as quite relaxed, active, outgoing, and tough, slightly dominating. calm. rational, and humorous. The women described their ideal selves as quite relaxed, active, and outgoing, slightly cender. humorous. calm, rational, and imaginadve. Generally, there were more similarities than differences between men and women in their actual and ideal self-descriptions. On the dimensions showing sex differences the men described themselves as more agentic than did the women. supporting Bakan's hypothesis and replicating previous research (2, 3) Men described their actual selves as primarily agentic; ideally they wanted to be even more agentic, i.e.. more tough, dominating. active, and rational. Women described their actual selves as communal (tender). androgynous, i.e., neither dominating nor submissive, rational nor emotional, and somewhat agentic (active, tense) ; ideally, the women wanted to be communal (relaxed, render, imaginative), agentic (active, rational), and somewhat androgynous (neither dominating nor submissive). Neither men nor women were exclusively agentic or communal. Women were less committed to feminine acrual and ideal self-descriptions than men were to masculine self-descriptions.",

      "title": "Anxiety increases sexual arousal.",
      "abstract": "Twelve male subjects who were trained to expect tolerance-level electric shocks viewed an erotic film under three different counterbalanced conditions. In one condition, subjects viewed erotic film in conjunction with a signal light indicating threat of shock. A second light indicated threat of shock if subjects did not achieve an erection of a certain size. A third light indicated no shock. Both anxiety-inducing shock-threat conditions increased penile response over and above np-shock-threat condition. Furthermore, shock threat contingent on size of erection produced more arousal than noncontingent-shock threat. There is an almost universal assumption that primary maintaining factor in male sexual dysfunction is anxiety, specifically, performance anxiety or fear of performance, and modal treatments employed have as a major goal reduction of this anxiety. Masters and Johnson (1970) note a number of initial etiological pathways to erectile dysfunction, such as alcohol abuse and unfortunate, early traumatic sexual experiences; but, in regard to subsequent maintaining factors, they observe that the prevalent roadblock is one of fear. Fear can prevent erections just as fear can increase respiratory rate or lead to diarrhea or vomiting (p. 196). Unfortunately, this is an assumption without evidence in either dysfunctional or normal subjects, an assumption that goes beyond careful observations that Masters and Johnson and other clinicians have made when dealing with sexual dysfunction. The few attempts to examine relationship between anxiety and sexual arousal have been puzzling. In 1977, Hoon, Wincze, and Hoon showed 2-minute film sequences that were either neutral in content or that were designed to produce anxiety (vivid scenes of auto' accidents) to normal women, These",

      "title": "The language of toys: Gendered language in toy advertisements",
      "abstract": "Children are socialized to conform to traditional gender role stereotypes, a developmental process affected by elements of popular culture that associate femininity with passivity, nurturance, and emotional expressivity; and masculinity with power, agency, and aggression. Toys, as one element of popular culture, often reflect these stereotypes through manipulations of design features that signify the gender appropriateness of toy play. Prior research on toys has documented the gender-differentiated use of such overt markers as colors, names, and logos in toy marketing. However, subtler gender markers such as the language used to advertise toys has received little research attention. This is surprising given the evidence of distinctive language styles adopted by females and males that are considered to reflect traditional gender role stereotypes. In this study, the narrative language that accompanied action figures marketed for girls, and action figures marketed for boys was analyzed for the presence of gendered language. It was hypothesized that lexical elements associated with traditional gender role stereotypes would differentiate the narratives as a function of gender. Results showed that female action figure narratives contained more intensive adverbs, more social words, and more adjectival references to physical appearance, fantasy, and triviality, supporting stereotypes of females as emotional, social, and uninvolved with real world concerns. Male narratives contained more second-person plural pronouns, more aggression words, and more adjectival references to power, destructive action, and science and technology, supporting stereotypic masculinity associations to power, aggression, action, and involvement with real-life endeavors. Discussion focuses on potential adverse consequences to children’s psychosocial development that is posed by exposure to gender-polarized toys.",

      "title": "Concerns about Misidentification as Gay/Lesbian and Fear of Sexual Advances",
      "abstract": "Social contagion concerns, which are defined as heterosexuals’ fears about being misidentified as gay/lesbian, can lead to avoidant and hostile responses toward gay men/lesbians. I argue that fear of becoming the target of sexual advances from gay men or lesbians, if misidentified, contributes to contagion concerns. I further hypothesized that the overperception of sexual interest from gay/lesbian individuals leads to heightened fears of sexual advances by same-sex gay/lesbian individuals if misidentified. Consistent with these predictions, in two studies fear of sexual advances was identified as a strong, independent predictor of social contagion concerns (Study 1a & 1b). An additional study (Study 2) showed people who are higher in trait contagion concerns thought their gay/lesbian interaction partner displayed more sexual interest in them, compared to those lower in trait contagion concerns. However, contagion concerns did not influence the interpretation of sexual interest from a heterosexual interaction partner. Additionally, when paired with a gay/lesbian partner high trait contagion participants were more concerned about being misidentified as gay/lesbian, more anxious about the upcoming interaction, and more interested in avoiding the interaction. Finally, perceptions of sexual interest and concerns about sexual advances mediated the indirect effect of the partner sexual orientation X contagion concerns interaction on concerns about being misidentified during the interaction. High contagion participants with a gay/lesbian interaction partner perceived more sexual interest from their partner, which was associated with increased fear of sexual advances from their partner, which then predicted increased concerns about being misidentified as gay/lesbian during the interaction.%%%%A Dissertation submitted to the Department of Psychology in partial fulfillment of the Doctor of Philosophy.%%%%Summer Semester 2017.%%%%July 12, 2017.%%%%Overperceptions, Prejudice/Stereotyping, Sexual Advances, Sexuality/Sexual Orientation, Social Contagion Concerns%%%%E.

Comienzan repasando la literatura psicológica acerca de androginia psicológica y flexibilidad comportamental y seguidamente concretan sus hipótesis: comprobar que los individuos andróginos a) mostrarán una mayor implicación en tareas tanto masculinas como femeninas, b) preferirán en menor medida actividades apropiadas a su sexo y c) experimentarán un mayor bienestar psicológico al desarrollar este tipo de actividades que cualquier otro grupo de rol sexual. Tras describir el método y los resultados del trabajo, los autores ofrecen una discusión final de éstos, en la que destacan que su investigación parece confirmar los resultados de Bem: parece que es el rol sexual andrógino el que siente un mayor grado de bienestar al realizar conductas que son sancionadas socialmente como inapropiadas a su sexo y el que escoge un mayor número de este tipo de comportamientos. Los autores finalizan afirmando que también parece haber quedado respaldada la validez predictiva del Bem Sex Role Inventory.ABSTRACTThe authors investigate the hypothesis of androgynous subjects as being more flexible in terms of their implication and confort, when confronted to tasks culturally typified as adequate to the \"other\" sex.They start by reviewing the psychological literature about psychological androgyny and behaviour flexibility; then, they specify their hypothesis' aims: to prove that androgynous subjects a) will show a higher implication in both masculine and feminine tasks, b) will show less of a preference to the tasks adequate to their sex, and c) will experience a higher psychological well-being performing these activities than any other group of sexual role. After describing the method and results of their work, the authors offer a final discussion, highlighting the fact that their research seems to confirm Bem's results: the androgynous sexual role seems to experience a higher degree of confort performing tasks that are socially considered as inadequate to their sex and seems also to choose these sort of activities more often. The authors end the work stating that the predictive validity of BSRI (Bem Sex Role Inventary) seems to be also backed by the results.",

Principle findings are that in spite of severe genito-sexual dysfunctions the majority continued having intercourse and about half felt orgasmic. Sexuality maintained its pre-injury significance for nearly all subjects, and most characterized their sexual lives as at least to some extent satisfactory. Loco-motor impairment and autonomous dysreflexia were more frequently given as causes of reduced sexual pleasure than were sexual dysfunctions. High spinal cord severance and lack of regular partner were negative factors for continuation of satisfying sexual experiences. Thus, genital sexual dysfunction is but one factor determining level of sexual satisfaction after a spinal cord trauma as many younger tetra- and paraplegics appear to be able to identify new and gratifying ways of sexual fulfillment.",

      "abstract": "Although most sexting among adolescents occurs in the context of romantic relationships, researchers have not fully investigated how relationships involving sexting differ from those that do not. This study assessed how individual and relationship characteristics differ by whether adolescent dating partners sext (N = 269). Adolescents in sexting relationships were more likely to report sexual intercourse with their dating partner compared to those who did not sext, scored lower on measures of self-reported relationship competency, and were in relationships characterized by more abusive behaviors and verbal conflict, as well as less positive support. Boys who sexted their dating partners reported less positive intimacy in their relationships than girls who sexted. Adolescents in relationships where one partner sent more sexts than the other did not report more negative relationship behaviors relative to non-sexters and those who sent equal numbers of sexts. Lastly, relationships with and without sexting did not differ on whether they had broken up six months later. Results suggest that sexting may be a characteristic of lower-quality adolescent romantic relationships, but more information about the sexting context is needed. Implications for understanding sexting as both a normative feature of adolescent romantic relationships and as a risky sexual behavior are discussed.",

One potential avenue by which it may occur is the misinterpretation of social cues, and such misperception may be mediated by extreme sex role adherence, i.e., hypermasculinity and hyperfemininity. 62 undergraduate students viewed a film of a neutral interaction between a college-aged man and woman. Subsequently, participants indicated which behaviors they remembered the opposite-sex actor performing, offered a prediction as to the outcome of the scenario and what they would do had they been in a similar situation, and then completed either the Hypermasculinity Inventory or the Hyperfemininity Scale. Scores on the former correlated negatively with recall accuracy, and men indicated that they were more likely to date and have sex with the actress than women reported being likely to date or have sex with the actor. Women reported a high perceived likelihood of dating the actor coupled with the expectation that he would have sex with the actress. Likewise, women expected to be sexually coerced by the actor had they been in a similar situation. Social implications of these findings and possible research are discussed.",

Gay men attending sex clubs attribute different value to collective sex and to committed relationships, and experience different challenges in satisfying their desires for intimacy.

CHILD DEVELOPMENT, 1984, 55, 2114-2121. Most cognitive theories of sex typing-including cognitive social learning theory and cognitive-developmental theory-suggest that sex typing results, in part, from a 2-step process: children are thought to acquire stereotypes of sex-appropriate behavior, primarily through observational learning; they are then thought to adopt as their own preferences the behaviors they have encoded as appropriate for their own sex. To determine if very early sex typing occurs in this sequence, 2-, 3-, 4-, and 5-year-olds were tested both for knowledge of sex role stereotypes and for preferences for sex-typed activities. Contrary to the hypothesized sequence, boys' acquisition of sex role stereotypes lagged behind (by about 1 year) rather than preceded their development of sextyped preferences. Girls' data neither clearly refuted nor clearly confirmed the hypothesized sequence. A secondary finding was that boys displayed equally strong tendencies to endorse same-sex activities and to reject cross-sex activities, whereas girls unexpectedly displayed a stronger tendency to reject cross-sex behavior than to endorse same-sex behavior.",

      "title": "Adolescent Sexual Wellbeing: A Conceptual Framework",
      "abstract": "Positive aspects of sexuality remain understudied among adolescents globally, especially in low- and middle-income countries. In particular, consensus is lacking on how to conceptualize different aspects of sexual wellbeing among young people. We propose a new conceptual framework for adolescent sexual wellbeing that draws on existing theories and definitions, grounded in theories related to positive youth development, empowerment, human rights, gender, social-ecological and life-course perspectives. The framework highlights six interrelated domains of key competencies that are central to healthy adolescent sexuality development, whether or not sexual activities occur: 1) sexual literacy, 2) gender equal attitudes, 3) respect for human rights and understanding consent, 4) critical reflection skills, 5) coping skills and 6) interpersonal skills. These competencies have the potential both to strengthen and impede adolescents’ sexual wellbeing in relation to both themselves and others. Personal sexual wellbeing includes, but is not limited to, having a positive sense of one’s own (sexual) self and body, and recognising and appreciating feelings of pleasure and desire. Relational sexual wellbeing can include developing and maintaining mutually respectful, gender equal relationships with other people that are that are part of young people’s sexual socialisation, such as peers, parents and community members. Over time, relational sexual wellbeing may also include outcomes related to intimate partners, such as equality in relationships, safe and pleasurable sexual interactions, free from violence and coercion. Whether young people are able to translate competencies into desired actions and achieve a sense of sexual wellbeing depends on the personal, social and economic resources available to them, their (sexual) agency, and on the influence of opportunity structures such as policies, laws and norms. We end with discussing the potential implications of the framework for public health programmes and research studies aiming to improve adolescent SRHR and wellbeing.",

This study examines the effect of the child's gender (male vs. female) and physical maturity (pre-pubescent vs. early pubescent) on the moral evaluation of apparently noncoercive adult–child sex in a 2 × 2 factorial online vignette experiment. One hundred eighty-three English-speaking pedophilic men rated their agreement with moral arguments on the Immoral Sex Scale, as well as whether they believed this behavior to be typical for a child. The results revealed considerable inter-individual differences, with about one third showing restrictive moral attitudes. Contrary to our expectations, gender and physical maturity neither affected the perceived morality of the sexual act, nor beliefs about the representativeness of the child's behavior. However, when controlling for confounds, pedophilic men believed that boys were more likely to willingly engage in adult–child sex. Furthermore, participants with stronger liberal attitudes were found to be more likely to defend the sexual act, as were participants with a preferential interest in pre-pubescents. There was no link between attitudes towards adult–child sex and sexual offending, replicating the non-associations reported in previous community surveys.",

Six months after spousal loss, only those men with low or average levels of social support from friends are more likely than women to report interest in remarrying someday. Similar patterns emerge for interest in dating 18 months after loss. Persons who both want and have a romantic relationship report significantly fewer depressive symptoms 18 months after loss, yet this relationship is attributable to their greater socioeconomic resources.",

We found that the age stereotypes of ‘Elderly gay men’ were blurred: ‘Elderly gay men’ were stereotyped less on elderly‐ and more on young‐stereotypical traits than both ‘Elderly heterosexual men’ (Study 1) and ‘Elderly men’ (Studies 2–4). These findings did not occur with any subtype, as was also not the case for ‘Elderly right‐handed men’ (Study 3), but replicate only with atypical subtypes (Study 4). Indeed, the blurring of the age stereotypes for ‘Elderly gay men’ was replicated for an additional atypical subtype, ‘Elderly Atheist men’, and amplified when the atypical subtype involved ‘Elderly men’ in combination with ‘Athlete men’, whose stereotypes implied youthful traits (Study 4). The results informed cognitive models of multiple category stereotyping.",

Para ello se analizan los encuentros vinculares heterosexuales, para luego proponer algunas contribuciones que faciliten la igualdad sustantiva y la responsabilidad afectivo/sexual. El consentimiento sexual supone un acuerdo para participar en una actividad sexual compartida. Para que sea consensuado, ambas personas deben estar de acuerdo en tener relaciones sexuales, todas y cada una de las veces que surja esa posibilidad. En el caso de los encuentros heterosexuales, a nivel simbólico, social y subjetivo continúa presente la tendencia de que las mujeres sean las encargadas de establecer límites a los activos intentos masculinos que buscan satisfacer sus deseos sexuales. Por lo tanto, las consecuencias de resistir o conceder dicho acto recae solo sobre las mujeres: proteger o exponer el cuerpo, velar o develar el deseo, aceptar el encuentro; o bien, no tener la posibilidad de negarse. Todo ello aparece ligado a la “disposición femenina” que se juega en el ámbito de lo íntimo, con el argumento sostenido en la idea de supuestas relaciones consensuadas. En este orden de cosas, el consentimiento sexual necesita ser repensado en articulación con los intersticios del poder y de los prejuicios sociales vigentes, presentes en las interacciones vinculares heteronormadas.",

      "abstract": "Examination of the gonads of 2,987 specimens of Teredo navalis of all ages, at all seasons, and during three successive years supplements the conclusions previously published regarding the sequence of sexual phases in this species. The functional phase, if any, in which any given individual is found will, in general, depend upon: a, age; b, size; c, season; d, season when hatched; e, its particular combination of genetic factors.Each normal individual shows a tendency toward an alternating series of functional sexual phases. There is good evidence that at least four of these phases may sometimes be completed in a lifetime of less than two years, although the average individual experiences hardly more than one or two.Among the variable sequences of phases which different individuals may experience the following may be considered typical:1. Male … female.2. Male … female … male … female.3. Male … female … male.4. Male … female … female.5. Male (\"true male\") … male … female.6. Male (\"true male\") … male.7. Female (exceptional) … male … female.Because the population consists of a vastly greater number of individuals of the younger ages than of the older age groups, it is obvious that death by suffocation, starvation, parasitization or some other cause will usually terminate the individual's existence before the normal cycle is completed.Protandric bisexuality is generally characteristic of the early sexual phases, with a tendency toward alternating unisexuality in later life. Of the latter, the female phase is usually of longer duration than the alternate male phase.The proportion of individuals in each sexual phase in the general population or in selected groups will obviously be correlated with a combination of the conditions mentioned above, but limited by associated environmental influences. The total population of teredos. living in a particular block of wood may thus consist of upwards of 90 per cent of individuals in either functional sexual phase or of about equal percentages of each, according to the age group or groups represented at the time of the examination.Attention has been previously (Coe, 1934a) called to the similarity of the sexual rhythm in Teredo to that of the larviparous oysters, \"although the usually shorter life of the former limits the number of the alternating sexual phases.\" There is some resemblance also to the sexual changes in the oviparous oysters (Coe, 1934b) and in the hard-shell clam Venus (Loosanoff, 1936), which are predominantly, but not exclusively, protandric, with a later change to the seasonally unisexual condition of the older individuals, in which there is an approximate equality in the sex ratio.",

Gender differences are found in practical-imaginative styles. Compared to males, relatively more females prefer a practical style. Age differences are found on extroversion-introversion and thinking-feeling styles. While Samoan children in all age groups generally prefer an extroverted style, an increased preference for an introverted style is seen at each older age. On the other hand, younger children display a somewhat balanced preference for thinking and feeling styles while older children generally prefer a thinking style. Cross-national differences are found in extroversion-introversion, practical-imaginative, and organized-flexible styles.

Controlling for other characteristics, both theories of discrimination predict that in early rounds excess votes will be made against groups targeted for discrimination. In later rounds, however, taste‐based models predict continued excess votes, whereas statistical discrimination predicts fewer votes against the target group. Although players are voting strategically, evidence of discrimination is limited. There is little in the data to suggest discrimination against women and blacks. I find some patterns consistent with information‐based discrimination toward Hispanics (other players perceive them as having low ability) and taste‐based discrimination against older players (other players treat them with animus).",

Although a significant literature describes positive outcomes for actual gay and lesbian parenting, research has not specifically examined the effect of these attitudes on heterosexuals' evaluations of parenting skills, competency in parenting situations, or attributions about behavior in children of lesbian and gay parents. Two hundred twenty participants responded to a series of vignettes describing a restaurant scene in which two parents respond to their child's public tantrum. Sexual orientation and gender of the active parent in the heterosexual condition were varied. Heterosexism, evaluation of parenting skills, and attributions for child's behavior were assessed. Unexpectedly, gay male parenting skills were rated most positively, and heterosexual parenting skills (where a woman was the active parent) most negatively. Both traditional and modern heterosexism predicted negative evaluations in the same-sex parenting conditions with modern heterosexism (denial of continued discrimination) explaining a larger portion of the variance in several outcome measures. It is suggested that differences in gender role expectations for men and women encourage excessive praise for men who interact with children and condemnation of women who disappoint unrealistic expectations.",

The adolescent is a marginal person who is no longer accorded the privileged status of the child, nor as yet many of the rights and responsibilities of the adult. The relatively low degree of institutionalization of adolescence as a status position and the marginal position of the adolescent in terms of role expectations in American society are reflected in the fact that most of the norms governing adolescent behavior do not have adolescent behavior patterns as their reference point. Rather, the norms and expectations governing adolescent behavior have either child or adult behavior patterns as their reference point. The exhortations of parents and other adults admonish the adolescent either to like a grown-up or to quit behaving like a child.. They rarely encourage him to like an adolescent. There are, then, no highly institutionalized expectations of how one is to behave like an adolescent, in the sense that achievement of these status expectations is a positive transitional link with the adult status.",

The complexity of the sexual life of some patients is not primarily caused by the \"acting-out\" generated by their instinctive, pregenital fixations or polymorphous and/or perverse fixations, but by an attempt of compensation of the underlying mental void. Patients with mental void have a tendency to pass from the signal of anxiety to dread. This is an indication of their ego fragility, particularly the narcissistic fragility of the organizing identifications of their psychic apparatus. Very often, sexual experiences carried out in order to shape an exaggerated masculine identity, followed by polymorphous sexual behaviour of different kinds, are attempts at evolution, an evolution that has probably been somehow interrupted during their lives.",

      "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to investigate potential ethnicity-related variation in men’s relationship status, sexual promiscuity, and testosterone levels. Data from two ethnically diverse subject populations were used. The first dataset included 302 male graduate students (age range: 23–36 years; M 28); the second dataset consisted of 77 male undergraduate and graduate students (age range: 18 –38 years; M 23). For both, we collected information on ethnicity (European American, African American, Hispanic, or Asian American), relationship status (single, in a short-term or long-term relationship, or married), and sexual promiscuity (number of lifetime sexual partners, number of one-night stands, extrapair sexual activity), in addition to measuring salivary testosterone concentrations. In both datasets testosterone levels were significantly higher in single men than in men in relationships but this difference was reversed in men of Asian American ethnicity. Asian American men had the lowest number of sexual partners, one-night stands, and extrapair sexual activity across ethnic groups. Moreover, among Asian Americans, men in relationships had a higher average number of sexual partners than single men. Our results indicate that to understand the association between relationship status and testosterone levels in men, ethnicity-related variation in sexual activity in single men and men in relationships must be taken into consideration.",

      "abstract": "A number of surveys have by now provided information about the relative risk of persons from various backgrounds to experience sexual abuse during childhood. Interestingly, they are fairly uniform in failing to find differences in rates according to social class or race. However, several other factors have emerged from community studies as being consistently associated with higher risk for abuse: (a) when a child lives without one of the biological parents; (b) when the mother is unavailable to the child either as a result of employment outside the home or disability and illness; (c) when the child reports that the parents' marriage is unhappy or conflictual; (d) when the child reports having a poor relationship with the parents or being subject to extremely punitive discipline or child abuse; (e) when the child reports having a stepfather. The article draws some implications from these findings and makes recommendations for ways to improve subsequent studies of risk factors.",

      "abstract": "El abuso sexual se refiere a cualquier conducta sexual mantenida entre dos personas (al menos, una de ellas, menor), entre las que existe una situacion de desigualdad -ya sea por razones de edad o de podery en la que el menor es utilizado para la estimulacion sexual de la otra persona. Mas que la diferencia de edad -factor, sin duda, fundamental que distorsiona toda posibilidad de relacion libremente consentida-, lo que define el abuso es la asimetria entre los implicados en la relacion y la presencia de coaccion -explicita o implicita(Lopez, 1997; Sosa y Capafons, 1996). No deja por ello de ser significativo que el 20 por ciento del abuso sexual infantil este provocado por otros menores. Las conductas abusivas incluyen un contacto fisico (genital, anal o bucal), o suponen una utilizacion del menor como objeto de estimulacion sexual del agresor (exhibicionismo o voyeurismo), o incluso de terceras personas, como cuando se utiliza a un nino para la produccion de pornografia (Madansky, 1996). . No es facil determinar la incidencia real de este problema en la poblacion porque ocurre habitualmente en un entorno privado -la familiay los menores pueden sentirse impotentes para revelar el abuso (Nogueral, 1997). Segun el informe de Finkelhor, Hotaling, Lewis y Smith (1990) -primera encuesta nacional de Estados Unidos, llevada a cabo en adultos, sobre la historia de abuso sexual-, un 27 por ciento de las mujeres y un 16 por ciento de los hombres reconocian, retrospectivamente, haber sido victimas de abusos sexuales en la infancia. En Espana, la frecuencia de los abusos, al menos en un sentido muy amplio del termino, puede afectar al 20 por ciento de la poblacion (23 por ciento de chicas y 15 por ciento de chicos). Al margen de esta tasa de prevalencia-ya de por si muy alta-, en el 44 por ciento de los casos el abuso no se ha limitado a un acto aislado (Lopez, 1995, 1997).",

      "abstract": "Although casual sex is increasingly socially acceptable, negative stereotypes toward women pursuing casual sex appear to remain pervasive. Specifically, a common trope in media (e.g., television, film) is that such women have low self-esteem. Despite robust work on prejudice against women who engage in casual sex, little empirical work investigates the lay theories individuals hold about such women. Across six experiments with US participants (N = 1,469), we find that both men and women stereotype women (but not men) who have casual sex as having low self-esteem. This stereotype is held explicitly and semi-implicitly, not driven by individual differences in religiosity, conservatism, or sexism, is mediated by inferences that women having casual sex are unsatisfied with their mating strategy, yet persists when these women are explicitly described as choosing to have casual sex. Finally, it appears unfounded; across experiments, these same participants’ sexual behavior is uncorrelated with their own self-esteem.",

      "abstract": "There are few psychometrically valid measures of exposure to social maltreatment that simultaneously assess sexism, racism, and anti-LGBTQ+ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and other nonheteronormative) behavior, despite the commonness of these phenomena. The Social Discrimination and Maltreatment Scale (SDMS) meets this requirement but is, as a result, somewhat lengthy (36 items). This article introduces a short form of the SDMS containing only half the number of items but generally retaining the psychometric qualities of the original measure. The 18-item Social Discrimination and Maltreatment Scale—Short Form (SDMS-SF) consists of six SDMS stem items (e.g., I have been disrespected, People made cruel or demeaning jokes about me) each of which is rated according to how often it had happened “because of my sex,” “because of my race,” and “because of my sexual orientation or gender identity.” In the SDMS online sample ( N = 528), SDMS-SF Sexism, Racism, and Cisheterosexism subscales were validated by confirmatory factor analysis and were internally consistent (α = .91–.95) and highly correlated with the original SDMS subscales ( r = .94 in all cases). All SDMS-SF subscales correlated with self-reported anxiety, depression, and posttraumatic stress (mean r = .29), corresponding to a medium effect size. In all but one instance, related SDMS and SDMS-SF subscales did not differ significantly in the strength of their association with symptomatology. Together, these results suggest that the SDMS-SF is a reliable and valid measure of social discrimination, generally equivalent to the SDMS despite containing only half as many items.",

Analyses indicated that the subjects have abnormally lower self concepts than non-delinquents and that females and the youngest subjects have significantly lower self concepts than their male and older counter-parts. Subjects confined from 13 through 24 months are significantly more critical of themselves indicating a willingness to recognize what they perceive as negative attributes. Age and sex were the only significant predictors of Total Self Concept, and age was also a significant predictor of perceived Behavior. Sex was a significant predictor of Personal and Family Self scores. Scores indicated that most of the subjects held themselves in abnormally low regard as individuals, members of society and as family members. Overall scores further reveal a group who perceive that they are held in low esteem by others, as well.",

Preadolescent boys (n = 251) were shown a video film portraying a male target playing either a masculine game with boys, a feminine game with girls, a neutral game with boys, or a neutral game with girls and were required to make a variety of inferences about him. All 4 groups made similar cognitive stereotypic inferences that varied in accordance with the gender stereotypic nature of the target's behavior. However, for the affective judgments (e.g., liking the target and wanting to engage in activities with him), the feminine males showed a pattern of inferences that was not only different from other sex role orientations, but often the reverse.

For most children these expressions are largely congruent with their experience of being male or female – their gender identity – and in line with the gender assigned at birth. This is in contrast to children who experience gender dysphoria (GD). These children show extreme and enduring forms of gender nonconforming/gender variant behaviours, preferences, and interests because they do not identify with their birthassigned gender. Because of the incongruence between their assigned gender and experienced gender, these children may experience clinically significant distress and are consequently often in need of clinical attention (American Psychiatric Association, 2013).",

Besides the many factors, such as heredity, increased sensory conduction and reception, deficient muscular forces, etc., that influence childbirth, I believe there is a marked difference on the pelvis in the physiologic effect of the exercise performed.

Developmentally appropriate behavior that is common and frequently observed in children includes trying to view another person's genitals or breasts, standing too close to other persons, and touching their own genitals. Sexual behaviors become less common, less frequent, or more covert after five years of age. Sexual behavior problems are defined as developmentally inappropriate or intrusive sexual acts that typically involve coercion or distress. Such behaviors should be evaluated within the context of other emotional and behavior disorders, socialization difficulties, and family dysfunction, including violence, abuse, and neglect. Although many children with sexual behavior problems have a history of sexual abuse, most children who have been sexually abused do not develop sexual behavior problems. Children who have been sexually abused at a younger age, who have been abused by a family member, or whose abuse involved penetration are at greater risk of developing sexual behavior problems. Although age-appropriate behaviors are managed primarily through reassurance and education of the parent about appropriate behavior redirection, sexual behavior problems often require further assessment and may necessitate a referral to child protective services for suspected abuse or neglect.",

As for moral patiency, children picked their own gender, regardless of valence: boys chose boys as victims and beneficiaries, and girls chose girls as victims and beneficiaries.

For both samples, there were significant mean, but no median, gender differences for the nonspecific ideal, replicating what has been found in some previous research. However, when risks were explicitly identified (in the present pragmatic and hedonic ideal conditions), significant mean and median gender differences emerged: Typically, men desired multiple sex partners, whereas women were consistently interested in a single sex partner, regardless of the risks or opportunities involved.",

This project aimed to describe how sexual consent is conceptualized across the adult lifespan, drawing comparisons between young, middle-aged, and older adults. Additionally, we examined variables that may differ by age group and influence sexual consent conceptualization. In a survey, young adults (n= 266), middle-aged adults (n= 236), and older adults (n= 51) were asked to define sexual consent and complete a measure on the appropriateness of giving and receiving consent in different types of sexual relationships. Participants also reported on their exposure to formal sex education and their current sexual relationship status. More than half (57.4%) of participants included basic elements of a simple core definition (agreement in reference to sexual acts), and most (63.3%) expanded beyond a simple definition. Age groups differed significantly on variables expected to influence sexual consent definitions, including exposure to sexual education and sexual consent attitudes. Age group differences were not found when examining the simple core definition, but young adults and middle-aged adults differed significantly in their expansion on the definition. Sexual consent attitudes were also significantly related to the scope of the supplied definition. These findings suggest that sexual consent definitions vary in scope across at least a portion of the lifespan and that the importance placed on sexual consent may be a reasonable intervention target regardless of age differences in sexual experience and education.",

      "abstract": "Various forms of intimate partner violence (IPV) are unfortunately common amongst adults in the United States, and these rates are devastatingly higher for transgender and gender diverse (TGD) individuals than for the general population. However, the TGD population is not monolithic, and is diverse regarding gender, sexual orientation, age, race/ethnicity, urbanicity, and other sociodemographic categories. This study uses data from the 2018 Michigan Trans Health Survey to explore these within group differences regarding sexual, physical, and emotional forms of IPV using chi-square tests of independence and logistic regressions. Chi square tests of independence found homelessness had significant associations across all outcome variables: “ever experienced physical violence from a partner,” “ever experienced forced sex from a partner,” “ever been threatened to be outed by a partner,” and “ever had gender belittled by a partner.” Gender identity and sexual orientation had significant associations with “ever experienced forced sex from a partner,” “ever been threatened to be outed by a partner,” and “ever had gender belittled by a partner.” Urbanicity showed a significant association with “ever being threatened to be outed by a partner.” In the logistic regressions, age indicated significantly higher likelihood of IPV physical IPV with each year of age; experiences of homelessness were significantly related to likelihood for all outcomes variables. Gender and sexual orientation were also significant across the models, with differing levels of likeliness depending on identities. Findings demonstrate a need for TGD inclusive programming, and specifically programs that target TGD persons who are older, report additional genders (meaning, multiple identities and/or identities besides transfeminine, transmasculine, or nonbinary), queer sexual orientations, and who are/have experienced homelessness.

      "title": "Is Risk Taking Used as a Cue in Mate Choice?",
      "abstract": "More frequent risk taking among young men than women has been explained as a sexually selected trait, perhaps advertising male quality. We investigated this hypothesis in three studies. (1) Young men and women rated how attractive they would find it if a potential partner took various specific risks. A domain-specific risk inventory allowed us to distinguish whether risk taking is attractive generally or only in certain domains. Both sexes reported social and recreational risk taking as attractive (the latter not always significantly so), but other domains of risk taking as unattractive (ethics, gambling, and health) or neutral (investment). The sexes differed markedly little. Parallel studies in Germany and the United States yielded very similar results. (2) We asked subjects to predict how attractive the other sex would find it if the subject performed each risky behavior. Both sexes were rather accurate (which could be merely because they assume that the other sex feels as they do) and sex differences in attractive risk taking are not explicable by sex differences either in attraction or in beliefs about what others find attractive. However, our data could explain why unattractive risks are more often taken by men than women (men slightly underestimated the degree of unattractiveness of such risks, whereas U.S. women overestimated it, perhaps because they themselves found such risk taking more unattractive than did U.S. men). (3) Both members of 25 couples reported their likelihood of engaging in specific risky behaviors, their perception of these risks, and how attractive they would have found these behaviors in their partner. One hypothesis was that, for instance, a woman afraid of heights would be particularly impressed by a man oblivious to such risks. Instead we found positive assortment for risk taking, which might be explained by a greater likelihood of encountering people with similar risk attitudes (e.g. members of the same clubs) or a greater compatibility between such mates. Finally, contrary to the assumption that taking a low risk is likely to be less revealing of an individual's quality than taking a high risk, we found a strong negative relationship between the perceived riskiness of a behavior and how attractive it was judged.",

      "title": "Examining Sexual Violence as a Predictor of Sexual Ambivalence",
      "abstract": "Abstract Sexual ambivalence can be defined as an experience of sexual behavior as both wanted and unwanted, to some degree, in a particular sexual situation. Despite ambivalence, individuals often decide to participate in these sexual experiences. There are several related and overlapping reasons as to why people ultimately decide to engage in sexual activity, including a history of engaging in a particular sexual behavior or being intimate with a prior partner. There is also evidence to suggest that experiences of sexual violence are related to sexual ambivalence. The present study explored whether prior experience with both a sexual activity and a partner, as well as sexual violence, predicted sexually ambivalent behaviors. Participants were 932 college students who completed a one-time survey about their sexual experiences. Results demonstrated that women were more likely than men to report experiencing sexual ambivalence, and women experienced more ambivalence before, during, and after a sexual encounter. Men were more likely than women to experience ambivalence during and after a sexual activity. A history of sexual violence victimization was associated with experiencing sexual ambivalence prior to engaging in a sexual behavior. Prior experience with a sexual partner or sexual activity was predictive of ambivalence during a sexual encounter, as well as engaging in a sexual activity despite ambivalence. These findings suggest that there are gender differences in sexual ambivalence, and that sexual violence impacts sexual-decision making. We hope these findings can inform sexual violence prevention and sexual education programs.",

Females choose their mates (or multiple mates) in a mating season, and in the following breeding season males invest their paternal care (or negative care-harassment), based on the likelihood of their paternity. The results show that the preference of females for monogamy or polyandry depends on how the cost increases with paternal care. The possibility of harassment (e.g, infanticide) by males with low probability of paternity may force the females to engage in extrapair copulation. Mate guarding by a dominant male can evolve to be imperfect because paternity sharing solicits paternal care or reduces harassment by subordinate males. Females should attempt to mate with a subordinate male within the constraints posed by the dominant male's guarding.",

      "title": "Evolution of male life histories and age-dependent sexual signals under female choice",
      "abstract": "Sexual selection theory models evolution of sexual signals and preferences using simple life histories. However, life-history models predict that males benefit from increasing sexual investment approaching old age, producing age-dependent sexual traits. Age-dependent traits require time and energy to grow, and will not fully mature before individuals enter mating competition. Early evolutionary stages pose several problems for these traits. Age-dependent traits suffer from strong viability selection and gain little benefit from mate choice when rare. Few males will grow large traits, and they will rarely encounter choosy females. The evolutionary origins of age-dependent traits therefore remain unclear. I used numerical simulations to analyze evolution of preferences, condition (viability) and traits in an age-structured population. Traits in the model depended on age and condition (\"good genes\") in a population with no genetic drift. I asked (1) if age-dependent indicator traits and their preferences can originate depending on the strength of selection and the size of the trait; (2) which mode of development (age-dependent versus age-independent) eventually predominates when both modes occur in the population; and (3) if age-independent traits can invade a population with age-dependent traits. Age-dependent traits evolve under weaker selection and at smaller sizes than age-independent traits. This result held in isolation and when the types co-occur. Evolution of age-independent traits depends only on trait size, whereas evolution of age-dependent traits depends on both strength of selection and growth rate. Invasion of age-independence into populations with established traits followed a similar pattern with age-dependence predominating at small trait sizes. I suggest that reduced adult mortality facilitates sexual selection by favoring the evolution of age-dependent sexual signals under weak selection.",

      "abstract": "Sexual exploitation of children (under 14 years of age) is a common occurrence, although actual numbers are unknown. There are three major forms of sexual abuse: (1) incest, ie, sexual activity between consanguineous family members; (2) sexual assault, such as rape or molestation by adults not related to the child; and (3) habitual sexual exploitation for purposes of financial reward or perverse sexual satisfaction. Brother-sister incest has the highest incidence in the middle and upper socioeconomic levels and is probably the least damaging, psychologically, to sexual adjustment later in life. Father-daughter incest is more common in the lower socioeconomic levels and is thought to produce major disorders in the psychosexual area. Sexual assault of children, if handled supportively and with understanding by the surrounding adults, including parents, physicians, teachers, law enforcement officers, and others, can result in minimal sequelae; however, often the situation is handled with emotional reactions ranging from disgust to hysteria which result in the child's being victimized and traumatized unnecessarily. These latter situations lead to sexual acting-out in adolescence, promiscuity, perversions, or frigidity in adult sexual life. Teachers, physicians, and child welfare workers need to be attuned to the possibility to sexual abuse in the children they serve.",

      "abstract": "Considerable research has established that particular partner characteristics have a negative impact upon marital quality and that marital distress often results from the failure of partners to resolve personality differences. This study assessed personality and interpersonal differences related to marital distress within 92 clinical couples. Husbands in marriages of 6 years or less reflected distant, apathetic, hostile, and domineering features, while their wives reflected a greater need for attention and stimulation. Husbands in marriages of 7 years or more reflected greater distant and apathetic, self-focused, hostile, and domineering characteristics, while their wives reported greater passive dependency. The shorter married wives’ and husbands’ marital distress was most strongly associated with their own avoidant and self-defeating characteristics. The longer married wives’ marital distress was associated with their husbands’ dominant and self-involved characteristics. The longer married husbands’ marital distress was most strongly associated with their own dominant and self-centered characteristics, but with none of their wives’ characteristics. Partner ratings supported interpersonal theory expectations that distressed couples would reflect noncomplementary interaction patterns. Marital therapists may increase the likelihood of remediating/preventing marital distress by helping couples to recognize that their own and their partner’s personality traits, and interpersonal styles can be linked to marital distress, that these links seemingly differ for males and females, and that these links are likely to change over the marital life cycle.",

      "abstract": "Abstract and Summary In diverse taxa members of one sex mimic members of the other. Some authors also hypothesize that younger or less fit individuals mimic older or fitter individuals of the same sex. The implications of sexual and age class mimicry for sexual selection theory have been underappreciated. Where deception involving the sex or age class of conspecific signallers arises, selection will act against (1) signal receivers who fail to distinguish between “honest” and “deceptive” signallers and (2) “honest” signallers who fail to become noticeably different from “deceptive” signallers. We refer to the tendency of “honest” signallers to become noticeably different from “deceptive” signallers as deception divergence . Deception divergence may be the mechanism whereby conspicuous epigamic features evolve to extravagance in the runaway process hypothesized by F isher (1958). Zusammenfassung Für zahlreiche Tierarten wird vermutet, daß Individuen eines Geschlechtes solche des anderen nachahmen, sowie daß schwächere Individuen ältere oder stärkere Artgenossen desselben Geschlechtes imitieren. Die Folgen derartiger heterosexueller oder altersbezogener Mimikry für die Theorie sexueller Selektion sind bislang unterschätzt worden. Wann immer Geschlecht oder Altersklasse eine wesentliche Rolle bei der Signalfälschung spielen, wird sowohl der Signalempfänger benachteiligt, der nicht imstande ist, zwischen „ehrlichen” und ”betrügerischen„ Sendern zu unterscheiden, wie auch der „ehrliche” Sender, der sich nicht deutlich genug von „betrügerischen” abheben kann. Die Tendenz „betrügerischer” Sender, sich „ehrlichen” Sendern anzugleichen, wie auch die Tendenz „ehrlicher” Sender, sich von „betrügerischen” Sendern deutlich wahrnehmbar zu unterscheiden, wird im folgenden als „Täuschungsdivergenz” bezeichnet. Eine Täuschungsdivergenz‐Hypothese, angewandt auf Konflikte zwischen gleichgeschlechtigen Artgenossen, könnte einen Mechanismus liefern, demzufolge gut sichtbare epigame Merkmale in einem unaufhaltsam fortlaufenden Prozeß bis zur Extravaganz entwickelt werden, wie F isher (1958) ihn beschrieben hat.",

      "abstract": "Curiosity is a psychological response to uncertainty that facilitates learning and other benefits, but little is known about how highly curious people interpret and process uncertainty differently from their less curious counterparts. We investigated the relationship between curiosity (both interest- and deprivation-type) and a variety of attitudes towards uncertainty. An adult sample from the United Kingdom (N = 398) completed an online questionnaire measuring dispositional interest- and deprivation-type curiosity, positive attitudes towards uncertainty, intolerance of uncertainty, and tendencies to focus on potential positive or negative outcomes. A higher score on interest was associated with finding uncertainty more enjoyable and focusing on positive possibilities. A higher score on deprivation was associated with being more intolerant of uncertainty and focusing on negative possibilities. The connections between curiosity and attitudes towards uncertainty differ according to the type of curiosity experienced. Interest may reinforce learning by promoting a fascination with the unknown and a focus on positive discoveries. Deprivation may reinforce learning by promoting discomfort with the unknown and a focus on negative discoveries that one wishes to be reassured of or prepared for.",

Secondary sex differences are those not directly related to sexual structures or organs, mating, and/or parental investment (which are primary sex differences). Secondary sex differences include body size/mass, shape, color, and behavior, and are highly variable. In primates, sexual dimorphism is common in anthropoids (monkeys, apes, and humans) and less so in prosimians (lemurs, lorises, galagos, and tarsiers).",

      "abstract": "Sex workers' noncommercial intimate partnerships are marginalized on two counts - they are non-monogamous and at least one partner is in sex work, an occupation with much stigma. We asked a heterogeneous sample of Canadian sex workers (N = 218) about their decisions to reveal/not reveal their sex work to intimate partners, and the resulting challenges and benefits. A minority (58/183) of participants who had been or were currently involved in an intimate relationship kept their work secret from at least one partner or disclosed limited information, shielding them from stigma but resulting in a burden of secrecy. The majority of participants (151/183) who had been/were currently involved in an intimate relationship chose to disclose their sex work to at least one partner, which for most, had one or more negative consequences. A small group of participants related that disclosure resulted in acceptance, support, and understanding from their intimate partner. Some participants avoided the disclosure dilemma by forming intimate relationships from social connections where sex work status was already known. These relationships were generally supportive. We conclude that intimate relationships provide positive experiences for many people who sell sexual services and that these relationships could be stronger if societal stigma was reduced.",

      "abstract": "There is an increasing concern on early initiation of sexual activity among adolescents, increasing sexually transmitted infections, and teenage pregnancy in Uganda. Adolescents perceptions of these sexual behaviors might be the result of discussing sexual and reproductive health issues with key influencing audiences. This study qualitatively explored the effect of sexuality discussions with key influencing audiences by means of in-depth interviews and focus group discussions with adolescents (N=83). Findings indicate that adolescence stage comes with changes of intense sexual desires, often presumed difficult to control thus leading adolescents to engage in sexual activities. Adolescents indicated that they were aware of the sexual behaviors such as condom use, contraception use, and multiple concurrent partnerships, but intertwined with persistent myths and misconceptions. Although discussing sexuality issues with someone was found to be instrumental, adolescent highlighted challenges that hinder discussion with key influencers. Challenges include, parents lack of time to talk to their children; some religious affiliations perceived to discourage use of contraception; limited skills of community health workers to address adolescent information needs; meetings held in groups not followed up with age-focused or one-on-one discussions; negative health workers’ attitudes and use of technical language; and peer pressure. These findings suggest the need to provide adequate and updated information to clear any misconceptions and strengthening of key influencers’ communication skills to gain confidence in addressing adolescent sexual and reproductive health needs.",

A convenience sample that included graduate and undergraduate students (N = 176; mean age = 37) completed a five-factor measure of personality as well as measures of spirituality, religiosity, shame, guilt, and sexual attitudes and experiences. Spirituality was negatively correlated with sexual permissiveness, and engaging in high risk sex. The moral emotion of shame increased when people had multiple sex partners within the past three months while those more spiritual or connected to God were less likely to have had sex after use of alcohol and/or drugs. Also, the more often someone attended religious services the less likely they were to have had multiple partners within the past three months. A sense of alienation from God predicted shame and guilt, but shame and guilt themselves did not predict sexual practices. These findings suggest that sexual attitudes and experiences are related to both spirituality and religious practices independently of personality, whereas they have no relationship to shame and guilt.",

      "abstract": "Homosexually active men and women are no more immune than anyone else from various types of sexual dysfunction and underlying psychopathology. Intimacy fears and conflicts, ignorance, alcohol and drug dependence and relationship issues exemplify the type of issues influencing dysfunction regardless of sexual orientation, although membership of a stigmatized minority sexuality may exacerbate causes of sexual dysfunction. The effects of discordant lifestyle and identity, homosexual identity formation, dysphoria and internalized homophobia on sexual functioning are three examples of these factors of specific relevance to being homosexual in this culture. The effects of AIDS, difficulties arising from the mechanics of safer sex and the psychosexual effects of oppression on healthy sexual functioning all indicate how factors important to (but not caused by) minority sexuality status may influence sexuality functioning. The importance of neither perceiving homosexuality solely in terms of pathology on the one hand, nor refusing to recognize unhealthy sexual functioning on the other, is emphasized throughout. Models of sexuality must be inclusive, positive and communicated to the client if future sexual dysfunction is to be limited. Finally, the role of the therapist in community development, as well as individual intervention, is addressed. Primary health care interventions are required not only to address the specific issues affecting homosexual men and women, but also to promote a more positive approach to sexuality for all.",

      "abstract": "Sex offenses to children or young adolescents have become a growing public concern. Chemical castration is currently considered as the best available societal response to child sex abuse. It abolishes testosterone secretion, its effects are reversible and side effects are minor. It has been argued that offering convicted sex offenders with the possibility to be treated may be in contradiction with the bioethics principle of autonomy because the person has really no other choice -- the alternative is usually a lengthy confinement sentence. In view of this controversy, we explored lay people’s and physicians’ views regarding the acceptability of chemical castration. Fifty participants (among them five physicians) judged the acceptability of castration in each of 36 scenarios consisting of all combinations of four factors: aggressor’s age (21 vs. 41-year old); (b) victim(s)’ age (5, 8, or 14-year old); (c) aggressor’s psychiatric status (no psychiatric antecedents, suffers from sexual deviation, or recidivist); and (d) family’s attitude (hostile to any kind of castration vs. approve castration). Participants’ ratings of acceptability were, on the average, very high, and 68% of participants considered that chemical castration was fully justified in all the cases that were shown. A small minority (8%) considered that first time offenders of young adolescents, without psychiatric antecedents, should not be chemically castrated. Another minority position (24%) expressed doubts regarding chemical castration of first time offenders without antecedents but they never strongly opposed it. Implications for bioethics are discussed.",

      "abstract": "Many older adults continue to engage in sexual behavior, most often in the context of long-term marriages. Prior studies have tended to examine older adults’ sexual behavior, desires and motivations separately. Thus, there remain considerable gaps in our understanding of the multifaceted-nature of older couples’ sexual expression. Using dyadic latent class analysis and data on 953 heterosexual couples in long-term marriages from Wave 2 of the National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project (NSHAP), we describe configurations of couples’ sexual expression. Four latent classes were identified. Within each latent class, couples were largely in agreement about their sexual behaviors, but husbands consistently expressed greater desire and motivation than their wives. In the highest engagement class, couples reported more frequent and wide-ranging activities (vaginal sex, oral sex, intimate touching), more frequent thinking about sex, greater satisfaction with their amount of sexual activity, and placed more importance on sex as part of their lives. In the lowest engagement class, both spouses indicated no sexual activity in the past year, but neither spouse was content with this situation even as both agreed sex was not an important part of life. Demographic, relational, and health factors were associated with membership in different classes. Health factors—especially sexual difficulties—were most predictive, with husbands’ health more associated with latent class membership than wives’ health. Given the complex and multifaceted nature of sexual expression among older married couples, geriatricians and other health practitioners should provide care that recognizes a wider array of activities and the potential for unmet need. Sexual expression is an important component of older adults’ health and well-being.",

The children had an average, or above-average IQ and none of them had any experience of sexual abuse. It was found that young children have a very limited knowledge of sexuality. They only possess some basic knowledge of genital differences, gender identity, sexual body parts and (non-sexual) functions of the genitals. Knowledge of pregnancy and birth, reproduction and adult sexual behaviour was found to be very limited and decreased in the order presented here. Non-sexually abused children appear to interpret situations that show physical intimacy between adults and children in terms of their own experiences. None of the children talked about sexual activities. Older children generally knew more than younger ones. No significant differences in knowledge between boys and girls were found.

The present studies (3.5-6.9 years; N = 420) found that children begin to use gender and race as cues to status in early childhood, but that gender and race related to different status dimensions and had different consequences for inter-group attitudes. Children expected boys to hold higher status as defined by access to resources and decision-making power (e.g., having more toys and choosing what other people play with) but did not expect boys to have more wealth overall. Gender-related status beliefs did not relate to gender-related social preferences; instead, children preferred members of their own gender, regardless of their status beliefs. In contrast, children expected White people to be wealthier than Black people, and among some populations of children, the belief that White people were higher status (as defined by access to resources and decision-making power) weakly related to pro-White bias. Children’s status-expectations about others were unrelated to beliefs about their own status, suggesting children more readily apply category-based status beliefs to others than to themselves.",

Participants were more likely to disclose to mothers than fathers, usually around age 19 years and in a face-to-face encounter. Mothers were told before fathers, largely because mothers asked or because youth wanted to share their life with them; fathers were told by someone other than their child or by the youth because it was time. The reason participants did not disclose to mothers was because it was not the right developmental time; the reason they did not disclose to fathers was because they were not close to them. Sons, more than daughters, feared the negative reactions of parents, who generally reacted in the same manner--supportive or slightly negative. Relationships with parents since disclosure generally had not changed or had improved. Sex of parent mattered more than sex of child on most domains.",

      "abstract": "Males represent only 10 percent of eating disorder cases. This gender discrepancy is among the most extreme in psychiatry and medicine. Determining what differences in etiology and mechanism best explain the discrepancy presents an intellectual challenge. Beginning at about the third grade, boys and girls diverge in social development. Boys show significantly less desire to lose weight, express dissatisfaction with the upper rather than the lower body, and use dieting to achieve specific external goals rather than as a cultural norm. Males reach a significantly higher body mass index (BMI) than females do before they beginning dieting. (27.2 versus 24.3, p < .01). While overall treatment principles are similar, males in treatment require attainment of a different hormonal milieu (testosterone), attention to past and future sexual role, amelioration of perception of stigma, and preparation for return to male social roles. Males and females suffer comparable degrees of osteopenia and brain shrinkage during anorexia nervosa. The effectiveness of antidepressants in males with eating disorders (compared with that in females) has not been well studied. Male gender is not an adverse factor in short-term or long-term treatment outcome. Understanding the lower frequency of these illnesses in males may lead to more effective means of protecting girls from eating disorders and from the culturally induced distress about normal body size and shape that burdens adolescent development and adult life.",

During puberty, which starts the process of adolescence, adolescents are faced with the fact they have not chosen their body which sends them back to the experience of passivity of childhood. It arouses in the most vulnerable adolescents what remains of expectations or affective dependence regarding their family circle, and thus they are confronted with that basic human paradox, i.e. to be oneself one has to accept to receive and to feed upon others and at the same time to be different from them. Such a fear of being dependent on others may lead adolescents to deprive themselves of what they expect to receive from others. Sexuality and the body, through the emotions they summon, are particularly subject to aggressive or rejection behaviours which characterize that age.",

      "abstract": "The initiation frequency and termination of breast-feeding are determined by cultural tradition. One of the most fundamental underlying differences among cultures affecting breast-feeding is the degree of mother-infant body contact. The physical distance may be seen as a reflection of the social distance sanctioned by their culture. A study of 60 societies found that in high body contact cultures the infant is almost continuously carried out by the mother in the early months; little or no clothing separates the mother and infant; and infants sleep with their mothers at night. Low body contact cultures are characterized by separation of the infant from the mother at birth; swaddling or elaborate clothing; sleeping in a cradle or crib not with mother. Warmer climates are conducive to higher body contact. The means of food-getting will affect the infants diet and time of weaning. cultures with domesticated animals may wean a child to cow or goat milk sooner than cultures where hunting of nuts and berries provides hard to digest food. In close body-contact societies breast-feeding is frequent on demand unsupplemented for the first 6-12 months and lasts from 2-6 years. Nursing frequency is twice an hour or more. Modern societies require strict clothing on the women and swaddling on the child. Nursing frequency is less. Those societies with the highest degree of body contact also show the longest mean duration of lactational amenorrhea.",

      "abstract": "Abstract This study investigates the sexual self‐efficacy and sexual self‐esteem of males and females and the relation between sexual risk‐taking and these self‐perceptions. Sexually active 18‐year‐olds were administered measures of sexual self‐efficacy and sexual self‐esteem and were asked about their sexual behaviour. Males had higher levels of self‐esteem and were more confident than females of their ability to assert their sexual needs, but less confident that they could say no to sexual demands. For a substantial minority there were some difficulties in dealing with condoms. Competence in the sexual domain accounted for a significant but small amount of variance in sexual risk‐taking. The predictors of sexual risk‐taking were the same for both sexes but differed according to type of partner. Confidence in the ability to say no was the sole predictor of safer sexual behaviour with a casual sex partner. In addition to this factor, lower levels of risk with a regular partner were predicted by these respondents' lower confidence in the ability to assert their sexual needs, together with lower levels of their own sexual self‐worth. There is need for adolescents to achieve a sense of mastery and self‐worth in the sexual domain, as well as an understanding of the nature of ‘regular’ relationships.",

An instrument that contained items relating to eight aspects of sexuality (sexual feelings, sex education, masturbation, personal relationships, sexual intercourse, sterilisation, marriage, and parenthood) was developed and found to have good internal consistency and test‐retest reliability. Age was associated with attitudes, with those aged 60 and above holding more conservative attitudes. Parents and staff differed in their attitudes, with parents holding more conservative attitudes. This difference was the product of age differences between the groups; nevertheless it may produce some confusion for adults with intellectual disability unless it is addressed appropriately. Both parent and staff groups were less positive about parenthood than about other aspects of sexuality, however the community group did not differ in their views when attitudes towards parenthood were compared with the remaining items of the scale.",

      "title": "Gendering innocence: An empirical inquiry into the lived experience of gender incongruence in childhood",
      "abstract": "Abstract Gender diversity in childhood has become an issue of significant public debate in Britain. Growing concerns have amassed around the exposure of children and adolescents to new forms of gendered knowledge and expression, arousing discourses of childhood ‘vulnerability’ and ‘innocence’. These ideas draw on a specific framework for understanding ‘childhood’, in which children are depicted as passive, dependent and in need of protection, as they follow a universal, predetermined developmental pathway. Among other effects, this has resulted in a dearth of empirical research that has explored gender diversity as a developmental experience in childhood. This article draws on evidence from interviews with 40 gender and sex variant young people and 30 caregivers of transgender children. Participants' accounts illustrate the deep psychic investment in embodied gender incongruence that young people may manifest from the earliest years of childhood. They highlight the profound distress sometimes experienced by children denied external recognition of their internal (gendered) selves and required to conform to extraneous expectations informed by essentialist understandings of biological sex. Far from ‘innocent’ of gender (difference), children can be deeply and actively involved in creating and adopting gendered subject positions, sometimes generating unanticipated forms of diversity.",

This includes inappropriate touching (clothed or unclothed), penetration using an object, forcing sexual activity between children, or asking a child to view, to read, or to pose for pornographic materials. l Most children being evaluated for sexual abuse will not have significant physical findings on examination. However, a thorough physical and genital exam is necessary. A practitioner with expertise and specialized skills should do these examinations with children and adolescents. Many parents and caregivers do not realize that the pediatric genital exam is very different from that performed on adults. In fact, only in rare cases will the experienced examiner perform an internal exam or use a speculum.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Studies on how physical gender schemas develop in children have traditionally utilized forced-choice and close-ended tasks, finding that the ability to make gender-related distinctions develops in the first years of a child’s life. To reduce demand characteristics that reinforce gender binaries in children’s models of gender, we relied on open-ended discourse analysis to study children’s physical gender schemas. We focused on whether children’s ability to ask questions that distinguish gender groups was greater in older than younger children. Participants were 44 3–4-year-olds, 35 5–6-year-olds, and 23 7–8-year-old children in the U.K. who were led through a guessing game to elicit gender-related beliefs and compare their beliefs about gender to their beliefs about other entities such as living things. When asking questions to distinguish gender binary groups, older children judging gendered individuals were more likely to ask questions that stereotypically distinguished the gender groups than younger children. Older children were also more likely to focus on individuals’ biological properties, clothing, and hair length than were younger children. Thus, the development of a child’s understanding of physical gender schemas gender is discrete, developing gradually at least until the age of 8.",

      "abstract": "The individual contemplating research on play faces a classic approachavoidance conflict. Few areas in biological and social sciences have witnessed a more spectacular growth in past 15 years than play. Play unites and cuts across disciplines leading very directly to questions relating to species adaptation and developmental change. Yet play is also a minefield for unwary, harboring a huge array of conflicting definitions, theories, and perspectives. The essence of play is paradox. This paradox both invites inquiry and repulses scientific systematization. Perhaps most fundamental paradox inherent in play is that its widespread occurrence at higher phylogenetic levels and its large role in behavior of humans suggests its adaptive significance, while playing appears to be purposeless. Or worse, Fagen suggests that the net immediate effect of play on fitness is therefore likely to be negative in most cases (37, p. 397). The importance of play in quantitative terms is overshadowed by its quality. It is residual in sense that it is often recognized and defined by contrast with other behaviors (e.g. play-fighting) and in sense that individuals appear to play only after other, presumably more important, motives (hunger, sex, shelter) have been satisfied. The third and last paradox to be presented does not exhaust list; two most widely accepted theories of play appear to be diametrically opposed. Both have a respectable history.

Perceived aetiology of erectile difficulty was also investigated. Twenty-three per cent of the sample were currently experiencing sexual problems, with ejaculatory difficulty approximately three times as prevalent as erectile difficulty. Nearly one-quarter had experienced erection difficulties at some time and, of these, 68 per cent had remitted without formal treatment. Most frequently cited 'causes' of erectile difficulty were 'psychological' rather than 'physical', 'practical' or specifically 'sexual,' with relationship factors including communication between partners being perceived as particularly important. The presence of erectile and/or ejaculatory difficulty was related to sexual dissatisfaction but not to ratings of relationship happiness. Men having sexual relationships outside their permanent relationship found their partner less sexually attractive and rated themselves as less happy than those men not having affairs but the two groups did not differ in terms of presence of sexual difficulty or sexual dissatisfaction. The limitations of a sample biased towards younger, more educated men, are discussed.",

Yet we are each simultaneously members of many social categories (including our race and gender). Among adults, racial and gender biases intersect: negative racial biases are expressed more strongly against males than females. Here, we consider the developmental origin of bias at the intersection of race and gender. Relying on both implicit and explicit measures, we assessed 4-year-old children's responses to target images of children who varied systematically in both race (Black and White) and gender (male and female). Children revealed a strong and consistent pro-White bias. This racial bias was expressed more strongly for males than females: children's responses to Black boys were less positive than to Black girls, White boys or White girls. This outcome, which constitutes the earliest evidence of bias at the intersection of race and gender, underscores the importance of addressing bias in the first years of life.",

      "abstract": "Drawing on the first national survey experiment of its kind ( n = 3,922), the authors examine Americans’ perceptions of transgender people’s sex and the factors that underlie these perceptions. The authors randomly assigned respondents to a vignette condition describing a transgender person whose self-identified gender (i.e., identifies as a man or a woman), age (i.e., adult or teenager), and gender conformity in physical appearance (i.e., conforming, nonconforming, ambiguous, or unspecified) had been experimentally manipulated. Then, respondents were asked how they would personally classify that person’s sex. The findings suggest that Americans are more likely to perceive a transgender person’s sex as consistent with their sex assigned at birth than with their gender identity. Furthermore, of the experimental manipulations included in the experiment, only the transgender person’s level of gender conformity—not their self-identified gender or age—affects public perceptions of sex. The authors also find distinct cleavages along sociodemographic lines, including politics, sexual orientation, and interpersonal contact with transgender people. Implications for research on sex and gender are discussed.",

      "abstract": "Sex is genetically inherited, but the child s participation in a particular social and cultural group must be built. Previous studies suggest that between 16 and 24 months old the child already has notions of gender identity, being able to categorize objects culturally appropriate to males and females. This research investigates the manifestations of gender identity in children between 21 and 30 months of age under the influence of the company of another child of the same sex or opposite sex. This study proposed to verify two hypotheses. The first is that children are influenced by the sex of their child partner selecting and manipulating objects. The second is that if this mentioned gender reference exists between boys and girls, the manifestation of imitative behavior will be influenced by the gender of the child partner. 12 children between 21 and 30 months old participated in the experiment, six boys and six girls, medium to high social-economic level. Dyads were formed using children of the same gender and children of mixed gender. The procedure consisted of placing the dyads of children in the presence of toys, some of them suitable for boys and other suitable for girls, and watch their choices and imitations. Each child dyad was videotaped during 20 minutes in the presence of objects considered appropriate for males and females. The following were analyzed: objects chosen by children, imitative behavior and time of manipulation of objects. The study showed that childs choices and objects manipulations were influenced by their partners. In dyads exclusively male prevail the manipulation of objects appropriate to the male gender, and in exclusively female dyads prevail the manipulation of objects appropriate to the female gender. However the frequency of choice and manipulation of female objects by male children increased in mixed dyads. With respect to imitation, the boys showed a greater tendency to imitate the girls than girls to imitate the boys%%%%O sexo e herdado geneticamente, mas a participacao da crianca em um determinado grupo social e cultural deve ser construida.

Adult men and women differ with respect to two dimensions; agency and communion. Communion refers to the condition of being part of a larger social or spiritual entity and is manifest in strivings for intimacy, union, and solidarity with that larger unit. Girls often play in dyads or small cliques, spend more time talking to one another and their games are indirectly competitive, involving turn-taking so that the winner is decided by highest score rather than by direct competition. Influence attempts by boys involve giving direct commands whereas girls are more likely to use polite suggestion. This challenging and competitive interpersonal style is manifest in the dominance hierarchies which boys develop.",

      "abstract": "Sport refers to institutionalised competitive games in which the display of physical skill is highly valued. This definition must be flexible, for several reasons. First, it must be capable of describing a range of activities. Recreational sports, like a friendly game of cricket on the beach, usually exhibit a low degree of organisation, informal rules and an emphasis on intrinsic outcomes (e.g. having fun). High-performance sports, like a cricket test, generally manifest a high degree of organisation, very explicit rules and an emphasis on extrinsic outcomes (e.g. winning at any cost). Second, any definition of sport must be culturally relative: Spaniards are passionate about bullfighting, a 'sport' that is illegal in Australia and which many Australians find cruel and disgusting. Third, definitions of sport change over time. For decades, women were formally and informally banned from competing in sports requiring endurance, strength and physical contact. However, increasing numbers of women are participating in marathons, triathlons, rugby, power lifting, body building and the martial arts: pursuits that used to be defined solely as 'men's sport'. Finally, sport usually has been depicted as the antithesis of work, 'free time' or 'leisure time' that people use for recreation and relaxation.",

Descriptions were reduced to three parent factors (Generous, and Masculine) and four child factors (Troubled, Responsible, Selfish, and Warm) . The older generation used the factor, Lost, less often than their children in describing the story parent: Lost was used more often to describe a mother than a father. The story child was described as more troubled, more responsible, less selfish, and less warm by the older generation than by their own children. Although the results were unclear as to whether generational differences were due to age, Parenting, or cohort group differences, the data suggest that individuals over age 35 had a less conventional view of parents and children.

In most animal species, this process is dangerous; vigilance is reduced and vulnerability to predators increased. In mammals, the pattern of hormonal control of the female's sexual behaviour varies across species. Males are more consistent, with testosterone being necessary for both adequate sexual behaviour and male fertility in virtually all species. The variety of socio-sexual structure is also reflected in the level of sexual activity of the male and/or female that characterizes a species. The \"power\" of sexuality tends to be regarded as an aspect of masculinity, with the male, for both social and physical reasons, typically being in a position of dominance. Offering oneself as a sexual partner for payment or other material benefits is a well-established aspect of human sexuality, as well as being evident among primates.",

      "title": "Potential Reproductive Rates and the Operation of Sexual Selection",
      "abstract": "In most animals, members of one sex compete more intensely for mates than members of the other sex, and show a greater development of secondary sexual traits. The relative intensity of mating competition in the two sexes depends on the operational sex ratio (OSR) (the ratio of males that are ready to mate to females that are ready to mate) at the site and times when mating occurs. The extent and direction of biases in the OSR is closely related to the potential rates of reproduction that individual males and females can achieve, although the distribution of the two sexes in space and time, sex differences in development time or life expectancy, and biases in the sex ratio at birth or hatching can also be important. The potential rates of reproduction in the two sexes are, in turn, affected by the proportion of time and energy expended by male and female parents on their progeny, though other factors may constrain reproductive rate in one or both sexes. We outline a simple model of the factors affecting the OSR, where relative parental expenditure by the two sexes and the adult sex ratio are fixed, and a more complex model where the adult sex ratio varies in relation to the reproductive activity of the two sexes. This framework for relating sex differences in mating competition to the OSR, potential reproductive rates, and parental expenditure differs from Triver's concept of the relation between parental investment and mating competition in three ways: first, it identifies the OSR as the immediate factor determining which sex completes most intensely for mates; second, it recognizes that factors other than the future fitness costs of rearing offspring can affect the potential reproductive rate of the two sexes; third, it suggests an empirical measure (potential reproductive rate) that can be estimated in natural populations and used to predict the distribution of mating competition.",

An underestimated common aspect is the high survival rate during dormancy compared to the active period, perhaps due to the reduced risk of predation and competition. We hypothesize that dormancy phenology is influenced by a trade-off between the reproductive benefits of being active and the survival benefits of being dormant. Using a phylogenetic comparative method and more than 20 hibernating mammals, we find that the sex difference in hibernation phenology is explained by sex differences in physiological constraints that may influence this trade-off. Consistent with the trade-off hypothesis, the sex that spends more time in an activity directly associated with reproduction (e.g. testicular maturation, gestation) or indirectly (e.g. recovery from reproductive stress) spends less time in hibernation. Some of the tested parameters such as testes maturation or a late mating period during the active season also influence the sex difference in dormancy phenology among ectotherms (e.g. reptiles, invertebrates). We then gathered evidence that dormancy in non-life-threatening periods that are unfavorable for reproduction may be more widespread than previously thought.",

      "title": "Gender differences in subjective distress to emotional and sexual infidelity: Evolutionary or logical inference explanation?",
      "abstract": "Men and women were asked to imagine a romantic partner being sexually unfaithful and/or emotionally unfaithful. Three hypotheses regarding gender differences in subjective distress to sexual and emotional infidelity, and in the inferences linking the infidelities were tested. The results indicated that more men than women were distressed by imagining a partner enjoying passionate sexual intercourse with another person, and more women than men were distressed by imagining a partner forming a deep emotional attachment to another person. Asking another group of women and men to imagine a partner committing both infidelities at the same time, and then to indicate which component of the combined infidelity was the most distressing, produced the same sexual asymmetries. The prediction that men will infer from a partner's sexual infidelity the co-occurrence of emotional infidelity and that women will infer from a partner's emotional infidelity the co-occurrence of sexual infidelity was not supported. An evolutionary perspective, rather than an alternative analysis emphasizing the different inferences men and women draw from sex and love, provided a satisfactory explanation of the sexual asymmetries in the cues to jealousy.",

      "abstract": "This article examines avatar gender choice within a competitive context in which avatar gender is not equivalent across functions. In data from the game League of Legends (n = 15,392) reflecting >5 million avatar gender choices, women were found to have stronger preferences for avatar gender consistency than men. Furthermore, women tended to choose female avatars at twice the available rate offered by the game, whereas men chose male avatars at a rate approximately the same as the proportion offered. These findings support the argument that women experience more pressure than men do to perform their gender identities overtly, even in competitive games where avatar choice is mostly functional and avatar gender is fixed within specific characters. A practical implication is that by offering a wider range of female avatar and character options, game designers could likely attract greater female audiences without a significant loss of male players.",

      "abstract": "Most first-time mothers experience a decline in both their sexual and relationship satisfaction from prepregnancy, which has negative consequences for the couple and their family. Prior studies have begun to identify risk and protective factors (e.g., empathy) for postpartum sexual and relationship satisfaction. Causal attributions for postpartum sexual concerns may be important because a specific cause can be difficult to pinpoint given the wide range of postpartum sexual problems among first-time parents. In the current study, 120 first-time mothers (3–12 months postpartum) completed validated measures assessing attributions for postpartum sexual concerns, sexual satisfaction, and relationship satisfaction. Attributions were measured on four dimensions: internal/external (i.e., is the sexual concern due to the self or the situation), stable/unstable (i.e., will the cause of the concern occur again in the future), global/specific (i.e., will the cause of the concern affect other situations), and partner responsibility (i.e., is the partner the cause). When new mothers reported more stable and partner attributions for postpartum sexual concerns, they were less sexually satisfied, and when they attributed greater responsibility for sexual concerns to their partners, they were less satisfied with their overall relationship. These associations remained significant after controlling for potential challenges that may also impact sexual and relationship satisfaction during this period (i.e., breastfeeding, sexual frequency, depressive symptoms, fatigue, sexual functioning). As postpartum sexual concerns are common, attributions for these changes may be a valuable target for interventions aimed at strengthening the intimate relationships of women making the transition to parenthood.",

Der Artikel diskutiert die Frage nach übereinstimmenden Persönlichkeitseigenschaften Betroffener und fragt nach Motiven. Anhand von Aussagen von 9 Personen werden Beispiele für auslösende Erfahrungen zitiert. Im Gegensatz zu anderen Kindern waren die Betroffenen oft vom Anblick eines Behinderten fasziniert. Im Artikel wird untersucht, ob das entsprechende Körperteil häufiger Erkrankungen zeigte. Geschildert wird typisches Pretending-Verhalten. Geprüft wird, ob es Parallelen zu körperdysmorphen Erkrankungen (BDD), Fetischismus oder Wahn gibt. Diese fielen gering aus, in der Mehrzahl ist der Wunsch auf ein spezifisches Körperteil fixiert, die Betroffenen sind sich der Absonderlichkeit ihres Begehrens völlig bewusst und hadern mit dem Pro und Kontra. Sexuelle Motive fanden sich bei etwa einem Drittel. Einige der Befragten befanden sich in ärztlicher oder psychologischer Behandlung; dies brachte den Amputationswunsch nicht zum Verschwinden. Bei mehreren der unter BIID-Leidenden wechselte der Amputationswunsch von einer Seite auf die andere. Dieser Befund ist mit der gängigen Theorie einer ZNS-Läsion nicht erklärbar. Diese Menschen haben eher das Ideal eines „perfekten” Körpers, der einen Arm oder ein Bein nicht umfasst. Die meisten bewundern die Schönheit eines Stumpfes und sehen Amputierte als „Helden”, die trotz der Behinderung ihr Leben meistern. BIID ist keine einheitliche Störung, sondern man muss mindestens 3 Achsen trennen: 1. Stärke der neuronalen Dysfunktion, 2. psychische Komponenten (z. B. sekundärer Krankheitsgewinn) und 3. Intensität des sexuellen Interesses.",

These latter organs of infinitely diversified kinds graduate into, and in some cases can hardly be distinguished from, those which are commonly ranked as primary, such as the complex appendages at the apex of the abdomen in male insects. Unless indeed we confine the term “primary” to the reproductive glands, it is scarcely possible to decide, as far as the organs of prehension are concerned, which ought to be called primary and which secondary.",

An online survey was fulfilled by 415 men (142 gay; 273 heterosexual), and participants completed the SDI-2 and the GMSEX. Main findings suggested that gay men scored significantly higher on both solitary sexual desire and attractive person-related dyadic sexual desire subscales, but not on a partner-related dyadic sexual desire subscale, compared to heterosexual men. Despite sexual orientation, partner-related dyadic sexual desire positively predicts sexual satisfaction, whereas solitary and attractive person-related dyadic sexual desire negatively predicts sexual satisfaction in men. Overall, gay men appear to experience higher levels of both attractive person-related dyadic and solitary sexual desire. Also, experiencing sexual desire toward a partner predicts positively, whereas experiencing desire to engage in sexual behavior with oneself and toward an attractive person predict negatively sexual satisfaction in men.",

Data are from a longitudinal study examining drinking and drinking-related problems in a diverse, community-based sample of self-identified SMW (Wave 1: n = 447; Wave 2: n = 384; Wave 3: n = 354). Longitudinal cross-lagged models showed that SMW who report higher levels of identity-behavior or identity-attraction discordance may be at greater risk of concurrent and subsequent hazardous drinking. Results of multigroup models suggest that sexual orientation discordance is a more potent risk factor for risky drinking outcomes among SMW in older adulthood than in younger adulthood. Findings support that discordance between sexual orientation dimensions may contribute to hazardous drinking among SMW and provide evidence that cognitive-behavioral consistency is important for individuals expressing diverse and fluid sexual identities, attraction, and behavior.",

      "abstract": "Sexually active teenage girls tend to wait at least a year before commencing contraceptive use, but half of all adolescent pregnancies occur within 6 months of the onset of sexual activity. To promote contraceptive use among adolescents and prevent unwanted pregnancy, an understanding of adolescent cognitive development is necessary. It has been suggested that many teenagers become pregnant not as a result of a lack of information, but because they lack the cognitive and behavioral skills needed to use the information. The major cognitive task in adolescence--formal operational thinking--involves the ability to analyze situations and hypothesize outcomes. According to Paiget, the capacity to imagine the future and act accordingly begins to emerge at about 11 years of age. However, many teenagers fail to develop this ability to think beyond the present and remain immersed in sexual fantasies when it comes to the area of sexuality. Since they are unable to conceptualize pregnancy and childbearing, they fail to use contraception. Moreover, adolescents commonly believe that they are not at risk of pregnancy the 1st few times they have sexual intercourse and are generally immune from the negative consequences of personal actions. Group discussions and role playing appear to be particularly effective tools to help adolescents speculate on the possible results of engaging in various sexual behaviors and stimulate cognitive development to advance from a concrete to a formal operational level.",

Participants bluffed on average 6% more frequently at poker tables with female-only avatars than at tables with male-only or gender mixed avatars—a highly significant effect in games involving repeated decisions. Nonetheless, participants did not believe the avatar genders affected their decisions. Males bluffed 13% more frequently than females.

One study found that partnered gay men showed stronger preferences for masculine faces than did single gay men, while another study found that partnered gay men showed weaker preferences for masculine faces than did single gay men. We re-examined this issue in a sample of 618 gay men, finding no significant difference between partnered and single gay men’s masculinity preferences.

      "abstract": "One hundred ninety-nine self0defined homosexual males were asked about the ages, at which milestone events occurred in the coming out process (i.e., initial awareness of same-sex attractions, same-sex acts, self-designation as homosexual, initial involvement in a long-tern relationship, self-disclosures to significant others, and acquiring a positive gay identity). Overall findings indicated that an orderly developmental sequence underlies the coming out process; however, not all subjects progressed in a predictable fashion from and awareness of same-sex feelings thought behavior to eventual self-labeling, self-disclosure, and final stabilization of a positive gay identity. A number of individual differences emerged: 18% of the sample labeled themselves ôhomosexualö in the absence of any overt same-sex sexual experience, 22% arrived at homosexual self-definitions while participating in a long-term relationship with another man; 23% adopted homosexual self-definitions only after involvement in such a relationship. Fifteen percent of the respondents indicated that they had not acquired a positive gay identity (i.e., were not glad to be gay). These individuals differed from the remainder of the sample on a number of significant measures reflective of psychological health. Significant difference was also found among three cohort groups with respect to age at occurrence of particular milestone events. Findings form the present investigation was explored in relation to both the theoretical conceptions and available empirical data concerned with homosexual identity formation.",

In a mixed-methods study of adolescents recruited from lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ+) spaces in communities differing in support of sexual and gender diversity, seven patterns emerged: (a) frequent use of nonbinary gender identity labels (23.9% of survey sample), especially in high-support communities; (b) greater comfort among adolescents assigned female at birth (AFAB) with diverse gender expression, which informants attributed to pressures to conform to compulsive masculinity for boys; (c) frequent use of plurisexual (60.8%) and asexual (9.9%) labels, especially among those AFAB, and discussion of online settings as a resource; (d) intersectional patterning of “queer” to describe sexual identity (12.4% of survey sample), with White youth in high-support communities signifying an intellectual/political stance and non-White youth in low-support communities using queer as an umbrella term; (e) resistance to labeling and ambivalence about labels due to intra-community dynamics; (f) labeling challenges among boys of color; and (g) challenges with stigma, sexualization, and violence for transgender and nonbinary youth. Findings highlight how contemporary adolescents engage with and challenge received conceptions of gender and sexuality and how this process is shaped by intersectional identities.",

With verbal communication allowed, there was no difference between males and females interacting in same sex pairs.

It is concerned with providing empirical evidence of resistance in young people's constitution of their sexual subjectivities. The research findings suggest that young people generally draw upon dominant discourses of (hetero)sexuality in their talk about themselves as sexual. However some took up subject positions that involved more resistant conceptions of the sexual self. For some young people this took the form of simultaneously accommodating and resisting subject positions offered by traditional discourses of (hetero)sexuality. It is argued that the potential to take up more resistant subject positions was partly contingent upon young people's location in contexts that offered access to, or opened space for, other ways of constituting themselves as sexual.",

The basic idea of the game is to cleverly insult someone by insulting members of one's family, usually by making derisive comments, preferably of a sexual nature, about one's mother. One ordinarily learns the game during the elementary school years, and often continues to play it on into adulthood. To be good at it, one must possess considerable wit and street verbal facility and also an ability to take it as well as dish it out. The game can involve varying degrees of sophistication, such that one who insults the other by indirect, round-about references ito the other's mother is more likely to win (that is, receive approval of the audience) than someone who merely makes more obvious, direct, unimaginative verbal attacks. The level of sophistication of the game increases as the ridicule of the mother and/or family becomes more indirect and oblique.'",

Erectile and orgastic spectatoring were frequent after stroke and were in the males significantly associated. Retarded ejaculation occurred for no males before but for 15% after the stroke. Marked decreases in different kinds of caressive behaviour were followed by discontentment and up to and about half the subjects felt that sexual partnership responsiveness had deteriorated. After the stroke the commonly occurring reduction in general sexual satisfaction was significantly associated with symptoms of increased sexual dysfunction, disturbed partnership responsiveness and reduced sexual fulfilment. The high prevalence of sexual maladjustment in stroke victims appears mostly to be psychogenic. Important precipitating factors are performance orientation and sexual stigmatism. Moreover, lack of sexual information and counselling may contribute to deterioration of partnership sexuality.",

      "title": "Subjective Ambivalence and the Expression of Anti-Gay Bias",
      "abstract": "Univalent attitudes toward gay people have been widely studied, but no research to date has examined ambivalent (i.e., torn, conflicted) attitudes toward gay people. However, the Justification-Suppression Model (JSM; Crandall & Eshleman, 2003) proposes that ambivalence leads to biased expressions through intrapsychic processes which facilitate biased expression, particularly in contexts presenting strong justifications for expressing prejudice and weak pressures to suppress prejudice. I test these implications in the context of bias toward gay people. In Study 1, the measurement of ambivalence is examined in terms of both subjective ambivalence (i.e., the reported experience of “torn” attitudes) and calculated ambivalence (i.e., mathematical conflict between positive and negative attitude components). I find that higher subjective ambivalence is only associated with more negative attitudes toward gay people (and not positive attitudes toward gay people), and that higher subjective ambivalence predicts less gay rights support even after taking negative and positive attitudes toward gay people into account. Further, higher subjective ambivalence is associated with ideological opposition to gay people and more negative intergroup emotions (e.g., intergroup disgust). These findings suggest it is valuable to examine the unique component of subjective ambivalence separate from univalent negativity. Because calculated ambivalence measures are mathematically dependent upon a univalent negative measure, they cannot be examined separately from negativity. Therefore, subjective ambivalence is the focus of Study 2.\nThe main goals of Study 2 were to determine why and when subjective ambivalence is related to bias. I examined the extent to which the negative relation between subjective ambivalence and opposition to anti-gay bullying can be accounted for by lower intergroup empathy and lower collective guilt, which may facilitate the expression of bias in keeping with the JSM. The relation between subjective ambivalence and anti-gay bullying opposition was examined within four social contexts based on a 2 (high vs. low offensiveness) x 2 (normatively unjustified vs. normatively justified) manipulation. I expected that higher subjective ambivalence would be most strongly related to lower intergroup empathy and collective guilt when there are the strongest justifications for bias expression, and that lower intergroup empathy and collective guilt would lead to less opposition to anti-gay bullying. Higher subjective ambivalence predicted less anti-gay bullying opposition. After accounting for positivity and negativity, the direct effect of subjective ambivalence was no longer significant, yet subjective ambivalence uniquely predicted intergroup empathy, which in turn predicted less anti-gay bullying opposition.\nThese findings provide evidence that subjective ambivalence is largely negative in nature, but also presents evidence for a unique component of subjective ambivalence (separate from univalent attitudes) associated with…",

While it is now widely accepted that sex differences are modulated by the hormonal status of female participants (menstrual cycle, hormonal contraceptive use), the question, whether hormonal status and sex hormones also modulate participants sex role orientation has hardly been addressed previously. The present study assessed sex role orientation and hormonal status as well as sex hormone levels in three samples of participants from two different cultures (Northern American, Middle European). Menstrual cycle phase did not affect participant's masculinity or femininity, but had a significant impact on reference group. While women in their follicular phase (low levels of female sex hormones) determined their masculinity and femininity in reference to men, women in their luteal phase (high levels of female sex hormones) determined their masculinity and femininity in reference to women. Hormonal contraceptive users rated themselves as significantly more feminine and less masculine than naturally cycling women. Furthermore, the impact of biological sex on the factorial structure of sex role orientation as well as the relationship of estrogen to masculinity/femininity was modulated by culture. We conclude that culture and sex hormones interactively affect sex role orientation and hormonal status of participants should be controlled for when assessing masculinity and/or femininity.",

      "title": "Sexuality and contraception.",
      "abstract": "Peoples sexuality and contraceptive needs are examined at 2 important periods of life -- adolescence and middle age. Human sexuality as much psychological as it is physical involves the mind and the body. Contraceptive and sexuality must be linked. When choosing methods of contraception couples must consider the facts and select what appeals to them in view of their needs fertility moral or religious habits and their cultural and individual attitudes towards sexual relationships and male and female roles. Another important principle is that the contraceptive needs of a person will vary throughout his/her life. With physical and psychological maturity occurring progressively earlier and the age of marriage becoming later it is inevitable that an increasing number of adolescents experiment with sex or have sexual relations outside marriage. The use of oral contraceptives (OCs) implies a premeditated intention to be sexually involved which many young women do not have as well as the ability and motivation to take pills regularly. The insertion of an IUD reduces the problem of poor motivation but the complication rates tend to be increased in young nulliparae which requires followup visits. 1 problem with the diaphragm is that nulliparous teenagers frequently find the procedure of fitting a diaphragm rather offputting. It also requires preparation for each act of intercourse. Condoms appear particularly suitable for unmarried teenagers because their use does not require any preparation or long-term planning and they are available from many retail outlets. Postcoital contraception is of use after a single episode of unprotected midcycle intercourse. The sexual potential of the human female is at its greatest between the ages of 35-45. By the time women reach the 40-45 year age group the fertility rate drops by more than 1/2. Barrier methods which are related specifically to each act of intercourse are particularly suitable for the older couple. The IUD requires no daily motivation and gives an overall failure rate of 3-5 pregnancies/100 women years. This is lower among older women. Many older women who have completed their families and want to stop taking the OC seek sterilization as the best method of fertility control.",

Most‐preferred and least‐preferred garments were described using the same words; preferences for suits and dresses were associated with aesthetic appeal and performance risk.

Both sexes judged the aesthetic appeal of styles for the other sex more favorably than that of styles for themselves. Males and females differed in their perceptions of money risk but not in their perceptions of performance risk.

Modeling and Labeling as Integrated Determinants of Children's Sex-typed Imitative Behavior. CHILD DEVELOPMENT, 1979, 50, 364-371. Young children were provided with 2 sources of information about the sex appropriateness of a behavior: the sex of a model displaying it and a sex-appropriateness verbal label. Subsequent imitative and preferential behaviors were then examined. There was no direct effect of a model's sex upon children's imitation or preference, but there was a strong tendency for children to adopt or express a preference for behavior labeled as appropriate to their sex. Children did integrate knowledge of a model's sex with sexappropriateness labels in determining their preferences, particularly when the model engaged in behavior inappropriate for his or her own sex. It is proposed that young children adopt a naive sampling theory which gives lesser weights to the sex of a single model than to labels that may summarize general rules of conduct.",

Further, participants reported the duration of foreplay and intercourse that they felt most men and most women wanted. Ideal length of foreplay did not differ for men and women. However, men reported a significantly longer ideal duration of intercourse than did their partners. The ideal duration of foreplay and intercourse were significantly longer than the actual duration for both genders. The women, but not the men, significantly underestimated their partners' desired duration of foreplay and intercourse. Further, both genders exhibited faulty stereotypes concerning men's but not women's ideal scripts. Men were seen as desiring a significantly shorter duration of foreplay and intercourse than the ideal reported by the men in the study. Both men's and women's perceptions of their partners' ideal duration of foreplay and intercourse were found to be more strongly related to their own sexual stereotypes than to their partners' self-reported sexual desires, suggesting that people rely on sexual stereotypes when estimating their partners' ideal sexual scripts. Men's and women's ideal scripts and men's and women's sexual stereotypes concerning the opposite gender's ideal duration of foreplay were found to uniquely predict the foreplay performance script. For intercourse, men's and women's ideal scripts and men's stereotypes concerning the duration of intercourse that women want uniquely predicated the performance script. We present potential reasons for the discrepancy in individuals' performance and ideal scripts.",

One potential avenue by which it may occur is the misinterpretation of social cues, and such misperception may be mediated by extreme sex role adherence, i.e., hypermasculinity and hyperfemininity. 62 undergraduate students viewed a film of a neutral interaction between a college-aged man and woman. Subsequently, participants indicated which behaviors they remembered the opposite-sex actor performing, offered a prediction as to the outcome of the scenario and what they would do had they been in a similar situation, and then completed either the Hypermasculinity Inventory or the Hyperfemininity Scale. Scores on the former correlated negatively with recall accuracy, and men indicated that they were more likely to date and have sex with the actress than women reported being likely to date or have sex with the actor. Women reported a high perceived likelihood of dating the actor coupled with the expectation that he would have sex with the actress. Likewise, women expected to be sexually coerced by the actor had they been in a similar situation. Social implications of these findings and possible research are discussed.",

Men and women ( N = 78) role played the part of a parent who has placed an advertisement for a full-time babysitter. They received information about a male or female, heterosexual or homosexual applicant (randomly assigned). Although participants preferred to hire (and felt more comfortable leaving their children with) a heterosexual woman than any other type of applicant, they believed that homosexual men and women were as knowledgeable about aspects of child care, e.g., nutrition, first aid, as their heterosexual peers. The least preferred child care worker was a heterosexual man, perhaps because such a target is inconsistent with traditional sex-role expectations.",

In an experimental study (Study 2), women (but not men) who were made to feel that the last sex was further (vs. closer) reported lower desire, but overall, there was limited evidence of causal effects. However, in a 21-day daily experience study (Study 3), within-person lagged models revealed that sex feeling further away was associated with lower sexual satisfaction, but higher desire, tomorrow, and higher desire and satisfaction were associated with sex feeling further away tomorrow.

      "title": "Parental investment and physical aggression among males",
      "abstract": "Past research indicates that men are physically more aggressive than women. Socio-cultural explanations for this sex difference involve variants of learning theory and a tabula rasa psychology. Sexual selection theory provides a more coherent ultimate explanation for sex differences in this and other domains of behaviour. The key processes in sexual selection (preferential mate choice and intra-sexual competition) can be understood in terms parental investment theory. This suggests that the higher-investing sex (usually female) will tend to become a more limiting resource for the lower investing sex. In bi-parentally investing species (e.g. humans), male parental investment tends to be less than the whole but more than a half of the female investment (Trivers, 1972). This is because unlike males the variable portion of the female's investment potentially begins from a higher (non-zero) threshold. This suggests that there may be greater male than female variability in parental investment in bi-parentally investing species, and consequentially greater male variability in sexually selected attributes. In the first study the prediction of greater male variability was tested through meta-analyses of variance ratios for data sets involving sexually selected characteristics (including physical aggression) and those unlikely to have resulted from sexual selection (including anger and self-esteem). Variation was significantly greater for men than women for most of the former data sets including physical aggression), and was similar for men and women for the latter data sets, broadly supporting the predictions. This is consistent with the view that the magnitude of the sex difference in physical aggression may be a function of the proportion of low parentally investing males in the sample. A scale (the pilot Paternal Investment Questionnaire; PIQ) to measure male parental investment was designed and standardised in the second study: the PIQ showed moderately high internal reliability, but results for concurrent and construct validity testing were inconclusive, with some evidence for the latter (as predicted PIQ scores were negatively correlated with a measure of mating effort [infidelity intentions] and positively correlated with jealousy). The main contribution of this thesis is in highlighting the need to view sex differences in terms of the variability in parental investment both between and within the sexes.",

However, the evolutionary origins of athletic behavior, that is, behavior which is associated with participating in and watching athletic contests, are rather obscure, as they do not seem to contribute directly to increasing survival or reproductive success. This article argues that athletic behavior has been shaped in ancestral times jointly by intrasexual selection forces, where men look for potential allies, and intersexual selection forces, where men look for spouses for their female relatives. On the basis of this evolutionary framework, a number of hypotheses are derived: First, men are more interested than women in taking part in and watching sports. In addition, men are more interested than women in taking part in and watching competitive sports than non-competitive sports, and are more interested in team sports than individual sports. Finally, men and women differ in their motives for participating in sports, while the sex differences in athletic behavior between men and women are consistent across different cultures. Evidence from a sample composed of 37 different countries provides support for all hypotheses.",

      "title": "Physical performance in high school students: effect of chronotype",
      "abstract": "Morningness-Eveningness (M-E) is an individual characteristic, defined as chronotype. People are typically categorized in 3 different chronotypes: Morning, Evening and Neither types (M, E and N-types), which differ in the circadian rhythm of many physiological variables. M-types use to wake up and go to bed early and to have their best performances in the first part of the day, otherwise E-types go to bed and wake up late and they have the peak performances in the evening. The chronotype is influenced by both individual and environmental factors and gradually changes during human development. Many studies have demonstrated a trend beginning with a tendency toward morningness in children that gradually evolves into a shift toward eveningness. Approximately at the age of 20 years, this shift reaches its maximum and starts to decline, leading to a growing tendency toward morningness from midadulthood on. This more pronounced eveningness has been found to negatively affect adolescents’ sleep and daytime functioning; even physical performance of adolescents can vary throughout the day because sleep pressure increases, the input from the circadian timing system is optimal or non-optimal to perform the task or both of them. In this study participated 216 students, 124 males and 92 females, attending the first two high school classes (mean age 14-15 years). For the assessment of chronotype, all students compiled the Morningness-Eveningness Questionaire (MEQ), validated by Horne and Ostberg in 1976. For all subjects we collected anthropometric data (weight, height, BMI). All the subjects were categorized as M (n=22), N (n=165), and E-types (n=29). To assess the relationship between chronotype and physical performance, from the sample we recruited 51 subjects, 22 M-type (14 males and 8 females) and 29 E-types (18 males and 11 females), who carried out three Eurofit tests (SHR, Shuttle Run; SBJ, Standing Broad Jump; Cooper endurance test). Preliminary results, although showing some differences in physical performance between E and M chronotype, have not detected statistically significant differences between the two groups.",

The Byronic Hero, a venerable literary model, embraces protagonists who possess extraordinary masculine traits that include dominance but also multiple personal flaws. Byronic Heroes, easily identified and plentiful in popular fiction, appear strongly to resonate with youthful audiences and provide alluring portrayals of heterosexual relations. In a classroom survey employing slide images of paired apparel models and a blind date scenario, collegiate women slightly but significantly preferred models independently judged to project Byronic traits over equally handsome men who appeared affable and conventional. Subject comments on Byronic models uniquely included allusions to sexual and mysterious/rebellious attributes.

Another explanation staged stereotypical characteristics of women (implicit prejudice). The other two explanations were fillers. The results support attributional differences between men and women.

      "abstract": "Shop-keepers some there wereAnd men of good repute,Each vow'd a Bachelor,Unnat'ral Lust pursu'dThe Women Hater's Lamentation (1707)1Much of what was written about sodomy during the eighteenth century remains amazingly vague. With a few crucial exceptions, broadsides and fictional accounts describe sodomy in very general terms, not as a transgressive sexual practice that involves certain unspeakable activities, but rather as a set of specific habits of dress or personal hygiene, often a foreign accent or questionable religious leanings, and occasionally a taste for opera.2 Even the socalled trial accounts themselves most often talk around sodomy, explaining for instance that men in the molly house were making love or that one man was caught in the act of seducing another-with a hand in his breeches, for instance-without any corroborating evidence or actual physical description of sodomitical relations.3At signal, rare moments, however, descriptions of sodomy include a visual account putatively based on observation that offers readers a titillating insight into the dynamics of unnatural activity. In the trial of Thomas Rodin (October 1722), for instance, Henry clay ton tells the court:I and the Prisoner lodg'd in one Room, at Peter Wright's, a Shoemaker, at the Three Shoes next Door to the Harrow in Long-Alley in Moorfields. My Landlady keeps a Baudy-house, and lets out Lodgings. Some Time in March last,-I forget the Day,-there accidentally comes in a Stranger to lodge, the Prisoner drank with him, and at half an Hour past ten they went up to Bed together; and saw the Prisoner lying with him in the Nature of carnal Copulation, as a Man lies with a Woman.Court. How you be sure of that.Clayton. not put my Hand between them; but it was a Moon-light Night, and was abed in the same room, and see what they plain enough.4Henry Clayton's account depends on direct visual testimony: clayton sees two men in the act of copulation. As unimaginative as his description is, it does suggest some of the ways in which sodomy is already coded. The visual account is enhanced by the moonlight and the intimacy of the observer, and even these simple details work to create a scene. Moreover, clayton's tantalizing claim that he did not put my Hand between (misprinted as I put my hand between in a recent edition of these trials) serves to emphasize his physical proximity and to give credence to his observation, which concludes with the claim that he could see what they plain enough (my emphasis). But clayton's account also demonstrates the perils of such close observation:5Court. How long was it before you spoke of this?Clayton. spoke on't the next Day.Court. And why you not prosecute sooner?Clayton is very quickly on the defensive here, and before very long his testimony has been thoroughly discredited. This is in part because his own character has been rendered questionable, not because of any activity of his own but because of his intimacy with the scene of sodomy itself. Sodomy is dangerously seductive, as this moonlit scene suggests.6 Clayton can hardly keep his hands away from the copulating couple.For the obvious reason that proximity implies guilty association, then, such accounts are often framed as keyhole testimony, in which an observer watches certain sexual activities from a distance and then reports them to a listener or an audience, either in a court of law or another social situation, such as an antisodomy tract or a novel. Rather than get so close that the observer touch the participants, in other words, a doorway or a partition usually separates the observer from the scene of sodomy. This gives precedence to a visual account of the scene and offers a new set of erotic dynamics, as the following account suggests.In the trial record for John Dicks (April 1722), for instance, the following testimony is recorded:William Rogers. …",

The tactic(s) used in both situations are conditional and are based on social and ecological environments, respectively, and on the relative social status of competitors. The decision-making rules for adopting a particular tactic for any individual at any one time in its life are based on its age, status, competitive ability, or current environmental conditions; these rules will ultimately maximize the individual's lifetime reproductive success.

      "title": "Aesthetic Preference for Nonredundant Complexity: Key to Creativity",
      "abstract": "The basic principle of all biological and social, and some physical processes is increase of interactive heterogeneity, which evolutionarily raises the sophistication level of intraspecific and interspecific systems. Primates, including humans, and other species of animals such as elephants, are known to create multicolor pictorial patterns on a canvas, holding a painting brush in a hand, or in the case of elephants, wrapping the long \"nose\" around a painting brush. Therefore the pattern creation has a long evolutionary history. Humans and monkeys branched off 6 or 7 million years ago. Humans and elephants much earlier. Another important consideration is the method of mate selection by females. Females prefer \"minority\" males. If Type A males and Type B males are mixed, females prefer \"minority\" males instead of \"supernormal\" males. The females' preference for \"minority\" males leads to intraspecific heterogenization, but if females preferred \"supernormal\" males, it would lead to intraspecific homogenization. There is heterogeneity of individual aesthetic preference types in terms of nonredundant vs. redundant complexity. Some examples of nonredundant complexity are: Picasso's Guernica, and Stravinsky's Le Sacre du Printemps. Aesthetic preferences are expressions of the individual's perceptual/cognitive/cogitative/action types (abbreviated as \"mindscape types\"). While individuals who prefer nonredundant complexity tend to be creative, those who like redundant complexity tend to be anti-creative. Furthermore, we must become aware that the individual types are not subcultural variations, but they exit across cultural, social, gender, and professional boundaries, and are therefore transgroup occurrences. The individual types also cut across boundaries between species, and are therefore transeidosic. This knowledge is useful in multicultural management. Awareness of transgroupness of individual mindscape types will reduce self-stereotyping and ingroup homogenization, and contribute to reduction of hostility, violence and terrorism between religious, political and ideological groups. In plain language, some persons in other groups are more similar to you than many people in your own group. Psychological tests are available.",

Adults generally categorized all of the machines accurately. Both groups of children categorized familiar possible machines as real, but were agnostic as to the fantasy status of unfamiliar possible machines. Children generally responded that both kinds of impossible machines were make-believe, but 4-year-olds were more likely to make these accurate judgments for the physical than biological items, different from the older children and adults (whose responses were similar). These data suggest that children's judgments about the possibility of machines are not strictly limited by first-hand experience. Young children's domain-specific causal knowledge interacts with their understanding of the fantasy/reality distinction to constrain their inferences in a rational way.",

      "title": "Review of Problems of Adolescent Sexual Behavior and the Role of Millennium Development Goals 4, 5 and 6 in Nigeria",
      "abstract": "Introduction: The problems of adolescents’ sexual behavior are grave and far-reaching. Methods: Review of exiting literature via Google scholar, AJOL, Pubmed, HINARI and other relevant data bases on the common problems of adolescents’ inappropriate sexual behavior. Result: Adolescent sexual behavior could result in adolescent pregnancy which prevalence varies widely throughout Nigeria perhaps due to differences in culture and development. Abortion, the willful termination of pregnancy is another problem which is often undertaken for pregnancies resulting from incest and sexual abuse. Also common is trans-generational sex which occurs when an adolescent has non-marital sex in the last 12 months with a man who is at least 10 years older than her. Also related to this, is transactional sex found in both committed and casual relationships. It is not always done for survival because in some cultures, sex for favor is carried out for reasons other than subsistence. Furthermore, multiple sexual partners are the engagement in sex with more than one partner over a particular time frame. It may be sequential or concurrent. The high prevalence of these problems in Nigeria raises a question of the possibility of achieving the millennium development goals (MDGs) 4, 5 and 6 specifically targeted at reducing child mortality, improving maternal health and combating HIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases respectively. Conclusion: Policies and strategies such as family life and HIV/AIDs education (FLHE) curriculum on adolescent reproductive health should be pursued with greater vigor in our secondary schools in addition to establishing HIV counseling centers and vocational training programs for out-of-school adolescents. WHO support and commitment to key action areas for countries and member states will build and strengthen their capacity to improve reproductive and sexual health.",

An analysis of variance with sex, grade, and stimulus person as the main effects produced significant sex, grade, sex × grade, and sex × stimulus person effects. Males had a larger personal space than females at all grades and for all stimulus persons. The mean for male third graders was significantly different from all other means for males and females. A larger personal space for males than for females established by the third grade tended to remain until the sixth grade, although personal space tended to decline for both sexes. A consistent downward trend in personal space for females reversed itself in the sixth grade when the personal space for females increased to approximately the same distance as for male sixth graders. The personal space of males and females toward men, women, and same sexed children tended to be at about the same level. However, personal space toward opposite sexed children tended to be smaller.",

The results were consistent with the primary assertion that measures of sex role identity are better predictors of contextual variations in self-disclosure than is sex per se. Sex consistently failed to predict subjects' willingness to self-disclose, both within and across contexts, whereas femininity promoted self-disclosure in the context that was clearly social and expressive in character. Although masculinity failed to exert the expected facilitative impact on self-disclosure within the instrumental context, it nonetheless influenced the results; androgynous subjects, who scored high in both masculinity and femininity, were more self-revealing across contexts than was any other group.",

Reactions are operationalized in terms of expressed rejection of the homosexual as indicated by responses to a social distance scale. The major variables examined are sex of homosexual, sex of reactor, and acceptance of two commonly held stereotypes. These stereotypes—perceived danger and psychological disturbance—both suggest that a sense of threat is associated with rejection of the homosexual. A particularly interesting finding was that male subjects are especially rejecting of male homosexuals. Presumably male subjects tend to view the male homosexual as a sexual failure and to perceive him as personally threatening or dangerous.",

Gender differences in sexual behavior are evident, with males showing earlier and more frequent sexual activity, while females demonstrate greater flexibility in sexual orientation.

In the first place, except for masturbation, sex necessitates collective action; and all collective action requires communication. Mutually understood signals must be conveyed, intentions expressed, and the action sustained by reciprocal encouragement. A second problem arises from the cultural conditioning of Western man. Both the appeal and the danger of ephemeral sex are increased because the partners are usually strangers to one another. In the positioning and signaling phases of the game, the players have already indicated their intentions. This stage, then, merely formalizes the agreement and sets the terms of the payoff. Another type of action that tends to swell the volume of sexual acts in a given facility is the simultaneous encounter, in which more than one sexual act is in process at the same time.",

Most were sexually active and used contraception. Nearly half acknowledged religious teachings on sexual activity, and one third believed premarital sex is proscribed. Religiosity items were negatively correlated with approval of sexual activity in hypothetical relationship scenarios, but religiosity was not related to self-reported sexual activity or contraceptive use. Participants emphasized relationships and physical health, not religious proscriptions, in their standards for sexual activity. Older adolescents may believe sexual activity is acceptable in committed romantic relationships.",

Patterns of play are similar, although Japanese adolescents have been playing for longer, they play fewer aggressive games, and there is greater perceived concern by Japanese parents. Principal components analyses of a scale to measure needs met by game play produce essentially the same factors: “companionship,” which correlates with play in the United Kingdomonly, and “prefer to friends,” which in Japan correlates with play for both genders, but only for boys in the United Kingdom. Aggression scores are predicted by frequency of play in both cultures, but years of play explain none of the variance. A preference for aggressive games predicts lower aggression scores in Japan.

We report a yearlong study of dominance and affiliation in 24 dogs at a dog daycare facility and provide additional details on dog relationships through long-term observations of pairs of dogs who lived together in the same household or met frequently for years. Companion dogs formed highly differentiated relationships with one another. At daycare, some dyads affiliated and displayed one-way submission (formal dominance), others affiliated without a dominance relationship (egalitarian), and the majority of dyads did not affiliate at all (agonistic or non-interactive). The dogs in household environments showed formal and egalitarian relationships, and two dyads exchanged two-way agonism without submission (unresolved). Sex influenced the types of relationships dogs formed, with mixed sex dyads more likely to affiliate and less likely to exhibit dominance than same-sex pairs. Dominance influenced the nature of affiliation in relationships; egalitarian dyads were more likely to play and showed more equitable gentle affiliation. Gentle affiliation was reciprocal in the group as a whole, but it was highly skewed in many dyads, especially those with dominance relationships. Gentle affiliation was usually, but not always, directed up the hierarchy. Certain dyads affiliated at much higher rates than others, indicating that the dogs formed friendships. Most friends were mixed sex and/or egalitarian pairs, but friendships occurred in all of the sex class/dominance combinations. Long-term observations demonstrated how dyadic relationships can change over time. Such highly differentiated relationships suggest significant social complexity in dogs.",

Using self-reported dyadic sexual desire relating to a partner, dyadic sexual desire relating to an attractive person, and solitary sexual desire from a large (N &amp;gt; 8000) and age-diverse (14.6 - 80.2 years) online sample, the current study had three goals: First, we investigated relationships between men and women’s sexual desire and age. Second, we examined whether individual differences such as gender/sex, sexual orientation, self-rated masculinity, relationship status, self-rated attractiveness, and self-rated health predict sexual desire. Third, we examined how these associations differed across sexual desire facets. On average, the associations between age and both men and women’s sexual desire followed non-linear trends and differed between genders/sexes and types of sexual desire. Average levels of all types of sexual desire were generally higher in men. Dyadic sexual desire related positively to self-rated masculinity and having a romantic partner and solitary desire was higher in people with same-sex attraction. We discuss the results in the context of the evolutionary hypothesis that predict an increase of sexual desire and female reproductive effort prior to declining fertility. Our findings both support and challenge beliefs about gender/sex specificity of age effects on sexual desire and highlight the importance of differentiating between desire types.",

      "title": "Identity Bargaining and Self-Conception",
      "abstract": "An essential feature of social interaction is negotiation as to the identities actors may assume. A roleplaying experiment was designed in which this identity bargaining could be observed and its outcomes predicted. Male subjects interacted with female stooges who demanded that they assume a certain identity in order to accomplish a desirable goal (e.g., get a date). In half the cases the subject was altercast in an identity incompatible with his ideal self-conception; in the other half the altercast was irrelevant to his ideal self. Half the subjects interacted in private, while half believed themselves to have a peer audience. As predicted, subjects engaged in greater ceding of identity when the stooges' altercast was not aimed at a central feature of their self-conception. While measures of subjects' interpersonal strategies were not consistently differentiated when the episode had an audience, in relative privacy, however, subjects whose central feature of self was attacked proved to be relatively more defensive and derogatory toward the stooge, to project greater secondariness, to altercast the stooge into a supportseeking identity, and to project greater autonomy. The common assumption that social interaction is goal-directed suggests central questions about the relationship between actors' goals and their means for pursuing them. The individual goes about his daily activities, attempting to affect others' behavior in ways best to achieve his purposes, while at the same time, these others pursue goals which ordinarily dovetail imperfectly with those being sought by the actor. Exchange theorists (e.g., Blau, 1964; Homans, 1961; Thibaut and Kelley, 1961) have argued that interaction goals should be viewed as preference rank orderings for the potential outcomes of behavior. Intervening between this rank ordering and the ultimate outcomes achieved in an encounter is a dynamic process of negotiation. It is through such negotiations that actors develop the shared meanings which allow them to interact (Goffman's, 1959 working consensus). Central to the working consensus is an implicit agreement over the situational identities actors may assume in the encounter. Each person projects a definition of the situation containing information about who he is in the encounter (selfpresentation, Goffman, 1959), and who alter may, or ought to, be (altercasting, Weinstein and Deutschberger, 1963). Since the purposes of any two actors seldom mesh perfectly, the definition of the situation they come to share is the product of a continuous negotiation. The negotiations centering on self-presentation and altercasting may be called identity bargaining, where actors place constraints on each other's situational identities, and finally anchor in the working con* This research was supported in various measures by N.S.F. grant GS-1093, N.S.F. dissertation grant GS-2520, and a grant from the Graduate Council of the State University of New York.

Identity bargaining is often more than simply a set of strategic maneuvers instrumental to some interactional goal; it may often yield intrinsic rewards as well. of the commonest forms of self-presentation is the pursuit of what McCall and Simmons (1966:75) call role-support, the confirmation from others for one's claims about one's identity. One of man's most distinctive motives is the compelling and perpetual drive to acquire support for his idealized conception of Besides securing role-support by shaping the responses of others, the person constantly tries to be himself, i.e., to behave consistently with his projected definition of self. There are two different ways costs and rewards may be attached to the actor's identity. The strategic identity he assumes in an encounter may be a vehicle for accomplishing his valued purposes, or his presented identity may capture important features of his self-conception. In a given interaction, however, these two elements may create conflict for the actor. From his perspective it would be desirable to assume an identity in pursuit of his situational goals which was congruent with an idealized version of himself. He would like to avoid the dilemma that Gergen (1965) has called selfconsistency vs. strategic self-presentation. The purpose of the present research was to create an identity bargaining encounter in the laboratory, by formally posing the selfconsistency vs. self-presentation dilemma to experimental subjects. This meant creating a desirable goal for the subject to achieve with another person, who made it a precondition of success that the subject assume an identity incompatible with his self-conception. Once placed in this dilemma, under what circumstances would the actor resolve the conflict in favor of self-consistency (and failure) or in favor of strategic self-presentation (and success)? It was necessary to create an experimental condition where the subject was constrained to bargain over an important and central feature of his self-conception, and a control condition where the object of negotiation was an unimportant or irrelevant feature of his self-conception.

      "abstract": "Sexual abuse has been defined as the involvement of dependent, developmentally immature children and adolescents in sexual activity that they do not fully comprehend and to which they are unable to give informed consent or that violate the social taboos of family roles.1 In this situation, there is an imbalance of power between abuser and abused, and an element of control of the child by a trusted adult. Sexual abuse ranges from violent assault to gentle seduction. The activities include all forms of digital-genital, oral-genital, genital-genital contact between abuser and child, as well as non-contact abuse such as exhibitionism and use of the child in the production of pornographic material.",

      "abstract": "The conflicts of 24 pairs of previously unacquainted 21-month-old children were examined for social hallmarks at several levels of analysis. Each child was observed with the same partner for 15 min on 3 consecutive days. On the fourth day half the dyads were rearranged such that each child now was paired with a new partner; the remaining children returned to meet their usual partners. Conflicts were defined dyadically as 1 child's protesting, resisting, or retaliating against an act by the peer; 217 were recorded across the 4 days, 84% of which were struggles over toys. The disputes possessed a patterned interactive structure and explicit communicative content, and 75% of the object struggles were preceded or followed by socially pertinent events. The extent of conflict neither increased nor decreased over days, nor were there reliable differences between acquainted peers on the fourth day. However, the outcome of 1 conflict affected the next; a child who lost a dispute was more likely than the winner to initiate the next. Moreover, the findings suggested that dyadic as well as dispositional factors influenced conflictual behavior; the children's tendency to initiate disputes on the fourth day could be predicted from their initiations on the first 3 days for both groups, but prediction of their tendency to yield to the peer's demands for objects was only possible for the group who retained the same partners.",

      "abstract": "Based on a sample of 814 university students, pro- and anti-same-sex marriage and polygamous marriage groups were established based on students scoring >1 SD above (n = 145; n = 132, respectively) and > 1 SD below the group mean (n = 127; n = 126) on the Attitudes Toward Same-Sex Marriage Scale (ATSSM: Pearl & Paz-Galupo, 2007) and Attitudes Toward Polygamy Scale, which was generated by modifying the ATSSM (ATPM). Compared to pro-same-sex marriage students, anti-same-sex marriage students were significantly more prejudiced against gays and lesbians, authoritarian, religious, and politically conservative. Anti-same-sex marriage students also had less contact with and appreciation for diverse cultural groups, more desire to dominate out-groups, were less autonomous in their thinking, and were more likely to be men. Anti-polygamous students were more strongly opposed same-sex marriage, idealized the traditional family, authoritarian, religious, less autonomous in their thinking, desire to dominate minority groups, and were more likely to be female compared to those who were propolygamous marriage. Results further indicated that, polygamy and same-sex marriage are predicted by different variables, with same-sex marriage being more strongly tied to prejudice against gays and lesbians and polygamous marriage being more strongly tied to beliefs about the inherent morality of conventions surrounding the traditional family. A regression analysis using data from all 814 students yielded almost identical results with regards to identifying variables most predictive of ATSSM. Followup analyses revealed that prejudice against gays and lesbians was the single best predictor of opposition to same-sex marriage and even accounted for the associations between opposition to same-sex marriage and religiosity, political conservatism, and support of traditional marriage and family. With respect to polygamy, data from regression analyses revealed that ATSSM was the best predictor of ATPM. Despite the cultural focus on this variable, however, controlling for ATSSM did not reduce the predictive power of critical variables to a non-significant level. Recommendations for challenging opposition to marriage equality are discussed.",

The chief invalidating impediments were precontract (being already married), consanguinity, and affinity; others were public honesty, spiritual kinship, young age, force or fear, criminal collusion, holy orders, solemn vows of religion, impotence and frigidity, error of person or condition, lack of baptism, and legal kinship. It was sometimes possible to obtain a papal dispensation from various impediments, such as consanguinity in the fourth degree (allowing third cousins to marry), but such dispensations were not common until the later Middle Ages.

      "abstract": "We explored the role of parental testimony in children’s developing beliefs about the ontological status of typically unobservable phenomena. US parents and their 5- to 7-year-old children (N = 25 dyads) separately rated their confidence in the existence of scientific and religious unobservable entities (e.g., germs, angels), and were invited to engage in an unmoderated dyadic conversation about the entities. Both parents and children were more confident in the existence of the scientific entities compared to the religious entities. Parental religiosity predicted the strength of their belief in the religious entities, and these beliefs were positively associated with their children’s judgements in the domain of religion. We coded parental testimony produced during the unmoderated conversation for a number of subtle linguistic cues that convey their confidence and prevailing beliefs in an entity’s existence. The results revealed consistent cross-domain differences: parents expressed more uncertainty, were more likely to mention variation in people’s beliefs and make explicit claims about the ontological status of the religious, as compared to the scientific entities. However, with increasing religiosity, parents produced fewer cues to uncertainty, mentioned belief variation less often, and were more likely to make claims of endorsement when talking about the religious unobservables. Importantly, the pattern of linguistic cues in parental testimony was significantly associated with children’s ontological judgements. The present findings have implications for understanding the socio-cultural mechanisms by which confidence in the existence of invisible agents and processes develops in childhood.",

      "abstract": "Adolescent males are often concerned that they may be homosexual because of a sense of sexual attraction to other males. This not uncommon concern is often expressed to pediatric endocrinologists who come into contact with these boys because of concerns with abnormal pubertal development. To explore the character and prevalence of these types of homosexual concerns we assessed the perceptions of a group of healthy adolescent males using a structured questionnaire. The aim of this study was to determine whether males concerned about homosexual tendencies manifest a unique self-perception profile or interact differently with others. A multi-item questionnaire regarding demographic, behavioral, psychological and sexual characteristics was administered to 52 18-24 year-old males. Overall, there were few differences between males admitting to an adolescent homosexual attraction to males and males without this attraction. Differences between these two groups included more exposure to some kinds of pornography (including male to male imagery), noticeable psychosexual responses to male pornography, internal questioning over homosexual tendencies, comparisons of genitalia and perceptions of body build. There were no differences in demographics, family structure, religious beliefs, socio-economic status, knowledge of puberty, inter-personal relationships or sources of information about sexuality.",

Recently, the principles established in that case were applied by the Family Court in a different context – for the provision of hormonal treatment for a 13 year old child,2 some aspects of which are irreversible. Previously, the Family Court had authorised gender reassignment surgery for a child suffering from a physical, congenital condition,3 but notably in Re Alex, the subject child suffered no identified physical condition indicating treatment, but from an identified psychological condition, gender identity dysphoria. This article considers the issues raised by recent applications of the principles relating to the capacity of children to consent to medical treatment, including the decision in Re Alex and the application of those principles to transgender and intersex children. While not all children or adults who identify as transgender or intersex choose the long and difficult path of gender reassignment, some will choose surgical gender reassignment or hormonal treatment at some stage of their lives. In cases where it is proposed that a minor undergo such treatment, the application of the principles of child consent poses particular difficulties.",

      "abstract": "How face perceptions unfold during ontogeny shapes how humans navigate adult social life. A vast literature implicates variation in sexually dimorphic facial characteristics in guiding judgments relating to suites of key life choices, ranging from partner choices to preferences for leaders. Although growing evidence supports that facial morphology underpins children’s first impressions from faces, whether these impressions influence children’s predictions about others’ behaviour remains unclear. We contrasted the influence of men’s facial hair, a highly sexually dimorphic masculine trait, on children’s explicit (Who looks strong/trustworthy) vs. implicit first impressions (Who do you want to tell your secret to/fight dragons?). While reading a storybook, children (N = 80; 4.5-12.0 years) and adults (N = 134), selected one of two twins (two images of the same identity, one bearded and one clean-shaven) to help them face a challenge requiring either a trustworthy or a dominant social partner. In control tasks, participants selected the strongest and most trustworthy member of each pair and then pointed to which face regions informed their decision. In the implicit task, both the probability of selecting a bearded partner and differential selection of bearded partners as a function of relevant trait increased with age. Selections in the explicit task were more adult-like and age-related changes in which facial cues participants used was surprisingly small. Thus, adult-like patterns in predicting other’s behaviour based on facial cues to trustworthiness and dominance lag behind adult-like patterns in inferring traits based on facial cues, potentially because first impressions are of unreliable.",

Other than bisexuality and, recently, mostly heterosexuality, possibilities within the nonexclusive spectrum are seldom investigated, especially among men. In two studies presented here, an additional point, primarily heterosexual, in-between exclusively heterosexual and mostly heterosexual, is proposed. The three were distinguished among 92 young men based on self-reports of three sexual indicators (attraction, fantasy, genital contact); two romantic indicators (infatuation, romantic relationship); and sexual identity. Exclusively heterosexuals differed from the other two in having lower levels of pupil dilation to same-sex (but not other-sex) pornographic stimuli and of gender nonconformity, a proxy for sexual orientation. Primarily and mostly heterosexuals did not differ from each other on either measure but did differ in the extent to which mostly heterosexuals were considerably more likely to endorse same-sex sexuality. Results supported the uniqueness of mostly heterosexual men and, descriptively, primarily heterosexual men. The second longitudinal study found the exclusively heterosexual point was the most stable. Across the three, there was greater movement toward same-sex than other-sex sexuality. This is interpreted in light of the increasing acceptance of same-sex sexuality within the millennial generation.",

      "title": "SEXTING, NON-CONSENSUAL IMAGE SHARING AND PSYCHOLOGICAL HEALTH",
      "abstract": "Background and Aims: Sexting refers to the exchange (sending and/or receiving) of self-taken sexual photographs, usually depicting the sender nude or semi-nude, via mobile phone. Academic and media narratives tend to portray sexting as a deviant behaviour due to the perceived risks of non-consensual image distribution (where individuals’ sexual images are shared without permission): Qualitative research suggests the psychological harms of revenge pornography (one type of non-consensual image distribution) are comparable to the effects of sexual assault and are gendered in nature; considered part of a continuum of sexual violence against women. There is a lack of quantitative research regarding adult sexting and non-consensual image sharing. Studies to date have conflated consensual and non-consensual sexting behaviours and have poor methodological design in terms of the operational definitions used. Researchers investigating sexters’ psychological health have thus far neglected to consider individual factors (e.g. coping, resilience and sexting attitudes), interpersonal aspects (e.g. relationship context and privacy expectations) and image characteristics. Existing research is biased by the measures used (i.e. primary focus on psychological distress) and there has been limited opportunity to demonstrate positive sexting associations (e.g. relational wellbeing). We therefore sought to develop a more nuanced understanding of sexters’ psychological health and wellbeing by addressing the following questions:\r\nHow common are non-consensual image sharing experiences amongst a UK community (non-clinical) sample of adult sexters?\r\nAre there any differences in the psychological health and wellbeing of non-sexters and sexters (including those who have experienced non-consensual image sharing)?\r\nAre any sexting specific factors, such as privacy expectations, image characteristics and relationship with recipients, associated with psychological health?\r\nAre there any differences in psychological health and wellbeing between consensual sexters’, those who have experienced non-consensual sexting, and non-sexters’ when coping, resilience and sexting specific factors are accounted for?\r\nMethod: We utilised a quantitative, cross-sectional online survey design. Participants from a non-clinical adult population (N = 270) were recruited via social media. The\r\nsurvey consisted of a sexting questionnaire identifying type of sexting behaviours, relationship context, privacy beliefs and sexting attitudes; as well as non-consensual image sharing behaviours and experiences. Psychological measures used included: the Depression, Anxiety and Stress scales (DASS-21), the Warwick Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing scale (WEMWBS), the Impact of Event Scale (IES-6), the Brief COPE and the Brief Resilience Scale (BRS).\r\nResults: 87% of the sample had engaged in sexting as an adult, primarily within committed relationships in order to maintain sexual intimacy. 14% of sexters had experienced the non-consensual distribution of their images and 16% had distributed others’ images without permission. Males and females did not differ significantly in who experienced non-consensual image distribution. Images were most often shared by someone the person was dating, typically with friends and family, although images were shared online in 43% of cases. Privacy expectations and sexting attitudes were not related to psychological health or wellbeing. When coping and resilience were accounted for, experiencing non-consensual image distribution was not related to psychological distress but individuals who were uncertain if their images had been shared had lower wellbeing, and consensual sexters who sent sexts to multiple partners had higher anxiety.\r\nConclusion: Our research suggests that the problematic coping strategies individuals employ, and their level of resilience have a stronger relationship with psychological health than do their sexting behaviours; although further quantitative research with clear consistent definitions of sexting and non-consensual image sharing is needed to identify if these findings are replicable. Clinical interventions for those who are distressed by non-consensual image distribution should focus on identifying and reducing the use of problematic coping strategies such as avoidance, denial and self-blame. Sexting may be considered a normative part of intimate relationships: Educational strategies should fully explore issues of consent and perceived gender stereotypes; as opposed to encouraging individuals to abstain from sexting as a deviant or risky behaviour (which could contribute to self-blame and victim blaming). Future research should focus on understanding specific motivations for and types of non-consensual image distribution (e.g. revenge pornography) and whether it is associated with more harmful aspects of relationships such as interpersonal violence.",

      "abstract": "Summary Psychic sex consists of gender identity (self-estimation), gender role (objective estimation of the behavior) and psycho-sexual orientation (hetero-, bi- or homosexual). It was believed that gender identification depends on the socio-environmental influences such as rearing, learning and individual choice. It has become recently evident that endogenous hormones more than socio-environmental factors may create sexually dimorphic gender identification and role. Experiments revealed that transient action of sex steroids (testosterone or estradiol) during perinatal life is crucial for the development of male sexual behavior in adulthood. In human male testosterone, produced perinatally in adult-type amounts, may play a role in the masculinisation of the brain i.e. creation of physiological and behavioral differences versus the female brain. In patients with disturbances of sexual differentiation of external genitalia (intersexuality) gender identity is also affected. Female gender identity is associated with the presence of ovaries or the lack of gonads (agenesis/dysgenesis), i.e. lack of sex steroids in fetal life. Male gender identity appears in the presence of testicular tissue (presence of testosterone in fetal life) irrespective of karyotype and phenotype of the body. In genetic men with the absence of male genitalia due to aberrant function of the androgen receptor (46,XY women), gender identity depends on the severity of the disorder: female - in the complete form and female, male or ambivalent - in the partial. These indicate that androgens are involved in the creation of male gender identity, whereas a female identity develops in the absence of androgen action during sexual differentiation.",

The are diseases of the genetic sex (genetic anomalies, eg. Turner syndrome), diseases of the gonads (hermaphroditism), anomalies of internal and/or sexual organs (pseudohermaphroditism). Recently, the troubles of sexual behaviour could be considered as pseudohermaphroditism, because there is missing the consensus generated by what is considered as conventional normality in biology (the average plus/minus 2 standard deviations). The lack of pubertary sexual development (late puberty) or precocious development complete the consensus of the 6 sexes.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Attachment describes the human infant's tendency to seek comfort, support, nurturance, and protection from a relatively small number of preferred caregivers or attachment figures. The capacity to form an attachment is not present at birth, but develops over time. Although infants in the first 6 months are able to distinguish among different interactive partners, they do not express an obvious preference for one caregiver over another. All of this changes at around 7 to 9 months of age. At that point, infants begin to exhibit stranger wariness and separation protest, two behaviors that herald the onset of focused attachment. Stranger wariness varies from mild reticence to outright distress, but it contrasts with the infant's comfort with an attachment figure, from whom the infant seeks comfort, support, nurturance, and protection. Separation protest describes the infant's reaction to actual or anticipated separation from an attachment figure. After these two behaviors appear, infants are attached to one or more caregivers. Once infants have developed the cognitive capacity to exhibit separation protest and stranger wariness, they may form new attachments with any caregivers with whom they have significant interactive experiences.",

Women scored higher in self-doubt and disappointment than men, but not in betrayal-anger. When the other variables were included as independent variables, women showed still more self-doubt than men when their partner committed adultery, and this was especially true for women of low self-esteem. Emotional dependency and one's own extradyadic sexual experience reduced all jealousy responses, whereas previous experience with adultery of the partner had a mitigating effect upon disappointment, especially among women. It is concluded that in general neither men nor women can be said to be more jealous, but that among women self-doubt and adaptation to the partner's adultery is a quite common pattern.",

      "abstract": "Sex counseling is needed because those people with sexual problems tend to magnify the problems and dwell on them at the cost of all the other important activities of day to day living. The topics covered in sex counseling include impotence (62.5%), premature ejaculation (11.7%), ejaculation dysfunction (13.0%) in case of male, and frigidity (19.1%), sexual aversion/fear (23.0%), and functional disorders of sexual organs (22.4%) in case of female. Frigidity and vaginismus as well as most male problems are within the scope of sex counseling and therapy, but many of the female complaints are psychological and they require marriage counseling. Sexual awareness is both inherited and acquired. 6 weeks after fertilization the presence or absence of Y chromosome already begins to influence both structural and functional development of fetus, and its influence continues throughout our lives. Free creative expression of sexual awareness is bound to clash with social conventions, and that conflict causes stress in some individuals and maturity in others. Positive handling of sexuality promises enriched lives, and sex counseling contributes toward that goal.",

However, there may be some inherent opposition between (a) sexuality (thoughts, affects, and pleasure) and (b) religion/spirituality (attitudes, motives) and (interpersonal) morality (dispositions, behavior). The two imply, respectively, self‐enhancement versus self‐transcendence, disinhibition versus self‐control, and disgust indifference versus sensitivity. We hypothesized that sexual experience attenuates spiritual and moral concerns and behaviors. In three online experiments, young adults were asked to recall a personal sexual experience. Compared to a control condition, sexual induction diminished spiritual behavioral intentions (Experiments 1 and 2), in particular among those with high individual disinhibition (Experiment 1), as well as behaviors of prosociality and integrity/honesty (Experiment 3). The effects were independent of individual religiousness/spirituality. These findings suggest that combining sexual pleasure with self‐transcendence and moral perfection, even if a legitimate ideal, is not an easy enterprise.",

      "abstract": "Abstract A number of risk factors for sexual distress have been identified, including impairments in sexual function. However, for women, sexual function is only weakly associated with distress levels in many cases. One reason for this disconnect may be that impaired sexual function can have a variety of consequences for the individual's sexual experience and that some consequences may be more or less distressing to different people. Research suggests that some consequences of impaired sexual function may be more distressing to older women and/or for women in longer or less satisfying relationships. To examine the association between consequences of impaired female sexual function and distress, 75 women reporting one or more recurrent difficulties with sexual function in the past month were assessed. Frequency of sexual consequences including decreased physical pleasure, decreased sexual frequency, and negative partner emotional responses, were associated with sexual distress after controlling for the effects of sexual function. Additionally, a number of sexual consequences were rated as more distressing by older women and women in unsatisfying relationships. The idiosyncratic ways in which impairments in sexual function play out in the context of sexual activity may be an important target of future research and clinical interventions for sexual dysfunction. Keywords: sexual distresssexual functioningfemale sexual dysfunction Notes 1. This criterion may have biased the sample by excluding women who were unable to engage in sexual activity; however, the requirement was necessary given our aim of assessing the consequences of impaired sexual functioning that occurred during or immediately following sexual activity.",

Despite challenges faced by these parents and their families, research consistently shows children raised by same-sex parents to be as psychologically healthy, and as socially and academically well-adjusted, as their peers raised in traditional heterosexual-parented families. The ability of these children to flourish despite the challenges they face highlights the resilience of this minority group. Contrary to comparative research, the current study is framed by a phenomenological approach, and utilized narrative methodology to qualitatively explore the lived experiences of the adult children of same-sex parents. Participants (N = 8) were over 18, lived in Australia, and had at least one parent who identified as gay, lesbian, or bisexual. Thematic analysis indicated that the dissolution of their biological parents' marriage and subsequent blending of two families were the most salient issues for participants. Participants did indicate fear and/or experience of homophobic reactions, parental modelling, controlling disclosure, social support, an outward perspective, and time to adjust were important in coping with challenges. Participants also indicated that their nontraditional family structure gave them unique advantages and emphasized the importance of secure, loving relationships within their family.",

      "title": "How multiple mating by females affects sexual selection",
      "abstract": "Multiple mating by females is widely thought to encourage post-mating sexual selection and enhance female fitness. We show that whether polyandrous mating has these effects depends on two conditions. Condition 1 is the pattern of sperm utilization by females; specifically, whether, among females, male mating number, m (i.e. the number of times a male mates with one or more females) covaries with male offspring number, o. Polyandrous mating enhances sexual selection only when males who are successful at multiple mating also sire most or all of each of their mates' offspring, i.e. only when Cov(♂)(m,o), is positive. Condition 2 is the pattern of female reproductive life-history; specifically, whether female mating number, m, covaries with female offspring number, o. Only semelparity does not erode sexual selection, whereas iteroparity (i.e. when Cov(♀)(m,o), is positive) always increases the variance in offspring numbers among females, which always decreases the intensity of sexual selection on males. To document the covariance between mating number and offspring number for each sex, it is necessary to assign progeny to all parents, as well as identify mating and non-mating individuals. To document significant fitness gains by females through iteroparity, it is necessary to determine the relative magnitudes of male as well as female contributions to the total variance in relative fitness. We show how such data can be collected, how often they are collected, and we explain the circumstances in which selection favouring multiple mating by females can be strong or weak.",

At the age of adolescence, namely the age range of 15 to 18 years adolescents will experiencethe first puberty, even some children experience puberty more quickly, which is around 10-13 years. In puberty,there is a strong urge that comes from within the individual to know something that he had neverknown. Circumstances like this that encourage adolescents in this case to try new things in life, including freesex (free sex). Sexual activity via mobile phones has now mushroomed in the community. Do not know thebeginning of when it began, but certainly there are many who know if sex can be done via cellular phone. Theactivity of having sex through a cellular phone is called phone sex. Telephone sex (Phone Sex) is a type ofvirtual sex that refers more to explicit sexual conversations that occur between two or more people over thetelephone especially when one participant or sex partner masturbates or performs sexual fantasies. Phone Sex (PS) is a sexual activity carried out by listening on a cellular phone.

      "abstract": "The experiments presented in this thesis examined the role of opioids in sexual pleasure, particularly during early formative sexual experiences, on the ability of male rats to associate an olfactory or somatosensory cue with their ejaculation-induced sexual reward state. The results show that opioids are an important substrate of the sexual reward state, and that this state feeds forward to form a conditioned ejaculatory preference (CEP), in which male rats ejaculate preferentially with females bearing or wearing the cue associated with sexual reward. This suggests that sexual reward (a presumably “proximate” cause of behavior) lies at the root of monogamous mate choice in the rat. These data also contribute to a growing body of evidence that the species’ specific sexual strategies of the male rat, often described as promiscuous, evidence a degree of plasticity that can move toward a monogamous mate choice when features of a familiar female (odor or jacket) are associated with sexual pleasure. This conditioned ejaculatory preference for familiar cues suggests that proximate pleasure-related states act as a Pavlovian US that can reinforce cue-related CSs to create partner and mate preferences. Such preferences bring proximate reward states into synch with reproductive choice, potentially enhancing reproductive success. Findings are discussed, as well as further directions.",

      "title": "An Exploration of the Relations Between Self-Reported Gender Identity and Sexual Orientation in an Online Sample of Cisgender Individuals",
      "abstract": "The present study explored the relations between self-reported aspects of gender identity and sexual orientation in an online sample of 4756 cisgender English-speaking participants (1129 men) using the Multi-Gender Identity Questionnaire and a sexual orientation questionnaire. Participants also labeled their sexual orientation. We found a wide range of gender experiences in the sample, with 38% of the participants feeling also as the \"other\" gender, 39% wishing they were the \"other\" gender, and 35% wishing they had the body of the \"other\" sex. Variability in these measures was very weakly related to sexual orientation, and these relations were gender-specific, being mostly U shaped (or inverted-U shaped) in men and mostly linear asymptotic in women. Thus, in women, feeling-as-a-woman was highest in the exclusively heterosexual group, somewhat lower in the mostly heterosexual group, and lowest in the bisexual, mostly homosexual, and exclusively homosexual groups, which did not differ, and the reverse was true for feeling-as-a-man (i.e., lowest in the exclusively heterosexual group and highest in the bisexual, mostly homosexual, and exclusively homosexual groups). In men, feeling-as-a-man was highest at both ends of the sexual orientation continuum and lowest at its center, and the reverse was true for feeling-as-a-woman. Similar relations were evident also for the other aspects of gender identity. This study adds to a growing body of literature that questions dichotomous conventions within the science of gender and sexuality. Moreover, our results undermine the tight link assumed to exist between sexual and gender identities, and instead posit them as weakly correlated constructs.",

However, gay male characters are often stereotypically portrayed as feminine, and no research has yet explored audiences’ reactions to counter-stereotypical gay characters. Heterosexual Italian men ( N = 158) were exposed to a clip portraying (i) a stereotypical feminine gay male character, (ii) a counter-stereotypical masculine gay male character, or (iii) a nature documentary. Compared to the other conditions, exposure to the counter-stereotypical gay character increased discrimination toward gay men, in the form of anti-gay jokes, the higher the level of participants’ prejudice against gay men. Results further demonstrated that this effect was explained by reduced perceived stereotypicality of the character. Findings are in line with the social identity theory prediction that when gay men (outgroup) are perceived as too similar, and potentially threaten the group identity, heterosexual men would attempt to restore ingroup distinctiveness.",

      "title": "The role of personality, cognition, and affective state in same-sex contests in the red junglefowl",
      "abstract": "Abstract Intra-species contests are common in the animal kingdom and can have fitness consequences. Most research on what predicts contest outcome focuses on morphology, although differences in personality and cognition may also be involved. Supporting this, more proactive individuals often have dominant status, although the causality of this relationship is rarely investigated. Contest initiators often win; thus, individuals that are more proactive in their personality (e.g., more aggressive, risk-taking) or cognition (e.g., more optimistic, impulsive) may initiate contests more often. To investigate this, we assayed the behavior and cognition of sexually mature male and female red junglefowl ( Gallus gallus ), a species in which both sexes contest over social status, before staging intra-sexual contests. We confirm that contest initiators were more likely to win. In males, individuals that behaved more boldly in a novel arena test were more likely to initiate and win contests. Female initiators tended to be less active in novel object test, more aggressive in a restrained opponent test, and respond less optimistically in a cognitive judgement bias test, whereas the main predictor of whether a female would win a contest was whether she initiated it. These results suggest that behaviors attributed to proactive and reactive personalities, and—at least for female red junglefowl—optimism, can affect contest initiation and outcome. Therefore, within species, and depending on sex, different aspects of behavior and cognition may independently affect contest initiation and outcome. The generality of these findings, and their fitness consequences, requires further investigation. Significance statement In red junglefowl, we explored how behavior previously shown to describe personality, cognition, and affective state affected initiation and outcome of intra-sexual contests, by staging contests between sexually mature individuals previously assayed in behavioral and cognitive tests. In both sexes, contest initiators usually won. Bolder males were more likely to initiate and win contests. Female contests initiators were less active, more aggressive, and less optimistic. Our results suggest that personality and cognition could affect the initiation and outcome of contests and that how this occurs may differ between sexes.",

Varying theoretical developmental trends have been posited with regard to gender flexibility, but relationships obtained between age and gender flexibility were mostly positive. Several negative relationships, however, underscored the complexity of gender-related responses.

      "abstract": "Emerging literature on dating goals suggests that young people have different reasons to date and that their dating goals orient both their behaviors and are important to attainment of life satisfaction. Four dating goals have received previous empirical support among late adolescents and emerging adults: intimacy, identity, social status and sexuality, with identity being the most salient domain and having important implications for satisfaction. However, up to now, no research has examined how dating goals may differ according to sexual attractions and gender. In this study, differences in dating goals, goal-consistent behaviors and domain-relevant satisfaction were investigated among a diverse sample of same-sex and other-sex attracted youth (N = 208 Australian; 91% Caucasian; 66% females; 43% same-sex attracted; Mage= 23.5 years, SD=4.1). Contrary to predictions, males did not report higher levels of sex dating goals, behaviors or satisfaction than females. In fact, females in the current study reported greater satisfaction with their sex-life than males. As predicted, females also reported higher levels of identity dating goals, preference for affiliation behaviors and satisfaction with their independence as compared to males. When same- and other-sex attracted young people were compared on goals, behavior and satisfaction in each domain, few differences emerged. However, contrary to expectations, same-sex attracted youth reported less satisfaction with their sex-life than their other-sex attracted peers. Furthermore, although none of the interaction effects between gender and attractions were significant for dating goals or domain-relevant satisfaction, an interesting interaction effect of gender and attraction was found for affiliative behavior. This interaction showed that same-sex attracted males and other-sex attracted females were significantly higher on preference for affiliation than other-sex attracted males and same-sex attracted females, respectively. Implications and future directions for research are discussed.",

      "abstract": "Parents of undergraduates were asked whether they would be more distressed by the sexual or the emotional infidelity of their child’s partner. Comparing the responses of mothers and fathers may offer a rare, “crucial” instance in which evolutionary and socialization perspectives offer different predictions. Socialization theory, broadly conceived, predicts an effect for the gender of the parent: Consistent with their differing gender socialization histories, mothers should be more distressed by the emotional infidelity of their child’s partner, and fathers by the sexual infidelity of their child’s partner. In contrast, an evolutionary psychology approach predicts little or no effect for the sex of the parents: Both mothers and fathers should be more distressed by infidelities that pose a greater threat to their genetic interests. Results were largely consistent with the predictions derived from evolutionary psychology: Both mothers and fathers regarded sexual infidelity as more distressing when committed by a daughter–in–law than by a son–in–law, and emotional infidelity as more distressing when it involved a son–in–law rather than a daughter–in–law. Discussion centered on the theoretical implications of research that examines the behavior of those who are, genetically, one step removed from the sexual behavior of others, but still affected by the reproductive consequences of that behavior.",

What happens?Sexual abuse entails all types of sexual activity often with escalating intrusiveness.Children may be exposed to indecent acts, pornographic photography, or external genital contact in the form of being fondled, masturbating an adult, or being used for intercrural intercourse.Finally, they may be penetrated orally, vaginally, or anally.How often does sexual abuse occur?Nobody knows how often sexual abuse occurs.It is certain that a lot of abuse is undiagnosed and equally certain that false diagnoses may be catastrophic.Five main risk factors predispose to child sexual abuse.* Previous incest or sexual deviance in the family * New male member of the household with a record of sexual offences * Loss of inhibition due to alcohol * Loss of maternal libido or sexual rejection of father * A paedophilic sexual orientation, especially in relation to sex rings and pornography.

      "abstract": "Consensual non-monogamy (CNM) refers to romantic relationships in which all partners agree to engage in sexual, romantic and/or emotional relationships with others. Within the general framework of CNM, subtypes of relationships differ in the extent to which partners intend for love and emotional involvement to be a part of their multiple relationships (that is, some relationships may prioritise love over sex with multiple partners, or vice versa). The present study examined whether individuals were more likely to stigmatise relationships that: (i) focus on loving more than one person (which is characteristic of polyamory), (ii) focus on having sex without love (which is characteristic of swinging lifestyles), or (iii) involve having sex without love without a partner's participation (which is characteristic of open relationships). In the present research, participants were assigned to read a definition of one of the three CNM relationship types (i.e. a swinging, polyamorous or open relationship) and to indicate their attitudes towards individuals who participate in those relationships. Results show that swingers were overwhelmingly perceived more negatively (e.g. less responsible) than individuals in polyamorous relationships and that people in open relationships were sometimes perceived more negatively (e.g. less moral) than people in polyamorous relationships. Overall, findings suggest that people are more uncomfortable with the idea of strictly sexual relationships (i.e. swinging relationships) than relationships involving multiple romantic/emotional attachments (i.e. polyamorous relationships).",

The gynephiles were paid volunteers; the latter three groups were patients. The androphiles, the only group among those compared known to exhibit a measurably greater degree of cross gender identity in childhood, were also the only group to report significantly poorer father-son relations. The homosexual pedo/pedohebephiles, who also prefer mal partners but who exhibit typical male gender identity in childhood, did not differ in father-son relations for the gynephiles to the heterosexual pedo/pedohebephile. Study 2 showed that, within a sample of nonpatient volunteer androphiles, those individuals who reported the greatest degree of cross gender behavior in childhood also tended to report the worst relationship with their fathers. This correlation was replicated within a sample of androphilic patients in Study 3. The consistent pattern of results obtained from these studies suggests that the emotionally distant relationships of father and androphilic sons relate to the sons' atypical childhood gender identity (or observable gender role behavior) rather than to the sons' erotic preference from male partners pre se.",

The data were drawn from several samples which avoided volunteer bias, either by selecting children according to birth-date or by taking complete class groups. The distribution of hand preference and of asymmetry of skill gave no evidence of systematic changes with age. Younger children were more variable and showed larger absolute differences in favour of the right hand than older children but L-R times were similar over most of the age range. Time for peg moving decreased with increasing age to a minimum in the late teens, remained stable for the next three decades and increased slightly in the 50+ age group. Males were faster than females with the left hand in almost all age groups. Females tended to be faster than males with the right hand up to 10 years of age but males then equalled and surpassed females, to be faster in most older groups. Correlations between hands did not vary systematically with age or sex. Left-handers were faster than right-handers and right mixed-handers were intermediate for peg-moving time by the non-preferred hand, in both sexes and both sets of samples. Differences for the preferred hand were less clear but still favoured left-handers in several comparisons. The findings raise the possibility that left hemisphere specialization for language is achieved through a right hemisphere handicap and that left-handers escape this risk to cerebral efficiency.",

Berbeda dengan perempuan, agresivitas mereka diluapkan dalam bentuk kebencian dan kemarahan, yang mana kebencian dan kemarahan mereka akan cenderung menetap lebih lama jika dibandingkan dengan remaja laki-laki. Bahkan tidak jarang pula ditemukan agresivitas remaja perempuan diluapkan dalam bentuk fisik dan verbal. \r\nPermasalahan agresivitas remaja usia sekolah ini perlu ada upaya penanganan agar kecenderungan mereka untuk meluapkan agresivitas mereka bisa di tekan dan dapat meminimalisir perilaku agresinya. Pada buku ini dikembangkan sebuah model bimbingan yang menggunakan ide-ide pokok dari pendidikan kedamaian, yang dalam buku ini disebut dengan bimbingan kedamaian. Model bimbingan kedamaian ini dirancang untuk mereduksi agresivitas remaja. Akan tetapi, tidak menutup kemungkinan bimbingan kedamaian ini dapat digunakan untuk membantu remaja keluar dari tekanan hidupnya seperti menekan perilaku bullying, cyberbullying, kekerasan fisik maupun non fisik, bahkan percobaan bunuh diri, dan lain sebagainya.\r\nBimbingan kedamaian yang dikembangkan dan termuat dalam buku ini terdiri dari tujuh komponen utama, yang digunakan untuk mengintervensi aspek-aspek dari agresivitas, baik fisik, verbal, kemarahan, dan kebencian. Ketujuh komponen dari bimbingan kedamaian tersebut adalah (1) rendah hati terhadap idealisme; (2) kontrol diri terhadap persamaan; (3) toleransi terhadap perbedaan; (4) memaafkan kesalahan orang lain; (5) memilih kekuatan daripada kelemahan; (6) mengatur emosi saya; dan (7) mengatur perilaku saya. \r\nBimbingan kedamaian ini dapat diimplementasikan dalam dua jenis layanan bimbingan dan konseling. Pertama, bimbingan kedamaian diimplementasikan dalam layanan bimbingan klasikal. Kedua, bimbingan kedamaian diimplementasikan dalam layanan bimbingan kelompok. Implementasi dari bimbingan kedamaian ini diharapkan dapat menekan agresivitas remaja yang mana agresivitas remaja ini dapat berdampak buruk bagi dirinya sendiri maupun orang lain. \r\nKonselor perlu menumbuhkan kreatifitasnya agar bimbingan kedamaian yang diimplementasikan tidak membosankan dan menarik bagi siswa. Terlebih remaja pada zaman sekarang, akan mudah bosan apabila mereka diberikan layanan bimbingan dan konseling yang tidak kreatif dan inovatif. Oleh sebab itu, penggunaan kearifan lokal sangat penting untuk menambah nilai lebih dan keefektifan dari bimbingan kedamaian itu sendiri. Kearifan lokal yang digunakan oleh konselor bisa merujuk dan memodifikasi kearifan lokal di daerahnya masing-masing.",

For example, men's greater interest in violent and/or sexually explicit media content may reflect gendered socialization practices that inhibit women from seeking out such traditionally male‐dominated genres, as well as sexist or sexually objectifying content that may decrease women's interest in such genres. In some domains, such as social media use, gender differences are not as notable, although women are more likely to use platforms such as Facebook, and engage in photo‐based behavior than men. Work on intersectional identities (intersections between gender and race, gender and sexuality, etc.) and media use focuses on navigation of stereotypic content, although some research has documented the benefit of new media (Internet and user‐generated content) for sexual and gender minorities in particular.",

More specifically, we explored whether this measure corresponds with sexual age preferences for adults over children in nonpedophilic men. In general, results across three experiments, in which observers freely viewed or rated the sexual appeal of person images, suggest that pupil dilation to sexual stimuli is an indicator of sexual orientation toward adults. Heterosexual men’s pupils dilated most strongly to adults of the other sex, homosexual men dilated most strongly to adults of the same sex, and bisexual men showed an intermediate pattern. Dilation to adults was substantially stronger than dilation to younger age groups. Sexual appeal ratings for images of adults and children also correlated with pupil responses, suggesting a direct link between pupil dilation and sexual interest. These findings provide support for pupil dilation as a measure of sex- and age-specific sexual preferences.",

      "abstract": "inate White supremacy. Our own role as Whites is rather different from that of people of color, because of the power that accompanies our color. A helpful analogy of White women is to consider how men should be involved in eliminating sexism. Eliminating sexism requires changing male behavior; men cannot simply opt out and leave sexism to women to address. Changes in male behavior would include learning to be quiet and not dominate conversations; not to speak for women; recognizing that male privileges nurture a sense of self-assurance that men tend to take for granted and do not see, even when they are trying to help. Changes in men would also include learning to share with us in a reciprocal fashion that respects what women can do; learning to step aside; learning to listen as nondefensively as possible when women try to tell them what bothers us; and generally taking us seriously. Men's role would also include actively supporting antisexist policies and programs, even (and especially) when they are unpopular with one's male friends and associates, and educating other men in order to win their support for antisexist policies and behaviors. Now replace the term sexism with White racism, and the appropriate gender groups with racial groups. (I do not mean to imply here that challenging sexism helps to address racism. It does not; White women are as racist as White men. But I find the analogy helpful.) This begins to provide an agenda for work White people need to do on ourselves.",

Come ogni caratteristica comunitaria, si riflettono nei media, risultando anche in quelli piu moderni come i videogiochi. Di conseguenza, pure questo mezzo d’intrattenimento e entrato a far parte della rete di creazione, perpetrazione e distruzione degli stereotipi. Tale processo e talmente automatico da essere quasi inconsapevole. Ne e prova la tendenza, sia da parte dell’industria videoludica stessa che dai suoi fruitori, a considerare il maschio eterosessuale come target principale. Questo mette in secondo piano donne e membri della comunita LGBT, creando problemi sulla loro rappresentazione. Percio, mettere in luce la questione e discuterne e necessario, a scapito – anzi, soprattutto a causa – della resistenza e l’atteggiamento difensivo mostrato dai giocatori sull’argomento.\r\nLa ricerca espone ed analizza gli stereotipi piu ricorrenti e le problematiche ad essi legate, quali la scarsa rappresentazione femminile (sia numerica che effettiva), l’utilizzo di modelli e ruoli distinti tra maschio e femmina (di vecchio stampo e ripetitivi) e il ridotto riconoscimento della comunita LGBT. Va da se che non siano convenzioni assolute, ne che la loro presenza in un gioco ne sancisca per forza la bassa apprezzabilita. Tuttavia vi e un aumento di prodotti sempre piu liberi da esse, di pari passo con la modernita e la maggiore consapevolezza del pubblico e dei produttori, a dimostrazione che non vi sono limiti al miglioramento. Tali prodotti sono stati riportati nello stato dell’arte, come esempio e spunto per la tesi.",

However it occurs often in dynamically developing firms that ethical norms are not kept and this process is observed by lack of equal chances to get a job – people without connections remain without work. Due to different research the very serious problem is a phenomena of mobbing. Psychological terror or mobbing in working life involves hostile and unethical communication which is directed in a systematic manner by one or more individuals, mainly toward one individual, who, due to mobbing, is pushed into a helpless and defenceless position and held there by means of continuing mobbing activities. These actions occur on a very frequent basis (statistical definition: at least once a week) and over a long period of time (statistical definition: at least six months´ duration). Because of the high frequency and long duration of hostile behaviour, this maltreatment results in considerable mental, psychosomatic and social misery.",

The major factor motivating the sexual behaviour of these women was the overwhelming importance to them of maintaining the dependent relationship upon a male with a total and blind acquiescence to his wishes. Of lesser importance were acting out against parents, a strong sexual drive, the need to prove oneself a woman and a desire, conscious or unconscious, to have a baby. Much guilt was aroused by the use of or insistence on birth control measures; these implied responsibility for sexual activity, the use of such measures was precluded. Contrary to other reports, nausea, vomiting and obstetrical complications occurred with the same frequency as in married women. The course of the pregnancy did not appear to be affected in any way. It was concluded that a weak ego structure was more basic to their behaviour than the unconscious drive to have a baby, or the acting out of unconscious fantasies which often have been assumed in the previous literature. The results suggest that the mild nausea and vomiting of pregnancy is of physiological rather than psychological origin, and that the course of pregnancy is not as readily affected by unhealthy motivation for having the baby as has often been assumed.",

      "title": "Fertility signalling games: should males obey the signal?",
      "abstract": "Game theory is frequently used to study conflicting interests between the two sexes. Males often benefit from a higher mating rate than females do. A temporal component of this conflict has rarely been modelled: females' interest in mating may depend on when females become fertile. This sets conditions for male–female coevolution, where females may develop fertility signals, and males may obey the signal, such that they only target signalling females. Modelling this temporal aspect to sexual conflict yields two equilibria: (i) a trivial equilibrium without signals and with males targeting all females, and (ii) a signalling equilibrium where all females signal before ovulation, and where either some, or all, males obey the signal. The ‘all males obey the signal’ equilibrium is more likely if we assume that discriminating males have an advantage in postcopulatory sperm competition, while in the absence of this benefit, we find the ‘some males obey the signal’ equilibrium. The history of game-theoretic models of sex differences often portrays one sex as the 'winner' and the opposite sex as the ‘loser’. From early models emphasizing ‘battle of the sexes’-style terminology, we recommend moving on to describe the situation as non-signalling equilibria having stronger unresolved sexual conflict than signalling equilibria. This article is part of the theme issue ‘Half a century of evolutionary games: a synthesis of theory, application and future directions’.",

Using an online sample of 1,277 Greek-speaking participants, we found that men and women who experienced same-sex attractions and desired sexual variety and sex without commitment were more likely to prefer same-sex attraction and contact in a partner. Moreover, we found that a considerable proportion of heterosexual men, but only a small proportion of heterosexual women, preferred same-sex attraction and contact in partner.

The outlook on early human embryology comprises three phases: first, the phase when only very few specimens had been discovered and the tentative conclusions drawn from their study were to a considerable extent merely surmised by analogy with the phenomena known to occur in the development of other animals; second, the phase where sufficient material has been acquired to enable investigators to verify or deny some of these postulations and even to suspect certain possibilities—like variations in the degree of development of the various elements in embryos of approximately the same age such as is known to occur in other mammals, or early histological changes indicating pathological relations between the embryonic and maternal structures which may foreshadow the failure of continued embryono-maternal relations and impending abortion; and third, a phase when the specimens will be so numerous that the conclusions of the earlier periods can be established with certainty or definitely refuted. At present, early human embryological study is in the second phase, and the early attainment of the third phase is desirable to fill gaps in the present knowledge of the stages in the development of several structures ( e.g. the yolk-sac, the amnio-embryonic vesicle, etc.) and to determine details necessary for a more precise comparison of the development of the human ovum with that of other primate and of lower vertebrate forms.",

The youths demonstrated well-established sexual identities by the consistency of their sexual fantasies, interests, and behaviors over time. Homosexuality was more frequently described as a general attraction to men (48%) and an indicator of positive personal attributes (33%) than as an isolated sexual behavior. The subjects reported strong negative attitudes from parents (43%) and friends (41%) toward their sexualities. Discrimination (37%), verbal abuse from peers (55%), and physical assaults (30%) were frequently cited problems.

So they aspire to character attributes rather giving rise to problems in relationships than preventing them. Pretentions to the quality of partnerships in the clinical sample are higher than in normal population. Women in the clinical sample aspire to the former social roles of men which causes dispositions of struggles of power. Depressive characteristics of anancastic men are judged as reliability and seriousness by the women whereas men want women to be hysteric, charming, kind, and fond of life so that men dislike women's depressivity.

Yet little is known about factors contributing to long-term lack of intimate relationships. We investigated phenotypic and genetic correlates of never having had sex in ~400,000 UK residents aged 39 to 73 and ~13,500 Australian residents aged 18 to 89. The strongest associations revealed that sexless individuals were more educated, less likely to use alcohol and smoke, more nervous, lonelier, and unhappier. Sexlessness was more strongly associated with physical characteristics (e.g., upper body strength) in men than in women. Sexless men tended to live in regions with fewer women, and sexlessness was more prevalent in regions with more income inequality. Common genetic variants explained 17% (SE = 4%) and 14% (SE = 3%) of variation in sexlessness in men and women, with a genetic correlation between sexes of 0.56 (SE = 0.17). Polygenic scores predicted a range of related outcomes in the Australian dataset. Our findings uncover multifaceted correlates of human intimacy and raise important lines of enquiry in the evolutionary and social sciences.",

      "abstract": "Adolescents and young adults who disclose a minority sexual orientation (“come out” as gay, lesbian, or bisexual) to their parents often are met with varied negative reactions. The current work builds on a growing literature aimed at understanding the myriad causes of negative parental reactions to these disclosures. Specifically, this work evaluates a hypothesis derived from evolutionary psychological logic: that variation in parental responses to offspring’s sexual orientation disclosures is driven, in part, by perceived costs to parents’ inclusive fitness (i.e., implicit or explicit concerns related to the reproductive success of genetic relatives). Across three studies (total N = 493), we examined whether daughters’ and sons’ perceptions of parents’ negative reactions to their sexual orientation disclosures systematically co-varied with inclusive fitness concerns, as indexed by parent gender, sexual orientation, and offspring number. This perspective received partial support among daughters, who reported more negative reactions from their mothers (vs. fathers), particularly in response to lesbian (vs. bisexual) disclosures. Reactions to sons’ disclosures did not vary across parent gender, sexual orientation, or offspring number. Taken together, this work provides preliminary evidence that perceived fitness costs may lead mothers to respond negatively to their daughters’ lesbian orientation disclosures.",

Taking into account the few studies that simultaneously examined the factors 'giftedness' and 'sex' in relation to overexcitability and that yielded conflicting results, our study attempts to clear these heterogeneous findings by investigating a German sample. Our study comprised intellectually gifted (n = 96) and averagely intelligent (n = 91) adults who filled out the 'Overexcitability Questionnaire-Two'. We found no statistically significant interaction of 'giftedness × sex'. Women (regardless of their intellectual status) scored statistically significantly higher than gifted and non-gifted men on emotional as well as sensual overexcitability.

      "title": "MODELLING SEX/GENDER",
      "abstract": "People often assume that everyone can be divided by sex/gender (that is, by physical and social characteristics having to do with maleness and femaleness) into two tidy categories: male and female . Careful thought, however, leads us to reject that simple ‘binary’ picture, since not all people fall precisely into one group or the other. But if we do not think of sex/gender in terms of those two categories, how else might we think of it? Here I consider four distinct models; each model correctly captures some features of sex/gender, and so each is appropriate in some contexts. But the first three models are inadequate when tough questions arise, like whether trans women should be admitted as students at a women's college or when it is appropriate for intersex athletes to compete in women's athletic events. (‘Trans’ refers to the wide range of people who have an atypical gender identity for someone of their birth-assigned sex, and ‘intersex’ refers to people whose bodies naturally develop with markedly different physical sex characteristics than are paradigmatic of either men or women.) Such questions of inclusion and exclusion matter enormously to the people whose lives are affected by them, but ordinary notions of sex/gender offer few answers. The fourth model I describe is especially designed to make those hard decisions easier by providing a process to clarify what matters.",

      "title": "Re: Sexual Harassment",
      "abstract": "Sexual harassment is widespread and prolific across the human race, mostly of females by males. It is a spectrum, from the worst of criminal behaviour (e.g. rape and murder of strangers, of women and girls) to what might be considered harmless playful banter between the sexes from later childhood and ever after. It does not occur in infancy, and appears to begin as a ‘learned’ phenomenon from later childhood. In his editorial, Isaacs considers sexual harassment occurring of women within our own profession, recognising that almost all examples of sexual harassment involve bullying, abuse of power and greater physical strength by males, often leading to emotional and/or physical harms.1 He does not mention the biological differences between the sexes.1 While sexual harassment is apparently learned, not innate, pre-pubertal boys and men are more aggressive than females, have more accidents and commit more violent crimes. While biological differences make males more often the initiators of sexual advances, they are no excuse for predatory or inappropriate behaviour, but any improvements will need to take these differences into account. Isaacs does not mention the importance of co-factors,1 the worst of which is alcohol. The disinhibiting effect of alcohol is relevant in both promoting and facilitating abuse, and any solution will need to take alcohol into account. Isaacs advocates greater fight-back by women and better behaviour by men.1 In truth, we really do not know what to do to prevent sexual harassment, but whatever it is, it needs to be on multiple fronts. We must start with teaching children, especially boys, that sexual harassment is unacceptable, like all bullying. As is clear from public health improvements, for example seat belts, pool fences and reducing drink driving, both active measures (sanctions) and passive measures (advocacy) will have to be used.",

They will no longer be content with an overall attitude of, for instance, permissiveness to the drives instead of the overall attitude of intolerance towards the child's drives. Both attitudes are equally detrimental to the child. Parents train their children for cleanliness very much later than they used to do, so as to give the childish personality more scope for development before the restrictive tendencies set in as a result of the prohibitions put on the satisfaction of the anal drives. Curiosity, if deflected from the sexual problems, becomes one of the greatest assets of the child all through childhood. Similarly, the severe repression of exhibitionism in a child's life is such a pity.",

      "title": "Approach to the Patient: Transgender Youth: Endocrine Considerations",
      "abstract": "Compelling studies have demonstrated that \"gender identity\"--a person's inner sense of self as male, female, or occasionally a category other than male or female--is not simply a psychosocial construct, but likely reflects a complex interplay of biological, environmental, and cultural factors. An increasing number of preadolescents and adolescents, identifying as \"transgender\" (a transient or persistent identification with a gender different from their \"natal gender\"--ie, the gender that is assumed based on the physical sex characteristics present at birth), are seeking medical services to enable the development of physical characteristics consistent with their affirmed gender. Such services, including the use of agents to block endogenous puberty at Tanner stage 2 and subsequent use of cross-sex hormones, are based on longitudinal studies demonstrating that those individuals who were first identified as gender-dysphoric in early or middle childhood and who still meet the mental health criteria for being transgender at early puberty are likely to be transgender as adults. Furthermore, onset of puberty in transgender youth is often accompanied by increased \"gender dysphoria\"--clinically significant distress related to the incongruence between one's affirmed gender and one's \"assigned (or natal) gender.\" Studies have shown that such distress may be ameliorated by a \"gender-affirming\" model of care. Although endocrinologists are familiar with concerns surrounding gender identity in patients with disorders of sex development, many providers are unfamiliar with the approach to the evaluation and management of transgender youth without a disorder of sex development. The goals of this article are to review studies that shed light on the biological underpinnings of gender identity, the epidemiology and natural history of transgenderism, current clinical practice guidelines for transgender youth, and limitations and challenges to optimal care. Prospective cohort studies focused on long-term safety and efficacy are needed to optimize medical and mental health care for transgender youth.",

      "abstract": "An individual being viewed in an Ames room usually appears considerably altered in physical size to an observer. However, some married persons perceive less size distortion of their spouses than a stranger. This instance of selective perceptual distortion, known as the Honi phenomenon, could perhaps reflect differential familiarity and/or emotional involvement toward these stimulus persons. Using heterosexual couples as subjects, we investigated familiarity (i.e., length of the relationship), type of relationship (i.e., dating, engaged, or married), and positive cathexis (i.e., love, liking, and trust of one's partner) as possible mediators of this effect and also explored the impact of some judgemental variations. Neither familiarity nor type of relationship influenced relative perceptual distortion of partner versus stranger. Rather, selective perceptual distortion was directly related to the strength of positive cathexis, principally among females. Only women high in positive cathexis exhibited the Honi phenomenon and perceived a stranger as being more distorted than their partners. In contrast, size judgements by men were affected only by the sequence in which stimulus persons were observed. Implications and interpretations of these findings are discussed.",

Previous research on sex role stereotyping suggests that males, but not necessarily females, anticipate female underachievement and failure. This finding was supported on a number of dependent variables. For example. female characters were rated as more expressive in their behavior but less likely to succeed at their occupation than male characters, and male subjects were more surprised at the male, but not the female, character's choice of a downwardly mobile career. The present study also found a number of changes in traditional sex roles, particularly for female subjects. These subjects were surprised at the job choice of the downwardly mobile female, and rated the character as weak and lazy, but rated the upwardly mobile female as strong and ambitious. Contrary to attribution theory, race of the character did not interact with either sex or occupation. This finding is consistent, however, with other results which suggest that race may be less important than occupational status or sexual gender in trait attributions to stimulus characters.",

Para ambos grupos, el consumo alcanzaba un tope de saturación como fue el caso con anterioridad para los hombres adultos. En treinta años, la indumentaria evolucionó mucho. Se compran menos « prendas de abrigo » tales como abrigos, trajes de chaqueta o trajes para hombre. Por el contrario, las prendas deportivas y los conjuntos de decontracción se van extendiendo. Las mujeres han adoptado cantidad de prendas masculinas sin que por ello hayan renunciado a arti- culos tradicionales. Esta evolución general no trae la desaparición de las diferencias entre categorias sociales. Por lo contrario, ya no se suele encontrar en la indumentaria tendencia a uniformización de las prácticas de consumo. Nuevos productos o importados del exterior no se van extendiendo sistematicamente de las categorias acomodadas a las demás categorias sociales. Asi pues, la falta de afición en materia de gastos de indumentaria atane mucho más a las categorias sociales desfavorecidas que a las categorias acomodadas.",

      "abstract": "Certain common features emerging during the therapy of a number of children in care have suggested that it would be helpful to direct attention to the appearance of markedly precocious or perverse sexuality as a significant feature of a child's relationships and activities. In these ways it can be recognised as a precursor of the disturbances of sexuality which have been more commonly studied as manifestations of adult emotional life. From the beginning of life physiological growth and functioning can be seen as interrelating with the growth of personality, sensory and sensual experience with infantile 'pre-genital' sexuality, and all linking in many complex ways with the development of character traits and personal relationships. Whereas infantile sexuality is characterised as being experimental and imitative in terms of phantasies about the parental relationship, and predominantly masturbatory in aim, adult sexuality is envisaged as essentially creative and reciprocal.",

      "abstract": "Intersectional perspectives in postcolonial theories and gender studies have long argued that femininity represented in museums and exhibitions is subjected to multiple forms of othering. 1) Acquired social modes of looking at artifacts, women and/or Others correlate with androcentric male gaze that passivizes the object being looked at. 2) Women’s social roles in binary androcentric system further render femininity and feminine activities as associated with passivity. Thus, reproduction, care, and socialization as women’s tasks are symbolically relegated to domestic, immanent sphere as a type of work that merely maintains the continuity of a society’s life. 3) In traditional patriarchal schemes, then, transcendental masculine activity is linked with political, economic, scientific, and decision-making realms that are socially constructed as more influential and significant factors in shaping history, thereby being viewed as more worthy of remembering and recording. 4) Representations of minorities in terms of their gender, racial, class, sexual and/or indigenous identities in institutions safeguarding knowledge and historical memory take place in a pre-defined and pre-mediated context shaped by Euro-centric, Judeo-Christian, orientalist epistemologies, which inherently relate knowledge to power and objectification. Tackling such a value system and epistemological bias posits a major challenge for today’s museums, institutions of memory and educational approaches. The following article follows suit in discussing the theoretical and practical potentials of decolonial methodologies which have been formulated from bellow by (formerly) othered, gendered, racialized and objectified positions. The text seeks to demonstrate some of the opportunities this standpoint offers in analyzing a case of (more or less) good practice in the American Museum of Natural History in its attempt to contrast historical narratives pertaining to early European settlements in what is now New York City. Further, elaborating on the tradition of quilting in the U.S., human zoos and exhibits of the Berlin Wall beyond Europe, the article argues for nuanced contextualization and intersectional methods in current musem work.",

      "abstract": "Vegetarianism can meet healthy, ethical, or ecological values (such as equality and protection of animals or the environment). At the same time, it can represent a response to the need for self-determination in adolescence. Furthermore, some studies show vegetarians have greater depressive risk and a lower sense of body satisfaction. Considering the spread of non-meat diets in the Western world, researchers have investigated the benefits and risks to physical and psychological health. Despite this, few studies have been conducted on factors influencing adolescent's vegetarian diet-related attitudes. Through self-administered loosely structured interviews, this research investigated factors potentially associated with vegetarian choices in adolescence. It checked (a) gender differences in vegetarian choices; (b) religious, familial, ethical, or health factors implied in vegetarian choices; and (c) indicators of well-being among young vegetarians. The findings suggest that for our sample, non-vegetarians have lower scores on health-related questions than others, while for vegetarian adolescents, the benefits of vegetarianism mainly depend on their ethical stances, beliefs, and values. Conversely, it is unrelated to factors such as the desire to lose weight, dissatisfaction about one's body shape, or depressive feelings.",

El impacto emocional puede ser profundo, y muchas veces subestimado por los equipos de salud, afectando la calidad de vida y el proceso de recuperación del paciente. En muchos casos, los pacientes reportan sentimientos de despersonalización y pérdida del atractivo físico, lo cual afecta su autoestima y sus relaciones interpersonales. Los pacientes ostomizados presentan una prevalencia elevada de síntomas ansiosos y depresivos, especialmente cuando el estoma se percibe como permanente o si fue resultado de una cirugía de urgencia. El trastorno de adaptación es también común, caracterizado por dificultades emocionales persistentes para asumir los cambios en el estilo de vida, alimentación, sexualidad e higiene. Las preocupaciones sobre el atractivo físico, el miedo a fugas o el rechazo por parte de la pareja pueden conducir a una disminución del deseo sexual o incluso a evitar las relaciones íntimas. Así mismo, muchos pacientes reducen sus actividades sociales por miedo al estigma o a situaciones embarazosas en público. El estoma intestinal exige una respuesta clínica que trascienda lo técnico y abrace la dimensión humana del proceso, es fundamental trabajar en la reconstrucción de la identidad psicológica y corporal del paciente. Solo mediante un enfoque biopsicosocial, centrado en la persona, será posible favorecer una adaptación saludable, restaurar el bienestar subjetivo y promover una vida digna y plena más allá de la ostomía.

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT.According to statistics, about 90% of people were emotionally abused in childhood, but many do not realize, deny or, worse, their own children or others, considering that their treatment of childhood was natural and normal. Emotional is form of aggression, but law can not penalize it. Most parents believe that child means physical or violence and / or child neglect. But they do not know that they can hurt child simply by their excessive attitude. The emotional is any behavior that is intended to control, subjugate, submit other beings through fear, intimidation, humiliation, blaming, and growing guilt, coercion, manipulation, invalidation etc. The consequences of emotional are multiple, varied, extremely serious; they leave marks for life, affecting child development at various levels - emotionally, intellectually and even physically. Moreover, it will affect future adult's social and professional life, relationships and physical and mental health, to greater or lesser extent, depending on type of emotional abuse, and on its frequency and intensity.Keywords: behavior, emotional abuse, violence, control, abuse1. IntroductionAbuse means use of force in order to try to dominate child, to compel him/her to do dangerous things that he/she does not want to do, expose him/her to hazardous situations or to situations perceived by him/her as dangerous. Any action that causes injury or psycho-emotional disorders is an abuse.The can be of several types:Physical - involves use of physical force against children and subjecting them to hard work that exceed their capabilities, actions that result in damage of their body integrity.Emotional - is inappropriate behavior of adults towards children, behavior that adversely affects child's personality in development. Child rejection, forced isolation, terrorization, ignoration, humiliation and corruption are manifestations of child abuse.Sexual - consists in exposing child to watching pornography, seduction (advances, caresses and promises) or involvement in acts of any kind.Economic - implies attracting, persuading or forcing child to do income generating activities, adults close to child at least partially or indirectly benefiting from this revenue. The economic leads to removing child from school, thus depriving him of to access superior social and cultural levels.Neglection - is adult's inability or refusal to appropriately communicate with child, and limited access to education.The term sexual abuse refers to exploitation of child whose age does not allow him/her to understand nature of contact and to adequately resist it. This exploitation may be done by child's friend whom he/she is psychologically dependent on.The can have different aspects:- evocation (phones, exhibitionism, pornography, content of adult's language etc.)- stimulation (erotic contact, masturbation, incomplete genital contact, forced participation in sexuality of couple etc.)- making sex (rape or attempted rape).1.2 Issues of Abusea) Children may be abused since very young.Children may be abused from very early age. They are often seduced by games in sexual- abusive situation. The abuser often establishes positive relationships with both parents and child.The child is encouraged or forced to engage in abusive relationship. This is achieved through rewards and / or threats. The activity is presented as something special, and child should be considered lucky because he/she has a chance to participate in it. The child is unable to understand what is happening. Just when he/she is told that the game is secret he/she begins to understand that something is wrong. …",

      "title": "National Strength and Conditioning Association Position Statement on Long-Term Athletic Development",
      "abstract": "There has recently been a growing interest in long-term athletic development for youth. Because of their unique physical, psychological, and social differences, children and adolescents should engage in appropriately prescribed exercise programs that promote physical development to prevent injury and enhance fitness behaviors that can be retained later in life. Irrespective of whether a child is involved in organized sport or engages in recreational physical activity, there remains a need to adopt a structured, logical, and evidence-based approach to the long-term development of athleticism. This is of particular importance considering the alarmingly high number of youth who fail to meet global physical activity recommendations and consequently present with negative health profiles. However, appropriate exercise prescription is also crucial for those young athletes who are physically underprepared and at risk of overuse injury because of high volumes of competition and an absence of preparatory conditioning. Whether the child accumulates insufficient or excessive amounts of exercise, or falls somewhere between these opposing ends of the spectrum, it is generally accepted that the young bodies of modern day youth are often ill-prepared to tolerate the rigors of sports or physical activity. All youth should engage in regular physical activity and thus should be viewed as \"athletes\" and afforded the opportunity to enhance athleticism in an individualized, holistic, and child-centered manner. Because of emerging interest in long-term athletic development, an authorship team was tasked on behalf of the National Strength and Conditioning Association (NSCA) to critically synthesize existing literature and current practices within the field and to compose a relevant position statement. This document was subsequently reviewed and formally ratified by the NSCA Board of Directors. A list of 10 pillars of successful long-term athletic development are presented, which summarize the key recommendations detailed within the position statement. With these pillars in place, it is believed that the NSCA can (a) help foster a more unified and holistic approach to long-term athletic development, (b) promote the benefits of a lifetime of healthy physical activity, and",

      "abstract": "Males and females must have an equal claim to participate in a variety of sports and may seek the challenges presented by competitive sports. As persons, women deserve the same respect and concern as men in pursuiting excellence through the challenge of athletic competition. To achieve the ideal of sex equality in sports, I`ll suggest the following on the basis of theories of and °assimilationism. Firstly, on the view of assimilationism, sex-blind teams are defensible in the aspect that any distinctions shouldn`t be made on the basis of sex in taking part in various athletic programs. It is fair to both men and women, for they are treated not on the basis of sex but on the basis of characteristics of the individual. It provides less strong or smaller men who are actually excluded from the top levels of competition between men with the equal opportunities to compete with women of roughly same physical conditions. It also provides the equal opportunities to top elite women who are thought to be qualified for being able to compete with men at the high levels of competition to express their physical excellence and develop their capabilities. Secondly, If the idea of sex blindness was implemented throughout society, it would not matter that few women played at the higher levels of athletic competition. In other words, in sex blind recognition, when an individual`s sex would be really regarded no important in our society, it would not be important that virtually all the top athletes were male. sex distinction doesn`t count and equal opportunities can be provided depending on the characteristics of each individual based on the ideal of androgyny Thirdly, a lot of efforts should be made to redefine our catalog of major sports which has a built-in bias towards athletic activities favoring men and promote female-dominance sports like gymnastics, skating, diving, and so on, which give the advantage to an individual having small size, beauty, flexibility, balance, and low center of gravity. It also should be sought to assimilate male dominance sports with androgyny. In order to achieve it, various methods-rules, system, procedure, protection equipment and etc. should be searched out in different ways. In addition, through the development of a wide variety of sports and athletic programs which are not biased in favor of male physiology, it is possible to change individual preferences and to accommodate them to such activities of female-dominance. In conclusion, as long as no discrimination takes place, men and women have been treated by the same standards and so have no ground to complain of inequity. On this view, sex equality in sports requires that we pay no attention to the sex of participants.",

The present study was carried out to evaluate the existence of a nycthemeral rhythm of human sexual behavior and to identify environmental factors responsible for the rhythmic pattern.Methods: Non-traditional university students (ages 18 to 51 years) recorded the times of day when they went to sleep, when they woke up, and when they had sex for 3 consecutive weeks. They also answered a questionnaire designed to identify the causes of their selection of time for sex.Results: The majority of sexual encounters took place at bedtime (11 pm to 1 am). The most common explanations for this temporal pattern were the rigidity of the professional work schedule and family obligations and the availability of the partner, which reduced the opportunity for sexual encounters at other times of the day.Conclusion: Most sexual encounters take place around bedtime. Although the presence of an endogenous component responsible for this temporal pattern cannot be excluded, the evidence indicates strong environmental forcing, particularly from the work/family schedule of the individuals and from partner availability.",

These young adolescents showed significant agreement about the characteristics of the ideal man and woman; however, there were important gender and cross-cultural differences. Boys emphasized physical characteristics more so than girls. As compared to U.S.A. adolescents, Mexican adolescents more highly valued liking children, helping others, high intelligence, and inner qualities such as goodness and honesty in the opposite sex ideal. U.S.A. adolescents gave higher rankings to having a lot of money and being fun, popular, good looking, and sexy; they drew the ideal person as more physically mature, and involved in a less sex-stereotyped activity than did Mexicans.",

It was found that marital quality of men and women differs in degree rather than in kind. Although men are more satisfied with their marriages than women, the same factors are important in their assessments. These aspects are more important to the overall marital quality for women, but their saliency varies by stages of the family life cycle. There are indications of differential assessment, with women more sexually fulfilled, while men are more satisfied with spouse's help, time with children, and friendship; results also suggest a greater focus by women on companionship.",

The use of contraceptives by sexually active single women needs to be researched. A model presented assumes that contraceptive use involves a dynamic process rather than a unidimensional progression from nonuse to use of the most effective technique. Some ways to minimize the risk of unwanted adolescent pregnancies are: 1) parents must realize the childs right to be sexual and 2) sex education training should occur simultaneously with all other forms of education. Another study reported indicates that contraceptive success is related to higher levels of sexual and contraceptive knowledge future time perspective low levels of sexual activity high levels of socialization and behavioral intentions to use contraception. Sexual experiences are influenced by social and emotional maturity and some of the problems which result from the need to coordinate development on the levels of biology individual differences and social interactions are discussed. Current data on the socialization of sexuality highlight the importance of learned emotional reactions to even early sexual behavior in differentiating the attitudes and behaviors of individuals. The data also suggest that: 1) persons with a negative emotional response to sex may have difficulty in learning what they need to know about contraception; 2) erotophobic young adults may not accurately anticipate future intercourse preventing them from taking contraceptive precautions in advance; and 3) erotophobia and erotophilia may have general effects on approach or avoidance of sexuality. Some ways to improve adolescent contraception might be through educating for change in erotophobia and erotophilia changing the emotional tone of contraceptive learning acquisition and use and changing beliefs and expectations.",

Unable to find a sexual reflection in popular culture and bombarded with tropes of toxic masculinity I turned my sexual desires inwards. Only with my closest confidant, my partner, did any semblance of sexuality emerge, mediated by images and symbols imbibed as a teenager. My deep desire for connection that extended into sexuality felt ossified and unaired—kept in an air-sealed wrapper, like a vintage toy to be sold in the future or admired on a shelf. The sexuality that emerges from within me doesn't feel constrained and defined by borders or the models used by the dominant culture. It is lush, verdant, warm, damp. It is not a shape defined by others. It is not attached to gender. It is not a taxonomical category to which I ascribe. My sexuality extends from the love that I easily feel towards other bodyminds like mine and the intimacy with which I seek to imbue relations. It need not be segregated and distinct.",

The masters of women wanted more than simple obedience, and they turned the whole force of education to effect their purpose. All women are brought up from the very earliest years in the belief that their ideal of character is the very opposite to that of men; not self-will, and government by self-control, but submission, and yielding to the control of others. All the moralities tell them that it is the duty of women, and all the current sentimentalities that it is their nature, to live for others; to make complete abnegation of themselves, and to have no life but in their affections.—John Stuart Mill, The Subjection of Women.",

Esta dinamica supone la construccion de una serie de valores morales que trastocan y definen areas significativas en la vida de las personas. Sin duda alguna una de las areas de mayor trascendencia y que se ha visto coartada en diferentes aspectos y medidas, es el area de la sexualidad. Es por ello que en los ultimos anos se ha mantenido un continuum de informacion discrepante en cuestion de propaganda sexual e informacion formal sobre el tema, sobre todo de parte de los medios de comunicacion y ultimamente por medio de las redes sociales; naturalizando actitudes poco saludables, separando la afectividad del ambito sexual, y reduciendo esta ultima al mero contacto fisico, eyaculacion, orgasmo y el conocimiento de la composicion fisiologica humana o metodos de anticoncepcion, relegando a un segundo lugar la parte afectiva relacional, y el componente psicologico que se enmarca en la situacion. La repercusion mayor se ha visto en la adolescencia, cuya psique esta en desarrollo y el manejo y discernimiento de dicha informacion les es de dificil comprension debido a la doble via de mensajes que entran a su consciencia; planteandoles una compleja eleccion sobre el que hacer frente a las exigencias del medio y lo que en realidad saben o desean. Igualmente influye el contexto cultural y relacional sobre todo en el caso de la familia cuando no hay apertura para poder preguntar sobre estos temas tan importantes debido a que son considerados tabu. Como resultado los adolescentes terminan introduciendose prematuramente al campo de las relaciones sexo-\r\ncoitales cometiendo diferentes errores, arriesgandose a enfermedades y embarazos, y con ello exponiendose a secuelas psicologicas.",

The term sex may be used to indicate male or female anatomy, the general distinction between male and female genders or between distinctive masculine and feminine behaviors attributed to the two genders, to activities leading to orgasm (8,9) or to penile/vaginal intercourse and reproduction. Sexual and sexuality are used with equal imprecision, referring to the sexual organs, to functions of sexual organs, to sexual drives, or to instincts. Gender, gender identity, and gender roles, on the other hand, have precise definitions derived from recent conceptualizations in psychosexual research. Gender usually indicates the equivalent of male or female anatomic sex. Gender identity refers to one's personally experienced sexual identity, a persistent individual self-awareness of being either male or female without regard to how or with whom one expresses this identity. Gender role involves everything one says or does to indicate his/her gender identity to others (11).",

Female players also discuss fantasy sports as a means of relationship building or strengthening, particularly with friends in their leagues or men in their lives; but our analyses suggest they may trade off social connections, as women who are highly involved in other groups are less likely to use fantasy sports to connect with others. Finally, male players, more so than their female counterparts, indicate fantasy sports participation strains relationships with their partners and families, an effect seemingly attributable to their greater emotional and mental investment in fantasy sports.",

By other accounts, these offenders exhibit pedophilic sexual interests. In this study, phallometrically determined sexual interests, recidivism, and choices of victims of 69 sex offenders with mental retardation are examined and compared with those of 69 sex offenders of average or higher IQ. Consistent with hypotheses, sex offenders with mental retardation exhibit more deviant preferences for prepubertal children, male children, and young children than do the comparison offenders. They are also more likely to have had a prepubertal victim, a prepubertal male victim, and a very young victim. They are no more likely than the comparison offenders to exhibit preferences for extremely coercive sex with children or to exhibit deviant adult activity preferences, nor are they more likely to recidivate violently. Results support the idea that pedophilia is a disorder of neurodevelopment and point to the importance of risk assessments that include assessing sexual preferences among sex offenders with mental retardation.",

Are attachment–sexuality links truly universal across cultures or are some localized to Western populations? Across 10 world regions ( N = 17,837), using multiple indicators of permissive sexuality, we attempted to replicate and extend recent work on these questions. Unrestricted sociosexuality was consistently linked to positive Models of Self in men but much less so among women. Self-reports of having an unfaithful sexual personality were linked to dismissing attachment in both men and women, though additional associations were observed with fearful attachment suggesting infidelity as a form of sexual permissiveness may be more closely associated with negative Models of Other. A measure of short-term mating interests was more strongly linked to dismissing attachment in men than in women. Engaging in short-term mate poaching (i.e., stealing another person’s partner for a brief affair) was linked with low overall attachment security in women but not in men. Many of the revealed associations between attachment and sexuality were relatively small in size, and some appeared to be localized to Westernized cultures.",

      "title": "The Sexual Exploitation of Missing Children: A Research Review.",
      "abstract": "This review based upon empirical research findings examines the prevalence, dynamics, and short- and long-term effects of sexual exploitation of missing children. Three categories of missing children are studied: runaways, the largest group of missing children; victims of parental kidnapping; and victims of family abductions. Between 11 and 23 percent of runaways become involved in prostitution; once involved in prostitution, runaways are more vulnerable to rape and pornography. Runaways at the most risk of engaging in prostitution are those who leave home frequently and longer each time, those with a history of serious sexual abuse, those from dysfunctional families, and males who describe themselves as homosexual or bisexual. There is no evidence that victims of parental abduction are at greater risk of sexual exploitation than children in the general population. Sexual abuse sometimes accompanies nonfamily abductions, but public fears may have exaggerated this connection; when sexual abuse does occur during nonfamily abduction, the effects on these children are probably quite severe and long lasting, with the presence of many symptoms more than 4 years later.",

      "abstract": "Society is acquainted to every individual’s life, even an introvert person makes one or two social contacts to survive. But a major problem of social acceptance is rising in today’s modern world. Everyone in this term, are running behind to match themselves with the society’s status so that they could be easily accepted by them, and if this failed, then it could lead to a problem named as SOCIAL ANXIETY, an anxiety where a person is afraid to be accepted, to stand in front of others, to be judged by others and so on. So, to get more knowledge about this issue, a comparative study has been designed on the sample of 100 individuals of age range (18-25) years with the help of Social Anxiety questionnaire for Adults (SAQ-A-30), and this study had been majorly conducted on the adults so as to examine the Gender differences (male/female) in the issue of suffering from social anxiety. This questionnaire also focuses of 5 sub-dimensions like, Speaking in public/talking with people in authority, Interaction with the opposite sex, Assertive expression of annoyance, disgust, or displeasure, Criticism and embarrassment and interaction with strangers. Therefore, it was studied that individuals are awfully becoming a part of social anxiety which can lead to social phobia.",

Adolescence is a time of important biological, physiological, neurological, behavioural and social transitions towards adulthood. This period of transition is characterised by higher impulsivity, increased sensation-seeking behaviour, higher risk-taking behaviours relating to substance use and/or sexual experimentation, an increased sense of self-awareness/invincibility, and a higher importance of social relationships involving partners and peers rather than parents and older siblings. Not surprisingly, the psychological stressors of going through adolescence, coupled with major hormonal, physiological and identity development and peer pressure (to fit in with dominant peer norms), result in enormous stress levels that sometimes lead to a variety of mental health disorders, e.g. inadequate coping and/or support structures.",

Illegal is punishable by deprivation of liberty to the person who commits them according to the norms indicated in the Integrated Code of Criminal Integral.\r\nArticle 171 of the Integral Criminal Code punishes the crime of rape, indicating that it is the carnal access, with total or partial introduction of the virile member, orally, anal or vaginal; Or the introduction, by vaginal or anal, of objects, fingers or organs other than the virile member, to a person of either sex.

      "abstract": "The concept of intersexuality subsumes a wide variety of phenomena with very specific underlying causes. In all these cases, an untypical development takes place during the prenatal sex differentiation process becoming clinically manifest, either at, or soon after birth or at the time of puberty. It subsumes conditions in which biological sexual characteristics (e.g. chromosomal sex, gonadal sex, hormonal sex, morphological sex) differ from each other and one person cannot easily be assigned to one sex. One of the main goals of medical treatment of persons with intersex-syndroms is the development of a stable gender identity. Over the last few years, sex (and gender) assignment of persons with different forms of intersexuality has become a much discussed topic. An interesting--and very obviously observable--variable that was brought in connection with sex assignment is gender related childhood play behaviour. The purpose of the presented study is to examine 37 persons with different forms of intersexuality (disturbances of androgen biosynthesis, partial and complete androgen insensitivity, gonadal dysgenesis with 46,XY and congenital adrenal hyperplasia with 46,XX) with regard to gender identity and gender role behaviour in childhood. Not all subjects in the study group had developed a clear female or male gender identity. In contrast to previous studies, some persons with CAIS did not recall distinguished female childhood play behaviour and these persons did not show a clear female gender identity. In contrast to results from other studies, the CAH-affected girls in this study did not seem to recall masculinized behaviour. Further research is needed to guarantee better psychosexual development with good quality of life in individuals with intersexuality.",

Students at academic institutions often sexually harass others by calling them “fag, ” “homo, ” “Hey, babe, ” “Hot stuff, ” or “Big stud” or other degrading terms that refer to sexual orientation. Additional types of sexual harassment include students starting or spreading sexual rumors, writing sexual graffiti on bathroom walls, sending crude e-mails or letters, and displaying sexual drawings or pornography. A person in a position of power may request sexual favors in return for a starting position on a college team, a higher grade, or access to a popular club or peer group. Individuals who experience sexual harassment feel fearful, intimidated, manipulated, and overpowered.",

These behaviors are not only maladaptive—they are criminal. But what about other atypical or unusual sexual behaviors that are noncoercive or do not involve children? Certainly, unusual sexual practices find their way into the sex lives of so‐called normal people. For example, normal sexual interactions between consenting adults may include tying one another to the bedpost while making love. Or a man may enjoy sex more when his partner wears lacy panties because he finds it particularly titillating. Are these normal or deviant practices?",

We propose an alternative model which places homosexuality and heterosexuality at one end of a continuum as gender-linked choices of sexual partner, and bisexuality at the other as nongender-specific. As a test of this model, we administered repertory grids to nine bisexual men and women to investigate the characteristics of sexual attraction in individuals for whom gender of partner was not a critical variable. Results supported the hypothesis that gender is not a critical variable in sexual attraction in bisexual individuals. Personality or physical dimensions not related to gender and interaction style were the salient characteristics on which preferred sexual partners were chosen, and there was minimal grid distance between preferred male and preferred female partners. These data support the argument that, for some bisexual individuals, sexual attraction is not gender-linked.",

The stereotypic traits are the male's masculinity and the female's femininity; the cross-stereotypic traits are the female's masculinity and the male's femininity. An average score was computed for both sexes on the stereotypic and cross-stereotypic traits. As predicted, there was an over-all evaluation bias that favored men. In addition, the stereotypic traits for each sex were rated higher than the cross-stereotypic traits. These effects were stable across different rating conditions—whether one or two persons were rated and whether the stimulus person was described as married or no information was given concerning marital status. The implication of these results for sex as a status characteristic was discussed.",

      "abstract": "Motivational drives guide behaviors in animals of different species, including humans. Some of these motivations, like looking for food and water, are crucial for the survival of the individual and hence for the preservation of the species. But there is at least another motivation that is also important for the survival of the species but not for the survival of the individual. Undoubtedly, sexual motivation is important for individuals to find a mate and reproduce, thus ensuring the survival of the species. In species with sexual reproduction, when males find a female in the appropriate hormonal conditions, they will display sexual behavior. However, some healthy males do not mate when they have access to a sexually receptive female, even though they are repeatedly tested. These non-copulating (NC) individuals have been reported in murine, cricetid and ungulates. In humans this sexual orientation is denominated asexuality. Asexual individuals are physically and emotionally healthy men and women without desire for sexual intercourse. Different species have developed a variety of strategies to find a mate and reproduce. Most species of mammals are polygamous; they mate with one or several partners at the same time, as occur in rats, or they can reproduce with different conspecifics throughout their life span. There are also monogamous species that only mate with one partner. One of the most studied socially monogamous species is the Prairie vole. In this species mating or cohabitation for long periods induces the formation of a long-lasting pair bond. Both males and females share the nest, show a preference for their sexual partner, display aggression to other males and females and display parental behavior towards their pups. This broad spectrum of reproductive strategies demonstrates the biological variability of sexual motivation and points out the importance of understanding the neurobiological basis of sexual motivational drives in different species.",

      "title": "‘Where are all the female gamers?’ – Female Gamers and Competitive Gaming in Esports",
      "abstract": "Female gamers have often been routinely marginalised with a lack of acceptance in video game spaces. However, many studies tend to focus on the marginalisation and exclusion of female gamers within private spaces (such as in their own home), rather than their participation in public spaces (such as gaming events). Traditionally, women in public gaming scenes have often been documented as the marginalised girlfriend, or more recently as the hyper-sexualised or sideshow professional player/all female team. This example prompts some worthwhile considerations on access to gaming and game spaces where entry involves a more complex structural arrangement, including networks, gaming know-how and access to technology/games – in particular, in esports (electronic sports - competitive gaming with high stakes). To date, some esports tournaments and organisations have started to consider the gender diversity of video game communities with ‘women only tournaments’ and ‘women gaming spaces’ to normalise the notion of women competing. For example, Smash Sisters is a series of women’s crew battles feature the Super Smash Brothers games, GirlGamer Festivals, WEGS women-only tournaments for specific games (CS:GO and Hearthstone) with smaller prize pools and Badass Women of Hearthstone tournaments. However, there have been continuous debates whether women only tournaments can be justified. This places importance on understanding the attitudes towards female gamers and competitive gaming, as well as encouraging women to compete in video game tournaments on the same platform as men to challenge the gender diversity of video game communities within video gamer culture. There is also of equal importance to understand the attitudes towards male gamers and competitive gaming, as well as encouraging a balance between community and competition for competitive gamers.",

Further, whether feigning orgasm, and motivations for feigning orgasm, is associated with sexual and relationship satisfaction and sexual desire is unknown. Thus, the purpose of the current study was to examine these relationships in a sample of 230 men (18–29 years old) having pretended orgasm with their current relationship partner at least once. Participants were recruited on Amazon Mechanical Turk. On average, participants reported feigning orgasm in approximately one-fourth of sexual encounters in their current sexual relationship, most commonly during vaginal sex. Feigning orgasm for reasons related to a poor sexual experience or to poor partner choice was the strongest predictor; associated with lower levels of desire and sexual and relationship satisfaction. Feigning orgasm to support a partner's emotional well-being was associated with higher levels of desire. Feigning orgasm because one was intoxicated, having undesired sex, or out of a desire to improve the quality of the sexual encounter was associated with higher levels of sexual satisfaction (though these variables accounted for little variance). This research indicates men do feign orgasm, and motivations for doing so are associated with sexual and relational outcomes.",

      "title": "[Sex education and the problem of early sexual relations among adolescents].",
      "abstract": "Puberty today occurs about 2 years earlier than it did at the beginning of the century. The age of menarche is now usually between 11-13 years, while the establishment of spermatogenesis and appearance of the 1st ejaculation usually occurs between 13-15 years. The ages at which adolescents feel mature, want to behave like adults, and initiate sexual activity are now lower than in the past. Sexual relations may occur between adolescents before they are fully capable of recognizing their consequences as autonomous and responsible acts guided by a system of moral convictions. Both marriage and parenthood may have unfavorable consequences for future personality development, sexual adjustment, and the personal-social adaptation of the individual. In Cuba, the persistence of traces of bourgeois mentality can be seen in the tendency to teach young girls false concepts of female behavior. Traits such as submissiveness, passivity, and fragility are stressed, and girls are taught to inhibit their sexuality from a very young age. Adolescent boys are expected to display virility and machismo. Adolescent boys may be so interested in the physical aspects of sexual activity that they deprecate the aspects, considering them to be weak female traits. Boys are more likely to separate the sexual object and the love object, while such duality is unusual in girls. Among the most serious problems of adolescent sexual activity in Cuba is a high rate of abortions among young adolescents. Some adolescents are promiscuous and have frequent changes of partner. The age group 15-19 years has the 3rd highest rate of syphilis and the 2nd highest of gonorrhea. The proportion of births to minors has increased from 22% in 1973 to almost half in some provinces. Divorce rates have been in constant increase in Cuba, and psychosocial immaturity of very young spouses is a principal factor in divorce. The widening temporal gap between attainment of puberty and marriage, which is likely to be postponed until the completion of ever more time-consuming educations, is a factor in increased premarital sex although it is not a determinant of it. An adequate sex education program would help adolescents develop responsible attitudes and good foundations for their future sexual adjustments. It would also help prevent adolescent pregnancy, with its frequent negative consequences.",

      "abstract": "Sex differences in the brain are reflected in behavior and in the risk for neuropsychiatric disorders. The fetal brain develops in the male direction due to a direct effect of testosterone on the developing neurons, or in the female direction due to the absence of such a testosterone surge. Because sexual differentiation of the genitals takes place earlier in intrauterine life than sexual differentiation of the brain, these two processes can be influenced independently of each other. Gender identity (the conviction of belonging to the male or female gender), sexual orientation (heterosexuality, homosexuality, or bisexuality), pedophilia, sex differences in cognition, and the risks for neuropsychiatric disorders are programmed into our brains during early development. There is no proof that postnatal social environment has any crucial effect on gender identity or sexual orientation. Structural and functional sex differences in brain areas, together with changes in sex hormone levels and their receptors in development and adulthood, are closely related to sex differences in behavior and neuropsychiatric disorders. Knowing that such a relationship exists may help bring about sex-specific therapeutic strategies.",

      "abstract": "Recent sexualities scholarship generally frames men as adhering to narratives of sexual assertion and constructions of hegemonic masculinity. However, research on masculinities notes scripts are changing and providing mixed messages regarding the expression of sexualities for heterosexual men. Given this, we look closely at sexual scripts in initiation of sexual intimacy as a means of exploring transformation in sexualities and understanding men’s interpersonal/intrapsychic narratives as expressions of masculinities. Based on in-depth interviews with sixty-nine heterosexual men, ages twenty to fifty-nine, we found that interviewees recounted feelings of readiness and desire for sex as boys and young men. We also found that though, as boys and young men, interviewees felt ready for and desired sex, yet in first experiences, they shared they were anxious and usually waited for partners to initiate or for clear clues partners were ready. Men’s accounts reflect concerns with sexual performance and the incongruence of sexual scripts at the cultural and interpersonal/intrapsychic levels, as well as a private expression of masculinity, reserved for situations with intimate partners.",

      "title": "Sex differences in social play: developmental trends in early childhood",
      "abstract": "Sex differences in play represent one of the largest non-reproductive physical or psychological sex differences and have been widely observed across taxa and cultures. Several aspects of play – including toys and activities, playmates’ sex, and play styles – differ between males and females in various animal species, including humans. In early childhood, boys’ and girls’ play styles are characterized by different behaviors and patterns of social interaction. Girls’ play is assumed to be more social, cooperative, structured and adult oriented than boys’ play. However, there is a notable lack of developmental studies in order to track whether and how sex differences change over time. The present study focuses on age and sex differences in social play by 2- to 6- year old children, when most children begin to experience peer social interactions. Crosssectional observations of social participation of 164 children from 16 classrooms in three French nursery schools were made during outdoor free play periods. The sample, ages ranging from 29 months to 74 months, was divided into four age groups corresponding to nursery school grades, with balanced sex-ratio in each group. Our results showed that, for both sexes, social play increased over time, while solitary play decreased. Although no sex differences were found in social play and interaction with peers, girls were systematically one year ahead of boys, and this induced successive sex differences in associative play, cooperative play and social interactions at some ages. Moreover, boys played solitarily more frequently than girls, especially when young. Finally, time spent interacting with adults also decreased over time for both sexes with no sex differences, even though the youngest girls spent twice as much time with adults as boys. Thus, important changes were found in social and solitary play during early childhood with a developmental gap between girls and boys. Our findings emphasize the need for developmental studies both in humans and animals in order to resolve conflicting results across single snapshot studies.",

Men push for career success, and achieve seniority, or they come to terms with having underachieved. Women’s experience is more complex. Socialisation into femininity is not as clear cut as masculinity and women do not have equivalent expectations of certain success. Women who do succeed in management or the professions are more likely to increase the problems and stress in their lives than if they opt out and the more senior a woman becomes the more she is likely to be stressed at work than a man of equivalent seniority. There are good social reasons why women find the high-flying life difficult, particularly if they are mothers. However, there are additional difficulties for senior women particularly in relation to the management of psychological boundaries between self, social context and in particular their sense of gendered subjectivity. The desire to achieve professionally does not preclude the desire to be feminine, enjoy being a woman and being seen as a woman with a sexual, intellectual and emotional presence that is feminine.",

It was hypothesized that frequent physical aggression toward a partner, in the range of shelter samples, is largely caused by antisocial behavior and mutual couple conflict and, thus, that there would be greater similarity across genders in such behavior than has previously been supposed. It was also predicted that levels of injury and fear would be higher in women but that some men would experience these impacts. Findings indicated similarity across genders both in the prevalence of frequent aggression and in its association with antisocial behavior. Furthermore, such aggression was likely to be bidirectional in couples.

      "title": "Allergy and sports",
      "abstract": "At the beginning of the third millennium, physical exercise is often seen as a kind of panacea (a Greek word meaning \"a cure for every sickness\"): there is no doubt that it induces an increase in an individual's socialization and self-esteem, but it also has positive physiologic and psychologic effects, improving the functioning of the cardiovascular, respiratory, and muscular systems, and leading to modifications in diet. Sports competitions are now an important part of economic, social, and cultural life, and leading athletes represent a model to be imitated by the majority of young people and children. Thus, a large proportion of the young population practice exercise and sports in order to achieve the best results from their bodies. Because allergic illnesses in industrialized countries affect 10–25% of the population (1), it may reasonably be hypothesized that this percentage will be the same for athletes and amateurs of various sporting disciplines. Could it be that a well-trained amateur or a professional athlete faces some problems of a pseudoallergic type when performing physical exercise? Or is it conceivable that an allergic subject can practice sports at the expert level and, indeed, become a champion? These issues will be examined in this review article. The different studies performed so far in this field are not very easily comparable owing to the different modalities of exercise (acute, prolonged, training season, etc.) or different sports (running, cycling, swimming, football, etc.) examined up to now. The methods employed to perform these studies have also been extremely varied: they range from the simple evaluation of leukocyte counts to that of the different lymphocyte subpopulations; from their response to mitogens to the study of cytokine production. Physical exercise can bring about modifications of various immunologic parameters. These studies could be an interesting point of research for that, as well as for the pathogenesis of recognized allergic disorders arising from sports. Various studies have revealed modifications in mononucleate blood cells (2–10). In general, increased levels of all the lymphocyte subclasses have been found during acute exercise, and some authors describe a fall in the CD4/CD8 ratio (11). At the end of the exercise, values fall below normal levels; according to a number of authors (2, 12, 13), both the duration and the suppression of the values depend on the intensity and duration of the exercise itself. The concentration of neutrophils increases during exercise, and continues to increase when exercise has finished (13); their oxidizing activity is reduced (14). Controversial data have been obtained on the activity of natural killer (NK) cells: they can be found to increase during exercise (15), subsequently decreasing at the end of the effort (perhaps following the prostaglandins produced by the activated monocytes [16]), or to be unchanged (17, 18), or to be reduced (19). A meta-analysis of 94 studies evaluating NK cell counts showed that there is a marked increase at the end of exercise (catecholamin-mediated demargination of cells?), whereas the cell count dropped after exercise to less than half of normal levels (20). The production of cytokines appears to increase as a response to acute exercise; proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1, IL-6 [21], and TNF-α) (22) are found at increased values after prolonged exercise (a 20-km run, for instance); increased IL-1β is found in the muscular tissue (23), and increased activity of IL-1 can be noted (24), although other authors (22) have found a suppression of their production 1 h after exercise. It is thought that IL-1 and TNF-α may be responsible for muscular proteolysis, since the injection of these cytokines in animals causes a release of branched chain amino acids from the skeletal muscle (25). As far as B cells are concerned, their modification during physical exercise has not yet been fully clarified; there seems to be a reduced in vitro functionality after the traditional stimuli used in the laboratory, and this is generally reversible (26). No modifications have been found in IgE and its production (27). It is worth noting the finding (28) of a marked decrease of salivary IgA levels in athletes during and after a training season. This could be a predictive marker of infectious risk for athletes (29), and also for allergic patients performing various physical activities. To explain the susceptibility of some elite athletes to infections (especially of the upper respiratory tract) during the competition season, one of the first hypotheses to be proposed is the so-called \"open window\" (5, 30, 31), meaning that between 3 and 72 h after exercise (according to the parameters being measured) there may be an increased risk of clinical events (32). This can be considered an important factor increasing, as we shall see, the risk of exercise-induced asthma. The three principal disorders which correlate allergic diseases with exercise and the practice of sport are the following: exercise-induced asthma (EIA) exercise-induced anaphylaxis (EIAn) exercise-induced urticaria (EIU). EIA (the word asthma comes from the Greek word ασθμα, as Hippocrates denoted breathing with difficulty) was first described around 2000 years ago, probably by Aretaeus of Cappadocia (33, 34). Asthma has recently been defined as a \"chronic inflammatory disease of the respiratory tract in which a number of cells have an important pathogenic role, including mastocytes, eosinophils, and the T lymphocytes. In susceptible individuals this specific inflammation provokes recurring episodes of dyspnoea, a sense of suffocation, thoracic constrictions and coughing, above all during the night and in the early hours of the morning\" (35). Generally, it is divided into \"allergic\" (or extrinsic) and \"nonallergic\" (or intrinsic) (36). The accumulation of eosinophils in the airways, the production of various proinflammatory cytokines leading to the activation of endothelial cells inducing, in turn, adhesion molecules such as ICAM-1, ICAM-2, and ICAM-3 (37), VCAM-1, selectins, and RANTES, leads to a complex inflammatory process which ends with several clinical expressions that depend both on the various stimuli and on individual responses based, for asthmatic subjects, mainly on atopy (38–45). Exercise may trigger asthma attacks. EIA represents the major risk for an allergic patient taking exercise, but, at the same time, exercise can cause serious respiratory problems also in nonasthmatic subjects. About 75–80% of asthmatic subjects out of therapy (38) may experience an asthma attack when practicing physical activity, but in recent years, even in apparently healthy, asymptomatic, and nonallergic subjects, some episodes of EIA have been described. Moreover, EIA is one of the main causes of asthma attacks in young children, often being the first symptom of atopy. The term \"exercise-induced bronchoconstriction\" (EIB) is sometimes (46) used to distinguish a physiologic response to hyperpnea, and to the drying out of the mucous membranes, from a true disease. There is a close link between EIA and sports: it is our task, by means of appropriate therapies, to allow asthmatic athletes to achieve their maximum potential; on the other hand, it has been observed that many endurance athletes, despite being asymptomatic at the beginning of their career, may develop asthma symptoms during the years of athletic activity, particularly when the activity is continued after the age of 28 (47). The symptoms are easily identifiable. They include coughing, dyspnea, thoracic constriction, and wheezing occurring several minutes after physical exertion has stopped (generally 2–10 min, peaking at around 10–15 min); they disappear spontaneously, however, after a period of time varying between 30 and 60 min (38, 48). The bronchospastic crisis (which may be slight or extremely serious, with even fatal consequences) is followed by a 2–3-h period during which renewed exertion generally does not create any kind of problem, or at most very slight symptoms. Regardless of the mechanism which gives rise to exercise-induced asthma (vascular or osmolar hypothesis) (38, 49–53), two factors are essential for EIA to be induced: the first one is the type of physical activity (exercise requiring more hyperventilation induces EIA more easily); the second one is the environment, since EIA is more frequent when the air is cold and dry. Moreover, if the bronchial reactivity is very high, a moderate ventilatory increment is sufficient to induce the symptoms; if bronchial reactivity is moderate (as, for example, in the case of a patient with pollen allergy during the interseasonal period), ventilation has to reach high levels in order to represent an adequate stimulus (54, 55). Allergic subjects are a typical example of this situation: in spring, for example, a notable increase in the number of cases of EIA has been found; this is due both to the inhalation of various pollens, and to an increase in bronchial reactivity owing to the inflammation of the airways observed during that period. The same is true for other seasons with a corresponding increase in other pollens (Ambrosia, Compositae, Parietaria, olive, and others). Individuals who show sensitivity also (or only) to perennial allergens (mites, for example) are those who, because of the chronic basic inflammation of the airways, are usually more subject to episodes of EIA. Recently, new potential hazards for allergic subjects have been described: if diving with compressed-air tanks seems to increase airway hyperresponsiveness (56–60), pollens trapped in a scuba air tank can also induce very dangerous asthma attacks underwater (61, 62). A bronchoprovocation test with physical exercise is essential. After a 5–8-min run (63) under suitable environmental conditions, the test allows the reproduction of the situations which can normally provoke an attack of EIA. By subsequently measuring the parameters of the flow-volume loop (FEV1 in partic-ular) at 5-min intervals up to 30 min, it is possible to determine whether the subject is positive for EIB (54, 55). A subject is considered positive when the FEV1 is reduced by at least 10% (in athletes) or 15% (in sedentary subjects) compared to base values. In the case of a positive outcome of the test, it is essential for the extent of the problem to be evaluated, and therapeutic safeguards put into effect for the patient under examination. EIA has been reported, for instance, in US Olympic Winter Sports athletes (64, 65), affecting about 25% of them, particularly cross-country skiers, and with a prevalence of women over men; in Finnish cross-country skiers also, the percentage was the same, with a prevalence of atopic subjects (66). The same was found for runners (67). Recently, there have been reports that the EIA screening of elite athletes shows remarkable differences between laboratory and field exercise challenges (68). In fact, exercise done during competition induces the symptoms more easily than in laboratory tests. One of the main problems currently confronting allergists is what kind of physical exercise or sport can be suggested for allergic subjects. The main questions are as follows: Can asthmatics practice sports? What kind of sport is suitable for asthmatics? How is an asthma attack to be prevented? How is an asthma attack to be treated? Of course, there is general agreement that asthmatic children not only can but should practice sports. Exercise is beneficial both for the growth and for the psychological status of asthmatic children, who often consider themselves – and are likewise considered by their parents and relatives – as seriously ill persons, incapable of achieving good performance in sports. It is often incorrectly believed by some physicians, too, that an asthmatic is not fit for sports. In fact, there is a long list of world athletes who have been able to reach the highest levels of success (taking part in world championships, the Olympic Games, and so on), despite being asthmatic; some of them have achieved quite brilliant performances. Among them, we may recall Miguel Indurain (69), the famous cyclist, and Kurt Grote (US Olympic Gold Medalist in the 400 m relay swimming in the 1996 Olympics). Another point is that there is a clear difference between power and endurance sports in terms of anaerobic and aerobic performance. It is well known that some sports involve less risk for asthmatic subjects. For instance, swimming is better than running, probably because the reduced gradient of temperature between the inhaled air and the airways decreases the effect of air on the aspecific bronchial reactivity, which is typical of the asthmatic patient. The asthmatic subject today has a whole range of measures to prevent an attack during exercise. Exercise is to be performed when the patient is clinically symptomless, but this status should also correspond to a peak respiratory flow rate (PEF) of ≥80%. The exercising individual should avoid areas and seasons where pollens are at high concentration (e.g., grass fields in springtime or indoor rooms where mites can be present). For instance, a positive skin prick test to such allergens was found in 41% of a group of Australian athletes involved in Olympic sports (70) and in 28% of 118 athletes of the Italian Olympic team (71); thus, elite athletes may often find themselves participating in competitions during already scheduled periods, which in general are not determined on the basis of the pollen season (70). Running, the highest-risk sport for asthmatics – apart from being a discipline per se, with various different events – is also a training method used in almost all sports to increase aerobic capacity. It is possible to observe subjects who do not complain of any symptom while practicing their own discipline, but who manifest symptoms during training runs. Swimming, as previously reported, is commonly suggested for asthma patients: the warm, damp air of the swimming pool avoids the drying-out and cooling of the bronchial mucous membrane which, as we have seen, is the cause of EIB, and ventilatory demands are limited. It is, however, necessary to pay attention to the high levels of chlorine as an aspecific irritant, as well as to the possible presence of mites or mold in the changing rooms and other communal areas. Medium-risk sports are team sports (particularly volleyball and basketball) in which the alternation of aerobic and anaerobic phases, as well as the relatively brief periods of continuous exercise (in any case, usually under 5–8 min), results in a lower risk of broncho-spasm; medium- to low-risk sports are those which do not require high ventilatory levels (fencing and artistic gymnastics, for example, are primarily indicated) (54), but, even in these cases, it is necessary to pay careful attention to the environmental conditions for allergy patients, or to the presence of aspecific irritants. The evaluation of the bronchial hyperreactivity is fundamental: if this proves to be high and not reversible by adequate pharmacologic therapy, even sports such as swimming are inadvisable. On the other hand, if the bronchial hyperreactivity can be prevented or reduced by treatment, even an asthmatic can practice any sport. Considerable restrictions remain, however, for any underwater activity using breathing apparatus, high-altitude sports (hang gliding or mountaineering, for example), and motor sports (54, 55). This topic is apparently not strictly related to allergy, but we will see that the relationships between viral infection, allergy, and sports are closer than they may at first appear. Infections of the respiratory tract by rhinoviruses, but also RSVs, parainfluenza, adenoviruses, influenza, and coronaviruses may exacerbate or induce an asthma attack (72), especially in young children. It has recently been demonstrated that the altered response of the airways during a viral infection probably exhibits the same mechanism as that observed during an asthma attack (73). In allergic subjects, in fact, the infiltration of the inflammatory cells, even at the level of the bronchial lumen, is supported by an increased expression of ICAM-1 (74), and 90% of human rhinovirus variants (HRVs) use this superficial glycoprotein as a receptor (75–78). If we take into consideration the fact that alterations of the immune defenses may occur for those who practice competitive sports, exposing the subject to a higher risk of viral infections, it is clear that asthmatic subjects performing exercise are at risk also from this point of view. There is general agreement that EIA can be prevented by some classes of drugs (79) (some of which are prohibited by current antidoping legislation). Salbutamol, terbutaline, and salmeterol are the only drugs allowed by antidoping laws, and they may be administered only by inhalation and only for the prevention and/or cure of EIA and EIB. The use of the drug must be reported in writing to the appropriate medical authority (80). In addition to the well-known effects of these drugs, they have the advantage of favoring the replacement of water lost during the inhalation of dry air (38). Particularly indicated for children, these drugs (cromolyn and nedocromil), with their short-term action of about 90 min, protect most athletes (even those who are prick-test negative) from EIA if administered beforehand (81). Their activity probably stabilizes the membrane of the mast cells, reducing the release of histamine, leukotrienes, and other mediators. It is well known that the systemic use of corticosteroids is reserved for the most serious cases (III and IV stage, according to GINA). In any case, they are prohibited by the antidoping laws. Conversely, the use of the topical steroids budesonide, fluticasone, flunisolide, and beclomethasone is the standard prolonged treatment of asthmatic subjects, and their use is allowed by the antidoping regulations, provided that the appropriate authorities are notified. The strategic place of leukotrienes in the pathogenesis of asthma has opened new possibilities for EIA treatment. EIA is the only key indication for the leukotriene receptor antagonists (zafirlukast and montelukast), and the drugs can also be administered in combination with β2-agonists and/or cromones. In the case of episodic exertion, β2 stimulants remain the drugs of choice for prevention and treatment, while antileukotrienes are employed when there is regular exertion, particularly in the case of children when exercise cannot be scheduled (82, 83). As far as dope testing is concerned, there are no restrictions (so far) on this class of drugs. For other classes of drugs, such as anticholinergic inhalants and orally administered theophyllines, there are no restrictions. As far as antibiotics are concerned, the only necessary caution concerns the formulation for intramuscular administration, inasmuch as local anesthetics, often used in association, are classed as doping substances. Antihistamines are prohibited only if used in association with β2 stimulants, sedatives, or ephedrine; they are in any case prohibited in the international competitions organized by the trapshooting, archery, and biathlon federations. Some antiasthmatic drugs are often used improperly even by nonasthmatic athletes in order to improve their competitive performance; in fact, some β2 stimulants (clenbuterol) (84) behave like anabolic steroids, and have been used especially by cyclists, bodybuilders, and weight lifters. Nonpharmacologic prevention, on the other hand, is based on the following strategies, which are not always easy to put into practice: Nasal breathing: this aids the warming of inhaled air, and gives rise to lower stimulation of the bronchial mucous membrane. Some authors have advocated the use of nasal dilators to reduce the airflow limitation in the nose and lungs (85, 86). At this point, it is worth remembering that allergic rhinitis, as an important factor which can predispose to or induce asthma, needs to be duly treated, mainly in children, in order to prevent EIA. The use of an anticold mask. The practice of performing warm-up exercises (87) consisting of brief exertions of between 15 and 30s, alternating with rest periods lasting 60–90s. There is, however, a certain percentage of allergic subjects with bronchial asthma able to practice either competitive or noncompetitive physical activities without any apparent problem. A relevant point to remember is that correctly administering allergen-specific immunotherapy (88) to allergic subjects can reduce bronchoreactivity, allowing them to perform better. Not being in a position to avoid pollen seasons (unless they can change hemisphere), asthma patients should avoid zones (such as grass fields) with high concentrations of allergens. A weekly pollen bulletin in many countries helps patients to assess the environmental situation. The Sydney Olympic Games, for example, were held during the southern spring, with consequently high spring pollen concentrations; a warning was announced that numerous pollen-allergic athletes taking part in competitions involving prevalently aerobic activity ran a risk of asthma (70). Another important issue is the close relationship and confidence between the patient and the doctor. There is agreement on the simple rules that have to be followed: Do not underestimate breathing difficulty after exercise, believing it to be simply the consequence of a heavier workload than normal or a normal effect of exercise. Do not underestimate episodes of dry and persistent coughing (more frequent in children after physical exercise), considering it a simple \"irritation\" of the airways. Do not underestimate excessive tiredness or headaches, accompanied by a sense of thoracic constriction and general feeling of malaise, that may arise after exercise: they may in themselves be the only manifestations of exercise-induced asthma in its initial phase. In 1996, of the 699 athletes in the American Olympic squad, 107 (15.3%) had suffered from asthma in previous years, 97 (13.9%) received antiasthma therapies, and 117 (16.7%) took antiasthma drugs or were diagnosed as having bronchial asthma. Numerous asthmatic athletes won medals in their events (89). This demonstrates that, despite preconceptions, it is possible for those with bronchial asthma to compete at the same level as non-asthmatic individuals, both in sports and in everyday life. Anaphylaxis, a name coined in 1902 by Charles Richet (1913 Nobel Prize winner) and his colleague Paul Jules Portier, to describe \"the opposite of protection (phylaxis)\" (90), is the most serious phenomenon in the field of allergology; the form arising from physical exercise is a relatively recent syndrome (first described in 1979) (91, 92). Its clinical manifestations can be extremely varied, ranging from pruritus, erythema, and urticaria to angioedema, gastrointestinal symptoms, laryngeal symptoms, and vascular collapse (93). There are two types of EIAn: postprandial (food-dependent, FDEIAn) non-food-dependent. In the first case, the symptoms may arise a few hours after the consumption of foodstuffs, which thus represent the predisposing factor. The literature includes cases of EIAn following the consumption of a wide variety of foods (94–96). EIAn following the consumption of snails in patients demonstrating cutaneous hypersensitivity to dust mites has also been described (97), the cross-reactivity between aeroallergens and foodstuffs being well known. Although the prognosis for this disease has not been clearly defined, a reduction in attacks has been shown in 45% of subjects upon the elimination of the foodstuff in question. In non-food-dependent EIAn, hyperemia and hyperthermia can, in subjects who have mast-cell instability, provoke an activation of the mast cells and eosinophils with massive and ubiquitous liberation of their mediators (98). Mention should also be made of the so-called aquagenic anaphylaxis (from contact with water), as well as of drug-dependent EIA (99). The diagnosis of EIAn may follow a well-defined protocol, first described by Romano et al. (100). It is important that patients with suspected food-dependent EIAn receive allergologic testing in the form of prick tests with a wide panel of commercial allergens (airborne allergens and food allergens, including seasonal foods) and fresh foods, as well as CAP System RAST. Avoidance of all test-positive foods (or of all meals, for patients whose reaction does not appear to be related to a specific food) for 4 h before exercise seems to prevent further EIAn episodes. Some authors also describe a case in which the EIAn depends mainly on the amount, and not on the type, of allergic food ingested (101). Urticaria, which has been well known since ancient times (described by Hippocrates [460–370bc]), was named by Frank in 1792 (from the Latin name for the stinging nettle Urtica urens). EIU is one of several different kinds of urticaria. These include EIU itself, physical urticaria (or urticaria factitia, or dermographism), and various forms induced by cold or heat, by compression, by exposure to solar rays, by vibrations, and by water, as well as the cholinergic form. The cold-induced form reveals itself in various ways. Among athletes, the most common is the primary acquired form; erythematous-pomphoid lesions develop in areas exposed to the cold, the wheals occurring after a few minutes and persisting for 0.5–1 h (102). Sometimes the pattern can be so serious that it might be related to EIAn, with symptoms leading to shock, especially after a swim. Delayed pressure-induced urticaria is characterized by a deep and painful pomphoid reaction which develops 3–12 h after a pressure stimulus, and which can last up to a day. In general, it affects young subjects in body areas under an increased pressure on the tissue (for example, the feet after a run, the buttocks of a cyclist, the hands of athletes who use their hands in their sports, or even in areas where a particular piece of equipment with belts, straps, or slings leads to an increase in pressure). Solar urticaria may affect all those athletes exposed to solar rays, revealing itself in erythema and wheals within 5 min of exposure to rays of a particular length, and this may vary from person to person (UVA, 320–400 nm; UVB, 290–320 nm; visible light, 400–700 nm). Aquagenic urticaria is a particular form of physical urticaria; it is provoked by simple contact of the cutis with water at body temperature. The lesions, indistinguishable from those of cholinergic urticaria, appear at 2–3 min and 30 min–1 h after contact, and regress after about 30 min (102). Other minor aspects of allergic disorders during sporting activity are related to contact dermatitis caused by different substances or situations. There have been descriptions of dermatitis in swimmers arising from phenol-formaldehyde resin and benzoyl peroxide contained in swimming goggles (103), or from diphenylthiourea or other substances in wet suits (104, 105). There are also reports of the \"sea bather eruption\" (a form of pruritic dermatitis probably due to Cnidaria larvae in Florida, the Caribbean, and Bermuda) (106, 107). Lichenoid photodermatitis in footballers (108) and dermatitis due to formaldehyde resins in athletic tape have been also described (109). The relationship between allergy and exercise has been clearly shown by a number of clinical pictures, ranging from simple dermatitis to potentially fatal anaphylaxis. The mechanisms of EIA, EIB, EIU, and EIAn have been clarified in general terms, and their diagnosis, prevention, and treatment are beginning to be well defined and standardized, mainly thanks to the extraordinarily rapid growth of research in the fields of allergy and immunology. Studies concerning the effects of exercise on the immune system may also yield further data and contributions to studies on allergy and sports. Relevant points to be stressed are that during exercise other important systems are activated: the neurologic (110) and endocrine (111) systems may greatly affect immunoallergic responses, and we should be aware of this aspect when performing studies on athletes in the field and in the laboratory. Nutritional factors (112) (foods, vitamins, amino acids, and integrators) are also of great relevance; this is another sports-related field of research whose effects are generally beneficial, but its relevance to allergy is also important, as we have seen in the case of food allergy, EIAn, and EIU. The number of allergic sportsmen and sportswomen is destined to increase rapidly over the next two decades: this implies that the studies performed so far on allergy and sports, which have been briefly outlined in this review article, need to be better standardized and brought out of the laboratories into the practical field. We are now in possession of a whole range of techniques by which we can measure and individually quantify physical effort, in order to evaluate an athlete's potential, as well as to assess the level of atopy, bronchial reactivity, cell subpopulations, and mediators, all of which allows us to provide allergic subjects with appropriate counseling and correct guidelines for behavior and treatment. In short, we now have the armamentarium to allow us to help our allergic patients to realize their full athletic potential; perhaps, as doctors, some of us will some day have the satisfaction of having helped produce a champion. We thank Professors A. Balestrieri and A. Concu for suggestions and advice; Ms E. Manca, Ms B. Ambrosini, and Ms A. Ghiani for laboratory technical support; Dr M. Scorcu for collaboration in our studies on athletes; and Mr D. J. Webb for English text supervision.",

      "title": "The unmarried adolescent parent.",
      "abstract": "Factors contributing to illegitimate adolescent pregnancies are examined in the hopes of providing a basis for establishing preventative and remedial approaches to the problem. Most of the information comes from previously published material. 7 nonsexual impulses which can be expressed in sexuality often leading to illegitimate pregnancy are 1) feelings of inadequacy; 2) a wish to be loved; 3) a wish to mother; 4) a wish to have a gift for the mother; 5) competition with the mother; 6) a wish to have a baby to identify with; and 7) hostility toward men. Studies indicate that somewhere along the line both the mother and father of an unwed mother have failed. Often the girls feel unloved and are not taught how to deal with and control their emotions. Many come from broken homes and have difficulty relating with other people. They appear to have a strong desire for self-punishment. The unwed mother is not usually promiscuous but her knowledge of sex and contraception often is very limited. A profile of the putative father generally does not reveal a sexual exploiter. Often he is very involved with his partner and willing to marry her. But he is immature and lacking in responsibility. He often does not have a strong masculine identity. Illegitimate pregnancies create social and financial problems to both the mother and the child. Those who give up their babies for adoption were found to be more stable intelligent and mature and to feel the stigma of illegitimacy more strongly. Many unwed mothers eventually marry the putative father; those who dont can pose serious problems related to economic support education child care and health. One way to cut down on the number of illegitimate children is to educate and provide contraceptives for girls who have already had an illegitimate pregnancy since about half of all illegitimate births are to mothers who already have 1 or amore illegitimate children.",

Previous literature has, however, primarily investigated first heterosexual sex, overlooking important contextual factors specific to same-sex/gender sexual experiences. Seventeen in-depth semi-structured interviews were conducted with lesbian, gay, bisexual, and other sexual minority (LGB+) individuals, ages 18-23 years. Four themes emerged from thematic analysis of reported thoughts, affect, and behavior. First, participants reported difficulty defining sex between same-sex/gender partners, especially women who reported that this undermined their personal relationships and identity. Second, participants met partners through several means; however, it was almost exclusively men who reported meeting their first partners online. Third, motivations for first same sex/gender sex included affirmation of personal sexual identity, sexual exploration, social expectation, and spontaneity. Fourth, participants felt underprepared for their first same-sex/gender sex, noting that their earlier sex and relationship education had not included information on same-sex/gender sex or LGB+ identities. Consequently, participants reported relying on experienced partners and seeking information on the internet, including pornography and social media. Greater cultural representation and more comprehensive sex education that recognizes sexual diversity is needed to better prepare LGB+ young people for early sexual encounters.",

The orientations, ideologies, beliefs, and schemas held by a parent regarding his or her gender, or the idea of gender as a whole, become a part of his or her personality. As agents of personality development for a child, including his gender identity, these ideologies held by a parent, as well as that of the other members of the family, play an essential role, which will be discussed in detail. The psychological viewpoints on the development of a person's gender identity, and how behaviors are shaped by the gender gaps that are brought about or play an important role in child rearing, are some of the other subsequent themes that will be looked into in depth. Gender gaps can be exhibited primarily in two ways. Firstly, the gap between the parents (or immediate family members) in terms of their gender, and secondly, the gap is found due to the biological sex of the child and his or her subsequent gender identity.",

      "abstract": "Evolution of male life histories and age-dependent sexual signals under female choiceSexual selection theory models evolution of sexual signals and preferences using simple life histories.However, life-history models predict that males benefit from increasing sexual investment approaching old age, producing age-dependent sexual traits.Age-dependent traits require time and energy to grow, and will not fully mature before individuals enter mating competition.Early evolutionary stages pose several problems for these traits.Agedependent traits suffer from strong viability selection and gain little benefit from mate choice when rare.Few males will grow large traits, and they will rarely encounter choosy females.The evolutionary origins of age-dependent traits therefore remain unclear.I used numerical simulations to analyze evolution of preferences, condition (viability) and traits in an agestructured population.Traits in the model depended on age and condition (\"good genes\") in a population with no genetic drift.I asked (1) if age-dependent indicator traits and their preferences can originate depending on the strength of selection and the size of the trait; (2) which mode of development (age-dependent versus age-independent) eventually predominates when both modes occur in the population; and (3) if age-independent traits can invade a population with age-dependent traits.Age-dependent traits evolve under weaker selection and at smaller sizes than age-independent traits.This result held in isolation and when the types co-occur.Evolution of age-independent traits depends only on trait size, whereas evolution of age-dependent traits depends on both strength of selection and growth rate.Invasion of age-independence into populations with established traits followed a similar pattern with age-dependence predominating at small trait sizes.I suggest that reduced adult mortality facilitates sexual selection by favoring the evolution of age-dependent sexual signals under weak selection.",

      "abstract": "To focus on sexual health issues represents a major challenge for Family Planning Associations in the decade ahead. Some argue that such a focus will divert family planning programs from their original mission and close off sources of funding. These arguments overlook the impossibility of isolating family planning from sexuality. An exclusive emphasis on contraception leads to the medicalization of the public aspect of sexuality and a dismissal of the intense emotions associated with sexual activity. A medical view of sexuality leads, in turn, to an emphasis on changing individual behaviors and blaming couples involved in unplanned pregnancies. An alternative approach is to help people to take control of and enjoy their sexuality, relationships, and fertility. Moreover, the same laws, institutions, and social values that prevent couples from controlling their fertility (through restrictions on abortion, for example) shape internal and external concepts of sexuality. The provision of contraceptives to adolescents is not sufficient in a social context where girls feed shame if they engage in premarital sex and guilty if they refuse and boys are not encouraged to assume co-responsibility for sexual encounters.",

      "abstract": "Camouflaging in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) could be a factor in later diagnosis of individuals without co-occurring intellectual disability, particularly among those assigned female sex at birth. Little research to date has examined how gender identity impacts camouflaging, however. Further, no study has compared groups that differ in diagnostic-timing to directly investigate if later-diagnosed individuals demonstrate elevated camouflaging relative to those receiving an earlier diagnosis. Using the Camouflaging Autistic Traits Questionnaire (CAT-Q) subscales (Assimilation, Compensation, and Masking), we investigated the roles of sex, gender identity (gender diverse vs. cisgender), and diagnostic timing (childhood/adolescent-diagnosed vs. adult-diagnosed), and the interactions of these factors, in ASD adults (N=502; ages 18-49 years). Main effects of sex, gender identity, and diagnostic-timing were revealed. ASD females reported more camouflaging across CAT-Q subscales compared to males. Gender diverse adults reported elevated camouflaging on the Compensation subscale compared to cisgender adults. Adulthood-diagnosed individuals reported elevated Assimilation and Compensation compared to childhood/adolescence-diagnosed individuals. We discuss how the ‘performative’ aspects of camouflaging probed in the Assimilation and Compensation subscales may have particular implications for the intersection of neurodiversity and gender diversity, and for later diagnostic timing.",

      "abstract": "Few studies have examined how groups of individuals enact different patterns of gender relations within and across contexts. In this article, I draw upon nine months of fieldwork and 15 semistructured interviews conducted with eight- to 10-year-old swimmers on a co-ed youth swim team. During focused aspects of swim practice, gender was less salient and structural mechanisms encouraged athletes to interact in ways that illuminated girls’ and boys’ similar athletic abilities, undermining categorical, essentialist, and hierarchical gender beliefs pertaining to athleticism. However, in the swimmers’ unfocused free time, the salience of gender was high and structural mechanisms encouraged swimmers to engage in “borderwork.” In this context, similarities between the genders were obscured and girls and boys instead interacted in ways that affirmed essentialist and categorical—but nonhierarchical—meanings of gender. By paying attention to structural mechanisms and the variable salience of gender, we can thus see the various conditions under which children deploy different patterns of gender relations, and how less oppressive gender relations can potentially “spill over” from one context to the next.",

      "title": "Disgust Toward Sex-Relevant and Sex-Irrelevant Stimuli in Pre-, Early, and Middle Adolescence",
      "abstract": "For prepubertal youth, sexual stimuli elicit disgust and avoidance, yet in adolescence this avoidance shifts to sexual approach. One explanation could be that disgust declines in adolescence. This project examined whether disgust is indeed lower in adolescence compared to preadolescence, and whether this difference across age groups would be restricted to sex-relevant disgust elicitors. We also examined whether the strength of disgust would depend on familiarity between participant and source. To examine disgust responses in youths, two cross-sectional studies (N = 248, ages six to 17 years) were conducted using scenario-based measurements. Disgust was overall higher in early adolescence than in preadolescence and relatively weak when the source of disgust was a familiar person. Specifically, when parents were the source, sex-relevant disgust was higher in the groups of early and middle adolescents than in the group of preadolescents. Sex-relevant disgust elicited by a stranger or best friend, however, was lower in middle than in early adolescence. The latter is consistent with the view that repeated confrontation with disgusting stimuli might attenuate disgust, which could contribute to healthy sexual functioning. The heightened sex-relevant disgust in middle adolescents when parents were the source might reflect a functional avoidance mechanism of inappropriate sex mates.",

The author advances an integrative theoretical model of gender development that bridges complementary theories by linking sex-related dispositions and physical characteristics to the process of assimilation within same-gender peer groups. Research suggests some (but not all) children have strong behavioral dispositions (temperaments and intense interests) and physical characteristics that are either highly compatible or highly contradictory with culturally valued in-group prototypes (e.g., boys strongly inclined toward physical activities vs. dress-up play, respectively). These children may either become same-gender role models or disidentify with the gender in-group, respectively. In contrast, children without strong dispositions may be most amenable to developing a broad repertoire of interests when provided opportunities and encouragement. Implications of this model for the development and well-being of children as well as future directions for research are discussed.",

      "title": "Sex Differences in Sexual Motivation in Humans and Other Mammals: The Role of Conscious and Unconscious Processes",
      "abstract": "In self-report questionnaires, men report higher scores than women on variables such as desire for sex, frequency of sexual thoughts, number of sex partners, etc. Based on this, men are considered to have a higher level of sexual motivation than women. However, retrospective self-reports may be unsuitable for estimations of the inherent level of sexual motivation. We review data on automatic (unconsciously controlled) responses and measures of implicit motivation during exposure to sexual stimuli. These responses and measures are inaccessible to willful manipulations and make it possible to determine whether the sex difference in answers to questionnaires is replicated when volitional response manipulations are unlikely. We complement the human data with observations from some rodent and non-human primate species. The attentional resources allotted to stimuli with sexual relevance as well as genital responses to such stimuli are similar in men and women. Measures of implicit motivation also fail to detect any sex difference. Finally, the frequency of masturbation is superior in female infants before the age at which social expectations begin to determine behavior. Neither in rodents nor in non-human primates is there any clear-cut evidence for sex differences in motivation. It seems that males and females are similar with regard to the intensity of sexual motivation. The responses to questionnaires may be affected by social learning of sexual scripts and/or the inferior quality of sexual experiences in women, among other things.",

      "title": "Let’s Say Gay: Dissecting the Role of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development in Extending Bostock Protections to the Fair Housing Act",
      "abstract": "This paper analyzes the role of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) in protecting LGBTQ+ Americans from gender identity and sexual orientation discrimination under the Fair Housing Act (FHA). The FHA prohibits discrimination in the renting and selling of units based on “race, color, religion, sex, familial status, or national origin.” Thus, the current protections do not explicitly extend to sexual orientation or gender identity. In 2020, the Supreme Court handed down the groundbreaking Bostock v. Clayton County decision which determined that Title VII’s sex discrimination prohibition encompassed sexual orientation and gender identity. In this decision, the Court used a but-for test and found “it is impossible to discriminate against a person for being homosexual or transgender without discriminating against that individual based on sex.” The court reasoned that discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity discriminates against “traits or actions it would not have questioned in members of a different sex.” Therefore, “homosexuality and transgender status are inextricably bound up with sex . . . . because to discriminate on these grounds requires an employer to intentionally treat individual employees differently because of their sex.” President Biden later signed an executive order on his first day in office calling for agencies to adopt policies preventing discrimination against LGBTQ+ people. In response, HUD issued a memorandum extending Bostock’s protections against LGBTQ+ discrimination to the FHA’s sex discrimination prohibition. Other federal agencies have followed suit, but have been challenged in federal courts on extending protections for sexual orientation and gender identity for their relevant areas of law without an explicit Supreme Court ruling. For example, the U.S. Department of Education (DOEd) issued a notice of interpretation extending Bostock’s sex discrimination protections to Title IX of the Educational Amendments of 1972 (Title IX). In response, twenty states filed a lawsuit against DOEd and obtained a preliminary injunction barring DOEd’s enforcement of Title IX’s sexual orientation and gender identity protections in those states. This paper explores the pros and cons of relying on agency action to prohibit discrimination against LGBTQ+ individuals in civil rights statutes, focusing particularly on the FHA. Part I highlights the disproportionate rates of homelessness and housing issues that LGBTQ+ people experience in America. This part also explores the wave of anti-LGBTQ+ legislation sweeping state legislatures and the lawsuits states have filed against federal agencies that have extended Bostock protections to their applicable civil rights statutes. Part II discusses the importance of explicit housing protections as well as the status of federal litigation on the issue. Part III discusses the pros and cons of different branches’ roles and the dangers of relying on agency action alone to establish protections for marginalized groups. Part IV explores the feasibility of the recommendation to utilize Congress as the driving force for securing LGBTQ+ protections in the FHA. I ultimately argue that while HUD’s extension of Bostock to the FHA is commendable, it risks repeal by future presidential administrations and court challenges. Instead, Congress is the ideal forum to explicitly enshrine these protections in the FHA to lessen such fluctuation concerns.",

Otras necesidades, como la de intimidad y riqueza emocional, o la reactivacion de los deseos de lazos mas cercanos con la madre, pueden hacerse dominantes y expresarse sexualmente. Previamente, pueden haberse abandonado las opciones mas convencionales, especialmente tras el nacimiento de los hijos. Para algunas mujeres, una relacion homosexual anterior es reemplazada temporal o permanentemente por otra heterosexual. Esto puede representar una autorizacion para desplazarse fuera del mundo de las mujeres, o un deseo de crear una familia y tener hijos.

However, most knowledge about such desires comes from forensic samples, and most studies fail to assess preferred sexual activity and sexual partner. A new multimodal assessment of sexual desire was used to investigate interest in consensual and nonconsensual sex with adults and children in an online sample of men sexually attracted to children (n = 101). Desires were compared across history of sex offending behavior and preferred gender of child victim. Men who have and have not acted on their sexual attractions to children reported similar levels of sexual desire. Men primarily attracted to girls reported greater desire for sex with adults than did men primarily attracted to boys. Results highlight the heterogeneity of men sexually attracted to children as well as possible distinctions across gender of children to whom they are primarily attracted.",

      "abstract": "The issue of body and embodiment bears strong roots in feminist theories, philosophy, gender studies, women’s studies and men’s studies. According to some previous publications, the impact of patriarchal power structures and hegemonic (heterosexual) masculinity on gender roles, sexuality, and the (social) position of women and minorities can also be construed in connection with (body) perception and embodiment.The experience of one's “sex” as a purely biological phenomenon is influenced by norms and values of parents, relatives and institutional systems from a very young age, and is thus exposed to the effects of the social and cultural environment. Contrasting the experience of manhood and womanhood, masculine (activity, aggression, resilience) and feminine (passivity, fragility) attributes, male (strong) and female (delicate) bodies is an important tool in creating, justifying, and maintaining gender dichotomies and power relations. Some previous studies on the body and the embodiment of gender also highlight that queer culture, transsexuality, and other marginalized groups (ethnic minorities, people with disabilities) questions the legitimacy of this gender binarity.The aim of the present study is to investigate the presence of embodiment theory in gender studies.",

      "title": "“Broad” Impact: Perceptions of Sex/Gender-Related Psychology Journals",
      "abstract": "Because men are overrepresented within positions of power, men are perceived as the default in academia (androcentrism). Androcentric bias emerges whereby research by men and/or dominated by men is perceived as higher quality and gains more attention. We examined if these androcentric biases materialize within fields that study bias (psychology). How do individuals in close contact with psychology view psychology research outlets (i.e., journals) with titles including the words women, gender, sex, or feminism (sex/gender-related) or contain the words men or masculinity (men-related; Study 1) versus psychology journals that publish other-specialized research, and do these perceptions differ in the general public? While the men-related journal was less meritorious than its other-specialty journal, evidence emerged supporting androcentric bias such that the men-related journal was more favorable than the other sex/gender-related journals (Study 1). Further, undergraduate men taking psychology classes rated sex/gender-related versus other-specialty journals as less favorable, were less likely to recommend subscription (Studies 1–2), and rated the journals as lower quality (Study 2 only). Low endorsement of feminist ideology was associated with less support for sex/gender-related journals versus matched other-specialty journals (Studies 1–2). Decreased subscription recommendations for sex/gender-related journals (and the men-related journal) were mediated by decreased favorability and quality beliefs, especially for men (for the sex/gender-related journals) and those low in feminist ideology (Studies 1–2). However, we found possible androcentric-interest within the public sphere. The public reach of articles (as determined by Altmetrics) published in sex/gender-related was greater than other-specialty journals (Study 3). The consequences of these differential perceptions for students versus the public and the impact on women’s advancement in social science and psychological science are discussed.",

      "abstract": "Sexual motivation strongly influences our mate choices and dating behaviors and can be triggered by merely viewing sexually arousing visual images, such as erotic pictures and movies. Previous studies suggested that men, more than women, tend to search for sexual cues that signal promiscuity in short-term mates. However, it remains to be tested whether the sex differences in the motivation to view sexual cues can be observed by using robust and well-controlled behavioral measures. To this end, we employed a pay-per-view key-pressing task. Japanese self-identified heterosexual male and female participants viewed images of men, women, or couples with two levels of sexual arousal (sexual vs. less sexual). Participants could alter the viewing time of a presented image according to their willingness to keep viewing it. The male participants were eager to view the sexual female images the most, whereas the female participants were more strongly motivated to view the less sexual images of couples. Such sex differences may reflect differentiated reproductive strategies between men and women; men’s motivation toward promiscuity and women’s motivation toward long-term relationships.",

      "abstract": "\"A woman's sex life ends with the menopause; Sex is for the young, I'm too old to bother with all that; older people are asexual.\" \"Later life sexuality in women is about words, images, ritual and fantasy as it is about the body\" Sexuality in older adults especially the sexual behavior of older women has been shrouded in discreet silence distaste and ignorance (Oppenheimer 2002).1 Recent literature however has demythologised sexuality and revealed that men and women continue to be sexually active well into old age. A recent study from US reported in the New England Journal of Medicine (Lindau et al. 2007)2 reports that 73% of those 57-64 age, 53% of those 65-74 years of age and 26% of those 74-85 years of age reported to being sexually active (defined as any mutually voluntary activity with another person that involves sexual contact, whether or not intercourse or orgasm occurs). In all groups, sexual activity for men was higher. It is interesting that 35% of all women and 13% of all men interviewed said \"sex was not at all important\". It is recognized that leading an active and fulfilling sexual life is related to physical health, ability to function sexually, availability of a partner and perceptions of self esteem and body image (Lindau 2007; Clarke 2006).2,3 Overlying all of these is the personal knowledge, attitude and perceptions of the role of sexuality and sexual behaviors in wellbeing. With the 'Baby Boomer' generation coming of age as 'Older Adults', this presentation will explore whether the discourses of positive ageing have created the sexy ageless consumer as a personally and socially responsible citizen. Is the availability and apparent popularity of adult on-line dating for relationships; gyms and health fads for the healthy body; drugs and devices (sex toys such as the Eros clitoral device, and ben-wa balls); cosmetic treatments (Clarke 2006)3 and now surgical procedures for the body beautiful (Goodman et al. 2007)4 indicative of a need for assistance in sexuality?

The model is motivated by three lines of research: intersexual conflict with respect to mating, sensory exploitation, and the evolution of female resistance, as opposed to preference, for male display traits. The model generates unique predictions that permit its operation to be distinguished from other established models of sexual selection. One striking prediction is that females will frequently win the coevolutionary arms race with males, leaving them encumbered with costly ornaments that have little value except that their absence understimulates females. Examples from the literature suggest that the model may have broad application in nature. The chase-away model is a special case of the more general phenomenon of Interlocus Contest Evolution (ICE).",

To begin a history of women’s sports at such a late date has several important distorting effects. Most simply, it ignores both the much longer history of women’s participation in many kinds of sports and the fact that the history of organized men’s sports as presently conventionally understood itself does not date back appreciably farther than the last century and a half. The history of women’s sports is more complicated than a progress narrative. Rather than seeing women being gradually admitted into more and more sports over time, we have to acknowledge that a variety of sports — from wrestling and boxing to polo and baseball — were played by women and were seen as suitable for women over long history. Women’s recent readmission to competition in some of these sports follows an intervening period of exclusion. \r\nMore significantly, to begin the history of women’s sports in the nineteenth century is to begin it in a time period in which men and women were seen, as both a descriptive and a normative matter, to be as different as possible from one another, with men strong and active, women delicate and passive.

In the nineteenth century, however, athletic and other sporting competition often was seen as doubly debilitating to a woman’s chances for heterosexual success: not only would sweating and the development of muscles make her unattractive, but strenuous physical exercise was thought to risk physiologically compromising her reproductive capacity. Rather than seeing physical fitness as conducive to reproductive fitness as had their ancestors, men like Pierre de Coubertin, founder of the modern Olympic movement, saw the two as in tension with each other. \r\nAfter considering the extent to which these competing views of women’s athleticism in relation to heterosexuality influenced the development of women’s sports, the article will conclude by observing the remnants of a heterosexual matrix in twenty-first century sports, from figure skating and synchronized swimming to gymnastics and crew.",

      "abstract": "Adults in the U.S. (undergraduate college students and adults recruited online) read vignettes about a fictional individual seeking to adopt an infant. Based on random assignment, participants read versions in which the prospective adoptive parent described was either an implied male or female and single, married to someone of the opposite sex, or married to someone of the same sex. After reading the vignettes, participants rated their expectations of the prospective parent’s ability to parent and their perceptions of the prospective parent’s personal characteristics. Female participants reported significantly (p &lt; .05) higher expectations of general ability to parent and perceived higher responsibility, greater likeability, and less selfishness. Both sexes endorsed significantly lower anticipation of ability to parent and less responsibility when the prospective parent was designated as single or in a same-sex marriage. Same-sex prospective parents were additionally rated as significantly higher in immorality. Prospective fathers were rated as less likeable than prospective mothers and participants approved less of their plan to adopt. The authors discuss findings as relevant to bias favoring traditional families headed by a man and a woman with the wife taking the lead in the transition to parenthood.",

This study examines the reasons for having sex, the frequency of sex (coitus) per night, sexual practices during the post-partum sex taboo, and beliefs and practices regard- ing homosexuality, masturbation, the use of sexual stimulants and a variety of other sexual behaviors. Thirty-fi ve Aka and twenty-one Ngandu adults who were or had been married were interviewed. For adults 18-45 years of age, the average frequency of sex per night was about three times among the Aka and two times among the Ngandu. Age had no impact on the frequency of sex per night. Aka averaged two days and Ngandu averaged three days between days with sexual activity. Aka and Ngandu cultural models or reasons for having frequent sex emphasized their desire for children rather than pleasure. Homosexuality and masturbation were rare or nonexistent in both groups. Aka men either did not believe in the post-partum taboo or if they had this belief they did not seek out other women during this period; almost all Ngandu men said they believed in the taboo but did not adhere to it and sought out other women. Aka men had the greatest knowledge and most frequent use of plants as sexual stimulants.",

      "title": "An investigation into masculine-atypical behaviour : a study among Moi university students Western Kenya",
      "abstract": "We are presented with a situation in which ‘the male identity is a fragile and tentative thing with no secure anchorage in the contemporary world’ (Brittan, 1989:3). However, empirical evidence surrounding the commonly perceived contemporary crisis of masculinity fails to support any overall crisis of masculinity thesis (Edwards, 2006:16). Instead, the different perceptions of the crisis tend to rest on at least one of the three propositions pointed out by Edwards (2006:17): Firstly; masculinity as a set of values, practices or dispositions may be suffering a crisis in so far as it is being undermined and devalued, or, moreover that masculinity per see is now to a greater or lesser degree equated with a series of negative rather than positive associations and connotations. Secondly; masculinity may be in crisis due to its perceived tendency to implore into femininity, whether through an undermining of any gender role distinctions or through feminization of some forms of masculinity as, for example, in the case of the rise of contemporary consumerist, fashion conscious or sexually uncertain masculinities such as metrosexuality. Thirdly, the crisis of masculinity may relate to the sense that masculinity in terms of the male sex role is itself ipso facto crisis-inducing. In this sense, masculinity is not in crisis, it is crisis. This study was based on the second proposition. In the patriarchal Kenyan society where gender roles are fairly traditional, and the male person perceived superior to the female and male things valued above female things, the aspect of feminization of masculinity is not just new but indeed strange. This investigation was intended to find explanations for the feminizing behaviour by males. The sex role paradigm developed in the 1970s explains acquisition of masculinity through socialization, sex role learning and social control. These mainstream theories of learning gender were explored in the assumption that they form the basis for the contemporary theories, and further, although much had changed with the times, a large part of the society still perceived gender roles from this traditional viewpoint. The masculine crisis theory and the constructionist views of gender constituted the theoretical framework of the study. This was due to the researcher’s acknowledgement that individuals were active participants in the construction of their own gender identity, and that there was likelihood for the individuals to deviate from the social expectations of what masculinity means and should be. As a result they could construct a masculinity that did not reflect normality, hence portraying a crisis. Data relating to the respondents’ perception of and reasons for feminine behaviour among young male adults was gathered from young males, young females, and both male and female parents through questionnaire and interview methods. Information about the home environment of the respondents was also necessary to help explore environmental factors that contribute to gender construction. In addition, observation was…",

      "abstract": "Ethnic jokes represent a widespread phenomenon in everyday life of different nations. Categorising people, even in the form of ethnic jokes, serves various functions, from the simplification of everyday interaction to positive evaluation of one?s own group through negative evaluation of others. The aim of this study is to determine the most frequent stereotypes present in ethnic and/or nationality jokes. The initial sample was drawn via the Internet, and after establishing stratification quotas, 1000 ethnic jokes were selected as a random sample (twenty nations and/or ethnic groups). The method of conceptual content analysis was employed to analyze the data. The results indicate that the common dimensions of stereotypes, regardless of the nation in question, are as follows: 1) intelligence and knowledge; 2) physical appearance and hygiene; 3) sexuality; 4) forbidden behavior and morality. The remaining categories most frequently present in the sample, detailing relation to money and material goods, psychological dysfunctioning and harmful habits/addictions, relation to work, agreeableness, and cowardice, not being proportionally present in the majority of nations, actually represent typical stereotypes of particular nations. The results thereby suggest that the central pivot of ethnic jokes constitute universal characteristics which relate to wider aspects of human functioning, but also the most sensitive aspects of an individual (mental abilities, sexual orientation, tidiness, consumption of harmful substances); in other words, those aspects which make an individual most vulnerable.",

These issues were assessed in 239 Grade 3 students. Scales of eating and weight attitudes and behaviors for this under-studied population were either created or modified from existing instruments. These 8- to 10-year-old children expressed weight, dieting, and physique concerns that reflect Western sociocultural values and preoccupation with body weight and dieting. Sex differences were examined and revealed several but not very reliable distinctions at this young age. These findings appear to be consistent with research on adolescents. The components that may lead to the development of an eating disorder or disregulated-restrained eating in a vulnerable adolescent may be both internalized and expressed at a very early age.",

      "title": "Neurohormonal functioning and sexual orientation: A theory of homosexuality–heterosexuality.",
      "abstract": "Following a historical sketch of attempts to explain homosexuality, we review evidence indicating that the process of determining human sexual orientation is fundamentally the same in all mammals. In this process, four phenotypic dimensions of sexuality develop from two more or less distinct sex genotypes. Studies are reviewed that indicate how phenotypic deviations from these two genotypes (called sexual inversions) can occur. The causes of sexual inversions are categorized as genetic-hormonal, pharmacological, maternal stress, immunological, and social experiential. From this evidence, we propose a theory of how the entire spectrum of human sexual orientation (vs. simply homosexuality) is determined. A consistent preference for sexual relations with one's own sex (homosexuality), the opposite sex (heterosexuality), or varying degrees of ambivalence about the partner's sex (bisexuality) may be called sexual orientation. Homosexuality should not be confused with occasional homosexual experiences. Homosexual experiences are fairly common, especially early in adolescence (Chilman, 1983, p. 18; Kinsey, 1941) or in the absence of alternative sexual outlets (Aldridge, 1983; Groth & Burgess, 1980) and are no more indicative of homosexuality than occasional heterosexual experiences are indicative of heterosexuality. An individual's sexual orientation refers to distinct preferences consistently made after puberty in the presence of clear alternatives, whereas isolated instances of sexual behavior may or may not reflect one's sexual orientation (Gadpaille, 1972, p. 193).",

      "abstract": "Researchers have long been aware of sizeable racial differences in the prevalence and timing of premarital sexual behavior. In a national US sample of youth aged 15-16 blacks are shown about 4 times more likely than whites to report ever having intercourse. Various explanations are hypothesized: a demographic composotion explanation that stresses differential socioeconomic position; an explanation that focuses on the consequences of low socioeconomic position a higher incidence of female-headed households or differences in school performance or educational aspirations; and a contextual explanation based on differences in subgroup attitudes or norms. Results provide limited support for the demographic composition argument and stronger support for a contextual subgroup explanation. Blacks in predominately black classrooms are much more likely to report ever having intercourse. For whites attending a class that is mostly white lowers the odds of having several sexually active friends. Youths reporting several or more friends having had intercourse are over 3 times more likely to report that they have had intercourse. In racially isolated and mixed classrooms blacks are 18.6 and 2.1 times more likely than whites to expect parenthood to occur before or at the same time as marriage. Perhaps adequate treatment of social context will push us further toward understanding teenage sexual behavior than will more refined analyses of individual characteristics.",

      "title": "Psychosexual stimulation: Sex differences<sup>1</sup>",
      "abstract": "The most extensive material regarding specific sex differences with regard to psychosexual stimulation was up to now presented by Kinsey et al. (1953). Their results, which were derived from questionnaires, show the following trends: 1. Men more often than women were stimulated through isolated stimuli (naked or clothed persons of the opposite sex, genitals of both the same and of the other sex, and pictures of sexual scenes). 2. Women were aroused by continuous stimuli (commercial moving pictures; literary material, e.g. novels, essays, poetry) practically as often as men. These stimuli must be assumed to be more romantic than sexual in nature. One main difficulty in obtaining unbiased results regarding sex specific differences in psychosexual stimulations consisted in the impossibility to exactly define or control the stimuli. So for example, the answer to the question if one was never, seldom, or often stimulated through literature would depend on what type of literature one had read. The results of Kinsey et al. therefore may reflect less the sex specific differences in psychosexual stimulation as the difference in extent and type of experience with psychosexual stimuli. It could be argued that in Western civilization women have fewer possibilities of obtaining experiences with psychosexual stimuli: Due to the traditional picture of woman as sexually passive, the supply of sexual stimuli is mainly oriented to men. A definition and control of psychosexual stimuli is possible only under experimental conditions. We are aware of twelve relevant experiments where both men and women subjects were examined. Of these twelve experiments, eight do not need to be considered in this connection because no information regarding sex was given (Brehm, 1966; Eliasberg, 1961; Koegler 1965); they were based on too few subjects (Clark, 1950; Hess, 1960); there were only two women and",

      "title": "ABC of sexual health: Sexual problems of disabled patients",
      "abstract": "Almost 4% of the UK population have some form of physical, sensory, or intellectual impairment—almost 2.5 million people. Many of these disabling conditions can produce sexual problems of desire, arousal, orgasm, or sexual pain in men and women. Sexual difficulties may arise from direct trauma to the genital area (due to either accident or disease), damage to the nervous system (such as spinal cord injury), or as an indirect consequence of a non-sexual illness (cancer of any organ may not directly affect sexual abilities but can cause fatigue and reduce the desire or ability to engage in sexual activity). The two main points for consideration are how disabling conditions affect sexual function and behaviour and which sexual difficulties most commonly arise. Women who undergo radical mastectomy or a disfiguring trauma often report concerns about their femininity and self image such as feelings of lowered self worth or the fear that men will find them less attractive. Similarly, young men with erectile dysfunction often avoid meeting potential partners because of their embarrassment over their inability to perform. \"Sexuality\" describes how people express their view of what is sexual. That awareness is the result of all the physical, emotional, intellectual, and social factors that have influenced their development up to that point in their life. Defining sexuality as wider than just physical functionis particularly important for people with disabilities. A person who is not able to use part of his or her body still has an equal right to full sexual expression. ### Key questions in cases of disability Present condition Effect of condition on sexuality",

      "title": "Paternity sharing in insects with female competition for nuptial gifts",
      "abstract": "When males contribute costly investments to offspring (i.e., paternal care or nuptial gifts), they are expected to have high confidence of paternity. While studies of species with exclusive male parental care have provided support for this hypothesis, paternity may be more uncertain in systems where males feed each mate. While mating co-occurs with each oviposition in many male-care systems, allowing control over insemination, mating is separated from egg-laying in nuptial-gift systems so that males typically compete more with rivals for fertilizations. Given the costly gift investment, and long refractory periods that limit male ability to gain fitness from frequent copulations, there should be strong selection to avoid cuckoldry, especially complete paternity failure. Further, because females are expected to mate frequently to obtain male-supplied nutrition prior to oviposition, males may be unable to avoid sperm competition because virgins will be rare (and lower quality), and females are expected to undermine male traits that limit remating or manipulate sperm stores. Thus, paternity sharing, in which males are not excluded from siring offspring completely, is an expected outcome of sperm competition in these systems. Using wild-caught females in two species (an orthopteran and a dipteran), in which sexually selected females compete for important male nuptial gifts, we examined paternity patterns and compared them to findings in other insects. Using microsatellite analysis of offspring and sperm stores, we found evidence of shared paternity in both study species, where very few males failed to sire offspring. Although paternity was not equal among sires, our estimates of paternity bias were similar to other insects with valuable nuptial gifts and contrasted with patterns in gryllid crickets where males supply little more than sperm and are frequently excluded from siring offspring. Further support for paternity-sharing is the lack of last-male sperm precedence in either of our study species.",

      "title": "Historical Views of Homosexuality: Ancient Greece",
      "abstract": "Ancient Greece featured at least five different varieties of same-sex relations: (a) pederastic relations, typically between adolescent boys and adult men who were not yet married; (b) relations between male youths of approximately the same age; less frequently (c) homosexual relations between fully adult men; (d) age-differentiated relations between females; and (e) relations between adult females. The origins of pederasty appear to be related to the relatively late age of marriage for males, which evolved as a response to needs to limit population growth in the scarcity-driven economy of the 7th century <sc>bce</sc>. The contexts of pederastic socialization (athletics, military comradeship, hunting, cockfighting, and intellectual/musical performance at elite symposia) point toward masculinizing pedagogy and mentorship as key social functions. However, social attitudes toward pederasty were not uniform throughout all Greek city-states in all periods. Evidence from several domains suggests that as Athens became more democratic and saw greater distribution of prosperity throughout all social classes, the age of male marriage declined; larger families became socially desirable, while non-procreative alternatives to marital sexuality became less fashionable and even morally dubious. What had always been characterized as an elite habitus during the archaic period and first half of the 5th century no longer seemed at home in a political system where appeal to the common man defined success and popularity. Some philosophical texts from the 4th century <sc>bce</sc> characterize physical sex between males as <italic>para physin</italic> (“beyond nature”), whereas others recognize the possibility that it is determined through natural processes grounded in anatomy or spiritual heredity. Of most interest for modern politics is the question of what Greek historical evidence can tell us about the ability of adolescent boys to consent to intimate relations with adult men. Modern jurisprudence, especially in the United States, assumes a universal inability to provide informed consent until well after the onset of puberty, and even voluntary relations between adolescent boys and men are heavily sanctioned in the criminal justice system. Although classical Athens featured a robust tradition of criticizing pederasty for a number of reasons, the notion that pre-adult sex with an older partner was psychologically harmful to boys was not among them. The Greeks viewed adolescent (and even younger) boys as inherently sexual, and the widespread practice of nudity in athletic exercise and daily life conditioned Greek boys to a greater degree of frankness and physical disinhibition. Both iconographical and textual evidence show that Greek adolescents were quite capable of rejecting adult suitors or discontinuing relationships that no longer pleased them.",

      "abstract": "고대 올림피아경기(BC776-AD393)는 남성만 참가한 남성의 경기로서 남성의 전유물이었다. 여성에게는 참관 (參觀)조차 허락되지 않았다. 하지만 여성스포츠는 20세기에 이르러 본격적으로 시작되었다. 그리고 남성경기와 여성경 기로 분화되었다. 남녀 혼성경기종목 제외하면, 엄격히 남녀 구분의 경기를 진행하고 있다. 이러한 남녀구분에 따른 스포 츠경기는 결국 여성스포츠 경기에 남성의 참가를 금지하는 의미는 물론 여성을 보호하려는 것이다. 만약 남성선수가 여성 으로 분장하여 여성스포츠에 참가하게 된다면 스포츠의 공정성과 객관성을 해치게 된다. 따라서 어떠한 경우에도 여성스 포츠에 남성의 참가는 금지된다. 그러나 여성스포츠는 처음부터 여성이 아닌 남성이 참가한다는 의혹과 함께 남성과 같은 체격과 근력을 가진 여성선수의 참가로 인해 공정성에 관한 문제(의혹)가 제기되고 있다. 이를 방지하고자 스포츠 단체는 여성을 판별하는 방법과 기준을 마련하여 오고 있다. 이러한 판별(性別검사) 과정에서 여성스포츠 선수의 인권침해가 발생하고 또한 월등한 경기력을 가진 여성선수를 차별(배타)하는 문제가 발생하고 있다. 따라서 이 연구는 여성스포츠에 서의 性판별검사 방법과 기준의 문제점과 함께 여성스포츠의 性 차이와 차별에 관한 담론이다.",

      "title": "“Kids and Girls”: Parents convey a male default in child-directed speech",
      "abstract": "Adults tend to view men (more so than women) as default people , with numerous real-world consequences for gender equity. In the United States, the tendency to center men in concepts of people develops across middle childhood, yet the specific mechanisms that contribute to it remain unknown. Here, we investigate one subtle but potentially powerful social mechanism: the category labels that parents use to describe boys/men and girls/women in conversations with their children. Across two studies ( N = 822 parent–child dyads, predominantly from the United States), parents used gender-neutral labels like “kid” or “person” more often to describe boys/men than girls/women and, conversely, used gender-specific labels (e.g., “girl”) more often to describe girls/women than boys/men. These patterns emerged when parents were shown gender-stereotypical girls/women and boys/men (e.g., a girl painting her nails, a boy digging for worms); when parents viewed counterstereotypical stimuli (e.g., a boy painting his nails, a girl digging for worms), the patterns reversed. Our findings illuminate parents’ category label usage as a critical social mechanism that may undergird the development of a male default in a US cultural context, informing efforts to intervene on this process.",

      "title": ",,,Appropriating Women’s Thoughts: The Admissibility of Sexual Fantasies and Dreams Under the Consent Exception to Rape Shield Laws",
      "abstract": "Federal Rule of Evidence 412 prohibits the admission of evidence of the victim’s prior sexual behavior and sexual predisposition. There are, however, exceptions to the general prohibition. Significantly, evidence of the victim’s sexual behavior with the defendant may still be admissible if the defendant claims consent. And, in the context of a consent defense, not only is the victim’s physical conduct with the defendant potentially admissible, but so are her voiced sexual fantasies or dreams involving the defendant. Thus, woman’s thoughts, imagined or even unconscious, may be appropriated as evidence of consent under current rape shield laws. \r\n\r\nThe same rationale that was the foundation for the chastity requirement under traditional rape law also applies to the admissibility of women’s sexual fantasies and dreams under the consent exception—women who express sexual fantasies act outside social norms, have deficient character, and therefore such evidence is relevant to consent. Yet, sexual fantasies and dreams, based on imagined or even unconscious thoughts, do not make the fact of consent more or less likely. And, even though such evidence is not relevant to consent, courts have admitted it. This Article examines the admissibility of women’s sexual fantasies and dreams under the consent exception, traces its origins, highlights its application, argues that sexual fantasies and dreams should be excluded, and proposes a practical solution to address this problem.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT. Sexual abuse is an aspect of cruelty to children which merits greater scientific attention. It has potential for damaging the mental health of the victim and intergenerational cycles of this behaviour pattern may develop. The paediatrician is in a position to detect children at risk and may be able to intervene. Three types of sexual abuse are described (i) single sexual attacks which may be accompanied by physical violence: (ii) sexual exploitation of children for financial gain, and (iii) longstanding sexual relationships, generally between girls and father figures; these are far the most common. Although it is hard to separate the effects of premature sexual experience from other adverse environmental influences. the child victim of longstanding sexual abuse emerges immature, with considerable confusion as to her role in the family, and with constricted personality development. Her primary motivation is attention seeking, and she adopts sexual activity with an adult as a means of survival in often deplorable conditions. The sensitivity of management following the assault being made public is an important factor in determining eventual adjustment.",

      "abstract": "As players craft and enact embodiment in digital games, the relationship between social interaction and gender (male/female) versus gender-role identity (masculinity/femininity) remains unclear. This paper examines differences in chat, avatar movement, and avatar appearance among male players who played male and female avatars. Initial analysis reveals that gender-based playstyles are distinct from gender role-based playstyles. Most importantly, men playing female avatars retain patterns typical of male players; however they depart from patterns typical of high-masculinity players. Specifically, gender-switching males tended to reject masculine behaviors in favor of flirting, using more punctuation, and deferring physical leadership. We interpret this to mean that male gender-switchers do not shed male behaviors and, instead of performing normatively feminine behaviors, work to counteract masculine behaviors – they try to act “not-masculine.” These findings have implications for gameplay scholarship where offline gender is unknown and for integrating gender roles as key to studying gender in games.",

Couples (N =115) completed a 21-day daily diary indicating whether a partner made a sexual advance each day, and if so, whether the advance was accepted or rejected. Having one’s sexual advance accepted was associated with increased sexual and relationship satisfaction that day, and increased sexual satisfaction up to 24 hours later.

      "title": "Graded Structure in Sexual Definitions: Categorizations of Having “Had Sex” and Virginity Loss Among Homosexual and Heterosexual Men and Women",
      "abstract": "Definitions of sexual behavior display a robust hierarchy of agreement regarding whether or not acts should be classed as, for example, sex or virginity loss. The current research offers a theoretical explanation for this hierarchy, proposing that sexual definitions display graded categorical structure, arising from goodness of membership judgments. Moderation of this graded structure is also predicted, with the focus here on how sexual orientation identity affects sexual definitions. A total of 300 18- to 30-year-old participants completed an online survey, rating 18 behaviors for how far each constitutes having \"had sex\" and virginity loss. Participants fell into one of four groups: heterosexual male or female, gay male or lesbian. The predicted ratings hierarchy emerged, in which bidirectional genital acts were rated significantly higher than unidirectional or nonpenetrative contact, which was in turn rated significantly higher than acts involving no genital contact. Moderation of graded structure was also in line with predictions. Compared to the other groups, the lesbian group significantly upgraded ratings of genital contact that was either unidirectional or nonpenetrative. There was also evidence of upgrading by the gay male sample of anal intercourse ratings. These effects are theorized to reflect group-level variation in experience, contextual perspective, and identity-management. The implications of the findings in relation to previous research are discussed. It is suggested that a graded structure approach can greatly benefit future research into sexual definitions, by permitting variable definitions to be predicted and explained, rather than merely identified.",

This study aimed to assess the prevalence of both positive and negative comments about sexual orientation and gender identity during online gaming, and to test the hypothesis that LGBTQ+ people witness or experience more prejudice than do heterosexual and cisgender persons. An online survey, distributed on social media sites and a psychology subject pool, included rating scales and open-ended questions on game-related conversations. Respondents ( N = 185) provided negative examples made by others more frequently than positive ones and attributed serious comments to themselves versus jokes and offhand comments to others. Across all respondent gender identities, the targets of the negative comments by others were almost always LGBTQ+ persons. These results bolster critiques of online gaming environments as hostile to members of marginalized groups.",

      "title": "Parental styles and aggressive beliefs. The mediating role of affects.",
      "abstract": "Parenting stiles (authoritative, democratic, permissive and neglectful) play a key role in personal development and can be related to aggressive beliefs and affects in the individual. In order to examine this relationship, 769 subjects (359 men; 46.68%), with an average age of 21.89 years, SD = 2.65, were assessed in terms of parenting styles, aggressive beliefs and affects; the mediating role of affects in the relationship between aggressive beliefs and parenting styles was also explored. The study revealed that these constructs are interrelated. The democratic parenting style was found to be the most widespread. In terms of gender, authoritative styles were used more often on men than on women, among which the permissive style was the most common. No significant gender differences were found concerning democratic and neglectful parenting styles. Women were revealed to be more exposed to negative affects, and aggressive beliefs were found to be more prevalent in men. Children educated according to a democratic style scored higher in positive affects and lower in aggressive beliefs. Authoritative styles tend to lead to above-average scores in positive affects and aggressive beliefs. In addition, one in five people educated according to a permissive style returns a high negative affect score, and one in four people educated according to a neglectful style yields high scores in aggressive beliefs. Finally, parenting styles were found to have a direct effect on aggressive beliefs, an effect enhanced by the mediating role played by affects. In conclusion, the study suggests that parenting styles are related to aggressive beliefs and affects. In addition, affects were shown to play a mediating role in the relationship between parenting styles and aggressive beliefs. Finally, it is worth emphasising that, owing to the far-reaching implications of parenting styles on the psychological, social and personal development of the individual, more research needs to be undertaken, not only to examine their relationship with affects and aggressive beliefs, but also with other psychological variables involved in personal development. Los estilos de crianza (autoritario, democrático, permisivo y negligente) juegan un papel clave en el desarrollo personal y pueden estar relacionados con creencias y afectos agresivos en el individuo. Para examinar esta relación, 769 sujetos (359 hombres; 46.68%), con una edad promedio de 21.89 años, DT= 2.65, fueron evaluados en términos de estilos de crianza, creencias agresivas y afectos; También se exploró el papel mediador de los afectos en la relación entre creencias agresivas y estilos de crianza. El estudio reveló que estos constructos están interrelacionados. Se encontró que el estilo de crianza democrático era el más extendido. En términos de género, los estilos autoritativos se utilizaron con mayor frecuencia en hombres que en mujeres, entre los cuales el estilo permisivo fue el más común. No se encontraron diferencias de género significativas en cuanto a los estilos de crianza democráticos y negligentes. Se reveló que las mujeres estaban más expuestas a los afectos negativos y que las creencias agresivas eran más prevalentes en los hombres. Los niños educados según un estilo democrático obtuvieron puntuaciones más altas en afectos positivos y más bajas en creencias agresivas. Los estilos autoritativos tienden a conducir a puntuaciones superiores a la media en afectos positivos y creencias agresivas. Además, una de cada cinco personas educadas según un estilo permisivo obtiene una puntuación alta en afecto negativo, y una de cada cuatro personas educadas según un estilo negligente obtiene puntuaciones altas en creencias agresivas. Finalmente, se descubrió que los estilos de crianza tienen un efecto directo sobre las creencias agresivas, efecto potenciado por el papel mediador que desempeñan los afectos. En conclusión, el estudio sugiere que los estilos de crianza están relacionados con creencias y afectos agresivos. Además, se demostró que los afectos desempeñan un papel mediador en la relación entre los estilos de crianza y las creencias agresivas. Finalmente, vale la pena enfatizar que, debido a las implicaciones de gran alcance que los estilos de crianza tienen en el desarrollo psicológico, social y personal del individuo, es necesario realizar más investigaciones, no sólo para examinar su relación con los afectos y las creencias agresivas, sino también también con otras variables psicológicas implicadas en el desarrollo personal.",

Populationen for denna granskning ar ett representativt urval av befolkningen i Malmo, Sveriges tredje storsta stad. Studien drivs framst av tva teoretiska inriktningar.

Metoden som anvants for att undersoka befolkningsmajoritetens attityder ar “mixed methods”. Den kvantitativa enkatstudien foljs upp med kvalitativa intervjuer till en del av de svarande. Studien visar att aven om det finns variationer i val av preferenser beroende pa\r\nvilken grupp det handlar om, kan majoriteten av respondenterna i enkaten och intervjupersonerna tanka sig att leva i blandaktenskap eller i annan blandrelation.

Yet, few studies have examined whether gender and race/ethnicity interact to predict institutional discrimination and racial microaggressions through an intersectional approach.A predominantly female (60%), ethnoracial minority (20.8% Black, 31.6% Asian, 30.8% Latina/o, 8.2% White, 6.6% Middle Eastern) sample of 895 undergraduates attending a minority-serving public university in an urban setting completed self-report measures of sociodemographic characteristics, experiences of racial microaggressions, and institutional discrimination.Significant (p<.05) gender × race/ethnicity interaction effects were found in several institutional discrimination domains: Males reported more police/court discrimination overall, but gender differences in police/court discrimination were less pronounced for non-Black vs. Black students. While males tended to report more institutional discrimination than females, the reverse was true for the Middle Eastern group: Middle Eastern females reported institutional discrimination in more domains and more discrimination getting hired than their male counterparts. There was a significant race/ethnicity × gender interaction effect for environmental microaggressions: White males reported more environmental microaggressions than White females, but gender differences were not found in the overall sample.This study is the first to our knowledge to assess the interactive effects of gender and ethnicity on the type of microaggressions experienced in a diverse sample that includes individuals of Middle Eastern descent. The authors highlight the range of discriminatory events that ethnoracially minoritized undergraduates experience, even at a minority-serving institution.",

      "title": "FEMALE MATE CHOICE IN NONHUMAN MAMMALS",
      "abstract": "Until now definite studies of mate choice have typically focused on non-mammal animal species where short life spans and gestation periods make reproductive success quicker to determine, and in which the females show preferences for clearly defined morphological or behavioural male traits. Mammals, which are invariably larger, have longer life spans and inter-birth intervals and are behaviourally more complex, are less suited to this type of experimentation. However, notwithstanding these difficulties, many studies of mate choice have been conducted on mammals and the current literature reveals that the females of several mammal species do appear to choose their mates, and through this potentially gain important direct and indirect fitness benefits. Here I review this body of work to reveal that the majority of female mammal mate choice studies conducted so far, particularly on large mammals, fail to: 1) determine the actual male phenotypic trait(s) of female preference (which is crucial to identifying male characteristics under sexual selection); 2) take into account other environmental and social factors that may affect female responses to male sexual signals, as well as intrinsic factors such as female hormonal state and breeding status; and 3) quantify the fitness benefits to discriminating females. I go on to give suggestions for future research and emphasise the need for a combination of carefully designed experimental and field studies. Experimental setups allow us to isolate specific male traits from other aspects of the male phenotype, determine female hormonal state and control for other competing male and female mating strategies that may affect female behaviour. Field observations of female mating behaviour can then be conducted to determine whether behavioural responses reported using experimental setups translate to actual copulations in natural conditions, and hence affect the reproductive success of individuals. Only this integrative approach will allow us to gain an appreciation of how inter-sexual selection is generated",

Previous research has found that psychology majors report hearing a variety of such beliefs and stereotypes more often from their fellow students than from their family members. In the current study, psychology majors/minors and non-majors/-minors ( N = 376) reported their frequency of hearing beliefs and stereotypes from friends/fellow students or family members and the extent that they agreed with those items. Majors/minors and non-majors/-minors differed significantly on their agreement with several items, such as psychology being “a dead end field,” “psychology is mostly an easy major,” and that “working with crazy people will make you go crazy.” Compared to majors/minors, non-majors/-minors were more likely to agree with the items. There was no evidence that upper-division majors/minors were less likely to believe or less likely to hear the beliefs and stereotypes than lower-division majors/minors. Students reported hearing many of the items more often from friends/fellow students than family members. We discuss the implications of these results for addressing beliefs about the psychology field and degree in introductory and careers courses.",

Young (age seventeen to twenty-nine), middle aged (age thirty to fifty-nine), and older (age sixty to eighty-five) adults (twenty-one male, forty-one female in each group) rated themselves on Bem Sex Role Inventory items, first describing themselves at age twenty, next at age forty-five, and finally at age seventy. Self-perceived age changes in sex role self concept reported by these three groups of adults produced strikingly similar patterns. In each case, both men and women evidenced high masculine self descriptions related to middle age (projected age forty-five) followed by decreases in masculinity in later life (projected age seventy). Only the projections of middle aged respondents displayed even marginally significant evidence in favor of sex role convergence.",

      "abstract": "This study examines the relational, normative, gender, and age dynamics of adolescent sexting in the USA using open-ended questionnaires. Girls in the study were no more likely than boys to sext; however, they were more likely to experience pressure to do so, particularly from boys. Girls were commonly judged harshly whether they sexted (e.g., “slut”) or not (e.g., “prude”), whereas boys were virtually immune from criticism regardless. Older adolescents described sexting as occurring primarily within the context of flirting, romance, or sex, whereas younger adolescents reported what might be described as “pre-sexting” behaviors, involving the joking exchange of sexually suggestive (but non-nude) photos with platonic friends. Although some adolescents expressed a fear that sexting might lead to reputational damage, the normative climate and desire for approval motivated some to sext regardless. Implications and avenues for future research are offered in the discussion.",

      "abstract": "Teasing is a universal phenomenon that is not confined to a certain nation, age, class, or even level of education. Teasing is mostly a disliked behavior that can be verbal or non-verbal meant to achieve a desired aim of the teaser on the teased target. It has various definitions, objectives and reasons. Teasing is double-edged; it can be innocent or malicious. The sample of this study consisted of 110 undergraduates (53 males and 57 females). It was carried out at five different intervals. It aimed to answer three questions concerning same-sex, cross-sex teasing categories and reactions. The findings of the study revealed that female-same-sex teasing expressions could be categorized under underestimation, criticism, physical appearance, academic competence, clothing, and imitation, whereas male-same-sex expressions could be categorized under underestimation, describing the target as an animal or something bad, physical appearance, relationships, cursing, and rumor. Teasing expressions directed from females to males could be categorized under underestimation, academic competence, and describing the target as an animal or something bad while teasing expressions directed from males to females could be categorized under physical appearance, underestimation, describing the teased target as an animal or something bad, clothing, and academic competence. The reactions of both females and males were the same as their reactions to the first teasing expression were mostly positive, and to the second one were mostly negative. The use of the teasing categories arrived at by the study were attributed to matters of interest among both same-sex and cross-sex. Impact of cultural background, mood, and mixing with others could also play a role in employing a certain teasing category or reaction to a teasing expression.",

      "abstract": "We theorize that sexual arousal by dominance and submission may be connected to a reproduction strategy respecting a reached social dominance rank (a common reproduction strategy in socially living mammals), while the preference for \"bondage\" may be derived from an opportunistic strategy when being unable to compete for hierarchic rank (an alternative reproductive strategy that co-occurs frequently with the above-named main strategy). The answers to questions dealing with hierarchy in character should correlate exclusively with sexual arousal connected to any kind of expression of a hierarchy, but not with bondage.The data were obtained from young adults (157 males and 183 females aged 18-20, with mean 18.4 years) via questionnaires.Seven out of eight questions dealing with hierarchy correlated with sexual arousal by dominance and submission in men (Spearman's r=0.169-0.313; p<0.05 - p<0.001), two questions correlated with sexual arousal by dominance and submission in women (Spearman's r=0.32-0.166, p<0.001, p<0.05). THE MAIN FINDINGS: The questions dealing with hierarchy correlated with sexual arousal by dominance and submission while no answers correlated with bondage, neither in men nor in women.The preference for sexual arousal by dominance and submission may be connected to strategy respecting rank, while the preference for \"bondage\" may be derived from an opportunistic strategy that may be essential for possible partner problems solution. From the evolutionary biology point of view, these patterns of sadomasochistic sex appear as adaptive rather than as pathology.",

La metodologia combina el analisis de la recepcion («focus group») con los datos obtenidos mediante un cuestionario anonimo, destinados a contextualizar los resultados del estudio cualitativo. La ficcion televisiva es el macrogenero preferido por los jovenes, sobre todo por las mujeres. En general, los participantes aprecian la mayor proximidad de la ficcion espanola, propiciadora de los diferentes mecanismos de identificacion/proyeccion activados en los procesos de recepcion, y le reconocen un cierto caracter didactico. La investigacion pone de manifiesto el caracter mas intimista de la recepcion femenina, frente al mayor distanciamiento de un espectador masculino mucho mas inconstante, que asimila la ficcion con el puro entretenimiento. La edad influye principalmente en las diferentes modalidades de recepcion, mientras que apenas se constata la incidencia de la clase social ni del origen de los participantes. Los personajes seguros de si mismos, rebeldes y ambivalentes, interesan mas que el resto. Por el contrario, la estructura del relato y una buena parte de los temas del programa visionado se relegan generalmente al olvido, lo que revela el peso de la memoria selectiva en los procesos de interpretacion y sugiere el caracter limitado de los efectos de la ficcion televisiva.",

      "title": "Misinformation, Misrepresentation, and Misuse of Human Behavioral Genetics Research",
      "abstract": "I INTRODUCTION Behavioral does not describe a single field with a single set of methodological tools, nor does it describe a single explanatory project. Rather, different researchers are interested in answering different questions about the relationship(s) between genes, behaviors, and development, and they use different methodologies to answer their questions. The same diversity holds for human behavioral genetics: different researchers are interested in different questions, and in attempting to answer those questions they use different approaches. At the broadest level, one can distinguish between (1) research into the differences in behaviors between different individuals and (2) research into behaviors shared by (most) individuals. It is obvious that some traits vary between people. Different people tend to act differently--when, for example, someone is said to be shy, it follows that, in general, they act differently at parties than people who are said to be gregarious. It is equally obvious that some traits do not vary much between people--although different people may speak different languages, all normal human adults (unlike other animals) use some complex language and learn that language while growing up. Researchers interested in the differences within a population will focus on the variation within that population. For example, within normal human populations, some people are taller than others, some people score higher on standardized intelligence tests than others, and some are more prone to violent behavior than others. Researchers interested in such differences attempt to discover how these differences are associated with the presence or absence of particular genes or environments. In other words, are particular genes associated with being more (rather than less) prone to violence? Do particular environments in which children grow up result in their being more (rather than less) likely to score highly on intelligence quotient (IQ) tests? More generally, such research focuses on particular differences in the resources used in organismal development. Humans, for example, develop over time from a single fertilized egg to an adult capable of a variety of complex behaviors, behaviors that require a body consisting of an astonishingly complex organization of many different types of cells. The development of any complex organism requires a variety of resources. Some of these resources are genetic (the genetic material inherited from the parents), some are environmental (from the prenatal environment of the mother, to the provision of food, and so forth), and some are hard to classify (the complex subcellular systems that, in conjunction with genes, make proteins, etc.). The outcome of this development is a complex organism that differs from (and, of course, resembles) other organisms in the population in a variety of ways. The goal of research focused on differences is to find ways to associate different phenotypes with differences in how the organisms developed--whether different phenotypes had, for example, different genes or experienced different environments. (1) In these projects, the hope is that researchers will be able to explain how differences in available resources produce different outcomes. More specifically, human behavioral genetics research that is focused on variation in human behavioral tendencies tries to associate different behavioral tendencies with genetic differences. It asks, for instance, if people who are more prone to violent behavior are also more likely to have certain genes, or if people who tend to score highly on standardized intelligence tests also share particular genetic traits. On the other hand, researchers interested in behaviors that do not vary significantly within a population have other goals. In the study of behaviors shared by (most) humans, the purpose is to figure out how particular traits are produced in normal development. …",

Many lesbian and bisexual women with long-term recovery are plagued by such major problems as eating disorders, dissociative disorders, depression, Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, compulsive debting/spending, sexual dysfunction, inability to be intimate, relationship problems, internalized homophobia, sexual identity confusion, and self-harming behaviors. A sense of defilement or stigma is unavoidable in the face of societal disgust and hatred both for those who are alcoholic and for those who are lesbian or gay or bisexual. Gay people who are subjected to the constant, ongoing totalitarian system of societal and familial homophobia intensified by their own personal, internalized homophobia learn to survive this emotional battering by \"numbing out.&quot",

      "title": "The Psychology of Sexual Deviance",
      "abstract": "There is one topic that is guaranteed to polarise any group that discusses it, and that is sex. The perception of what is sexually perverted shifts dependent on who is talking about it. A person’s profession, gender, age, race, proclivities, education and even which century they live in, have all effected the viewpoint on sex and sexual perversions. For example, homosexuality has long been stigmatised as sexually perverted, (and remains so among some portions of society), but psychological and medical professionals no longer consider it pathological. Even the term perversion is controversial. Psychologists generally refer to non-traditional sexual behaviour as sexual deviation or, in cases where the specific object of arousal is unusual, as paraphilia. There are a number of clinically recognised disorders of sexual or paraphiliac function, including fetishism (the object of sexual desire is either an inanimate object or a non-genital part of the human anatomy), voyeurism (the covert viewing of other individuals who are naked, undressing, or engaged in sexual activity) and chronophilia (the primary sexual attraction is to a particular age group). Many of these behaviours are punishable by law. Although rape is not classified as a paraphilia, it is a serious sexual deviance, and perhaps the most highly reviled form of sexual gratification. \r\nThis lecture will explore forms of sexual deviance and sexual violence that come to the attention of forensic psychology, and outline the psychological theories that attempt to explain why some people find sexual gratification in unusual and illegal ways. You may be surprised at the ways in which the law impinges upon sex.",

Four patterns of friendship dissolution were identified: physical separation, new friends replace old, growing to dislike the friend, and interference from dating or marriage. The transition to college resulted in a higher rate of deteriorated friendships than was evident during the high school years, particularly for women. Significant gender differences in patterns of termination were also found: physical separation was more likely to precipitate dissolution in men's friendships, and dating or marriage was more likely to interfere with women's. The results are discussed in terms of how the experiences of the young adult life stage might result in the termination patterns observed.",

Parents reported that misconceptions were common among 3- to 6-year-olds, particularly for reproduction and death. Parents reported a greater reluctance to talk with their children about death and reproduction and also thought their children should learn about these concepts at a later age than other biological concepts. One third of the misconceptions reported by parents occurred at the boundary between different domains, where information from another domain (i.e., physics or psychology) was incorrectly associated with the biological domain. Parents of 5- to 6-year-olds reported fewer misconceptions than parents of 3- to 4-year-olds, suggesting that these misconceptions are open to change and are eventually replaced by accurate biological knowledge.",

Sexual addiction was defined similarly to how the DSM-5 has defined substance use disorders. Following the DSM-5 diagnostic criteria, as well as how Carnes et al. defined sexual addiction, it sometimes appears as though sexual offenders are sex addicts and are therefore not responsible for their sexually abusive behaviour. Sex offenders may have a sexual addiction in addition to being a sexual offender; however the sexual addiction has nothing to do with sexual offending. No different than a sex offender having a substance use disorder- the drugs or alcohol used never cause the offender to rape, rape is a choice the offender makes whether sober or intoxicated. Sexual addiction involves having intense thoughts involving sexual activities and may include engaging in numerous promiscuous sexual encounters and frequent masturbation. However, those sexual encounters are not about forced sex, just about sex. Sexual offenders rape and molest because of thoughts involving the use of physical or psychological use of force to obtain sex and/or because of sexual thoughts involving children or adolescents.",

To provide practice for skills that will be employed in aggressive fighting, rough-and-tumble play would necessarily have to resemble it in some way. Developmental psychologists have been at the forefront of these endeavours, most notably in their attempts to identify precursors of adult aggression/violence in the lives of children and adolescents. Whether the separation between playful and serious aggression that applies to the majority of children also applies to adolescents and adults is only beginning to be investigated. Data on sex differences in rates of participation are also compatible with the practice fighting hypothesis: males need to fight more than females, therefore males need more practice, therefore males engage in more rough-and-tumble play.",

The emotional regulation is a process whereby people seek to redirect the course of their emotions. The selection or avoidance of situations is one of these strategies. Faced with an emotionally intense situation, either negative or positive, and from a subjective assessment, subjects anticipate the likely emotional consequences. This can trigger selection or avoidance strategies. The efficacy of this process is based on a balance between search for wellbeing and avoidance of discomfort, in a way that predominantly the result is emotionally positive. Different studies suggest that older people tend, more than younger people, to de seek of maintenance and a predominance of a positive emotionality. The results obtained in this study show common aspects as regard to selection strategy. However, some differences appear. In youth, others attitudes is a source of negative emotions. In middle-age, family problems and political opinions are source of rage. In older people, everything that refers to the negative aspects of ageing, such as sickness and passivity, is avoided. The avoidance in older people doesn’t imply a scape, but rather neutralization or balance between their social compromise and their emotional equilibrium.",

The current study employs content analysis methodology to examine several attributes of masculinity among major male characters in televised police and detective programs over time. Within a sample of 210 major male characters from 24 top-rated programs airing between the 1950s and the turn of the millennium, the analysis finds some movement across the decades toward more emotional expressiveness and less stoicism, although the latest decade examined, the 1990s, reverses the trend. Levels of physical aggression remained fairly consistent across the decades examined. Characters of color, who were severely underrepresented in the sample across all decades examined, were no more likely to be presented as \"bad guys\" compared to White characters, but did differ in terms of their lesser tendency to be shown in romantic relationships or to express affection.",

      "abstract": "Family is one of the most influential institutions when it comes to the production and reproduction of gender. Yet despite the prevalence of families in which children are not biologically related to parents in the U.S. today, little research has explored the role of the biological connection in parents’ beliefs about children’s gender nonconformity. Using original data collected through an online survey experiment ( N = 712), I examine the extent to which parents’ beliefs toward a biological child or stepchild’s, and son or daughter’s, gender nonconformity differ. After reading a short vignette about a child acting in a gender non‐normative way, respondents were asked a series of questions, ranging from whether they would be upset, supportive, and most importantly, feel accountable to others, that gauged beliefs about the child’s gender nonconformity. Results showed greater upset and heightened accountability for biological children (vs. stepchildren). Results revealed that parents overwhelmingly indicated greater upset, less support, and heightened accountability for sons (vs. daughters). These findings illustrate the mutability of accountability structures in the face of the biological connection and gender between parents and children.",

      "title": "Adolescent School Failure: Failure to Thrive in Adolescence",
      "abstract": "Success in school is an excellent marker for general adolescent well-being; school failure in adolescence is a powerful indicator of other high-risk behaviors, such as delinquency, substance abuse, and pregnancy. It is estimated that about 17% of White non-Hispanic children in the United States are at high or very high risk for these behaviors compared with 51% of African-American children and 45% of Hispanic children.It is difficult to consider any one of these high-risk behaviors in isolation because all can be antecedents to or consequences of any of the others. Lower grades, for example, are associated with substance abuse and early childbearing, and truancy and disruptive behavior at school are related to substance abuse and delinquency. Although there are many complex mitigating factors and pressures, most adolescents initially try hard drugs, commit a first delinquent act, or engage in unprotected intercourse as a personal decision at a given time and place.In contrast, school failure is more insidious, resulting from an array of forces, many of which are outside the control of the adolescent. It occurs at the end of a long process rather than at its initiation. Because school progress frequently is measured through grades and group achievement testing, there are many opportunities for preventive interventions. The ultimate marker of school failure is dropping out. In a sense, school failure and dropout can be viewed as failure to thrive of adolescence. Many of the etiologies for adolescent school failure can be viewed in both public health and medical model frameworks.Successful programs and interventions for adolescent high-risk behaviors largely address the antecedents to these behaviors rather than the behaviors themselves. The antecedents of school failure and subsequent dropping out, which are virtually the same, have been described by Dryfoos (see Suggested Reading) and are summarized in Table 1. Children who are 1 year older than classmates (behind 1 modal grade) have a 20% to 30% greater chance of dropping out of school, even when achievement, social status, and gender are controlled for. This should make clinicians skeptical of endorsing any recommendation for retention. Race and ethnicity cease to become factors in school dropout when social status is controlled for.In addition to the factors listed in Table 1, low self-concept and an external locus of control (believing that the\"winds of fate\" control one's destiny rather than the individual being able to bring about change) are significant predictors of school failure. Children and adolescents who have low self-esteem about their academic ability should be provided with individualized successful academic experiences. Youths who have an external locus of control can be provided with mentored learning experiences that demonstrate the relationship between their positive behaviors (such as sticking to a structured study schedule)and academic outcomes (including getting more work turned in and better test scores).The epidemiologic research (Table 1) cites conduct problems and \"behavior\"—referred to in the biobehavioral literature as externalizing behavior problems—as major predictors of school failure. At the same time,\"psychological factors,\" including stress and depression, are characterized as predictors that only are \"cited in selected sources\" in the literature. This may be explained by reporting bias. Externalizing behavior problems (oppositional and defiant behavior and conduct problems) are easily recognizable in the classroom and affect the ability of teachers to teach and learners to learn as well as the\"social ecology\" of the entire classroom. Internalizing behaviors(anxiety and depression), on the other hand, are not easily identified by teachers and peers and do not often interfere with general classroom functioning. It is strongly incumbent on clinicians to ask about and identify any internalizing behavior problems in adolescents who are performing poorly in school because the health-care system may be the only professional interface outside of school used by adolescents and their families that is prepared to diagnose and treat these symptoms.The relationship between household composition and school failure is inconsistent. For example, it is unclear whether single-parent households are correlated with higher rates of school failure or dropping out.Children from disadvantaged homes have been found to succeed in excellent schools. On the other hand, some schools are so inadequate that success is the exception. In one recent survey, almost 70% of adolescents who had dropped out of school stated that they might have stayed if\"teachers paid more attention to students\" and if \"we were not treated like inmates.\"Effective programs that prevent school failure and dropout share three major attributes: Early intervention programs such as Head Start and Early Childhood Special Education have focused successfully on the prevention of learning and developmental problems and educating parents in child development. Successful school-age programs have maintained a focus on basic academic skills and recognized the primary importance of a healthy school climate.Several years ago Dr Michael Rutter studied students making the transition from primary schools to middle schools in London. He found that the best students often did poorly when moved into the worst schools, while the poorer students often did well when placed in the best schools. The \"best\" schools could be characterized as emphasizing academics; allowing teachers autonomy to meet the educational needs of individual students; and having programmatic flexibility,systems of incentives and rewards for students, and systems that allow students to take responsibility for their own behaviors. In the United States, Dr James Comer has established a model school-based management approach in inner-city New Haven, Connecticut, and other cities. These schools have advisory councils consisting of the principal,teachers, teacher aides, and parent groups. They also have school-based mental health teams, paid parent participation programs, and a flexible academic program.Programs such as these provide for individualized attention and instruction for students and attract committed teachers who have high expectations. Links between learning and working (such as working in a nursing home and keeping a daily journal of this experience) have been found to be extremely effective in many programs. Some high-risk students require intensive, sustained counseling before they can take full advantage of these programs.Adolescents who are successful despite extremely high-risk profiles have been found to have specific interests and been supported in pursuing them; often have had some mentoring relationship that has encouraged them to believe in themselves; and have been described as self-aware, self-directed, and committed to interpersonal relationships.State-mandated promotion policies that rely solely on testing results are ineffective. Raising school standards without raising the quality of the schools simply encourages failure and dropout. Grouping classes by\"ability\" has uncertain benefits for the lowest achieving students at a potentially enormous psychological cost. Being labeled as \"below average\" can have a tremendously negative effect on students' self-concepts. Teachers often have low expectations of these students, and this can become self-fulfilling. Early intervention or basic skills programs without follow-up are often unsuccessful. Programs in which adolescents are \"scared straight\" or\"moralized to\" almost always fail. The question should be: \"How do schools fail adolescents?\" rather than \"How do adolescents fail school?\"Factors contributing to school failure are among the most frequent problems presenting to primary care clinicians who see school-age children and adolescents. The public health model reviewed previously provides an important overview that is particularly helpful when formulating public policy. Although this model also can suggest some important areas to be pursued, it lacks the analysis of pathogenesis that is most helpful to clinicians in making a diagnosis and planning effective intervention for individual adolescents and their families. A differential diagnostic model for school failure in adolescents is presented in Table 2. Infants exposed to prenatal drugs and alcohol have an increased potential for school failure,particularly secondary to attentional disorders and lowered cognitive abilities. The same holds true for significant exposure to toxins such as lead. Serious hearing or vision impairment, particularly when unrecognized, can result in poor achievement and subsequent behavior problems. Chronic illness can result in significant school absence,as can \"functional disorders\" such as chronic recurrent abdominal pain or headaches. Neurologic disorders such as seizure disorders,neurodegenerative diseases, static and toxic encephalopathies, and post-traumatic disorders may be accompanied by cognitive and attentional limitations.In addition, certain medications,including some anticonvulsants and asthma medications, can lead to cognitive slowing and attentional problems in school. Adolescent substance use and abuse certainly can lead to school failure and truancy. Teenage pregnancy is another marker for all of the high-risk behaviors of adolescence. All of these conditions are likely to come to the attention of clinicians who care for adolescents, and a careful school history should be an integral part of these medical/neurologic evaluations.Biobehavioral disorders are associated with impaired production in school work, mild-to-severe learning problems, socialization and communication difficulties, and disruptive behavior in the classroom.ADHD is the most prevalent biobehavioral disorder of childhood and adolescence. The current DSM-IV formulation for ADHD is two-dimensional and has three subtypes:predominantly inattentive,predominantly hyperactive-impulsive, and combined. The latter two types are often brought to the attention of parents by teachers and subsequently to the attention of clinicians. The predominantly inattentive type often remains undetected. It manifests primarily through difficulties with school achievement and a slow work production speed and often occurs concomitantly with symptoms of anxiety or depression. The number of children and adolescents diagnosed with ADHD is largely a function of the diagnostic criteria used. In a clinical sample,15% more children and adolescents meet DSM-IV criteria for ADHD than met the former DSM-III-R criteria. In an epidemiologic sample(Wolraich), a comparison of teacher ratings of the same students on DSM-III-R and DSM-IV scales resulted in a 57% increase in diagnoses of ADHD, primarily due to identification of children who met the criteria for inattentive and hyperactive-impulsive types of ADHD. ADHD presents differently in adolescence than it does in early and middle childhood. Hyperactivity often is diminished, and the condition is characterized more by continued impulsivity, poorer school performance, and school failure in adolescence. Previous social skills deficits are magnified as poor peer relationships become more obvious and prominent at a developmental stage where peer group acceptance increases in significance. Because of continuing impulsivity, the high-risk behaviors of childhood become the extraordinarily high-risk behaviors of adolescence. The challenges to minor rules or parental limit setting of early and middle childhood now become substance abuse, delinquency,early and unprotected sexual activity,and repeated antisocial behavior.Diagnosing and treating attention disorders in adolescents is associated with several complicating factors. Because of the process of separation and adolescent individuation, parents may no longer be good sources of information about their adolescents. Feedback from and communication with teachers often is complicated by a student having multiple teachers, none of whom may know the student in the detail required to formulate specific learning needs. Finally, the signs and symptoms of attentional disorders usually are not evident during routine office visits.Medication management of attentional disorders also may be more complicated and problematic with adolescents. Dosing is more variable among patients. Stimulant medications take on \"street value.\"Afternoon and early evening doses of stimulant medications increase in importance as demands for producing school work increase. Adolescents who attributed little value to taking medications in early and middle childhood now may refuse to take them, which can lead to increased parent-adolescent conflict as well as escalating school failure.Factors that support a favorable outcome for adolescents who have ADHD include: early evaluation and intervention; self-understanding and acceptance of problems and issues; a supportive family; an understanding and developmentally attuned school system; appropriate individual educational plans (IEPs) if indicated;and a willingness to engage in appropriate counseling, mentoring relationships, and \"coaching\"surrounding production and completion of work. High-risk factors for negative outcomes include: delayed diagnosis; an ongoing cycle of failure; serious behavior problems in school (oppositional, defiant, and conduct problems); significant substance abuse; medication refusal;and damaged self-esteem resulting from the adolescent's problems being viewed as \"characterologic disorders\" rather than as biobehavioral issues that are amenable to systematic interventions.Learning disabilities generally are defined on a discrepancy model:significant discrepancies between cognitive skills (intelligence quotient[IQ]) and achievement, between achievement in different areas(eg, mathematics and reading),or between an individual's achievement and that of grade-mates. The DSM-IV recognizes learning disabilities in reading, mathematics,and written expression as well as communication disorders involving expressive language and mixed receptive and expressive language. Criteria for special educational services based on these disabilities vary from state to state.Learning challenges and demands change significantly during adolescence. Demands on attention in adolescence require more consistent and sustained mental energy, more efficient processing of information, and a significantly increased ability to produce school work. Adolescents need more techniques for remembering, recalling, and summarizing new information, such as mnemonic devices and visual associations. New visual/spatial challenges include increased demands for nonverbal reasoning, visualizing strategies,and familiarity with interpretation and production of graphic representations of information.At this developmental stage, it is assumed that sequential skills include the abilities to stage work appropriately, preview what is required to do the work, make realistic schedules for accomplishing long-term assignments, and organize school work in the context of a busy life with increased social demands and outside activities. Language demands require a greater emphasis on abstract language, learning of a second language, more complex verbal reasoning, and a considerably increased demand for fluency in written language. Neuromotor skills call on abilities for speed-writing,note-taking, and keyboarding. If writing is not automatic or too slow, work production may be impaired severely. Increased cognitive demands include abilities in advanced problem-solving skills and a greater ability to handle abstract concepts.The majority of students who are mentally retarded (IQ <69 with commensurably delayed adaptive functioning) or have autism and more severe autistic-like disorders (PDD) should have been evaluated, diagnosed, and placed in special school programming well before adolescence. Adaptive programs that optimize life and vocational skills and minimize physical, emotional, and sexual exploitation should be well under way for these individuals by the time they reach mid-adolescence.However, adolescents who have borderline intellectual functioning (IQ of 70 to 85) may not have been detected or may have been labeled as \"slow learners.\" They may not qualify for special help in the school system because their academic achievement is not significantly discrepant from their cognitive abilities (IQ). These adolescents are particularly vulnerable to school failure when success demands a greatly increased ability to organize, plan, complete, and turn in work and depends on accessing and using many higher level cognitive skills.Milder forms of PDD, including \"high-functioning autism,\"Asperger syndrome, and nonspecific forms of PDD, also may not have been detected previously. Adolescents who have these disorders are at risk for increasing emotional trauma and rejection as their social awkwardness among peers becomes more evident and relationships take on increased significance.The disruptive behavior disorders are defined in the DSM-IV as ADHD, ODD, and CD. ODD is characterized by losing one's temper; arguing with adults; defying adult requests and rules; blaming others for one's own mistakes; using obscenity; and being touchy or easily annoyed, angry, resentful, spiteful,and vindictive. During adolescence these attributes may lead to increased conflict at school and at home as developmental individuation becomes prominent. With parents less able to exert control over behavior and issues such as homework production, school failure becomes more likely.CD is characterized by stealing, running away from home, setting fires, lying,breaking into homes or cars, and physical and sexual aggression. Although patterns of CD may be well established before adolescence, during the adolescent years the behaviors are likely to be more serious and have more serious consequences. The prognosis for ADHD in adolescents is much poorer when CD is also present. Further, CD can be exacerbated by impulsivity,especially when it occurs concomitantly with ADHD. These adolescents may be easily influenced to become involved in delinquent acts when they succumb to peer pressure. CD may be helped by the same measures used to treat ADHD:stimulant medication, behavioral techniques, and cognitive-behavioral training.Conduct-disordered behavior that is premeditated is much more difficult to treat, carries a much worse prognosis, and may be seen in adulthood as an antisocial personality disorder. Adolescents who exhibit conduct-disordered behavior are at significant risk for major depressive disorder, and this always should be ruled out or treated as indicated.The disruptive behavior disorders are usually obvious at home and interfere significantly with classroom functioning. For these reasons, they often are brought to the attention of clinicians by parents and teachers. In contrast,the internalizing behavior disorders, depression and anxiety, often are unrecognized by parents and teachers and may present as nonspecific school failure and/or social isolation. The primary care clinician may be in a unique position as the only professional outside of the school system to interact with adolescents and their families about school-related issues. Symptoms and signs may not be apparent during an office visit, and adolescents may be reluctant to discuss these issues spontaneously. Depression and anxiety should be considered routinely whenever the issues of suboptimal school performance or school failure arise.The clinician can link the public health and medical models for adolescent school failure. A format for planning an evaluation for school problems, failure, and dropout is presented in Table 3. It is important to recognize that the biobehavioral and behavioral/emotional diagnoses cannot withstand the rigors of the more \"medical model\"diagnostic approach. For example, ADHD and depressive disorders can be quite difficult to distinguish from each other by using any clinical data other than the diagnostic criteria. In addition, multiple diagnoses are more often the rule than the exception. For this reason, it may be more fruitful to generate a problem checklist based on functional limitations than to use a more formal diagnostic approach. This allows the generation of evidence-based treatment interventions for problems where an adolescent's behavior is significantly interfering with optimal functioning.Evaluation of school-related problems can present a challenge. The gathering of information can be time-consuming, and insurance coverage for these labor-intensive and often lengthy evaluations generally is suboptimal. Although it can be argued that early and comprehensive evaluation and treatment should be extremely cost-effective, this remains an unexamined and highly neglected area of clinical research.Most of the target behaviors related to the etiology of school failure are not evident in the office and may require multiple measures, information from multiple observers, and at times, a multidisciplinary approach. Many rating scales that have been devised to help gather information efficiently also have been normed for reliability and validity (Table 4). Most scales cannot be used to make diagnoses, but they can be extremely helpful in gathering structured information from various sources in a manner that allows for quantitative comparison of adolescents with their peers. Recent reviews by Aylward and Kutcher of these and other rating scales can be found in the Suggested Reading.Primary care clinicians should develop or use previously developed structured histories that can be filled out by parents and teachers before an initial evaluation visit and reviewed by the clinician prior to the visit. By using rating scales and prereviewed structured histories, a primary care evaluation visit that includes observations and interviews with parents and adolescents usually can be conducted in less than 1 hour of direct clinical time. The use of rating scales and structured histories allows the clinician to focus on the most important questions for a particular adolescent during the evaluation visit. Parent-adolescent dynamics and conflicts and affective responses of the adolescent to family issues and other specific questions can be observed only during an effective interview.In the clinical setting, private discussions should be initiated with preadolescents. A primary goal is to foster self-esteem and to promote self-efficacy and ownership of both strengths and vulnerabilities through education and support. Adolescents generally should be seen alone and identified as the \"patient\" where developmentally appropriate. They should participate in making decisions and take increasing responsibility for all interventions. However, clear communication with parents or guardians is also essential.Problems with attention, impulsivity, and hyperactivity (the ADHD\"triad\") can be confirmed with a careful history, interview, and use of normed and validated rating scales. Physical and routine neurologic examinations usually are not helpful unless otherwise indicated. Neurodevelopmental findings can support the diagnosis of attentional disorders(particularly difficulties with short-term and active working memory and sequential organization) and suggest the presence of coexisting developmental and learning style problems, such as motor and language delays or processing difficulties. Examining general learning style issues, rather than problems related only to inattention and impulsivity, is critical.The neurodevelopmental examination of an adolescent typically includes an examination of fine motor, gross motor, and grapho-motor skills; language;visual-perceptual-motor functioning; temporal-sequential organization abilities; cognitive speed; and short-term memory skills. The role of computerized tests of attention (continuous performance tasks) in the evaluation and management of attentional disorders remains controversial. These tests never should be used alone for diagnosis, although they can be helpful in distinguishing the group of adolescents at highest risk for attentional disorders. Typical false-negative rates range from 15% to 35%, and false-positive rates are about 2%.Interventions for the ADHD triad of symptoms include education about and demystification of the symptoms, medication management with stimulants or other agents such as certain antidepressants or alpha-2-adrenergics as indicated, and interventions related to specific learning style issues.Disruptive behavior disorders also can be evaluated with a careful history and interview as well as normed and validated rating scales. Interventions include behavioral parent training for parents and the introduction or enhancement of behavioral management programs at school.Underachievement can be evaluated by cognitive (IQ) and achievement testing performed by the school or a community child psychologist. An optimal assessment includes an analysis of where in the process of reading, writing,or mathematics the learning breaks down. Adolescents in whom there are significant findings are entitled to and should request a formal Individual Education Plan (IEP) through the school system.The internalizing behaviors of depression and anxiety can be screened for by history, interview, and normed and validated rating scales. Screening tools include multidimensional rating scales such as the Child Behavior Checklist(Achenbach) and the Behavioral Assessment Scales for Children (BASC) as well as the more specific (but not truly categorical) scales of the Child Depression Inventory (CDI) and the Revised Children's Manifest Anxiety Scale (RCMAS). Referrals then can be made as indicated by results of screening. Adolescents at risk should be referred for appropriate evaluation. Interventions include medication management and psychotherapy.Family functioning always should be assessed as part of the evaluation for school failure. Again, evaluation consists of a careful history and interview and may be enhanced using normed and validated scales for family stress and perceptions concerning family functioning. The primary intervention for significantly impaired family functioning is family therapy. Some families often cannot take advantage of the more behaviorally oriented parent training until they engage in family therapy.Adolescent social functioning and the ability to self-modulate behavior adequately can be evaluated through history, interview, and rating scales. Effective interventions center on cognitive-behavioral (self-talk)techniques.However substance abuse is addressed, a drug screen is strongly recommended. This can be performed ethically only with the adolescent's consent.Assessing the match between the adolescent and the school and/or teachers is difficult for most primary care clinicians providing care to a geographically diverse population of adolescents. However, if a decline in school performance has been precipitous or it cannot be accounted for by the rest of the evaluation, a school/teacher and adolescent mismatch may be significant.Because school-related problems are multidimensional, it is very helpful to primary care clinicians to develop a community referral network or become part of a community-based assessment team that might include a clinical psychologist (for evaluation of adolescents at risk for depression, anxiety,and other emotional concerns as well as provision of family and individual psychotherapy), an educational or school psychologist (for psychoeducational assessment), and school professionals, with additional consultants as indicated. Within this context, primary care clinicians should be able to diagnose attentional disorders and medically related problems and be able to screen for other problems and disorders.The role of the primary clinician in dealing with school failure can be critical by linking the epidemiological with the clinical and encompassing the pediatric/adolescent life span. It includes components of social and public health advocacy, preventive medicine, evaluation, education, treatment, and referral. The most effective interventions are early and multifaceted. The primary care role includes: community advocacy; counseling about prenatal drug and alcohol abuse; early detection and treatment for attentional disorders,underachievement, and learning disabilities; interviews addressing multiple risk factors, grades, school attitudes, behavior, and friends; anticipatory guidance; education about individual learning style and good \"learning hygiene\"; early referral and intervention for preadolescent conduct problems and parent-child conflict; early referrals for family distress; and prevention of substance abuse and adolescent pregnancy.",

They also have school-based mental health teams, paid parent participation programs, and a flexible academic program.Programs such as these provide for individualized attention and instruction for students and attract committed teachers who have high expectations. Links between learning and working (such as working in a nursing home and keeping a daily journal of this experience) have been found to be extremely effective in many programs. Some high-risk students require intensive, sustained counseling before they can take full advantage of these programs.Adolescents who are successful despite extremely high-risk profiles have been found to have specific interests and been supported in pursuing them; often have had some mentoring relationship that has encouraged them to believe in themselves; and have been described as self-aware, self-directed, and committed to interpersonal relationships.State-mandated promotion policies that rely solely on testing results are ineffective. Raising school standards without raising the quality of the schools simply encourages failure and dropout. Grouping classes by“ability” has uncertain benefits for the lowest achieving students at a potentially enormous psychological cost. Being labeled as “below average” can have a tremendously negative effect on students’ self-concepts. Teachers often have low expectations of these students, and this can become self-fulfilling. Early intervention or basic skills programs without follow-up are often unsuccessful. Programs in which adolescents are “scared straight” or“moralized to” almost always fail. The question should be: “How do schools fail adolescents?” rather than “How do adolescents fail school?”Factors contributing to school failure are among the most frequent problems presenting to primary care clinicians who see school-age children and adolescents. The public health model reviewed previously provides an important overview that is particularly helpful when formulating public policy. Although this model also can suggest some important areas to be pursued, it lacks the analysis of pathogenesis that is most helpful to clinicians in making a diagnosis and planning effective intervention for individual adolescents and their families. A differential diagnostic model for school failure in adolescents is presented in Table 2. Infants exposed to prenatal drugs and alcohol have an increased potential for school failure,particularly secondary to attentional disorders and lowered cognitive abilities. The same holds true for significant exposure to toxins such as lead. Serious hearing or vision impairment, particularly when unrecognized, can result in poor achievement and subsequent behavior problems. Chronic illness can result in significant school absence,as can “functional disorders” such as chronic recurrent abdominal pain or headaches. Neurologic disorders such as seizure disorders,neurodegenerative diseases, static and toxic encephalopathies, and post-traumatic disorders may be accompanied by cognitive and attentional limitations.In addition, certain medications,including some anticonvulsants and asthma medications, can lead to cognitive slowing and attentional problems in school. Adolescent substance use and abuse certainly can lead to school failure and truancy. Teenage pregnancy is another marker for all of the high-risk behaviors of adolescence. All of these conditions are likely to come to the attention of clinicians who care for adolescents, and a careful school history should be an integral part of these medical/neurologic evaluations.Biobehavioral disorders are associated with impaired production in school work, mild-to-severe learning problems, socialization and communication difficulties, and disruptive behavior in the classroom.ADHD is the most prevalent biobehavioral disorder of childhood and adolescence. The current DSM-IV formulation for ADHD is two-dimensional and has three subtypes:predominantly inattentive,predominantly hyperactive-impulsive, and combined. The latter two types are often brought to the attention of parents by teachers and subsequently to the attention of clinicians. The predominantly inattentive type often remains undetected. It manifests primarily through difficulties with school achievement and a slow work production speed and often occurs concomitantly with symptoms of anxiety or depression. The number of children and adolescents diagnosed with ADHD is largely a function of the diagnostic criteria used. In a clinical sample,15% more children and adolescents meet DSM-IV criteria for ADHD than met the former DSM-III-R criteria. In an epidemiologic sample(Wolraich), a comparison of teacher ratings of the same students on DSM-III-R and DSM-IV scales resulted in a 57% increase in diagnoses of ADHD, primarily due to identification of children who met the criteria for inattentive and hyperactive-impulsive types of ADHD. ADHD presents differently in adolescence than it does in early and middle childhood. Hyperactivity often is diminished, and the condition is characterized more by continued impulsivity, poorer school performance, and school failure in adolescence. Previous social skills deficits are magnified as poor peer relationships become more obvious and prominent at a developmental stage where peer group acceptance increases in significance. Because of continuing impulsivity, the high-risk behaviors of childhood become the extraordinarily high-risk behaviors of adolescence. The challenges to minor rules or parental limit setting of early and middle childhood now become substance abuse, delinquency,early and unprotected sexual activity,and repeated antisocial behavior.Diagnosing and treating attention disorders in adolescents is associated with several complicating factors. Because of the process of separation and adolescent individuation, parents may no longer be good sources of information about their adolescents. Feedback from and communication with teachers often is complicated by a student having multiple teachers, none of whom may know the student in the detail required to formulate specific learning needs. Finally, the signs and symptoms of attentional disorders usually are not evident during routine office visits.Medication management of attentional disorders also may be more complicated and problematic with adolescents. Dosing is more variable among patients. Stimulant medications take on “street value.”Afternoon and early evening doses of stimulant medications increase in importance as demands for producing school work increase. Adolescents who attributed little value to taking medications in early and middle childhood now may refuse to take them, which can lead to increased parent-adolescent conflict as well as escalating school failure.Factors that support a favorable outcome for adolescents who have ADHD include: early evaluation and intervention; self-understanding and acceptance of problems and issues; a supportive family; an understanding and developmentally attuned school system; appropriate individual educational plans (IEPs) if indicated;and a willingness to engage in appropriate counseling, mentoring relationships, and “coaching”surrounding production and completion of work. High-risk factors for negative outcomes include: delayed diagnosis; an ongoing cycle of failure; serious behavior problems in school (oppositional, defiant, and conduct problems); significant substance abuse; medication refusal;and damaged self-esteem resulting from the adolescent’s problems being viewed as “characterologic disorders” rather than as biobehavioral issues that are amenable to systematic interventions.Learning disabilities generally are defined on a discrepancy model:significant discrepancies between cognitive skills (intelligence quotient[IQ]) and achievement, between achievement in different areas(eg, mathematics and reading),or between an individual’s achievement and that of grade-mates. The DSM-IV recognizes learning disabilities in reading, mathematics,and written expression as well as communication disorders involving expressive language and mixed receptive and expressive language. Criteria for special educational services based on these disabilities vary from state to state.Learning challenges and demands change significantly during adolescence. Demands on attention in adolescence require more consistent and sustained mental energy, more efficient processing of information, and a significantly increased ability to produce school work. Adolescents need more techniques for remembering, recalling, and summarizing new information, such as mnemonic devices and visual associations. New visual/spatial challenges include increased demands for nonverbal reasoning, visualizing strategies,and familiarity with interpretation and production of graphic representations of information.At this developmental stage, it is assumed that sequential skills include the abilities to stage work appropriately, preview what is required to do the work, make realistic schedules for accomplishing long-term assignments, and organize school work in the context of a busy life with increased social demands and outside activities. Language demands require a greater emphasis on abstract language, learning of a second language, more complex verbal reasoning, and a considerably increased demand for fluency in written language. Neuromotor skills call on abilities for speed-writing,note-taking, and keyboarding. If writing is not automatic or too slow, work production may be impaired severely. Increased cognitive demands include abilities in advanced problem-solving skills and a greater ability to handle abstract concepts.The majority of students who are mentally retarded (IQ <69 with commensurably delayed adaptive functioning) or have autism and more severe autistic-like disorders (PDD) should have been evaluated, diagnosed, and placed in special school programming well before adolescence. Adaptive programs that optimize life and vocational skills and minimize physical, emotional, and sexual exploitation should be well under way for these individuals by the time they reach mid-adolescence.However, adolescents who have borderline intellectual functioning (IQ of 70 to 85) may not have been detected or may have been labeled as “slow learners.” They may not qualify for special help in the school system because their academic achievement is not significantly discrepant from their cognitive abilities (IQ). These adolescents are particularly vulnerable to school failure when success demands a greatly increased ability to organize, plan, complete, and turn in work and depends on accessing and using many higher level cognitive skills.Milder forms of PDD, including “high-functioning autism,”Asperger syndrome, and nonspecific forms of PDD, also may not have been detected previously. Adolescents who have these disorders are at risk for increasing emotional trauma and rejection as their social awkwardness among peers becomes more evident and relationships take on increased significance.The disruptive behavior disorders are defined in the DSM-IV as ADHD, ODD, and CD. ODD is characterized by losing one’s temper; arguing with adults; defying adult requests and rules; blaming others for one’s own mistakes; using obscenity; and being touchy or easily annoyed, angry, resentful, spiteful,and vindictive. During adolescence these attributes may lead to increased conflict at school and at home as developmental individuation becomes prominent. With parents less able to exert control over behavior and issues such as homework production, school failure becomes more likely.CD is characterized by stealing, running away from home, setting fires, lying,breaking into homes or cars, and physical and sexual aggression. Although patterns of CD may be well established before adolescence, during the adolescent years the behaviors are likely to be more serious and have more serious consequences. The prognosis for ADHD in adolescents is much poorer when CD is also present. Further, CD can be exacerbated by impulsivity,especially when it occurs concomitantly with ADHD. These adolescents may be easily influenced to become involved in delinquent acts when they succumb to peer pressure. CD may be helped by the same measures used to treat ADHD:stimulant medication, behavioral techniques, and cognitive-behavioral training.Conduct-disordered behavior that is premeditated is much more difficult to treat, carries a much worse prognosis, and may be seen in adulthood as an antisocial personality disorder. Adolescents who exhibit conduct-disordered behavior are at significant risk for major depressive disorder, and this always should be ruled out or treated as indicated.The disruptive behavior disorders are usually obvious at home and interfere significantly with classroom functioning. For these reasons, they often are brought to the attention of clinicians by parents and teachers. In contrast,the internalizing behavior disorders, depression and anxiety, often are unrecognized by parents and teachers and may present as nonspecific school failure and/or social isolation. The primary care clinician may be in a unique position as the only professional outside of the school system to interact with adolescents and their families about school-related issues. Symptoms and signs may not be apparent during an office visit, and adolescents may be reluctant to discuss these issues spontaneously. Depression and anxiety should be considered routinely whenever the issues of suboptimal school performance or school failure arise.The clinician can link the public health and medical models for adolescent school failure. A format for planning an evaluation for school problems, failure, and dropout is presented in Table 3. It is important to recognize that the biobehavioral and behavioral/emotional diagnoses cannot withstand the rigors of the more “medical model”diagnostic approach. For example, ADHD and depressive disorders can be quite difficult to distinguish from each other by using any clinical data other than the diagnostic criteria. In addition, multiple diagnoses are more often the rule than the exception. For this reason, it may be more fruitful to generate a problem checklist based on functional limitations than to use a more formal diagnostic approach. This allows the generation of evidence-based treatment interventions for problems where an adolescent’s behavior is significantly interfering with optimal functioning.Evaluation of school-related problems can present a challenge. The gathering of information can be time-consuming, and insurance coverage for these labor-intensive and often lengthy evaluations generally is suboptimal. Although it can be argued that early and comprehensive evaluation and treatment should be extremely cost-effective, this remains an unexamined and highly neglected area of clinical research.Most of the target behaviors related to the etiology of school failure are not evident in the office and may require multiple measures, information from multiple observers, and at times, a multidisciplinary approach. Many rating scales that have been devised to help gather information efficiently also have been normed for reliability and validity (Table 4). Most scales cannot be used to make diagnoses, but they can be extremely helpful in gathering structured information from various sources in a manner that allows for quantitative comparison of adolescents with their peers. Recent reviews by Aylward and Kutcher of these and other rating scales can be found in the Suggested Reading.Primary care clinicians should develop or use previously developed structured histories that can be filled out by parents and teachers before an initial evaluation visit and reviewed by the clinician prior to the visit. By using rating scales and prereviewed structured histories, a primary care evaluation visit that includes observations and interviews with parents and adolescents usually can be conducted in less than 1 hour of direct clinical time. The use of rating scales and structured histories allows the clinician to focus on the most important questions for a particular adolescent during the evaluation visit. Parent-adolescent dynamics and conflicts and affective responses of the adolescent to family issues and other specific questions can be observed only during an effective interview.In the clinical setting, private discussions should be initiated with preadolescents. A primary goal is to foster self-esteem and to promote self-efficacy and ownership of both strengths and vulnerabilities through education and support. Adolescents generally should be seen alone and identified as the “patient” where developmentally appropriate. They should participate in making decisions and take increasing responsibility for all interventions. However, clear communication with parents or guardians is also essential.Problems with attention, impulsivity, and hyperactivity (the ADHD“triad”) can be confirmed with a careful history, interview, and use of normed and validated rating scales. Physical and routine neurologic examinations usually are not helpful unless otherwise indicated. Neurodevelopmental findings can support the diagnosis of attentional disorders(particularly difficulties with short-term and active working memory and sequential organization) and suggest the presence of coexisting developmental and learning style problems, such as motor and language delays or processing difficulties. Examining general learning style issues, rather than problems related only to inattention and impulsivity, is critical.The neurodevelopmental examination of an adolescent typically includes an examination of fine motor, gross motor, and grapho-motor skills; language;visual-perceptual-motor functioning; temporal-sequential organization abilities; cognitive speed; and short-term memory skills. The role of computerized tests of attention (continuous performance tasks) in the evaluation and management of attentional disorders remains controversial. These tests never should be used alone for diagnosis, although they can be helpful in distinguishing the group of adolescents at highest risk for attentional disorders. Typical false-negative rates range from 15% to 35%, and false-positive rates are about 2%.Interventions for the ADHD triad of symptoms include education about and demystification of the symptoms, medication management with stimulants or other agents such as certain antidepressants or alpha-2-adrenergics as indicated, and interventions related to specific learning style issues.Disruptive behavior disorders also can be evaluated with a careful history and interview as well as normed and validated rating scales. Interventions include behavioral parent training for parents and the introduction or enhancement of behavioral management programs at school.Underachievement can be evaluated by cognitive (IQ) and achievement testing performed by the school or a community child psychologist. An optimal assessment includes an analysis of where in the process of reading, writing,or mathematics the learning breaks down. Adolescents in whom there are significant findings are entitled to and should request a formal Individual Education Plan (IEP) through the school system.The internalizing behaviors of depression and anxiety can be screened for by history, interview, and normed and validated rating scales. Screening tools include multidimensional rating scales such as the Child Behavior Checklist(Achenbach) and the Behavioral Assessment Scales for Children (BASC) as well as the more specific (but not truly categorical) scales of the Child Depression Inventory (CDI) and the Revised Children’s Manifest Anxiety Scale (RCMAS). Referrals then can be made as indicated by results of screening. Adolescents at risk should be referred for appropriate evaluation. Interventions include medication management and psychotherapy.Family functioning always should be assessed as part of the evaluation for school failure. Again, evaluation consists of a careful history and interview and may be enhanced using normed and validated scales for family stress and perceptions concerning family functioning. The primary intervention for significantly impaired family functioning is family therapy. Some families often cannot take advantage of the more behaviorally oriented parent training until they engage in family therapy.Adolescent social functioning and the ability to self-modulate behavior adequately can be evaluated through history, interview, and rating scales. Effective interventions center on cognitive-behavioral (self-talk)techniques.However substance abuse is addressed, a drug screen is strongly recommended. This can be performed ethically only with the adolescent’s consent.Assessing the match between the adolescent and the school and/or teachers is difficult for most primary care clinicians providing care to a geographically diverse population of adolescents. However, if a decline in school performance has been precipitous or it cannot be accounted for by the rest of the evaluation, a school/teacher and adolescent mismatch may be significant.Because school-related problems are multidimensional, it is very helpful to primary care clinicians to develop a community referral network or become part of a community-based assessment team that might include a clinical psychologist (for evaluation of adolescents at risk for depression, anxiety,and other emotional concerns as well as provision of family and individual psychotherapy), an educational or school psychologist (for psychoeducational assessment), and school professionals, with additional consultants as indicated. Within this context, primary care clinicians should be able to diagnose attentional disorders and medically related problems and be able to screen for other problems and disorders.The role of the primary clinician in dealing with school failure can be critical by linking the epidemiological with the clinical and encompassing the pediatric/adolescent life span. It includes components of social and public health advocacy, preventive medicine, evaluation, education, treatment, and referral. The most effective interventions are early and multifaceted. The primary care role includes: community advocacy; counseling about prenatal drug and alcohol abuse; early detection and treatment for attentional disorders,underachievement, and learning disabilities; interviews addressing multiple risk factors, grades, school attitudes, behavior, and friends; anticipatory guidance; education about individual learning style and good “learning hygiene”; early referral and intervention for preadolescent conduct problems and parent-child conflict; early referrals for family distress; and prevention of substance abuse and adolescent pregnancy.",

      "abstract": "How do adults experience and manage their sexual desires, when these desires are laden with shame, guilt or religious transgression? This study looked at a group of 15 heterosexual, single adult men in the Orthodox Jewish community whose religious laws explicitly prohibit them from both masturbating and from expressing all forms of premarital physical intimacy. When these religious laws are internalized, the person can encounter a unique set of conflicts that can significantly impact his relationships, religiosity, and emotional well-being. Interviews focused on the different ways that men navigated these conflicts over the course of development. Findings point to 3 distinct conflict/defense positions that represent advancing developmental stages on the road to “sexual ownership”: (1) sexual disembodiment, during which the person’s desires are felt as irrational and senseless outside forces, split off from their otherwise purpose-driven self; (2) sexual internalization, where desire is felt as an anxiety-laden but tolerable part of the self, and the person manages his intrapsychic conflicts using a variety of mature defense; and (3) sexual integration, where the person accepts their sexual desire as an important part of the self that can be linked to other motives, needs, and conflicts. The factors that facilitate and obstruct the sexual ownership process are discussed. The generalizability of this process to other populations is considered, and clinical recommendations are provided for therapists who encounter sexual ownership problems in their patients.

      "title": "Sexual Dysfunction Among Cancer Survivors",
      "abstract": "“Sexual and reproductive health and wellbeing are essential if people are to have responsible, safe and satisfying sexual lives. Sexual health requires a positive approach to human sexuality and an understanding of the complex factors that shape human sexual behaviour. These factors affect whether the expression of sexuality leads to sexual health and wellbeing or to sexual behaviour that put people at risk or make them vulnerable to sexual and reproductive illhealth. Health program managers, policy – makers and care providers need to understand and promote the potentially positive role sexuality can play in peoples’ lives and to build health services that can promote sexually health societies.” – (WHO 2006) There is increasing number of cancer survivors worldwide. A lot of them experience sexual dysfunction for a long time which can last beyond ten years post treatment. Sexual dysfunction can occur as a result of any aspect of cancer and cancer treatment. Sexual functioning and/or satisfaction have been found to be of concern to many cancer survivors. Sexual function can be affected by physical or emotional trauma especially if the genitals are affected and can adversely affect the quality of life of the patients. Sexual dysfunction includes erectile dysfunction in males and disruption in the sexual response cycle (sexual desire, excitement, arousal, orgasm and resolution) and dyspareunia in women. There are differences in the pattern of sexual dysfunction between males and females as females may be able to cope better than males emotionally. Bonini-Colmano et al. (2007) noted that malignant diseases have a strong influence in quality of life, sexuality being one of the most affected variables. In their study to determine the prevalence of sexual dysfunction in a cohort of patients with cancer and its relationship with the following: pain, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, mechanisms of adaptation to stress, anxiety and depression, questionnaires were used which included treatment, adverse events, Zimong and Snaith depression and anxiety scale, sexual dysfunction questionnaire, coping strategies of Tobin David, Hopwood body image scale and the analogical visual test for pain evaluation. Sixty four patients were evaluated. Seventy two percent were women and median age was 50 years. Libido was absent in 50%; this was associated with gender (better in men; p=0,05) and the presence of pain (p=0,05) and fatigue (p=0,05) but not with age. All patients who had intact libido also had arousal and orgasms; this was more prevalent in men than in women and in subjects younger than 60 years. Arousal was absent in 47% of cases. Forty four percent of men had erectile dysfunction; this was present in all patients older than 60 years. Frequency of",

      "title": "The effects of traditional family values on the coming out process of gay male adolescents.",
      "abstract": "The development of a gay or lesbian identity (often referred to as the coming out process) has been widely studied in adults; however, few studies have examined the process in gay adolescents. Even among these studies, little research has investigated the effects of race or family values on the coming out process. A small sample of African-American, Hispanic/Latino, Asian/Eurasian, and Caucasian gay male adolescents participated in this survey study. Coming out was operationalized in three stages: sensitization; awareness with confusion, denial, guilt, and shame; and acceptance. The majority of respondents reported feeling different from other boys as children. The average age of first crush on another boy was 12.7 years; average age for realizing they were gay was 12.5 years. Most respondents reported feeling confused during their first awareness that they were gay. Denial of identity was a coping strategy for about half the sample. Traditional family values played a greater role in predicting coming out experiences than did race. Families were categorized as having high or low traditional values based upon (1) the importance of religion, (2) emphasis on marriage, (3) emphasis on having children, and (4) whether a non-English language was spoken in the home. Families with a strong emphasis on traditional values were perceived as less accepting of homosexuality than were the low traditional families. Those who work with adolescents need to be aware that some will recognize their sexual orientation as gay, lesbian, or bisexual during this time of their lives. These youth need support in the coming out process because they may encounter stigmatization and disapproval not only from the larger society, but also from their families, peers, and sometimes the gay community itself.",

      "title": "Development of the Human-Research Animal Bond and Its Impact on Animal Well-being",
      "abstract": "For millennia, relationships have developed between animals and people through the context of work, sport, companionship, or some combination of these activities. Often, a bond between animal and human results, which is based on affection and/or respect. In the research environment, it is not uncommon for a bond to develop between the investigator, veterinarian, and/or animal care technicians and the animals with which they work; and such a bond can be just as strong for a mouse as it is for a dog. Circumstances that foster the formation of these bonds include the close and frequent contact between the researchers and their animals during studies or during training of animals to particular tasks, the long periods of time many research animals live in the facilities (often years), the dependency of the animals on the animal care staff for their daily needs, and the veterinarian/patient relationship, which is not unlike that of private practitioners and client-owned animals. In addition, overlaying the fundamental relationship with the research animal are special bonds that can form with certain animals. Among those that engender a special attachment are animals that are particularly friendly, amusing, or intelligent; animals requiring extra supportive care; animals that show courage; animals that represent a milestone in a particular scientific advancement; and animals that reflect humans' own strengths and foibles. The development of these relationships is enriching to both personnel and animals inasmuch as people who care about their animals are committed to promoting and ensuring the well-being of those animals.",

      "title": "Evolution of male life histories and age-dependent sexual signals under female choice",
      "abstract": "Sexual selection theory models evolution of sexual signals and preferences using simple life histories. However, life-history models predict that males benefit from increasing sexual investment approaching old age, producing age-dependent sexual traits. Age-dependent traits require time and energy to grow, and will not fully mature before individuals enter mating competition. Early evolutionary stages pose several problems for these traits. Age-dependent traits suffer from strong viability selection and gain little benefit from mate choice when rare. Few males will grow large traits, and they will rarely encounter choosy females. The evolutionary origins of age-dependent traits therefore remain unclear. I used numerical simulations to analyze evolution of preferences, condition (viability) and traits in an age-structured population. Traits in the model depended on age and condition (good genes) in a population with no genetic drift. I asked (1) if age-dependent indicator traits and their preferences can originate depending on the strength of selection and the size of the trait; (2) which mode of development (age-dependent versus age-independent) eventually predominates when both modes occur in the population; and (3) if age-independent traits can invade a population with age-dependent traits. Age-dependent traits evolve under weaker selection and at smaller sizes than age-independent traits. Evolution of age-independent traits depends only on trait size, whereas evolution of age-dependent traits depends on both strength of selection and growth rate. Invasion of age-independence into populations with established traits followed a similar pattern with age-dependence predominating at small trait sizes. I suggest that reduced adult mortality facilitates sexual selection by favoring the evolution of age-dependent sexual signals under weak selection.",

      "title": "Power at Play: Gender Discourses in Media-Based Pretend Play in the Early Childhood Education Classroom",
      "abstract": "North American children are growing up in a media-saturated landscape. Since the deregulation of children’s television in the 1980s in the United States, an explosion of intertextual transmedia franchises has resulted in Canadian children being surrounded by not only film and television texts, but also by media-based toys and merchandise. Market segmentation means these toys and related items are highly gendered, with themes that include femininity, passivity, appearance and friendship for girls, and hegemonic masculine ideals including dominance, aggression, militarism and competitiveness for boys. This investigation undertakes an observation of children at a daycare and a preschool, in Montreal, engaged in pretend play utilizing media-based toys and dress-up costumes to understand what types of gender discourses circulate through play with these items. Results indicate that the gendered themes evident in the media-based toys and narratives are taken up by the children and become part of their everyday play worlds, exacerbating gender policing among peers. However, aspects of gender discourses are also contested as some children take pleasure in subverting gender norms, or turning submissive roles into more agentic positions in play. The production history and content of some of the media-based franchises are also examined, as well as pedagogical approaches that may prevent critiques of hegemonic gender discourses in the early childhood education environment.",

      "abstract": "Nur wenige sexuelle Variablen zeigen einen so großen Gender Gap wie der Umgang mit Pornografie im Jugendalter. Während ein Großteil der Jungen sich intensiv mit Online-Pornografie befasst, sie regelmäßig zur Masturbation einsetzt und unter Peers zuweilen mit Porno-Wissen prahlt, stellen Mädchen üblicherweise kollektives Desinteresse bis Abscheu zur Schau. Doch das ist nicht die ganze Wahrheit. Denn auch jugendliche Mädchen nutzen sexuell explizite Medieninhalte, sind neugierig auf Sex und fasziniert von medialen Sexdarstellungen. Nur greifen sie neben oder statt den Mainstream-Plattformen für Videopornografie teilweise auf andere sexuelle Online-Medien zurück als Jungen, etwa auf X-Art-Videos, Erotik-Romane, explizite Mangas und Comics sowie selbstgeschriebene sexuelle Fan Fiction. Und natürlich haben Mädchen gelernt, sexuelles Interesse und Begehren tunlichst herunterzuspielen, denn Geilheit ist nach gängigen Geschlechtsrollenerwartungen halt einfach nicht mädchenhaft und auch nicht ladylike. Keine will schließlich als „Schlampe“ oder „Hoe“ dastehen. Und so entsteht das in der sexualpädagogischen Praxis allzu bekannte Schweigen der jugendlichen Mädchen, wenn es um sexuelle Medien, Fantasien, selbstbestimmte Lust und Selbstbefriedigung geht.",

      "title": "Infants Prefer Those Who ‘Bow Out’ of Zero-Sum Conflicts",
      "abstract": "Cooperation and conflict are basic to human social life. From early infancy, humans seem to recognize cooperation and to prefer cooperative individuals. They also seem to recognize conflict, expecting larger individuals or those with more allies to prevail. The present paper asks how infants feel about others who either win or lose (by yielding) in a conflict. We present a total of nine experiments. In four of the experiments, infants ages 10 to 16 months watched vignettes showing two puppets in a conflict. Infants preferred (reached for) the puppet that yielded to another puppet, rather than the puppet who was yielded to. Five more experiments ruled out alternative explanations for the main findings, including that the infants preferred the yielding puppet because it helped the other puppet achieve its goal. These results are striking in light of earlier findings showing that only five months later, at age 21 months, children emphatically prefer the winner (non-yielding puppet) in such conflicts. These results suggest that humans go through a dramatic developmental shift during the second year of life in the way they evaluate individuals based on the outcomes of conflict.",

      "abstract": "Questionnaires that assessed self-esteem, self-concept, educational goals, career goals, preferred and expected career commitment, and sex-role attitudes were completed by 884 male and female undergraduates representing two racial groups and two age groups. Men and women did not differ significantly in terms of self-esteem, but the men described themselves as more attractive than did the women in their age group. For the 18–25-year-old white women, an intelligent, unconventional, and/or nonreligious self-concept predicts nontraditional goals and feminist attitudes, and the interaction between self-esteem and socioeconomic status influences educational goals and sex-role attitudes. For the 18–25-year-old white men, a physically strong and intelligent self-concept predicts higher educational goals and traditional career goals, and lower self-described strength and religiousness and greater intelligence predict more feminist attitudes. Physical self-concept is unrelated to goals or attitudes for the female samples. Self-concept is less strongly predictive of goals and attitudes for the black women and the older men and women. Possible reasons for the sample differences and implications for related research are discussed.",

      "abstract": "Mediante este trabajo se reflexiona de forma general sobre la sexualidad en el adulto mayor y algunos de los factores que mas pueden influir en ella de forma desfavorable. El objetivo es describir los enfoques actuales de la sexualidad en los adultos mayores de 65 anos de edad. Se han desarrollado gran variedad de mitos y/o tabues, el primero se refiere a que los adultos mayores no tienen capacidad fisiologica que les permita tener conductas sexuales activas, no les interesa el sexo, las adultas mayores que se interesan por el sexo son perversas y ridiculas (Viuda alegre), el adulto mayor con deseo sexual es un degenerado o viejo verde, las personas mayores no son sexualmente deseables, la disfuncion erectil es normal en los adultos mayores, entre muchos mas. Se concluye que la sexualidad en los adultos mayores es la expresion psicologica de emociones y compromisos que requiere la mayor cantidad y calidad de comunicacion entre ellos, en una relacion de confianza, amor, compartir y placer, con o sin coito. Los principales cambios anatomofisiologicos que se producen en los organos sexuales de los adultos mayores tienen que ver de una forma directa con el desarrollo de su sexualidad. La existencia de estresores como puedan ser la perdida de la pareja, el deterioro de la red social y del nivel socioeconomico o la presencia de problemas de salud en la familia, contribuyen tambien a la aparicion de diversas dificultades en la actividad e interes sexual en el anciano. La renuncia a la actividad sexual debe ser el ultimo recurso y debe quedar como opcion del individuo, nunca como consecuencia fatalista de un evento en particular.",

      "abstract": "Hedges in Japanese conversation are discussed in relation to three social variables: age, sex, and formality. In the present study, hedges are defined as expressions of uncertainty, possibility, or tentativeness, all of which convey a sense of vagueness. I quantified the use of 26 Japanese hedges (e.g., toka ‘or something’, kana ‘I wonder’, nanka ‘like’, and tabun ‘probably’). Three hypotheses were posited to investigate the effect of the social variables: hedges are used (1) more often by younger speakers than by older speakers; (2) more often by women than by men; (3) more often in casual speech than in formal speech. Data of 20 single-sex dyads were collected from two age groups and from both sexes. The data supported hypotheses (1) and (2), but not (3). Most notably, younger female speakers use hedges often. Social factors of the speaker as well as context play an important role in the use of hedges in Japanese conversation.",

      "title": "Asexuality: An Introduction for Questioning Clients",
      "abstract": "Asexuality—defined as the lifelong and nonpathological lack of sexual attraction to people of any sex or gender—is increasingly being recognized as a valid sexual orientation. For gay, lesbian, and bisexual individuals, this questioning phase is often triggered by feeling sexual attraction to someone of the same sex or gender; however, for asexual individuals, questioning may start with the realization that the person does not feel—and has never felt—sexual attraction to anyone, regardless of sex or gender. Thus, psychotherapists and other counselors have an ethical duty to respect their clients’ sexual orientation and not to discriminate against, deny service to, or demean clients on the basis of sexual orientation. Because asexuality is newly recognized as a sexual orientation, however, relatively few resources exist on cultural competency with asexual or potentially asexual clients. Finally, asexual individuals may have to navigate the implications of their asexuality in terms of cultural and social expectations for sex, relationships, and childbearing.",

      "abstract": "Most people in Euro‐American and industrialized societies strongly believe in fidelity and most are, in fact, sexually faithful to their romantic partners. However, infidelity (also called extramarital or extrarelational sex) does occur. Several factors increase the likelihood of infidelity (e.g., gender, frequent travel); of these, relational factors (e.g., conflict, dysfunctional communication) are the most powerful. Infidelity has many negative consequences. The cheating partner often experiences guilt, anxiety, and fear; the cheated‐on partner typically experiences feelings of jealousy, anger, self‐doubt, and betrayal; and the relationship itself often does not survive. Researchers who study responses to (imagined) infidelity generally find that both men and women consider emotional infidelity (their partner falling in love with someone else) to be more upsetting than sexual infidelity (their partner engaging in sexual activity with someone else). However, two sex differences are commonly found: when asked to select the most distressing event, more men than women select sexual infidelity, and more women than men choose emotional infidelity. Although scholars continue to debate the origin of these sex differences, all agree that infidelity is an upsetting and destructive event in the life of most monogamous relationships.",

      "abstract": "Two histories of physically normal men with persistent gender issues highlight the major impact played by parental input on the sexual and gender development of children. Both men had been subjected to firm, harsh behavior modification by their parents, particularly their mothers, during childhood in response to effeminate behavior. While both men continue to manifest major gender/sexual issues as adults, their outcomes have been dramatically different. The first man takes female hormones and denies any satisfaction from his sexuality. This individual remains convinced that he has female internal sexual organs and monthly internal menstrual bleeding. Although he has a career, he has become alienated from his family and is a social cripple. The second man has a successful career, lives a heterosexual life with his children and wife of 20 years and is involved in his community. He is visually attracted to men and remains obsessed with male pornography. This individual credits his mother with directing him toward a successful heterosexual life, which he feels has prevented the emotional burden of an active homosexual life. These two cases illustrate the tremendous influence played by environment and parental input on the sexual perspectives of developing children.",

If a person is incapable of consenting because they are temporarily non-autonomous – as in the case of an intoxicated adult or a pre-autonomous child – the infringement should be delayed until the individual becomes autonomous and can make their own decision. Given the seriousness of violating anyone's right to BI, and especially that of the most vulnerable persons, the appropriate likelihood-of-consent for proceeding with a BI infringement on a child is argued to be at or near the 'medically necessary' threshold. Depending on what the proposed BI infringement is, then, children will sometimes be able to consent – or withhold their consent – to a proposed alteration of their bodies in a way that is appropriate for their developmental stage.",

Overall, as expected, spouses in happy marriages reported feeling less controlled than spouses in the 2 distressed groups. Few gender differences were obtained, with the exception that wives in aggressive marriages were more likely to report that their husbands controlled their sense of competence and self-respect. Differences between the DA and DNA groups depended on the specific area of control. Wives in the aggressive couples were significantly more likely than their husbands to state that their spouse's aggression was an attempt to control them.",

I contend that female sexual fluidity is an evolved predisposition in heterosexual women and the behaviour evolved as a result of the need for allomothering— helping each other’s offspring survive—and also providing assistance with survival of the females themselves. The Allomothering hypothesis asserts that same-sex sexual behaviour can be adaptive in condition-dependent circumstances because it promotes pair bonds that ultimately contribute to the survival of offspring. A revised definition of sexual fluidity, one that is different from the traditional definition, was devised. In this dissertation the revised definition states “sexual fluidity occurs when self-identified heterosexual (straight) or predominantly heterosexual females experience short-term fleeting physical (sexual) attraction to and/or a deep emotional connection (like romantic love) with other females in a condition-dependent circumstance.” Four studies were conducted to find evidence in support of the allomothering hypothesis. The first study compared self-identified heterosexual (mostly straight) women and men in terms of same-sex sexual experience. Overall, women more than men have engaged in various dimensions of same-sex sexual behaviour. The second study compared pornography geared toward heterosexual women and pornography geared toward heterosexual men. Female same-sex sexual behaviour occurred in almost all the top selling movies for both heterosexual women and men. The third study tested the allomothering hypothesis by having self-identified heterosexual (mostly straight) women who have engaged in same-sex sexual behaviour rate the person they had the experience with on “good mothering traits.” The more the women enjoyed same-sex sexual behaviour, the higher they rated the person they had the sexual experience with. Various aspects of same-sex sexual behaviour among heterosexual (mostly straight) women and allomothering were explored. The final study was an assessment of captive Bonobos (Pan paniscus) at the Milwaukee Zoo. Bonobos are humans’ closest genetic relative along with Chimpanzees (Pan troglodtyes). The study examined the connection between female same-sex sexual activity among bonobos in relation to pair bonding, grooming, play, and allomothering.",

      "abstract": "For two decades, psychologists studying ovulation have successfully employed a series of “T-shirt studies” supporting the hypothesis that men can detect when a woman is most fertile based on olfactory detection of ovulatory cues. However, it is not known whether the ability to detect female fertility is primarily a function of biological sex, sexual orientation, or a combination of both. Using methodologies from previous T-shirt studies, we asked women not using hormonal contraceptives to wear a T-shirt for three consecutive nights during their follicular (ovulatory) and luteal (non-ovulatory) phases. Male and female participants of differing sexual orientations then rated the T-shirts based on intensity, pleasantness, and sexiness. Heterosexual males were the only group to rate the follicular T-shirts as more pleasant and sexy than the luteal T-shirts. Near-significant trends also indicated that heterosexual men and non-heterosexual women consistently ranked the T-shirts, regardless of menstrual stage, to be more intense, pleasant, and sexy than did non-heterosexual men and heterosexual women. Recommendations for future research, including suggestions for methodological changes, are discussed.",

      "abstract": "Objectives Women are underrepresented in top positions and experimental evidence suggests that one explanation is gender differences in preferences for competition, that is, fewer women than men enter competition‐intensive careers. Less is known about whether there are remaining gender differences in competitiveness within the subpopulation of men and women that choose to pursue such careers, which creates further female underrepresentation in top positions. Studying a subcomponent of competitiveness, namely resilience to failures, this article provides quasi experimental evidence from the field on this issue. Methods I study professional golfers’ resilience to failures by estimating the causal effect of a failure in one tournament on the performance in the next. Results The results show that both male and female golfers respond negatively to failures, and that their responses are virtually identical. Conclusion Thus, in this particular subpopulation of competitive men and women there seems to be no gender difference in resilience to failures.",

      "abstract": "A nationwide and demographically representative sample of 1,166 people responded to a survey exploring choices for a favorite movie monster and reasons underlying the choice. Results of the study indicated that, irrespective of demographics, the vampire is the king of monsters. With a few exceptions (e.g., Chucky, Dracula, and sexiness), males and females were generally attracted to the same monsters and for similar reasons. Regarding age differences, younger people were more likely to prefer recent and more violent and murderous slasher monsters, such as Freddy Krueger, and to like them for their killing prowess. Older people were more attracted to earlier vintage, non-slasher monsters like Karloff's Frankenstein. Slasher and non-slasher monsters who ranked in the Top 10 in terms of popularity differed in two important respects: slashers were preferred for their killing prowess while non-slashers were preferred for being objects of empathy, pity, or compassion. Overall, though, monsters were particularly liked for their intelligence, superhuman powers, and their ability to (safely) show us the dark side of human nature.",

      "abstract": "The present generation of parents and other educators faces a particular problem: having been brought up for the most part with little or no sex instruction, having been protected to some extent by the pressures of social convention, they find themselves faced by a generation of young men and women who talk freely about sex, who say openly that they are not prepared to accept the traditional teaching of the Churches with regard to sexual behaviour and for whom the fear of an illegitimate pregnancy is no longer the deterrent to fornication that it may have been in the past. To make matters even more perplexing, the young men have long hair which used to be thought a symbol of homosexuality and the young women wear mini-skirts which is confusing for a generation of men accustomed to thinking of the exposed female thigh as a non-verbal communication of a specific kind. What are they to do ? Judging by the number of books currently flooding the market, at least part of the answer seems to be ‘read a book about sex’ for, with no statistical evidence, I’d be prepared to guess that it is this generation rather than the one at risk that is doing most of the reading—perhaps the others are too busy with the field work. The first of these three paperbacks, Sense and Nonsense about Sex, purports to be written for teenagers, and more specifically appears to be directed to Protestant teenagers in youth clubs, but I find it hard to imagine any young man or woman actually reading it.",

      "abstract": "38 schizoid and 70 hysterical patients with neurotic disturbances are compared with regard to social data, intelligence and triggering situation. Schizoids are more frequently single, childless and live alone, while hysterics are married, remarried or divorced, have one child and live with their partner and the child. With nearly the same education and intelligence, schizoid patients are more often workers/skilled workers, pupils/apprentices/students or have no profession; hysterically structured individuals, being predominantly women, are more frequently housewives. Nearly half of the most frequent triggering events are equally distributed in both structure groups; these are particularly events signalling a change during development, which, in degree of severity, can just as well be minor threshold situations as serious reverses. With an earlier age of onset, schizoids decompensate significantly more often in \"developmental stages\", whereas hysterical patients are more likely to do so in connection with events of \"love-sexuality\" and those which provoke hysterical anxieties. Of the 15 most frequent events, only 6 each occur in either the schizoids (starting school, puberty, moving away from home, entering into a heterosexual relationship in terms of a casual encounter, beginning an apprenticeship or studies, failure in a test) or the hysterically structured individuals (vacation, marriage, pregnancy/delivery, marital disharmony, extra-marital relationship and severe illness of the patient).",

We evaluated how males’ responses to female solicitations related to female characteristics, number of males and conceptive females present, and the male’s recent copulations. Using 12 years of data from a wild population, we found that males accepted only 20% of female solicitations. Odds of acceptance (copulation) increased for conceptive females, for females with whom the male copulated recently, and when fewer males were present. Odds of accepting nulliparous females decreased when more conceptive females were available, consistent with market models. Male responses did not relate to female rank or matings with other females the same day. When males responded negatively, nulliparous females were especially likely to receive aggression vs. mere refusal. Overall, males’ decisions to mate with willing females depended both on female characteristics, especially fertility, and on social context.",

      "title": "Creating Inclusive and Positive Climates in Girls’ and Women’s Sport: Position Statement on Homophobia, Homonegativism, and Heterosexism",
      "abstract": "Creating inclusive and positive climates in sport is essential for the realization of the benefits of sport for female athletes. Homophobia, homonegati homonegativism, and heterosexism threaten the quality of sport experiences and harm all girls and women in sport. Homophobia generally is considered an irrational fear and intoler-ance of lesbians and gay (Herek, 1984). Homonegativism, a related but distinctly different concept, reflects learned beliefs and behaviors towards nonheterosexu-als and is demonstrated through stereotypes, prejudice, and (Krane, 1997, p. 145). Finally, heterosexism refers to the belief that heterosexu-ality is the only normal and natural sexual orientation (Herek, 1992). A key distinction between homonegativism and heterosexism is that homonegativism is demon strated through biased and prejudicial actions whereas heterosexism occurs through omission or disregard for individuals who are not heterosexual. Homonegative and heterosexist prejudice also may be aimed at an athlete's identity or gender self-expression (how one externally chooses to present one's inner identity to the world) (Answers, 2004). Research has documented the homonegative and heterosexist climate of many sport settings (e.g., Griffin, 1998; Lenskyi, 1997; Hargreaves, 2000). Although long-standing stereotypes claim there are many lesbians in sport, they are not accepted in many sport settings. Bias and discrimination against female athletes who are lesbian, bisexual, and transgender can occur through negative stereotypes, verbal comments and harassment, discrimination in team selection, social isolation, negative media attention, and loss of resources (Krane & Barber, 2003). Homonegative and heterosexist sport environments perpetuate negative stereotypes, provoke fear of being labeled lesbian, and victimize girls and women who are lesbian, bisexual, transgender, or perceived as lesbian (Krane & Barber, 2003). Because of existing homonegativism in sport, some girls will drop out of sport (Shakib, 2003) or will select to participate in socially acceptable or sports (Griffin, 1998). Although sport participation can lead to many health benefits, homonegative climates can negate the likelihood of obtaining them as well as create behaviors that threaten well-being (Krane, Surface, & Alexander, 2005). When faced with intolerant sport settings, girls and women can incur low self-esteem and confidence; high stress, depression, and frustration; increased risk of suicide; and feelings of isolation, being disconnected, or underappreciated. Attempts to escape discrimination can lead to alcohol or drug use. Some athletes, to avoid being labeled as lesbian, will employ unhealthy eating, exercise, and training behaviors (Krane et al., 2005). Girls and young women who feel the need to meet societal demands and be perceived as feminine and het erosexual may engage in unhealthy eating to change their body size or shape. Athletes who feel compelled to prove their heterosexuality may feel pressured to be sexually active with the opposite sex (krane et al., 2005). Athletes concerned about appearing feminine or heterosexual also may be vulnerable to sexual harass ment (Lenskyj, 1992). These athletes may submit to unwanted sexual attention from boys and men to avoid being labeled lesbian. Altogether, when in intolerant sport environments,. female athletes' physical and psychological health may be at greater jeopardy than their peers not faced with such discrimination. Homonegative and heterosexist sport environments also may impede athletic success. Since being a muscular female athlete often is associated with being labeled lesbian, some girls and women limit their strength training or avoid appropriate weight training programs (Krane et al., 2005). Such avoidance can increase the likelihood of injury, as protective musculature will not be developed, or can limit sport skill development, due to insufficient strength. …",

      "abstract": "The sexual values of absolutism (abstinence until marriage), relativism (sexual decisions made in reference to the nature of the relationship), and hedonism (if it feels good, do it) were assessed in a convenience sample of 783 undergraduate students at a large southeastern university. Results revealed that relativism (62.1%) was the predominate sexual value followed by hedonism (24.6%) and absolutism (13.4%). Significant differences included: men were more hedonistic than women; Blacks were more absolutist than whites, older students (those 19 years of age and above) were more hedonistic than those who were younger, persons who had up were more hedonistic than those who had not hooked up, persons who had experienced a friends with benefits relationship were more hedonistic than persons who had not, persons not involved in a relationship were more hedonistic than those who were involved, persons who had not cohabited were more absolutist than those who had cohabited. Theoretical explanations for gender differences and implications/limitations of the data are suggested. ********** Limited research has been conducted on sexual values--the moral guidelines individuals use to make decisions regarding their sexual behavior. Recent exceptions include research demonstrating the nature of parental transmission of sexual values (implicit, nonverbal, negative) (Kim and Ward, 2007) and the perceived inadequacy of parental discussions of sexuality (Rouse-Arnett and Mario Long Dilworth, 2006). The current research examined the sexual values of a convenience sample of university undergraduates (primarily first year students and sophomores). What moral principles guide undergraduates today and how do their values differ by gender, race, age, relationship status, and cohabitation experience were among the questions of this study. Sample and Methodology The data for this study were taken from a larger nonrandom sample of 783 undergraduates at a large southeastern university who answered a 100 item questionnaire (approved by the Institutional Review Board of the university) on Sexual Attitudes and Behaviors of College Students. Respondents completed the questionnaire anonymously (the researcher was not in the room when the questionnaire was completed and no identifying information or codes allowed the researcher to know the identity of the respondents). Of the respondents 74.6% were females; 25.4% were males. Racial background included 82% whites, 18% Blacks (respondent self-identified as African-American Black, African Black, and Caribbean Black or biracial) and 1.8% Hispanic. The median age of the sample was 19 with 71.7% younger and 28.3% older. Items specific to sexual values and their correlates served as the focus of this paper. Three sexual values were identified and defined with students asked to select the sexual value they currently adhered to: Absolutism was defined as before marriage is wrong; relativism-if you are in a loving relationship, intercourse is ok even if not married; and hedonism-if it feels good, do it--being in love or being married don't matter. Responses to these three sexual values were cross-classified to determine the statistical significance of hypothesized differences (Chi Square). Findings and Discussion Relativism was the predominate sexual value reported by over sixty percent of respondents (62.1%), followed by hedonism (24.6%), and absolutism (13.4%). Analysis of the data revealed several statistically significant differences in those who selected various sexual values: 1. Men were more hedonistic; women more relativistic. Men were significantly (p",

Speaking of heritage, independently of individual variation, and supposing female characteristics to be transmuted to their male equivalents, I showed (1) that the possession of each unit of peculiarity in a man [that is of difference from the average of his race] when the man’s ancestry is unknown, implies the existence on an average of just one-third of a unit of that peculiarity in his “mid-parent,” and, consequently, in each of his parents; also just one-third of a unit in each of his children; (2) that each unit of peculiarity in each ancestor taken singly, is reduced in transmission according to the following average scale:—from a parent, to ¼; from a grandparent, to 1/16; from a great-grandparent, to 1/64, and so on.",

      "title": "DIVORCE FOR SUBJECTIVE REASONS: THE SURVEY DATA",
      "abstract": "According to sociological telephone survey, conducted by the research centre Discourse in may 2016, half of young women with children believe that his wife has the moral right to divorce her husband, whom she doesn’t love, even if he is not guilty in front of her and they have children. In this situation, even perfect behavior of one of the spouses makes no warranties from divorce at the demand of the other spouse. According to the author, the divorce laws in Russia are too liberal. Spouses with no children from this marriage, mutual consent to divorce can get a divorce without a trial. If they have children under 18 years of age or if one of the spouses doesn’t agree to divorce, the marriage is dissolved in court. But the judge may not refuse to divorce even when only one spouse demands it, and the other spouse is innocent and doesn’t want to divorce. The author suggests in this situation to recognize the initiator of the divorce is guilty if he (or she) doesn’t prove that the other spouse has violated the rules of family life. The innocent spouse should have the benefit, in dividing property and establishing child custody. Opponents of stricter divorce laws claim that it can reduce the number of marriages. Many people refuse to marry. They are afraid of losing the apartment after divorce. Divorce is always possible, even without guilt on their part. According to the legislation of the Russian Federation, all property of the spouses jointly acquired during marriage is shared. After the divorce, it is divided equally, even if one of the spouses had no personal income all the time of marital life. This rule is valid if there is no marriage contract about joint or separate ownership. But if the groom will offer the bride to sign an agreement for waiver of claims to the apartment in case of divorce, she may be offended by such distrust, and to refuse to marry him. The number of marriage contracts in Russia is very small compared to the number of marriages. However, it is possible to amend the Family Code that marriage registration is required marriage contract. If people know that the prenup is necessary, it protects their property, and they will not lose it in case of divorce for fault of the other spouse, the number of marriages will increase, and the number of cohabitating couples will decrease.",

In this study, 459 unmarried, heterosexual undergraduate students (female = 328; male = 131), aged 18 to 25 years, from three universities completed an online questionnaire about their behaviors with technology and romantic relationships. In general, low attachment avoidance and high fear of negative evaluation from the dating partner predicted sending a sexually suggestive photo or video, sending a photo or video in one's underwear or lingerie, and sending a sexually suggestive text. High fear of negative evaluation predicted sending a nude photo or video as well as sending a text message propositioning sex. Low attachment avoidance, greater fear of negative evaluation, and greater social distress when dating were associated with sexting behaviors.",

      "abstract": "Gay men's communities, social networks, and strategic action fields consider the interconnectivity of gay men. These concepts are discussed. Overall the concern is to describe how gay men coalesce, engage in concerted action, and experience categorical oppression. We can realistically speak of separate, somewhat overlapping, communities of gay men or gay men's communities encompassing territory (the gay ghettos of Wilton Manors and the Castro for example), ethnic‐like enclaves, friendship groups, institutions, social venues, fictive kin‐like relations, value or even interest, imagined, symbolic, referential, or aspiration groups, and so forth. Clearly, in late modernity there is nothing like a “total” community of gay men. There have been and in some cases today are gay men's communities of mollies, S&amp;M, leather, drag, clones, house ball scenes (or communities), political and voluntary groups, party, sport and recreational, sexual scenes and networks, “bears,” social scenes (both commercial and noncommercial), gendered, raced, medicalized, capitalized, activist, resistant, marketed to, subaltern, secretive, professional associations (and professional groups permeated by same‐sex sexually interested and active men), Radical Faeries, queers, Act Up‐ers, Internet‐ and electronic‐based networks, groups, venues or communities, and so on. There clearly are, however, subgroups or social networks of gay men. Social movements’ analysis has some utility herese (Adam 1987). Field theory also appears to have the potential to assist with our understanding of the aggregated lives of gay men; that is, if we are interested in the birth, ebb, flow, impacts, outcomes, and possible death(s) of these gay communities, social networks or fields of culture, structure and action.",

      "title": "Physical activity play: the nature and function of a neglected aspect of playing.",
      "abstract": "In this review, we consider the nature and possible developmental functions of physical activity play, defined as a playful context combined with a dimension of physical vigor. We distinguish 3 kinds of physical activity play, with consecutive age peaks: rhythmic stereotypies peaking in infancy, exercise play peaking during the preschool years, and rough-and-tumble play peaking in middle childhood. Gender differences (greater prevalence in males) characterize the latter 2 forms. Function is considered in terms of beneficial immediate and deferred consequences in physical, cognitive, and social domains. Whereas most theories assume that children's play has deferred benefits, we suggest that forms of physical activity play serve primarily immediate developmental functions. Rhythmic stereotypies in infancy are hypothesized to improve control of specific motor patterns. Exercise play is hypothesized to function primarily for strength and endurance training; less clear evidence exists for possible benefits for fat reduction and thermoregulation. In addition, there may be cognitive benefits of exercise play that we hypothesize to be largely incidental to its playful or physical nature. Rough-and-tumble play has a distinctive social component; we hypothesize that it serves primarily dominance functions; evidence for benefits to fighting skills or to emotional coding are more equivocal. Further research is indicated, given the potentially important implications for children's education, health, and development.",

      "abstract": "Natalism is a belief that promotes human reproduction, that is child-bearing and parenthood, as desirable for social reasons. In J. K. Rowling's Harry Potter series, the key characteristic of the heroes seems to be their adherence to heteronormativity and natalism (they are straight, they wed young and have multiple children or are children themselves). In contrast, the villains are characterized as both not conforming to heteronormativity in various overlapping modes – implied homosexuality (Greyback, Voldemort, Bellatrix, Grindelwald), pedophilia (Greyback, Voldemort), implied incest (the Carrows, Bellatrix and Narcissa), rape (Merope), asexual forms of reproduction, i. e. horcruxes (Voldemort) – and as being markedly antinatalistic – lack of children, or only one child (the Lestranges, Voldemort, the Malfoys), also, in books 1-6 the core of their opposition consists of children (Harry and his friends) and in book 7, the majority of their opposition consists of children (Hogwarts students). In fact, the whole series is a result of Voldemort's readiness to kill baby Harry and his young parents for his own immorality achieved through asexual means and Harry's mother being willing to die for her son – this event forms a basic structure in which natalism and antinatalism clash forming a template that we can find reproduced throughout the series. Interestingly, the villains' pure-blood ideology can be brought down to their own racist natalist agenda, which, the books seem to imply, is a result of their nonconformism to heteronormativity and therefore equals antinatalism.",

      "abstract": "Few people, if they paused to reflect on the question, would disagree with the idea that various aspects of a person’s identity have a bearing on their experiences in the world. There are differences in how a person of twenty-five years versus one of sixty-five years mediates a dispute, trains to run a marathon, or walks into a dance club. Completing a graduate degree versus dropping out of high school affects the opportunities a person has when applying for a job or running for office. Identifying as a woman, a man, or neither will affect a person’s experience of serving in the military, seeking a job promotion, or being the primary caregiver for young children (at least in many locales). Most of these variations in experience have little to do with persons’ biological differences. Instead, they grow out of social environments and others’ expectations. To the identifiers of age, education, and gender suggested above, we can add race, disability, immigrant status, sexual orientation, and other markers of identity. And it is the intersection of those multiple various aspects of a person’s identity, combined with personal choices and life experiences, that make each person distinctive and shape each person’s experience.",

      "abstract": "The transition to parenthood is characterized by physical changes and altered sexual dynamics that may be associated with a tendency for new parents to underestimate their partner’s physical attraction to them and/or be more attuned to daily changes in their partner’s attraction. To examine this possibility, this study assessed directional bias and tracking accuracy in new parents’ perceptions of their partner’s daily physical attraction to them. Fifty-nine couples completed 21-day diary tasks during pregnancy, 2 weeks after childbirth, and 15 weeks after childbirth (i.e., up to 63 diary days). Both mothers and fathers experienced increased appearance insecurity and decreased sexual frequency and sexual satisfaction across the transition. Moreover, at times when new parents reported higher appearance insecurity or lower sexual satisfaction, they underestimated their partner’s physical attraction to them, but were not more likely to notice day-to-day fluctuations in their partner’s attraction. Results highlight the misperceptions that can occur during this pivotal life transition.",

      "abstract": "We argue that some sex pheromones released by males or females serve as ornaments and that strong chemical signals released by healthy individuals result in high reproductive success through mate attraction or facilitation of social shoaling behavior. We also consider cases where conspecific odors may amplify the threatening effect of aggressive displays among males to signal social dominance or ultimately influence mate choice decisions by female onlookers. Thus, sexual ornaments may function to attract or deter (i.e., threat) conspecifics. We suggest that males and/or females assess mate quality and discriminate among potential mates by using a variety of cues, including seasonal variation in steroid levels that relate to gonadal development.",

      "abstract": "The present study examined whether sex differences in emotion are related to the social context and addressed differences between global, retrospective, and on-line, momentary self-descriptions of emotional experience and expression. Participants provided global, retrospective descriptions of their emotional characteristics at an initial session, and then provided momentary emotion ratings as well as details about the social context in which they experienced their emotions over a one-week period. We predicted and found that sex-related differences in emotion in global self-descriptions, but not in the averaged momentary ratings of emotion. Furthermore, only sex of the interaction partner elicited sex differences in emotionality; participants experienced and expressed more emotion when in opposite-sex dyads. Although most of the other context variables were themselves associated with emotional experience or expression, suggesting that they were emotionally evocative, none emerged as elicitors of sex differences in emotional experience; felt intimacy in the interaction was associated with sex differences in ratings of emotional expression. Together, the findings present certain caveats to the widely held belief that women are the ''more emotional'' sex.",

      "abstract": "Peoples strong tendency to assign male gender to neutrally described persons has been termed the people = male bias. We aimed to assess whether this effect can be elicited using amorphous visual stimuli instead of verbal descriptions and whether it is already evident in childhood. We presented 53 children (4 to 12 yrs., 27 boys) with black-and-white amorphous drawings of humans and asked them whether the adult depicted was a man or a woman. The option to choose \"I dont know\" was also provided. In order to assess whether social contexts influenced childrens gender attributions (as has been previously reported for adults) we placed the same amorphous humans in three different contexts: 1) the adult was depicted alone, 2) the adult was passively involved in a social situation with a child and 3) the adult was actively helping a child. Children showed a clear tendency to assign male gender to the amorphous adults across all context variations; this was equally true for boys and for girls. However, when the adult was shown in a social context the proportion of male gender attributions was lower compared to the condition without social context. The older the children were, the more likely they were to attribute female gender to a higher proportion of amorphous figures across all contexts. Median response times were higher for \"female\" ratings, indicating that this decision was associated with greater cognitive effort. Our results show that a strong bias towards attributing male gender to visually presented amorphous figures is evident already in childhood and that it somewhat decreases with age. For children, just as it has been demonstrated for adults, social contexts lead to a larger proportion of female gender attributions. These results encourage future research to include developmental aspects for explaining the mechanisms underlying gender perception and stereotypes. Meeting abstract presented at VSS 2014",

      "abstract": "Although the males of many animals (including mammals) are decorated brighter than females, such sexual differentiation is not observed among the humans. Yet, women much more intensively use various decorations (from make-up to perfume, etc.) and therefore, they look “brighter” than men. In the authors’ view, beside the genetic component this process is due to the humans’ comprehension of the relationship between coitus and pregnancy, as far as pregnancy and then the child-breeding have always entailed serious material problems. If a pregnant woman or the women already confined is left without man, this is a particularly difficult situation for her. Therefore, a woman tries to attract men by her bright outfit and decorations. Another outcome is that since the primitive communities, women have been covering up female breeding organs and some erogenous parts to avoid raping. So, on the one hand, women dress up to please men and on the other hand, cover up their bodies not to over-arouse them. The fact that the female body covering up is associated with these points (and is not exclusively the function of protection from cold, status function, etc.) is evidenced by the dynamics of their stage-by-stage public denudation in the course of civilization process.",

      "abstract": "Parenthood is usually viewed as happening within the institution of marriage. Single parenthood has a negative connotation and is typically associated with divorce, separation, or widowhood. However, independently planned parenthood, or single-parenthood-by-choice, is intrinsically different in that independently planned parents actively plan to pursue parenthood without a romantic partner, sexual partner, or other coparenting unit. This study examined attitudes toward independently planned parenthood and willingness to consider independently planned parenthood as a function of gender and sexual identity. Participants included 631 cisgender young adults (201 lesbian/gay, 430 heterosexual) living in the United States. Women had more positive attitudes toward independently planned parenthood than men, and lesbian and gay people had more positive attitudes toward independently planned parenthood than heterosexual people. Gay men were more willing to consider becoming parents independently than heterosexual men, but there were no significant differences between lesbian and heterosexual women. In all, independently planned parents are an underrecognized population within single parenthood. These parents challenge the patriarchal and heteronormative norms surrounding parenthood and may suffer social backlash and stigmatization because of their decision to pursue parenthood alone. However, this study finds that monosexual women and gay men may be more welcoming of this nontraditional family structure than heterosexual men. This research acts as a foundation to continue to explore issues of independently planned parenthood. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved).",

This can be costly if the woman’s social partner loses the competition and, as a consequence, invests in offspring that are not genetically his own, a situation known as cuckoldry. Previous research suggests that men may have evolved tactics such as mate retention behaviors that reduce the risk of sperm competition and cuckoldry. The current research provides new evidence that men at greater risk of partner infidelity and sperm competition, measured as having spent a greater proportion of time apart from their partner since the couple’s last in-pair copulation, more frequently perform a variety of mate retention behaviors, such as calling unexpectedly to check up on their partners, monopolizing their partners’ time when around other men, and threatening other men who show an interest in their partners.",

The former gets off significantly lighter in terms of ideological framing and formal punishment. The latter—and drug users in particular—are typically demonised and heavily punished, whilst the former are regularly lionised, dramatised, celebrated and punished less severely. The preceding disparities cannot be upheld from the standpoint of morality in general or from that of a Broad Internalist sport ethic. Consideration of the consequences, actions, motives and vices involved in the respective categories fails to support them. Nor is support provided by the notion that sports are tests of the physical skills and virtues that the obstacles presented are designed to foster and promote, and behaviour that threatens the opportunity to exercise those excellences or have competitions determined by them should be the subject of critical moral scrutiny. Openly violent on-field transgression does not fare at all well by the yardstick of Broad Internalism. Robust investigation of and ultimate change in the values underpinning the disparities is warranted.",

Since gender-related conflicts have escalated in Korea especially among younger adults, we predicted that (1) there would be gender differences in one's perception of gender discrimination in Korea and (2) such differences would be particularly large among younger adults. Consistent with the predictions, we found that Korean men underestimated discrimination against women and overestimated discrimination against men, relative to Korean women. Also, such tendency was more pronounced among younger men than among older men without significant differences in sexism between them. Moreover, young men claimed that men were at least as discriminated against as women in Korea unlike other groups who believed that discrimination against women was larger than discrimination against men. Our data also suggest that such perception of gender discrimination among younger Korean men is possibly due to their beliefs that social atmosphere in Korea is disadvantageous to their gender. We further showed that gender differences in perception of gender discrimination were associated with corresponding differences in emotional reactions (i.e., anger) to gender discrimination.",

      "abstract": "Federal Rule of Evidence 412 prohibits the admission of evidence of the victim’s prior sexual behavior and sexual predisposition. There are, however, exceptions to the general prohibition. Significantly, evidence of the victim’s sexual behavior with the defendant may still be admissible if the defendant claims consent. And, in the context of a consent defense, not only is the victim’s physical conduct with the defendant potentially admissible, but so are her voiced sexual fantasies or dreams involving the defendant. Thus, woman’s thoughts, imagined or even unconscious, may be appropriated as evidence of consent under current rape shield laws. The same rationale that was the foundation for the chastity requirement under traditional rape law also applies to the admissibility of women’s sexual fantasies and dreams under the consent exception—women who express sexual fantasies act outside social norms, have deficient character, and therefore such evidence is relevant to consent. Yet, sexual fantasies and dreams, based on imagined or even unconscious thoughts, do not make the fact of consent more or less likely. And, even though such evidence is not relevant to consent, courts have admitted it. This Article examines the admissibility of women’s sexual fantasies and dreams under the consent exception, traces its origins, highlights its application, argues that sexual fantasies and dreams should be excluded, and proposes a practical solution to address this problem.",

      "title": "Behavioural Changes At Adolescence in Chimpanzees",
      "abstract": "Male chimpanzees experience puberty (marked testicular growth and ejaculation) when they are about 9 years old and just over half adult weight. They reach adult weight at 14-15 years. Females start small sexual swellings at about 8 years, mate with adult males when they are about 10.5 years and have their first infants when they are about 12 years. Males reduce their constant association with their mothers when they reach puberty and associate more with adult males and cycling females. Some males form strong, long-lasting associations with particular adult males. Females remain with their mothers until first oestrus,and then associate with adult males either in their natal community or a new community during oestrus. The decline in association with the mother is more closely correlated with pubertal stage than with chronological age in both sexes. Immatures of all ages spend 3-13% of their time in social grooming, but grooming partners change during adolescence. Juveniles of both sexes groom their mothers and siblings most, but males groom individuals outside their maternal unit more than do females. Juveniles receive over 90% of their grooming from mothers and siblings. Adolescent males groom less with their mothers and more with cycling females and adult males. While early adolescent males start to be groomed by females only late adolescent males receive any grooming from adult males. Adolescent females without mothers groom little except with adult males when they are in oestrus. Social play is most frequent with individuals aged 2-9 years and individuals play most with others of their age. Time spent playing by both sexes declines markedly during adolescence. Juveniles and early adolescents of both sexes have friendly interactions with infants, but late adolescents rarely interact with infants. Males show frequent sexual behaviour with oestrous females from an early age. Males spend more time with oestrous females as they get older but frequency of copulation declines gradually through adolescence. Early adolescent males try to take females on consort, but only late adolescent males succeed. One female rejected the sexual advances of a male once he reached puberty. Rates of interference in copulations by males decline during adolescence and males become more cautious of copulating in the presence of adult males. Females show little sexual behaviour until they start getting large oestrus swellings. Males receive increased aggression from adult males during adolescence. They become tense in the presence of adult males and even late adolescents are peripheral to grooming clusters of adult males. Males start to challenge adult females in adolescence but are often attacked, and are not able to dominate them all until late adolescence. Male juveniles perform elements of charging displays without hair erection more frequently than females. The freqency of this declines in adolescence while the frequency of charging displays with hair erection by males increases in adolescence and displays become increasingly more adult-like in length and form. Males show the shoulder hunch for the first time in early adolescence. Males pant hoot more than females and rates of pant-hooting increase with age in both sexes.",

The subject was identified as a male at birth, and reared as such in a society in which the differentiation between male and female social roles is more incisive than is generally the case in modern Western society. The appearance at adolescence of gender-incongruent physical secondary sex characteristics, and the comprehensive physical and psychological examinations that were subsequently performed, showed ‘him’ to be essentially feminine, however. Hence, after minor genital surgery, the subject was re-registered as a female and retested 16 months after her reassignment of sex. The subject showed marked improvement in the pattern of serious intrapsychic maladjustment evinced on initial testing, but a deterioration in social behaviour. These findings indicate that differences in psychosexual orientation and behaviour have a biological basis, and are not wholly learned and/or imprinted.",

      "abstract": "Aim. The aim is to present the results of research on the sexual nervousness of men and women.&#x0D; Methods. 87 Ukrainian men and women were interviewed. For the analysis of the obtained results, methods of statistical processing of data were used.&#x0D; Results. It has been established that there are differences between men and women in terms of sexual nervousness, attitudes towards pornographic materials, sexual arousal, friendly and exchange approaches to sex, signs of positive relationships with others and self-acceptance. Men are more focused on careful approach to sex and woman on friendly approach. Men are more loyal to pornographic products and reach sexual arousal faster. They have higher levels of sexual nervousness. For both men and women, sexual satisfaction is related to a reduction in sexual nervousness and an increase in a sense of feasibility in a sexual way. Dissatisfaction with a men’s sex life is related to emotional discomfort. With the growth of sexual-neurotic feeling and sexual actions the desire for a technically perfect sexual act increases neglecting other aspects of relationships and partner’s wishes. Women who are dependent on others tend to reject themselves and dissatisfaction with their sexual lives increases.&#x0D; Conclusions. Male and female sexuality is associated with many factors of the individual’s mental life. The experience of subjective well-being and quality of life includes sexual satisfaction.&#x0D; Sexual nervousness is closely related to personal nervousness, which in turn is a set of negative emotional feeling, expressed destructive and inconsistent personality traits, and impedes efficient social and psychological functioning. Sexual nervousness is defined as dissatisfaction, disappointment in sex life that leads to neurotic sexual response – difficulties in controlling the sexual urge, confusion, anxiety, etc.",

In general, Indian children prefer extroverted to introverted, practical to imaginative, feeling to thinking, and organized to flexible styles. Gender differences among Indian children are significant only on extroversion-introversion. Age differences are found on thinking-feeling and organized-flexible styles.

In contrast to children in the United States of America, those in India are more likely to prefer practical styles.

      "abstract": "The current study investigates how descriptive and prescriptive gender norms that communicate work and family identities to be (in)compatible with gender identities limit or enhance young men and women's family and career aspirations. Results show that young adults (N = 445) perceived gender norms to assign greater compatibility between female and family identities and male and work identities than vice versa, and that young men and women mirror their aspirations to this traditional division of tasks. Spill-over effects of norms across life domains and cross-over effects of norms across gender-groups indicated that young women, more than young men, aimed to 'have it all': mirroring their career ambitions to a male career model, while keeping their family aspirations high. Moreover, young women opposed traditional role divisions in the family domain by decreasing their family aspirations in face of norms of lower family involvement or higher career involvement of men. Conversely, in line with traditional gender roles, young men showed lower family aspirations in the face of strong male career norms; and showed increases in their career aspirations when perceiving women to take up more family roles. Young men's family aspirations were, however, more influenced by new norms prescribing men to invest more in their family, suggesting opportunities for change. Together, these findings show that through social norms, young adults' gender identity affects aspirations for how to manage the co-presence of their work and family identities. Altering these norms may provide leverage for change to allow both men and women to combine their multiple identities in an enriching way.",

Conversely, men possess a body centered orientation toward sex-the goal of sex is physical gratification. These different orientations toward sex in relatidnships should lead men and women to have different desires in the sexual relationship. We hypothesized that women will desire more activities in sex that demonstrate love and intimacy, while men will desire more activities that focus on arousal aspects of the sexual activity itself (more partner initiative; more variety). Two samples were used to test the hypotheses: 189 undergraduate students and 53 newly married couples. Men and women were asked how much they desired their partner to do less or more of a variety of activities during sex. The results indicated that there were gender differences found in what was desired from the sexual relationship that were consistent with our pred...",

The authors examined implicit math attitudes and stereotypes among a heterogeneous sample of 5,139 participants. Women showed stronger implicit negativity toward math than men did and equally strong implicit gender stereotypes. For women, stronger implicit math=male stereotypes predicted greater negativity toward math, less participation, weaker self-ascribed ability, and worse math achievement; for men, those relations were weakly in the opposite direction. Implicit stereotypes had greater predictive validity than explicit stereotypes. Female STEM majors, especially those with a graduate degree, held weaker implicit math=male stereotypes and more positive implicit math attitudes than other women. Implicit measures will be a valuable tool for education research and help account for unexplained variation in the STEM sex gap.",

Males and females rated their level of agreement to 42 items on a l-to-5 scale. There were 31 items that showed statistically significant sex differences at the .05 level or better. For 13 items, males were more likely than females to endorse items reflecting sexual permissiveness, or other male cultural stereotypes (e.g., disapproval of homosexuality). For females, 18 items showed greater acceptance of certain attitudes, ranging from disapproval of masturbation, to feeling they had to have sex when aroused. Females showed significantly more jealousy than males on both jealousy items, one on partner sexual intercourse, and the other on partner emotional involvement, which contradicts, at least in part, Buss's evolutionary psychology theory of jealousy (Buss, 2000). Possible reasons for the findings are discussed.",

The present online-survey included a large sample of most recent dreams. The results clearly indicate that sex role orientation (femininity/expressivity and masculinity/instrumentality) affect the same dream characteristics that show marked gender differences (e.g., sexual dream content, physical aggression). Whereas the effect of sex role orientation on dream content support the continuity hypothesis of dreaming, the effect of biological sex on dream content does not exclude that other variables (such as, for example, the amount of sexual fantasies during waking) have an effect on dream content in addition to sex role orientation. Thus, future studies have to elicit more waking-life variables in order to model the varying daytime experiences of men and women in order to investigate whether these daytime differences sufficiently explain gender differences in dreaming or whether biological factors are also of importance.",

Previous research has suggested that frequent users of pornography also experience signs of behavioral addiction such as loss of control over use and preoccupancy with thoughts of using. Research has also suggested that frequent users experiencing signs of behavioural addiction are more likely to copy or fantasize about imitating what the see in pornography. However, most research has shown that only individuals experiencing psychopathic personality traits are the ones who will imitate what they see in pornography. A study of 1,060 persons explored the effects of addiction to pornography, the dark triad and personality, and addiction to sex as contributing factors to the perpetration of aggressive or violent sexual behaviours. Persons with higher scores of psychopathy and problematic pornography use and compulsive sexual behaviours were more likely to behave aggressively sexually, but the findings also indicate that, regardless of personality, individuals experiencing lower levels of sexual satisfaction also reported more sexual aggression.",

      "abstract": "Previous research has shown repeatedly that human stature influences mate preferences and mate choice in heterosexuals. In general, it has been shown that tall men and average height women are most preferred by the opposite sex, and that both sexes prefer to be in a relationship where the man is taller than the woman. However, little is known about such partner preferences in homosexual individuals. Based on an online survey of a large sample of non-heterosexual men (N = 541), we found that the majority of men prefer a partner slightly taller than themselves. However, these preferences were dependent on the participant's own height, such that taller men preferred shorter partners, whereas shorter men preferred taller partners. We also examined whether height preferences predicted the preference for dominance and the adoption of particular sexual roles within a couple. Although a large proportion of men preferred to be in an egalitarian relationship with respect to preferred dominance (although not with respect to preferred sexual role), men that preferred a more dominant and more \"active\" sexual role preferred shorter partners, whereas those that preferred a more submissive and more \"passive\" sexual role preferred taller partners. Our results indicate that preferences for relative height in homosexual men are modulated by own height, preferred dominance and sex role, and do not simply resemble those of heterosexual women or men.",

      "title": "Inappropriate Sexual Behavior Scale",
      "abstract": "In the early 1980's, there was a startling realization that children are often sexually victimized by other children. With this understanding has come a serious confusion as to what constitutes normative sexual expression and what is sexual exploitation. This article discusses the two stances that have been prevalent: 1) discourage or ignore sexual behavior in children and hope that it goes away, or 2) persistent sexual behavior, particularly with other children, is either pathological or a definitive sign of emerging pathology. The disparity and myopic nature of both positions makes them unacceptable. How do we then take a more balanced and accurate view of childhood sexual expression, given our new sensitivity to children exhibiting sexually offending behavior? The Inappropriate Sexual Behavior Scale is presented as a tool to take into consideration normative sexual themes and behavior in children and the possibility of developing sexual pathology. The Discovery that Children are Sexual Beings Historically, it is difficult to determine just when the realization occurred that children, as well as adults, are sexual creatures with all the resulting ramifications. From a sociological perspective, it is clear that what our culture still considers part of childhood (11 to 18 years of age) in many cultures would have already undergone the rite of passage to adulthood. With this passage comes the responsibilities and privileges associated with adulthood—work, conscription into the army, leaving home, taking a partner, and freedom to be sexually active. Presently, in third-world nations, large percentages of their armed forces are younger than the legal age to view rated movies in the United States. It is ironic to the point of absurdity what children in our culture are exposed to, concerning sexuality and the restrictions we place on their response to this exposure. Television, movies, magazines and even comic books frequently depict mild-to-strong sexual themes such as nudity, sexual suggestiveness, sexual behavior and sexualized dominance and violence. Yet, about the only culturally agreed upon sexual behavior of children is to ask a biology question or two. When it comes to sexuality, the disparity between the physical or hormonal clock and the cultural clock exacerbates the difficulty.",

      "title": "Fisherian and “good genes” benefits of mate choice: how (not) to distinguish between them",
      "abstract": "“Good genes” models of mate choice are commonly tested by examining whether attractive males sire offspring with improved survival. If offspring do not survive better (or indeed survive less well), but instead inherit the attractiveness of their father, results are typically interpreted to support the Fisherian process, which allows the evolution of preferences for arbitrary traits. Here, I show that the above view is mistaken. Because of life‐history trade‐offs, an attractive male may perform less well in other components of fitness. A female obtains a “good genes” benefit whenever males show heritable variation in quality, even if high‐quality males invest so much in sexual advertisement that attractiveness has no positive correlation with any other life‐history trait than male mating success itself. Therefore, a negative correlation between attractiveness and viability does not falsify good genes, if mating with a high‐quality male results on average in superior offspring performance (mating success of sons included). The heritable “good genes” benefit can be sustained even if sexually antagonistic genes cause female offspring sired by high‐quality males to survive and reproduce less well. Neglecting the component of male mating success from measurements of fitness returns from sons and daughters will bias the advantage of mating with a high‐quality male downwards. This result may partly account for the rather weak “good genes” effects found in a recent meta‐analysis.",

This paper examines variations in intentions to use condoms for vaginal intercourse with main and casual partners as a function of gender, ethnicity and risk. Additionally, the paper examines the extent to which these different factors influence the degree to which people can (or cannot) act upon their intentions. While 68% of men and 81% of women report intentions to use condoms for vaginal sex with their casual partners, only 33% of men and 37% of women intend to use condoms for vaginal sex with their main partner. Men with positive intentions were able to carry out those intentions about 64% of the time with respect to both main and casual partners; women with positive intentions were able to act upon these intentions 53% of the time with their main partners, but almost 82%, of the time with their casual partners. Possible factors influencing the ability to act on one's intentions are explored and implications for interventions are discussed.",

      "abstract": "Gender representations reproduce and legitimate gender systems. To examine this aspect of the gendered social order, we analyze the representation of males and females in the titles and central characters of 5,618 children’s books published throughout the twentieth century in the United States. Compared to females, males are represented nearly twice as often in titles and 1.6 times as often as central characters. By no measure in any book series (i.e., Caldecott award winners, Little Golden Books, and books listed in the Children’s Catalog ) are females represented more frequently than males. We argue that these disparities are evidence of symbolic annihilation and have implications for children’s understandings of gender. Nevertheless, important differences in the extent of the disparity are evident by type of character (i.e., child or adult, human or animal), book series, and time period. Specifically, representations of child central characters are the most equitable and animals the most inequitable; Little Golden Books contain the most unequal representations; and the 1930s-1960s—the period between waves of feminist activism—exhibits greater disparities than earlier and later periods. Examining multiple types of books across a long time period shows that change toward gender equality is uneven, nonlinear, and tied to patterns of feminist activism and backlash throughout the century.",

Assumptions about the causal antecedents of sexual desire may contribute to sexual miscommunication and the failed negotiations that result in sexual harassment and date rape. I examined the impact of one presumed cause of female desire (i.e., romantic love or romantic events) on perceptions of a heterosexual, sexual interaction. Results indicated that the perceived level of sexual desire felt by a female target and the extent to which she is believed to want sex mediated the relation between a male target's sexual request style (romantic vs. sexual) and the extent to which their sexual interaction was viewed as consensual. Neither gender nor previous experience with harassment or assault moderated this result; however, main effects for gender were found such that men attributed greater sexual desire to the female target than did women, and women perceived the female target as less responsible for the occurrence of intercourse than did men.",

      "title": "[Adolescent pregnancy].",
      "abstract": "This exploration of adolescent pregnancy focuses on adolescents whose pregnancies are undesired. The physical and psychic transformations of puberty and adolescence may be experienced differently in different social contexts. The prolongation of school attendance in Western societies means that most adolescents remain financially dependent on their parents. But greater sexual freedom in the society at large has been reflected in an increase in early sexual activity among adolescents. Wider use of contraception has not completely eliminated prenatal pregnancy among adolescents. Adolescent pregnancies have actually declined in France as a proportion of all pregnancies carried to term, from 4% to 1.5-2% in the past 10 or 15 years. But in 1986, 42.5% of all induced abortions were performed on adolescents. Among causes of unwanted pregnancy in adolescents are their frequent inability to believe that they may be at risk of pregnancy, or that pregnancy can result from the 1st sexual intercourse. The episodic nature of sexual relations, the lack of ready availability of contraception, and specific shortcomings of different methods are factors in the frequent failure of adolescents to protect themselves against undesired pregnancy. Adolescents may become pregnant out of loneliness or to prove that they are women, or as a result of incest or prostitution. Adolescents who seek abortions are those who have discovered and acknowledged their pregnancies before the 12th week and had the courage to inform their parents and obtain legal permission for the abortion. Pregnancy terminations are more frequent in more advantaged societal sectors with more structured family life. The moral shock and sense of failure associated with abortion are often deeply felt by adolescents. Their experience is greatly influenced by the attitudes of those around them. Adolescents who carry their pregnancies to term are those who have not sought abortion in the 1st 12 weeks. Often they refuse to admit they might be pregnant. But adolescents from disadvantaged environments may wish to continue the pregnancy in order to attain social status. Most parents eventually resign themselves to the pregnancy. Adolescents who are closely monitored usually have normal pregnancies and deliveries. The proportion of adolescent mothers who place their infants for adoption has declined. Most of the infants kept by their mothers are entitled to 2 sets of social prestations, the allowances for the young infant and for single parents. School nurses have an important potential contribution in informing students about sexuality and contraception and in assisting those who become pregnant.",

      "abstract": "Although a couple's sexual relationship evolves over time and is sometimes replaced by other forms of intimacy, it is not true that long-term relationships lack sex altogether. However, it may take more energy and creativity for long-time partners to stimulate themselves and each other and to keep their sexual relationship satisfactory. This article suggests that, although it seems contradictory, development of a more individual, autonomous stance in each partner often fosters the relationship, including sex. Falling in love or extramarital sex can be the catalyst that makes it clear that some fundamental elements are lacking in a long-term relationship. Sometimes couples therapy-or reconsidering the reasons to stay in a marriage in another way-helps to bring a couple together again. In other cases, this is not effective, and divorce can be a necessary next developmental step for one or both partners. For children, divorce is never easy, especially when they are adolescents and in their second separation-individuation stage of development. For adolescents, seeing one or both of their parents fall in love again and start a sexual relationship with someone new can be a confusing and upsetting experience. A case example is offered to illustrate these dynamics.",

      "title": "Sexual objectification and dehumanization: Implications for women’s sexual agency",
      "abstract": "While ideally sexual activities would only take place when mutually desired, many women participate in sex that they do not want. During their lifetimes, between 18% and 25% of women will experience rape or attempted rape, and 50% or more will experience some form of unwanted sexual activity (Gavey & Senn, 2014). The present research tests whether women’s ability to exercise sexual agency is undermined when her internal sense of humanness has been diminished by others thinking of and treating her like an object. In patriarchal cultures, women are chronically sexually objectified: represented as sexual objects, existing primarily for men’s sexual use. Conceptually, objectification implies dehumanization and previous research has found that when people evaluate another person’s appearance, they dehumanize women but not men (Heflick et al., 2011). When women or men are dehumanized by others, they self-dehumanize (i.e., experience diminished human characteristics and feel more object-like) (Andrighetto et al., 2018; Baldissarri et al., 2017; Bastian & Haslam, 2010; Loughnan et al., 2017) and experience diminished agency (Andrighetto et al., 2018; Baldissarri et al., 2017). Building on this previous research, the present research has two goals. Study 1 tests whether women are more commonly viewed as less human than men. In Study 2, experiences of being dehumanized were then examined as a cause of diminished agency (self-reported self-efficacy and sexual agency) due to self dehumanization. Women and men do not experience dehumanization equally. When people focus on another person’s appearance, women are viewed as less human than men; when instructed to focus on their performance or on them as a person, women and men are not viewed differently (Heflick et al., 2011). The conclusion from this research was that women are viewed as less human than men when the focus is on their appearance. Study 1 of the present research tested an alternate hypothesis: that women are generally viewed as less human than men except when the focus is on their personhood. Before viewing a video featuring either a woman or a man, participants were either given no instructions or were asked to focus on one of three things: the subject’s appearance; the subject as a person; or the video. Consistent with the hypothesis, when given no instructions, participants viewed the women as less human than the men (i.e., lower on competence and human characteristics). Study 2 then examined whether being dehumanized impacts women’s sense of their own humanness and, consequently, their sense of agency. After recalling either an experience of having their appearance evaluated by others or an experience of being treated primarily as an instrument in the workplace, women and men rated their internal feelings of humanness. Moderated mediation analyses demonstrated that both situations caused women and men to self-dehumanize and in turn report lower self-efficacy. Contrary to predictions, however, self-dehumanization did not diminish either women’s or men’s sexual agency. Challenges examining sexual agency are discussed.",

Children aged 6 to 16 years were presented with a series of illustrations of three men (one of whom was tattooed), and in each case were requested to decide which individual best fitted a negative (delinquent), positive (prosocial) or neutral description. Results. Participants revealed a strong bias to associate the tattooed individuals with the negative attributes, but little tendency to associate them with the positive or neutral attributes. There was some evidence of an increase in the bias during middle childhood. Conclusions. Children appear to acquire by at least age 6 strong negative stereotypes of persons with tattoos. This has implications for children's performance as witnesses in certain contexts; it also indicates that young people electing to obtain tattoos are aware of the criminal stigma attached to this form of body marking.",

Less common is exploration of the evolution of choosiness or preference strength: i.e., by how much a trait is preferred. We examine both population and quantitative genetic models of the evolution of preferences, specifically developing \"baseline models\" of the evolution of preference strength during the Fisher process. Using a population genetic approach, we find selection for stronger and stronger preferences when trait variation is maintained by mutation. However, this force is quite weak and likely to be swamped by drift in moderately-sized populations. In a quantitative genetic model, unimodal preferences will generally not evolve to be increasingly strong without bounds when male traits are under stabilizing viability selection, but evolve to extreme values when viability selection is directional. Our results highlight that different shapes of fitness and preference functions lead to qualitatively different trajectories for preference strength evolution ranging from no evolution to extreme evolution of preference strength.",

Teenagers from divorced backgrounds were less likely to say that they want to marry compared with teenagers from intact families. However, other indicators reveal that they may in fact marry early as they are more affected by variables associated with early marriage: leaving school; leaving home; and forming serious boyfriend/girlfriend relationships. Daughters of divorce were most affected by these pro-marriage influences. Distinctions are drawn between different groups of children of divorce and between marital attitudes and behaviour. It is suggested that the adolescent's own experience of intimate relationships and cohabitation can overcome negative attitudes to marriage arising from parental divorce.",

      "title": "Male infertility, female fertility and extrapair copulations",
      "abstract": "Females that are socially bonded to a single male, either in a social monogamy or in a social polygyny, are often sexually polyandrous. Extrapair copulations (EPC) have often been suggested or rejected, on both empirical and theoretical grounds, as an important mechanism that enables females to avoid fertility risks in case their socially bonded male is infertile. Here, we explore this possibility in two steps. First, we present a mathematical model that assumes that females have no precopulatory information about male fertility, and shows that a female EPC strategy increases female reproductive success only if certain specific conditions are upheld in the nature of male infertility. In particular, these conditions require both (i) that fertile sperm precedence (FSP) is absent or incomplete within ejaculates of the same male (i.e. that an infertile male is, at least partly, truly infertile), and (ii) the existence of FSP among ejaculates of different males (such that infertile spermatozoa of the infertile male are at a disadvantage when competing against spermatozoa of a fertile male). Second, to evaluate their potential role in the evolution of female EPC, we review the abundance and FSP patterns of the different male infertility types. The conclusion is drawn that some common infertility types, such as poor sperm count or motility, contribute to the evolution of female EPC, whereas other common infertility types, such as sperm depletion or allocation in a social monogamy (but not in a social polygyny), and in particular male driven polyspermy, do not. Also, a deeper look at the arms race between sperm fertilization efficiency and female barriers to sperm may answer the non-trivial question: \"why are some types of infertility so common?\"",

The son was often more significant to the mother, than the husband. In contrast to this maternal intimacy, the father-son relationship was characterized by reciprocal hostility, as well as detachment and rejection by the father. As a result of these disturbing early relationships, there is a life-long persistence of the original feminine identification with the mother, and a search for love from the father or father-surrogate. However, anger and rage at the parents also coexists and is drained off by a considerable degree of psychic masochism. The masochism seeks discharge through homosexual activity 5 . In the treatment of homosexuality with autogenic approaches, the general experience has been that the therapeutic process involves frequent and prolonged periods of neutralization of nonsexual material 4 . The neutralization of mother-related aggression is of major importance. Father-related aggression is secondary and is superseded by the neutralization of death-related traumatic material such as accidents and medical procedures, anxiety provoking religious education, and a variety of inadequate disturbing identifications. In this exploratory study we describe the psychodynamics of two patients who were treated with both analytic psychotherapy and autogenic abreaction (AA). Our primary objective has been to analyze the differences in the understanding of these patients gained through these two different approaches. Since we hypothesized that material gathered during AA is dream-like and more representative of the true mental life of the patients than interpersonal discussion, we were particularly interested in observing patterns present during AA that were not noted during analytic psychotherapy. Method Two homosexual males were treated by two different therapists in analytically oriented psychotherapy and autogenic therapy for nine months. The therapists did not discuss the patients with each other during the course of the study.",

There is a common misbelief that female gamers prefers simple cute easy games so that they are incompetent if higher skill level is required or disqualified to be a winning party member in MMORPG. This pink game theories are the results of video game analysis done in US and Europe way before online games and mobile games become popular thus. there are many evidences that such misconceptions do not hold anymore. However, researches on gender game culture and gender preferences have not been seriously conducted since 2007 in Korea. Thus, in this paper, we surveyed 88 male and 151 female gamers from their late teens to 30s and found a gap between behavior and perception due to serious gender stereotypes. Gender differences are still found in several areas, but the degree of differences were weakened or in different direction from 2007. The game design to attract female gamers should understand such gender gaming culture and gender difference.",

      "abstract": "Conventional knowledge, resulting from observations and experience, maintains the conviction that there are gender differences in the acquisition, preparation and consumption of food.This review shows differences between the sexes in eating behavior, food choice and nutritional strategy which were conditioned by evolution and by intra-individual (biological or psychological) and extra-individual (socioeconomic and cultural) factors.Women manifest a more pronounced trust in healthy nutrition, greater engagement in controlling body weight, a higher tendency to eat in a group and in stressful situations, and they frequently experience frustration due to their own nutritional behaviors, which reflects higher social pressure and their attempts to reduce eating-related pleasure.On the other hand, men prefer fatty meals with a strong taste, and are directed mainly by the pleasure of consumption; they more frequently furtively eat sweet foods while watching television, use more dietary supplements and more frequently visit fast food restaurants.Nutritional behavior, styles of nutrition, dietary profiles, approach to nourishment, approach to the place of meal consumption, and the sources of nutritional knowledge all demonstrate associations with gender.Reciprocal interactions between gender and diet are conditioned by physiological, psychological and sociocultural factors.This system of reciprocal interactions includes feedback: biological sex and cultural gender shape one's diet and, reciprocally, one's diet affects the deepening or flattening of gender differences.The analysis of reciprocally interacting factors entangled in the formation of a nutritional model may also represent an important element of pro-health prophylaxis and should be used in medical and dietary practice.Males in particular should be informed and educated about health-promoting diets.",

Findings demonstrate that implicit and explicit own‐gender preferences emerge early in both boys and girls, but implicit own‐gender preferences are stronger in young girls than boys. In addition, female participants' attitudes remain largely stable over development, whereas male participants' implicit and explicit attitudes show an age‐related shift towards increasing female positivity. Gender attitudes are an anomaly in that social evaluations dissociate from social status, with both male and female participants tending to evaluate female more positively than male.",

      "title": "Homo ludens in the twenty-first century: Towards an understanding of Caillois's paidia in sports",
      "abstract": "Even among participants, physical activity and sport seem run through with paradox—the drive (rather than walk or cycle) to the club match or the gym, the joy of movement and the focus on repetitive regularity and performance in placeless stadia and fitness centres, the claims of an 'endorphine rush' and bliss in a sterile, emotionless place devoid of leisure and in many cases devoid of pleasure. The significance of this paradox may be seen in public health responses to the lack of physical activity as an issue connected to a global rise of obesity, diabetes and other health problems. Many public health policies intended to stimulate physical activity, such as the WHO global physical activity strategy, do not deliver on expectations. As part of the project this chapter draws on, adults were interviewed about play in their life-span. At first it seemed that adults hardly played at all. However, during the interviews it became clear that they did not call their play 'play', so attention shifted from whether they play to what they play: the activity. The presence of the verb to 'play' in sports activities such as 'playing' football or 'playing' tennis indicates that a sport activity cannot exist without being 'played', yet much sport is regulated in ways that undermine playfulness. This discursive characteristic demands that we unravel the concept of play to clarify the role of play in physical activity.",

      "title": "The strategic female: gender-switching and player behavior in online games",
      "abstract": "As players craft and enact identities in digital games, the relationship between player and avatar gender remains unclear. This study examines how 11 in-game chat, movement, and appearance behaviors differed by gender and by men who did and did not use a female avatar – or 'gender-switchers'. Drawing on social role and feminist theories of gender, we argue that gender differences in behavior align with the social roles and norms that establish appropriate and inappropriate behavior for men and women. Thus we complicate questions of 'gender-switching' by examining not only player gender, but also player psychological Gender Role as measured by the Bem Sex Role Inventory to examine how gender does – and does not – manifest in digital worlds. Analysis revealed that men may not necessarily seek to mask their offline gender when they use a female avatar, but there is evidence they do reinforce idealized notions of feminine appearance and communication. Movement behaviors, however, show no differences across men who do and do not gender-switch. That is, selecting avatar gender may be less a matter of identity expression, and more a strategic selection of available multi-modal codes that players take up in their navigation of this digital space.",

      "abstract": "We contrasted the long-term mate preferences, reported developmental experiences, life history traits, and current personal traits of low-income women who reproduced with a single man (n = 222), two or more men (n = 145), or had not yet reproduced (n = 106). The mate preferences of the three groups were more similar than different, suggesting that group differences in reproductive strategy may be more strongly related to developmental experiences and current circumstances than to explicit preferences for one type of reproductive partner or another. Path analytic models revealed that the only direct predictor of number of reproductive mates was age of first reproduction, which in turn was predicted by level of education and age of first sexual intercourse. Age of first intercourse, in turn, was predicted by time spent with father. The pattern suggests paternal investment influences timing of adolescent sexual activity, and timing of this activity can set in motion a long-term reproductive trajectory.",

Sin importar de que estas excepciones a la ley hegemónica de la masculinidad sean un acto hipócrita o no, nos muestran una serie de carencias producto de encarnar este arquetipo de hombre, que la ley masculina además no permite otra forma de satisfacer.

A twofold Masculinity-Femininity scale was used to measure these two variables. The three gender groups were found to differ significantly on both variables. Since the first variable implies acknowledgement of the sex roles placed upon one's gender by the culture, and the second variable implies ability and willingness to fulfill those demands, it is argued that a gender that ranks high on one part of the scale but low on the other, or vice versa, experiences role strain in the area of sex roles. By this methodology, females were found to experience much role strain, males and transsexuals little. It is argued that the latter group, unlike females, is hereby shown to have made a relatively satisfactory adjustment in this area.",

Of interest is how these women construct their sexual identities across the transition to parenthood-a period associated with intensified heteronormative expectations, and changes in women's roles and identities. This longitudinal study of 28 plurisexual, male-partnered women examined women's sexual identity construction across the first year of parenthood, using four waves of data. Most women were White, bisexual-identified, and first-time parents. The majority of women described decreases in the salience or centrality of their sexuality more generally. Almost all women continued to hold plurisexual identities across the first year of parenthood, although many described these as private identities amidst public assumptions of heterosexuality. Some, though, sought to maintain a connection to their plurisexual identities through sexual identity disclosure, same-gender fantasies, and involvement in consensual nonmonogamy. Although only one woman articulated a shift in sexual identity label (from bicurious to heterosexual), others increasingly distanced themselves from their same-gender behaviors and desires. Our findings illustrate how women engage in an active process of sexual identity construction amidst heteronormative pressures, and how they navigate tensions amongst their partnership and parenthood statuses and their private identities and past behaviors.",

      "abstract": "Gender norms can lead men to shy away from traditionally female roles and occupations in communal HEED domains (Healthcare, Early Education, Domestic sphere) that do not fit within the social construct of masculinity. But to what extent do men underestimate the degree to which other men are accepting of men in these domains? Building on research related to social norms and pluralistic ignorance, the current work investigated whether men exhibit increased communal orientations when presented with the true norms regarding men's communal traits and behaviors versus their perceived faulty norms. Study 1 (N = 64) revealed that young Belgian men indeed perceive their peers to hold more traditional norms regarding communal and agentic traits than their peers actually hold. Study 2 (N = 319) presented young Belgian men with the data collected in Study 1 to manipulate exposure to men's actual normative beliefs (i.e., what men truly think), their perceived norms (i.e., what men believe other men think), or a no information control. When men were presented with actual rather than perceived norms, they altered their own self-descriptions, future behavioral intentions, and broader gender-related social attitudes in a more communal direction. In particular, men who were presented with information about men's actual beliefs regarding the compatibility between communal and agentic traits exhibited the strongest movement towards a more communal orientation. The findings show that participants in conditions that uncover pluralistic ignorance adapted their attitudes and behaviors to be more in line with the actual norm: adopting a more communal self-concept, having lower intentions to hide future communal engagement, and supporting more progressive gender-related social change. The results are discussed in terms of influences of norms on men's communal orientations and broader attitudes towards gender-related social change, and the down-stream implications for increased gender-equality in HEED domains where men remain highly underrepresented.",

We follow this theoretical approach in an analysis of the sexual attitudes, beliefs and behaviors of over 13,000 12 to 19 year olds who participated in a sexual education program promoting abstinence until marriage. Factor analyses of this survey data revealed a general factor – Sexual Restrictiveness – hypothesized to be a dimension of the life history strategy and that underlies a variety of self-reported sexual beliefs and attitudes. The corresponding responses include expressed intentions to abstain from sex, endorsed personal and social reasons to refrain from sex, positive attitudes towards teenage abstinence, and lack of endorsement of positive aspects of sex; related responses perceived refusal skills regarding sex, endorsed health reasons to abstain from sex, and religiosity. As expected, lower scores on the Sexual Restrictedness factor were associated with more frequent endorsement of sexual behavior, even when statistically controlling for age and gender. The relation between these sexual attitudes and reported sexual behaviors and life history evolution in humans is discussed.",

They hypothesized that the child's approaches to the mother \nare met with disapproval or rebuff together with actual or imaginary \nridicule, threat, or punishment. The child then attempts to seduce \nthe aggressor, thereby averting the catastrophe of loss of love. Thus, \nlibidinal attachment becomes intimately associated with aggression, \nleading toward a special type of sexuality. As a result of various types \nof excessive stimulation or other unpleasure induced by the mother, \nthe parent has become the aggressor and the child the protomaso­\nchist in this interchange, and the child's potential for investing \nnormal aggression in the parent has been modified. Does this shift \nlay the basis for the development of masochism, providing a means of \nsurvival against the danger of parental aggression?

      "title": "Liminal identities: Caribbean men who have sex with men in London, UK",
      "abstract": "Abstract Accounts by 10 Caribbean men who have sex with men living in the UK reveal them to be liminal beings with unstable and unresolved identities. They are between social states: aware they are not heterosexual and not publicly recognised, or in some cases self‐accepted, as homosexual. Caribbean‐born respondents especially suffer from homophobia, expressing regret and disappointment at their sexuality. They may also experience cognitive dissonance – as they are aware of their conflict with the heteronormative order – they cannot resolve. Religion contributes to homophobia and cognitive dissonance particularly for Caribbean‐born men, some of whom may believe a fundamental conflict exists between Christianity and homosexuality. Heterosexism and homophobia contribute to and reinforce their liminal state, by preventing transition to publicly recognised homosexual status. Respondents may engage in private and public, internal and external, overt and covert policing of their and other gay men's behaviour: through strategic pretence at heterosexuality and/or condemnation of men engaging in behaviour identifiable as stereotypically homosexual, for example. Narratives point to the need to complexify the conventional understanding of Jamaican heterosexism to explain reported variations in the degree of anti‐homosexual hostility in the country. Résumé Les récits de 10 hommes originaires de la Caraïbe, ayant des rapports avec des hommes et vivant au Royaume Uni, révèlent que ces hommes sont des personnes liminales, avec des identités instables et non résolues. Ils évoluent d'un état à l'autre : conscients qu'ils ne sont pas hétérosexuels, et non reconnus publiquement ou, dans certains cas, ne s'acceptant pas en tant qu'homosexuels. Les répondants natifs de la Caraïbe sont ceux qui souffrent le plus de l'homophobie et expriment des regrets et de la déception par rapport à leur sexualité. Ils peuvent aussi expérimenter une dissonance cognitive – conscients qu'ils sont de leur situation conflictuelle par rapport à l'ordre hétéronormatif – qu'ils ne peuvent résoudre. La religion contribue à l'homophobie et à la dissonance cognitive, en particulier pour les hommes nés dans la Caraïbe, dont certains peuvent croire qu'il existe un conflit fondamental entre le christianisme et l'homosexualité. L'hétérosexisme et l'homophobie contribuent à leur état liminal et à renforcer celui‐ci, en empêchant leur transition vers un statut d'homosexuel reconnu publiquement. Les répondants peuvent se livrer à un contrôle, en privé et en public, interne et externe, manifeste et secret, de leurs comportements d'hommes gays et de celui d'autres hommes gays : par exemple, en employant la stratégie de prétendre qu'ils sont hétérosexuels et/ou de condamner les hommes dont les comportements sont des stéréotypes de comportements homosexuels. Les récits mettent l'accent sur la nécessité de complexifier l'explication conventionnelle de l'hétérosexisme jamaïcain, afin d'expliquer les variations des degrés d'hostilité envers les homosexuels dans ce pays. Resumen Los relatos de 10 hombres caribeños que tienen relaciones sexuales con otros hombres que viven en el Reino Unido revelan que son seres liminales con identidades inestables y sin resolver. Estos hombres se encuentran entre diferentes estados sociales: son conscientes de que no son heterosexuales, pero la sociedad no los reconoce como homosexuales o en algunos casos ellos mismos no se aceptan como tales. Los entrevistados nacidos en el Caribe sufren sobre todo homofobia, y muestran tener remordimientos y estar decepcionados por su sexualidad. Dado que son conscientes de su conflicto con el orden heteronormativo también pueden padecer disonancia cognitiva, que no pueden resolver. La religión contribuye a la homofobia y la disonancia cognitiva especialmente en hombres de origen caribeño, algunos de los cuales podrían creer que existe un conflicto fundamental entre el cristianismo y la homosexualidad. El heterosexismo y la homofobia contribuyen y refuerzan el estado liminal al impedir que pasen a ser reconocidos públicamente como homosexuales. A veces los entrevistados participan en un escrutinio privado y público, interno y externo, abierto y cubierto de su conducta, y la de otros, como hombres homosexuales: por ejemplo, fingiendo de forma estratégica ser heterosexuales y/o condenando a hombres que participan en conductas que se pueden identificar como estereotípicamente homosexuales. Los relatos apuntan que es necesario entender la complejidad que existe más allá del concepto convencional del heterosexismo jamaicano para explicar las variaciones de los relatos en lo que respecta a la hostilidad antihomosexual en el país.

      "title": "Emotion and Gender Typicality Cue Sexual Orientation Differently in Women and Men",
      "abstract": "Abstract Heterosexual individuals tend to look and act more typical for their gender compared to gay and lesbian individuals, and people use this information to infer sexual orientation. Consistent with stereotypes associating happy expressions with femininity, previous work found that gay men displayed more happiness than straight men—a difference that perceivers used, independent of gender typicality, to judge sexual orientation. Here, we extended this to judgments of women’s sexual orientation. Like the gender-inversion stereotypes applied to men, participants perceived women’s faces manipulated to look angry as more likely to be lesbians; however, emotional expressions largely did not distinguish the faces of actual lesbian and straight women. Compared to men’s faces, women’s faces varied less in their emotional expression (appearing invariably positive) but varied more in gender typicality. These differences align with gender role expectations requiring the expression of positive emotion by women and prohibiting the expression of femininity by men. More important, greater variance within gender typicality and emotion facilitates their respective utility for distinguishing sexual orientation from facial appearance. These findings thus provide the first evidence for contrasting cues to women’s and men’s sexual orientation and suggest that gender norms may uniquely shape how men and women reveal their sexual orientation.",

      "title": "On sexual behavior and sex-role reversal",
      "abstract": "Sex is not about reproduction; sex is about (re-)combination of DNA. Sex, not reproduction, always involves physical contact between two individuals; to achieve this, strategies of sexual behavior evolved. Sexual behavior, therefore, did not evolve as part of a reproductive strategy, but evolved to enable exchange of genetic material. In multicellular organisms the situation is more complicated than in unicellular organisms, as it is impossible for each cell within a multicellular body to have sex with another cell. Hence, evolution selected a system in which the possibility to have sex was limited to only one cell-line: the germ cells. As a result, sex adopted the character of fertilization, and sex and reproduction became inseparably linked. Still, in some species, including humans, sexual behavior still exhibits features of its evolutionary past: in humans (like in bonobo's) most sexual activity and many sexual behavioral patterns have nothing to do with reproduction (masturbation, homosexual behavior, for example); in humans, sexual behavior also became associated with other strategic objectives, such as intensifying the pair bond, expression of love or power. Different genders - male and female - evolved, and each gender evolved typical gender-related sexual and reproductive strategies as well. In most multicellular species, these strategies became inextricably mixed, and sexual behavior increasingly more - and in most species even exclusively - 'served' the interests of reproduction: sexual behavior became more or less synonymous with reproductive behavior. In most species, the 'mix' of sexual and reproductive strategies evolved into typical gender-related patterns of behavior, that is, in typical 'sex-roles'. Often, males are bigger and more 'beautiful' (= more intensely ornamented) than females; males compete with each other for access to females; males court females, while females choose males ('female choice'). However, ecological circumstances may cause a reversal of sex-roles, resulting in a situation in which females are bigger and more intensely ornamented than males, females compete for access to males, females court males and only males invest in care for the young, provided they are relatively certain of their paternity. Also, as in the case of the spotted hyena, females may be highly virilized and be socially dominant. This 'sex-role reversal' is seen, e.g., when males are relatively rare due to high predation pressure, or when the process of reproduction is very risky for the same reason: then it is 'better' that males, with their plenty of sperm, are wasted, than females with their few, precious eggs. It can be argued, with women being the fair sex, exhibiting competitive behavior and with an actively displaying courtship, and with men investing heavily in their offspring, meanwhile taking all (cultural) kinds of measures to guarantee their paternity, that humans, too, exhibit some degree of sex-role reversal.",

      "title": "[Psychosociology of the demand for abortion].",
      "abstract": "3 preliminary observations are relevant to an analysis of the psychosociology of abortion. All pregnancies, regardless of the outcome, are meaningful for the woman and/or the couple. On the other hand, the debate for or against abortion is meaningless to the extent that most women seeking abortions are to some degree \"against\" abortion. Finally, beyond a certain point the use of contraception and the demand for abortion are not related, as shown by the stability of abortion rates in France over the past 20 years during which rates of contraceptive usage changed greatly and by the high level of contraceptive information among women seeking repeat abortions. In the psychic realm, being pregnant is positive if only as a indication of the power to become pregnant. It is known that women suffering a recent loss are more likely to become pregnant. PRegnancy under circumstances of loss or mourning signifies that something other than death or loss is possible. The idea of pregnancy as a compensation for loss can refer to a range of situations such as death of a close relative, end of a union, divorce, unemployment, or educational or professional failure, to name a few. The unconscious utilization of pregnancy as a proof of power can be repeated each time doubt arises as to the reality of this power. Not pregnancy, but bringing a child into the world is what is impossible in voluntary pregnancy termination. Abortion is chosen because it allows the mother or the couple to avoid an investment for which they are unprepared. Becoming a mother means to stop being a child and also forces an encounter with the images of one's own parents internalized during childhood. Such images are not always good, which caused problems in the psychic work of identification with the parent that accompanies childbirth. Choosing to have a child and joining the chain of generations is impossible for some persons, because the filiation is too difficult or the parental images are too negative. Abortions, like the occurrence of the pregnancies that lead to them, are always meaningful, although their significance may not be consciously grasped by the woman. On the societal level, abortion may signal resistance to the medicalization and perhaps politicization of sexuality. The perceived high economic cost of children and desire to provide them with abundance may be other factors in the demand for abortion. To some degree children are now valued by society primarily as a potential market. Study of the origins of abortion is not specific, but fundamental to an understanding of human reproduction in general.",

      "title": "Başarı Yönelimlerindeki Cinsiyet Farklılıklarının Akademik Seçim ve Edinimlere Dönük Etkileri",
      "abstract": "Review of the relevant literature indicates that girls, relative to boys, have less confidence in their ability to succeed in challenging and difficult intellectual tasks. Moreover, the results of many studies show that girls are more likely than boys to show the helpless pattern of achievement-related beliefs and behaviors. It is indicated that girls are more likely than boys to use insufficient ability as an explanation for failure, but are less likely than boys to use ability as an explanation for their success. Girls show a stronger tendency than boys to view their successes as due to the external and uncontrollable factors such as luck, which implies some uncertainty about their ability to succeed in the future. Furthermore, it is argued that since girls attribute their failures to factors that are stable and beyond their control (particularly insufficient ability), in the face of difficulty, they tend to lower their expectations for future successes. Girls' lowering of their expectations results in avoidance of difficult and complex task situations that hold the threat of failure. Culturally defined sex-role stereotypes, gender-based parental expectations and orientation along with the early childhood experiences are indicated to be the basic environmental social factors contributing to the girls’ lower level of self confidence. Such social and cultural factors, as associated with the teachers by given negative feedback and treatment in the classroom, will in turn contribute to the girls’ failure to develop the achievement orientations necessary to succeed later on in really challenging intellectual areas. Mathematics constitutes the best example of such challenging intellectual areas. Beginning in the late elementary school years, mathematics appears to be an area, where, regardless of one’s aptitudes, one is likely to confront novel and confusing material. To enjoy and perform in mathematics well one must be able to maintain one’s confidence and concentration in the face of novelty and in the face of failure. This is precisely the kind ofsituation which is not suitable for the confidence level and achievement orientations of girls, but rather for those of boys. In this case, girls tend to orientate towards the verbal areas, where once the basic skills, such as reading, writing, spelling and vocabulary have been acquired, increments in difficulty tend to be gradual. Furthermore, the clarity of the correctness criterion in mathematics is indicated to make that area attractive andfacilitative to boys but not to girls. All these factors act together to make mathematics more compatible with the achievement orientations of boys, and verbal areas more compatible with the achievement orientations of girls. As a result of this early intellectual ability differentiation between boys and girls, it is seen that during the subsequent years of education most of the mathematics-based science and technical options of the academic world are being occupied by the men. In a cultural context, wherever the parents and teachers themselves are probably unaware of their own expectations, orientations and behaviors that sustain and reinforce conformity to sex-role stereotypes, it is quite difficult to eliminate the differences between the self-confidence, achievement orientation, intellectual ability and academic achievement levels of boys and girls, since these differences are encouraged and developed by such sex-role stereotypes.",

      "abstract": "Evolution of male life histories and age-dependent sexual signals under female choiceSexual selection theory models evolution of sexual signals and preferences using simple life histories.However, life-history models predict that males benefit from increasing sexual investment approaching old age, producing age-dependent sexual traits.Age-dependent traits require time and energy to grow, and will not fully mature before individuals enter mating competition.Early evolutionary stages pose several problems for these traits.Agedependent traits suffer from strong viability selection and gain little benefit from mate choice when rare.Few males will grow large traits, and they will rarely encounter choosy females.The evolutionary origins of age-dependent traits therefore remain unclear.I used numerical simulations to analyze evolution of preferences, condition (viability) and traits in an agestructured population.Traits in the model depended on age and condition (\"good genes\") in a population with no genetic drift.I asked (1) if age-dependent indicator traits and their preferences can originate depending on the strength of selection and the size of the trait; (2) which mode of development (age-dependent versus age-independent) eventually predominates when both modes occur in the population; and (3) if age-independent traits can invade a population with age-dependent traits.Age-dependent traits evolve under weaker selection and at smaller sizes than age-independent traits.This result held in isolation and when the types co-occur.Evolution of age-independent traits depends only on trait size, whereas evolution of age-dependent traits depends on both strength of selection and growth rate.Invasion of age-independence into populations with established traits followed a similar pattern with age-dependence predominating at small trait sizes.I suggest that reduced adult mortality facilitates sexual selection by favoring the evolution of age-dependent sexual signals under weak selection.",

      "abstract": "Some important psychosocial factors which lead to unwanted pregnancies -- fear, embarrassment, conflicting priorities, and subconscious motivation -- are reviewed along with the need for nurses to be aware of their own attitudes about contraception and sexuality when counseling clients about contraception. Individuals may hesitate to use effective contraceptive methods because of reported side effects or because they fear the judgmental attitudes of others. Embarrassment about discussing anything related to sexuality or having a medical examination can mean a woman will avoid certain contraceptive methods. Frequently, contraceptive use is subordinated to some other concern, reflecting a lack of maturity, an inability to focus objectively or to plan, to assume responsibility, to accept one's own behavior. Priorities commonly affecting contraceptive use include: the \"nice girls don't\" ideology; \"it won't happen to me;\" \"excitement is taking risks;\" loneliness; and crises and pressures. Although pregnancy may be rejected when it actually happens, it may be desired in part. The desire for pregnancy may be operating at a subconscious level. Additionally, pregnancy may be used to deal with or avoid conflicts in relationships, to ease guilt, or to make up for losses. Nurses counseling clients in family planning clinics can help their clients do a cost/benefit analysis of contraceptive use and pregnancy should it occur. A way to help women explore their available options is group sessions. Nurses should be aware of the goals of family planning work and help each client explore for herself the ramifications of the use of each of the available contraceptive methods.",

Research on the development of gender identity and its relation to the development of play offers evidence that preference for gender typed toys occurs prior to gender identity, but is incorporated as part of the child’s gender schema during the third year of life. Some researchers have found that children begin to engage in sex-differentiated play before they are able to use gender labels. The chapter examines how the sequence of play behaviors interacts with the child’s developing gender identity. Many cultures maintain gender segregation through adult-directed separation of the sexes. In industrialized countries, preschools are rarely organized with the specific goal of promoting gender segregation.",

As in previous work, heterosexuals' responses to a forced-choice question about hypothetical infidelity yielded a gender difference. However, no gender differences were found when participants recalled personal experiences with a mate's actual infidelity. Men and women, regardless of sexual orientation, on average focused more on a mate's emotional infidelity than on a mate's sexual infidelity. Responses to hypothetical infidelity were uncorrelated with reactions to actual infidelity. This finding casts doubt on the validity of the hypothetical measures used in previous research.",

We find equal proportions of males and females as first-time coaches, and limited evidence that males inherit slightly worse teams. Also, when hired, males are older and have more experience. Males have slightly higher winning percentages for the first few seasons of coaches’ tenures. Furthermore, we find no difference in survival; it is independent of sex and largely determined by performance. Thus, we find female coaches are not held to higher promotion or retention standards in the WNBA.",

      "title": "The link between early adolescents' gender discrimination and gender attitudes about peers: Does gender similarity matter?",
      "abstract": "Abstract Gender is one of the most salient social identities, particularly during early adolescence. However, factors related to adolescents' gender attitudes remain underexamined. We examined links between adolescents' gender discrimination, felt‐gender similarity, and intergroup gender attitudes. Participants were 270 adolescents in the United States ( M age = 12.95 years, SD = 1.33; 47.4% adolescent girls; 63.7% White, 12.2% Latinx, 10.7% Black, 4.1% Asian, 5.6% multiracial, and 3% indigenous). Path analyses showed that gender discrimination negatively predicted adolescents' attitudes towards own‐ and other‐gender peers. Felt own‐gender similarity positively predicted own‐gender attitudes as expected, but other‐gender similarity did not predict other‐gender attitudes. Further, own‐ and other‐gender similarity did not interact to predict adolescents' gender attitudes. However, adolescents' attitudes towards other‐gender peers were more negatively impacted by gender discrimination for those who felt highly similar to own‐gender peers than for those with average or low own‐gender similarity. Findings inform potential strategies to improve adolescents' gender attitudes.",

      "title": "Adolescents as victims of family violence. Council on Scientific Affairs, American Medical Association",
      "abstract": "Adolescents experience maltreatment at rates equal to or exceeding those of younger children. Recent increases in reported cases of maltreatment have occurred disproportionately among older children and adolescents. However, adolescents are less likely to be reported to child protective services and are more likely to be perceived as responsible for their maltreatment. Adolescent girls are reported as victims more often than boys, especially in sexual abuse. However, boys may be less likely to be identified or reported and often are abused by nonfamily members. Parents of adolescent victims have higher average income and educational levels and are less likely to have a parental history of abuse than parents of younger children. A wide range of serious adolescent risk behaviors is associated with maltreatment. These include increased risk of premature sexual activity, unintended pregnancy, emotional disorders, suicide attempts, eating disorders, alcohol and other drug abuse, and delinquent behavior. Incarcerated youth, homeless or runaway youth, and youth who victimize siblings or assault parents have been shown to have high rates of prior maltreatment. Signs of maltreatment are often ambiguous for adolescents. Screening questions have been effective in prompting self-disclosure of abuse. Adolescents also experience problems in the child welfare system that offers fewer and less appropriate services for this age group. Recommendations are made regarding screening of adolescents for maltreatment, the development of better services for adolescents, research on parenting to prevent maltreatment, and training of school staff to identify and refer victims of maltreatment.",

In general, Pakistani children prefer extroverted over introverted, practical over imaginative, and organized over flexible styles. Although their preference for thinking and feeling styles is balanced, gender differences are significant. Males generally prefer a thinking style and females generally prefer a feeling style. Gender and age differences are found on practical-imaginative and organized-flexible styles. Cross-national differences are found on practical-imaginative and organized-flexible styles. In contrast to children in the US, children in Pakistan are more likely to prefer practical and organized styles.",

The major purposes of this research were to examine gender differences in emotional reactions (pleasure, anxiety, and guilt) to first intercourse and to test possible explanations for these gender differences. Based on data collected from 1,659 college students who had had sexual intercourse, we found that men reported experiencing more pleasure and anxiety than did women, whereas men reported experiencing less guilt than did women. Men's greater subjective pleasure in response to first intercourse was explained, in part, by their greater likelihood of having an orgasm. Similar gender differences in emotional reactions were found regardless of the stage and length of the relationship in which first intercourse occurred; both genders reported more pleasure, more anxiety, and less guilt when sex occurred in a close relationship than in a casual one. However, continuing involvement in the relationship was associated with a pleasurable reaction for women. Other ways in which gender was related to the first intercourse experience are also presented.",

      "title": "SEX-LINKED INHERITANCE IN MENTAL DEFICIENCY",
      "abstract": "1. Mental deficiency seems to be consistently more common in the male than in the female sex. 2. This is most strikingly shown in opposite-sex twins. Among 27 pairs of opposite-sex twins, both had mental deficiency in 11 instances, the male alone in 11 instances, and the female alone in 5 instances. 3. It appears in a similarly consistent way that girls make a slightly better showing than boys in intelligence tests and in scholastic record. 4. These facts suggest that gene factors of intelligence may in some cases be carried in the X-chromosomes and not only in the autosomes; or, in other words, that there may be a sex-linked factor in some cases in the genetic history of mental deficiency and of general intelligence. 5. In order to make the simplest provision in biological symbols and formulas for a sex-linked factor, it is necessary to assume the existence of six possible types of males, nine types of females, and 54 types of mating. 6. Theoretically, from 38 of these types of mating only normal offspring can result. 7. The mentally deficient offspring that may result from eight other types of mating may be expected to be eqaully distributed in the two sexes, as far as the possible influence of any sex-linked factor is concerned. 8. Only male mentally deficient offspring can result from the remaining eight types of mating. 9. Among phenotypes it is, of course, impossible to distinguish the various genotypes represented in the symbols and formulas listed in this paper. However, it may be readily deduced from the formulas that when both parents are mentally deficient or when the father alone is mentally deficient, an equal distribution of mental deficiency in the two sexes of offspring may be expected. When both parents are normal or when the mother alone is mentally deficient, then, too, mentally deficient offspring of both sexes may result; but their distribution will not be equal in the two sexes, for the cases in which a sex-linked factor may be operative will be included in this part of the material. Here, according to theory, any relative excess of mental deficiency in the male sex must be, at least in part, attributed to a sex-linked factor. 10. A re-investigation of a part of Goddard's published material, selected by reason of relevancy to the questions raised in this contribution, bears out the assumption of a sex-linked factor in the genetic history of mental deficiency. The general relative excess of mental deficiency in the male sex is, however, greater than can be accounted for by this factor; to some extent it must be attributed to some other factor or factors.",

      "abstract": "The author's depth interviews with students of the University of Nis checked for the possibility of receptivity to sexual stereotypes and conditioning of sexual/gender socialization by sexual group affiliation. Examined the experiences and attitudes of students of both sexes regarding early gender socialization and it's characteristically stereotypes, stereotypes about dressing, instrumentalization of sexuality, the influence of parents/environment on the formation of sexual morality, own the gender socialization in the family, twin rules for the socialization of children of different gender and sex/gender roles in marriage. Belonging to the sex group has no effect on susceptibility to sexual stereotypes regarding early gender socialization and dressing. Difference may be seen in the effort to comment on and evaluate the wear behavior of girls more than a young man dressing, which may be an indicator for further research had sexual dimorphism in terms of dressing and nudity. It seems that the experience of respondents of both sexes are dependent primarily from the general family atmosphere (closeness, openness to communicate with each other, the absence of the traditional gender division of roles in the family/emotional distance from the parent of the opposite sex or of both parents, the rigidity, the strict division of gender roles in the family). In the first case, where both parents are involved in the upbringing of the child, relationships are intimate with both, and vice versa. Therefore, we can conclude about the lack of connection between the sex of the child and separated upbringing (traditional: the mother confides sexual education of women, a father of male child) in the first case, and a link to another should only check to prove it. Sex does not condition susceptibility to stereotypes about education and gender roles. Traditionally, transitional and modern attitudes are equally represented in subjects of both sexes.",

      "abstract": "Anxiety is defined as fear or worry to a perceived, imminent challenge or threat either in the present or the future. The experience would be an exaggeration in the perception of situational threats. This may cause muscular tension and guarded behaviors. The prevalence of anxiety among adults in Pakistan is 34% (range 29-66% for women and 10-33% for men).1 There is a high prevalence of anxiety in adolescents more in male gender, 22.5% 2, and an estimate of 65% in the shelter homes and 51% in the community samples of children.3 Variation in anxiety is attributable to the difference in perception and symptoms related to a threatening situation. For example, Generalized Anxiety is characterized by excessive worry about numerous things. In Social Anxiety the individual is fearful or avoidant of social interaction and situations that involve the possibility of being scrutinized. Separation Anxiety refers to fear of separation from an attachment figure. Stage Fright is characterized by a consistent failure to speak at public occasions. Among students it is common to experience Exam or Performance Anxiety, which falls under the umbrella of generalized anxiety disorder. Performance anxiety presents with worries about failure in regards to accomplishing something specific or a fear of failing to perform effectively in similar situations. It is generally noted that anxious students perform poorly and are less motivated in highly evaluated exam situations as compared to a relaxed student.4 Multiple factors can lead to the development of anxiety among students negatively impacting their performance that include; self-doubt, insufficient preparation, fear of scrutiny, and facing failure.5 Anxiety is curable and at the same time treatable. Anxiety gets worse when not attended to by engaging with appropriate services. Among students, clarity in their study goals and a stepwise approach towards their future goals can help ease the burden and the tension (anxiety) about it. A good routine and healthy eating habits have always been noted with mental well-being. Conducting a self-evaluation to determine one’s strengths and areas for improvement and adopting a clear, feasible study plan coupled with consistency has been proven very effective.",

Whereas, in our previous research we found that it took very intimate or repeated sexual behaviour before participants would label a historically heterosexual woman bisexual, we found that a man was labelled bisexual for almost all same-sex sexual behaviours and emotions. In a second study, we found that historically heterosexual males were rated higher on a sexual continuum (1=heterosexual; 10=gay/lesbian) than females for the identical same-sex sexual behaviours suggesting confirmation of the ‘one and done’ rule. However, the mean ratings for both sexes fell within the bisexual range. The findings are discussed in relation to a more nuanced understanding of the one and done rule, specifically, and in terms of bisexual erasure in general.",

      "title": "Athletic Style of Dress and Perceived Social Distance",
      "abstract": "One hundred and fifteen college and university students participated in a study of the relationship between perceived style of dress (casual, athletic, fashionable) and social distance. Results of an analysis of variance showed that, independent of their own preferred dress style, respondents reported the greatest social distance between themselves and others who dressed in an athletic style. Furthermore, it was found that men generally perceived greater social distance than did women. In social interactions, people occasionally form impressions of others on the basis of minimal evidence. In such cases, they go beyond observed behaviour to infer qualities they believe the others are likely to possess, and form stereotypes. In stereotyping, individuals are grouped together indiscriminately on the basis of some noticeable characteristic such as skin colour, ethnic background, or religious preference, and treated as if they possessed other qualities common to that group. Of course, stereotyping is not restricted to racially, ethnically, or religiously prejudiced people; other distinctions such as body build, physical or mental disability, mental illness, occupation, hair colour, and style of dress, may also serve as the basis for stereotyping (Wallace, 1971). When a stereotype is negative, the persons affected may become the object of prejudice. This prejudice, in turn, increases social distance (Bryan, Coleman, Ganong, & Bryan, 1986). One group that for years has been susceptible to stereotyping on college and university campuses is student-athletes. Fellow students and faculty tend to waver from being enthusiastic fans to holding disdainful stereotypes of this group (e.g., Adler & Adler, 1985; Blinde & Taub, 1992; Edwards, 1984; Elman & McKelvie, 2003; Engstrom & Sedlacek, 1991, 1993; Engstrom, Sedlacek, & McEwen, 1995; Hamilton & Trolier, 1986; Lapchick, 2000; Sellers, 1992; Shriberg & Brodzinski, 1984; Zingg, 1982). These include assumptions that athletes are dumb jocks who have a literacy problem and rob university admission slots from academically deserving peers. They are narcissistic, demand privileges, are socially inept, and lack contact with the campus community. They fight during games, in bars, and on campus. They have a problem with drugs and alcohol abuse. The males are perpetrators of sexual aggression and the females are mannish, failed heterosexuals. Although these perceptions do not necessarily reflect reality (Lapchick, 2000), they persist and suggest that many students hold negative attitudes toward their athletic peers. The present study addressed the question whether or not negative attitudes towards athletes generalize to other people (not necessarily athletes) who dress in a sportive fashion (i.e., clothing of or related to sports), with the result that others perceive a greater social distance between themselves and those wearing such attire. Human beings appear to have a natural inclination to form groups; they value membership in some groups (in-groups: groups one belongs to and identifies with) and avoid membership in others (out-groups: groups one does not belong to or identify with). They want to be perceived by others as belonging to a particular group and adopt symbols of that group in order to be recognized as such. One of these symbols is style of dress. Satrapa, Melhado, Coelho, Otta, Taubemblatt, and Siqueira (1992) noted that people choose their clothes while keeping their social meaning in mind. Dress style conveys information not only about such matters as age, gender, personality traits, socioeconomic status, values, and political ideologies, but also about interpersonal attitudes such as aggressiveness, gracefulness, arrogance, and so forth. Dion, Bersheid, and Walster (1972) suggested that if there is an association between individuals' internal characteristics and their appearances, then there are stereotypes about personal characteristics based on appearance. …",

      "abstract": "Despite a large body of literature on the development of sexual orientation, little is known about why some gay men have been (or remain) married to a woman. In the current study, a self-selected sample of 43 never married gay men ('never married') and 26 gay men who were married to a woman ('previously married') completed a self-report questionnaire. Hypotheses were based on five possible explanations for gay men's marriages: (a) differences in sexual orientation (i.e., bisexuality); (b) internalized homophobia; (c) religious intolerance; (d) confusion created because of childhood/adolescent sexual experiences; and/or (e) poor psychological adjustment. Previously married described their families' religious beliefs as more fundamentalist than never married. No differences were found between married' and never married' ratings of their sexual orientation and identity, and levels of homophobia and self-depreciation. Family adaptability and family cohesion and the degree to which respondents reported having experienced child maltreatment did not distinguish between previously married and never married. The results highlight how little is understood of the reasons why gay men marry, and the need to develop an adequate theoretical model.",

      "title": "Do Cooperators Exit More Readily than Defectors?",
      "abstract": "Standard prisoners' dilemma games offer players the binary choice between cooperating and defecting, but in a related game there is the third possibility of leaving the game altogether. We conceptualize exiting as taking the individual beyond the reach of externalities generated in the original group, and on that basis—together with the assumption of self-interested (dollar-maximizing) behavior on the part of all players—we derive the prediction that the exit option will drain the community or group more of cooperators than of defectors. But experimental data do not support this prediction; cooperators do not leave more frequently than defectors and, in fact, there is evidence that defectors are more prone to leave than cooperators. We consider and reject the possibility that this failure of prediction results from the (admitted) greater optimism of cooperators about the incidence of cooperation “here,” and present data supporting the hypothesis that cooperators often stay when their personal interest is with exiting because of the same ethical or group-regarding impulse that (presumably) led them to cooperate in the first place. Cooperation can be produced for a group or community either by inducing people to cooperate or by inducing those who are going to cooperate to stay in the game, and ethical considerations seem to underlie the decision to stay as well as the decision to cooperate while staying.",

Findings revealed that, in general, children reached divisions while using a preponderance of constructive problem‐solving strategies, rather than contentious tactics. The degree of conflict of interests and the quality of sibling relationships predicted the children's use of problem‐solving and contentious negotiation strategies, and was related to the types of resolutions achieved. Dyads experiencing low conflict of interests resolved their differences quickly. High conflict of interests coupled with positive relationships and constructive negotiation resulted in longer negotiations and creative, agreeable resolutions. High conflict of interests coupled with more negative relationships and destructive negotiations resulted in children's failures to reach agreement. Developmental differences indicated that older siblings within the pairs took the lead in negotiation, and benefited slightly more from the divisions. Furthermore, children in older dyads were more sophisticated and other oriented in their negotiations.",

      "title": "Sexual partner preferences: Evolutionary imperative, emotional attachment or hedonism?",
      "abstract": "Data are taken from a representative sample of the Australian\r\npopulation to determine the qualities that are desired in a sexual\r\npartner. These qualities are considered in three categories: those reflecting\r\nthe perceived reproductive value of the partner (evolutionary imperative),\r\nthe emotional attachment to a partner and the pure pleasure\r\nassociated with having sex. Subjects completed a telephone-based survey(876 males; 908 females; aged 18-59). The qualities respondents report\r\nthey most desire in a sexual partner are that the person is someone who\r\ncares about them, and whom they love. They also rank highly the criterion\r\nthat their partner should enjoy sex, and much less highly that they\r\nthemselves should enjoy the sex. Evolutionary imperatives are ranked\r\nfairly low as criteria sought in a sexual partner. Males and females generally\r\nexpressed similar preferences in a sexual partner, as do persons\r\nin different age groups, and persons in different marital status categories.\r\nHeterosexual males appear to place a higher emphasis on the physical\r\nappearance of a partner when compared with non-heterosexuals.",

      "title": "‘It’s the sport that counts’: On homosexual participation in sports in the Netherlands",
      "abstract": "Statistical data on participation in sports reveal differences related to personal characteristics and background factors, such as age, education and ethnicity. Less is known, however, about possible relationships between participation in sports and sexual preferences. Although qualitative research has shown that especially homosexual men experience barriers that deter them from participating in (organized) sports, it is not known to what extent lesbian women and gay men participate in sport in general, specifi c types of sport or particular sport organizations. Like in most European countries, sport participation studies in the Netherlands use broad defi nitions of sports, referring to many different kind of recreational or professional activities that can be characterized by game aspects, aimed at improving (motor) skills and performance, physical fi tness and/or competition. This means that apart from the traditional (Anglo Saxon) competitive sports like football, tennis and track and fi eld, also recreational swimming, tour cycling, fi tness and 'mental-sports' like chess and bridge belong to the 'sports family' and may be included in sport participation questionnaires (DiopterJanssens and Van Bottenburg BV 2000; Van der Meulen 2003). Nowadays sport participants are active in all kinds of settings: they are participating alone, in informal groups, in sports clubs, in school or local government-based organized settings or in commercial institutions like fi tness centres. Nonetheless, mainstream sport in the Netherlands is still associated with competitive physical sports, organized in voluntarily organized club contexts. It has been documented that the broadened defi nition of sport and the increasing organizational possibilities have increased participation in sport by (formerly) underrepresented social groups like women and the elderly, but also that specifi c sports are practised by particular social groups (e.g. Breedveld 2003; Elling and Knoppers 2005). Possibly, also gay men and lesbian women are over-and underrepresented in particular areas of the heterogeneous sport reality.",

      "abstract": "Feeling and expressing love is at the core of romantic relationships, but individuals differ in their proclivity to worry about their relationships and/or avoid intimacy. Saying “I love you” signals a commitment to a future with our romantic partner. Contrary to gender stereotypes, research in the United States demonstrates that men are more likely to confess love first. We aimed to replicate this sex difference in an online cross-national sample (seven countries, three continents), while testing for variation according to attachment style and environment (the national sex ratio). Men were more likely to confess love first in a relationship, with preliminary evidence that this was more likely when men had more choice (more female-biased sex ratio). Independent of biological sex, highly avoidant respondents were less happy to hear “I love you” than less avoidant respondents, and highly anxious respondents were happier to hear “I love you” than less anxious respondents. Our findings suggest that prior observations generalize beyond an ethnically homogenous sample and incorporate attachment theory into the study of love confessions. Our research suggests a dissociation between initial declarations of love (moderated by biological sex) and emotional responses to love confessions, moderated by attachment style but not by biological sex.",

From their responses we have identified 3 main strategies of coping with the stress from having competing multiple identities: 1) transformation of one identity from a public identity into a private one (e.g. when people stop participating in their religious community, but focus on personal religiosity instead, or when they stop expressing their feminist identity in their religious communities); 2) renunciation of one of the identities (e.g. when people completely withdraw from their original religious community without looking for a substitute); 3) combination of both identities in public, which can lead to two opposite results: being accepted in both competing communities and leading a fruitful life, or being rejected by both communities, exacerbating the stress of juggling competing identities.",

      "title": "Reconceptualizing Physical Sex as a Continuum: Are There Sex Differences in Video Game Preference?",
      "abstract": "With video games representing a rapidly growing media platform, recent events have highlighted conflicts surrounding gender and games. Previous research has established sex-typed cognitive advantages and game genre preference. Potential explanations of how these align have been inconclusive. Concurrently, research on sex development has suggested that binary categorizations of sex (physical sex; male or female) don't capture the full variation of individuals and are thus inferior measures of sex. Two studies (one replication study) were conducted which use two continuous markers of physical sex (hormonal 2D:4D finger ratio, and continuous skill-based performance) to predict game preference and playing. Using both statistical effect- and equivalence tests, we present a series of p-curves and several possible interpretations based on meta-analytical cutoffs. In general, we find that binary markers of sex significantly predict game preference, while continuous markers significantly do not. These findings challenge the notion of binary sex differences and suggest a more complex relationship between physical sex and video game preferences. Implications for future research on video game playing and sex are discussed.",

It has been proposed that men exhibit high tolerance to their partner’s same-sex infidelity, which allows such predispositions to exist in a relative high frequency in the population. On this basis, the hypothesis was tested that heterosexual men and women would differ in their tolerance level, with men exhibiting higher tolerance to same-sex infidelity than women. Evidence from an online sample of 590 heterosexual Greek-speaking participants provided strong support for this hypothesis. In particular, the vast majority of women exhibited low tolerance, while about one in two men exhibited high tolerance to same-sex infidelity. Furthermore, men and women exhibited higher tolerance to the same-sex infidelity of their long-term than of their short-term partners, with men exhibiting higher tolerance in the latter case. In addition, women exhibited low tolerance to opposite-sex and same-sex infidelity, but men exhibited low tolerance to opposite-sex infidelity, but much higher tolerance to same-sex infidelity.",

      "abstract": "This paper explores the representation of masculinity in Japanese television cooking shows. It does this for a number of reasons: first, because television is the most consumed medium in Japan today, present in every household and viewed, on average, 3.5 hours a day; second, because food is present on nearly every channel, in some form, on and in between virtually every program, all day, every day; third, because gender representations, especially masculinity, are a major component of these communications; fourth, because the version of masculinity that is communicated is a very narrowly constructed, univocal type. Following Ito (1996) Ito, K. 1996. Danseigaku Nyumon, (Introduction to Men's Studies) Tokyo: Sakuhinsha. [Google Scholar], this type is shown to be \"masculine hegemony,\" a construct with three essential elements: authority, power, and possession. Working through an array of on-screen data, I show that, regardless of the \"kind\" of male present in food shows, men invariably embody one or all of these masculine characteristics. Importantly, women also reinforce these qualities, either by facilitating manifestation or adopting these traits themselves. Few, if any, deviations from these depictions can be located, and when they are, they can be explained in terms of the corporate structure of television in contemporary Japan. A key observation is that, despite the prevalence of hegemonic masculinity, it is not played out through the iconic Japanese male, the salaried worker. In fact, in contrast with the pervading socio-economic reality in the \"real world,\" this male archetype is wholly absent inside the food-show screen.",

      "abstract": "Sterility (an inability to conceive without clinical intervention) and infertility (the inability to conceive after 1 year or more of unprotected intercourse) both produce psychological distress and reduced quality of life.1 ,2 Prevalence of sterility and infertility is variably increased after some types of cancer treatment, and similar adverse outcomes are reported among survivors.3 ,4 Despite the possibility of adoption and gamete/embryo donation, most adult patients with cancer prefer to have biological offspring5; advances in assisted reproduction technologies (ART) have made this possible.3 ,4\n\nThe provision of ART in these circumstances is grounded in the moral obligation to respect the autonomous choices of individuals, which is fundamental to a free society. In general we do not prevent adults from exercising freely made reproductive choices unless to do so poses serious risks of harm to the children conceived or to others.\n\nConsiderations of reproductive medicine, with exceptions such as the provision of contraceptive advice in adolescents, have not historically formed a significant part of paediatric practice. Children may not possess—and may never develop—some or all of the characteristics that enable them to make autonomous reproductive choices. They may lack sufficient cognitive ability to use information; the presence of a coherent set of values in which such fundamental choices might be framed; and a sense of identity, developed over time, that enables them to formulate and implement life plans. But even if children lack these attributes there is evidence to suggest that parents are interested in fertility preservation on behalf of their children.3 Moreover infertility has adverse psychosocial consequences for the increasing number of adult survivors of childhood cancer.6,–,8\n\nConcerns about fertility preservation are not the sole prerogative of patients with cancer in childhood.9 Others affected include …",

      "abstract": "Anti-Black racism in America renders Black people both invisible and hypervisible, at times. Here, we draw on previous research on inattentional blindness, a phenomenon whereby people fail to perceive something or someone (e.g., a person walking about) in their environment when attending to another feature of their environment (e.g., other people playing a ball game). We sought to replicate past work examining the conditions under which heterosexual White women fail to perceive a Black man walking through a complex scene. Specifically, we investigated whether selective inattention to a task-irrelevant person walking through a scene of two teams passing basketballs may depend on two factors: (a) the race of the person walking through the scene (Black vs. White), and (b) the interpersonal goal of the viewer (searching for a coworker, neighbor, friend, romantic partner, or a control condition)—hence the reason we recruited heterosexual White women participants. Consistent with the original work, across three studies, we found a main effect of target race such that heterosexual White women participants were more likely to notice the White (vs. Black) man walking through the ball-passing scene. Inconsistent with the original work, we did not find that this effect was moderated by the interpersonal goal condition. We discuss the implications of the current findings and future directions.",

They were more likely to cry alone than when with others and least likely to cry with people they did not know well. Women cried more often and for longer and with more intensity than men. Britons cried more than Israelis. Explanations in terms of differential inhibition were not supported. The sex difference was especially marked for situations involving criticism from others, anger, or problems with work, where men were particularly unlikely to cry, and least for those situations Darwin described as involving tender feelings. The pattern was related to differences documented elsewhere in which men tend to more active and confrontational styles of behaviour. British–Israeli differences were consistent with the effects of military service. Tearfulness for tender feelings increased with age in all groups. A principal component analysis distinguished crying that is intense, long lasting and difficult to stop from crying that is more diverse in appearance but more controllable. The distinction seems related to whether crying pre‐empts or concurs with other ongoing activities.",

Among 189 low-income men (44% African American, 56% Caucasian) who underwent rigorous assessments of family behavior and social context longitudinally across 20 years, those men with the low activity MAOA allele who experienced more punitive discipline at ages 1.5, 2, and 5 years showed more antisocial behavior from ages 15 through 20 years. Effects of punitive discipline on antisocial behavior differed by caregiver and age at which it occurred, suggesting sensitive periods throughout early childhood in which low MAOA activity elevated boys’ vulnerability to harsh parenting and risk for antisocial behavior. This genetic vulnerability to punitive discipline—and not just extreme, maltreatment experiences—may generalize to other male populations at risk for antisocial behavior.",

      "title": "Friendship and aggressiveness as determinants of conflict outcomes in middle childhood.",
      "abstract": "The attributions and responses of aggressive and nonaggressive boys to ambiguously intended actions of friends and nonfriends were examined. Thirty-seven aggressive and 37 nonaggressive third- and fifth-grade boys were presented with descriptions of encounters between peers in which child experienced a negative outcome as the result of the ambiguously intended actions of another. Neither aggressive nor nonaggressive subjects were influenced by the presence or absence of friendship between themselves and the child whose behavior they were asked to interpret or respond to. Aggressive subjects attributed more hostile intent than nonaggressive subjects when the objectionable action was directed at themselves but not when directed at others. Both groups of subjects predicted less hostile responses by themselves than by others. Although a significant degree of consistency was found between subjects' attributions and responses, it was also true that most hostile responses were predicted following nonhostile attributions. This finding is inconsistent with an attributionally based explanation of hostile reactive behavior. Conflict between peers is a fact of life throughout childhood. It occurs among children of both sexes, between friends and nonfriends alike, whenever one person does something to which a second person objects (Hay, 1984, p. 2). Denned in this way, conflict entails a dyadic exchange in which the actions of child are met with opposition by another. The first child need not have intended to offend the second for conflict to arise. However, if offense is intended, but none is taken, no conflict can be said to exist. Thus, an oppositional or antagonistic response by the offended party is a denning feature of conflict (Shantz, 1987). When a potential conflict situation occurs, a child's interpretation of that situation, particularly the intention that he or she attributes to the other child involved, has been shown to be important in determining the child's response (Darley, Klosson, & Zanna, 1978; Dodge, Pettit, McClaskey, & Brown, 1986; Mallick & McCandless, 1966; Rule, Nesdale, & McAra, 1974). If the child has a negative experience and believes that the other individual acted with hostile intent, then he or she is likely to respond with hostility. In contrast, if the child views the responsible peer as having acted benignly, a nonhostile response is more likely to result.",

      "abstract": "Allegations of Parental Alienation (PA), the systematic disparaging of one parent by the other parent aimed at alienating their child's affections, as a basis for child custody decisions are highly controversial. Claims of parental hostility or allegations of child sexual abuse in custody cases may trigger concerns about PA. Family court professionals (N = 280) rated young children's accuracy of report (e.g., suggestibility, honesty) in general and also read three custody scenarios varying as to whether or not they included allegations of parental hostility or child sexual abuse, or no such allegations. For each scenario, the alleged alienating parent's gender was experimentally varied between subjects. Participants rated the likelihood that each case involved PA. For the scenario that included allegations of child sexual abuse, professionals who viewed young children as more inaccurate reporters or who read about the mother (rather than a father) as the alleged alienator were more likely to rate the scenario as involving PA. For the scenario that described parental hostility but no child sexual abuse allegations, professionals who were older or female were more likely to judge the scenario as involving parental alienation when a mother (rather than a father) was the alleged alienator, whereas there were no significant predictors of responses to the no-allegation scenarios. Findings are discussed in relation to the difficult task of evaluating custody cases for PA when parental hostility or child sexual abuse is alleged.",

      "abstract": "Through three studies, we examined how person‐specific sexual attitudes and gender‐specific sexual norms influence men's erotica enjoyment (operationalized as self‐regulated viewing of erotic slides). In Study 1, men viewed more erotica than did women, supporting a gender‐typing interpretation that legitimizes erotica enjoyment for men but condemns it for women. In Study 2, gender was a situational variable; men viewed erotica while alone, with a female co‐participant, or with a male co‐participant. As expected, female (but not male) presence inhibited men's enjoyment, suggesting that the female presence was associated with negative sentiments about erotica. In Study 3, the co‐participants explicitly expressed either a positive or negative sentiment about pornography. As predicted, only these expressed sentiments influenced erotica enjoyment; the gender‐based norms were no longer salient. Overall, the findings suggest that erotica enjoyment is a gender‐typed behavior and that a man's enjoyment is influenced by both predisposition and normative situational cues.",

Propaganda regular and undying of male strength is cause the formation of personality conflict. Methods 35 patients were examined in this age range. Analysis of the data revealed that most patients were observed ejaculation disorder, (which was associated with increased sexual arousal) and erectile dysfunction, due to a number of reasons (personal characteristics, the nature of psychological trauma). Results At a young age, there is an active search for a regular sexual partner. Unsuccessful attempts to prove their sexual viability leads to the formation of non-adaptive systems of personality that was the cause of sexual dysfunction. Is aggravated sexual dysfunction picture of perfectionism. The emergence of sexual dysfunction was also due to misconceptions about the norm of sexual activity. Thus formed resistant obsessive fear of impotence.

This chapter reviews the evidence as to how these various factors contribute to a range of specific behaviors that differ on average for males and females across the life span, including toy and activity preferences; core gender identity; sexual orientation; verbal, mathematical, and spatial abilities; and aggression and empathy. Although many types of factors are involved in the development of each of these gender-related behavioral outcomes, the specific factors involved appear to differ from one outcome to another. Thus, the development of differences in behavior between males and females, as well as individual variability within each sex in gendered behavior, is multi-determined.",

      "title": "Theories of sexual identity and the masculinization of the gay man",
      "abstract": "Since the early 1970s the style and image of gay men in North America and Western Europe has undergone a dramatic shift. Whereas previously the most characteristic practice and most pervasive popular image of the male homosexual were effeminate, over the last twenty years the predominant styles of gay men have become increasingly masculine. The most obvious aspect of these new styles is clothing. The central styles have been the 'clone', partially supplanted in the mid-1980s by the sportsman. Alongside these have grown other, more specialist images: the leatherman/biker, the construction worker, the squaddy, the skinhead, the cowboy. Many, though not all, of these styles of clothing mimic those of occupations and pursuits which are strong male preserves. But the prescribed forms of masculinity extend beyond dress to gestures and 'body language' (no longer the limp wrist, no more 'mincing'), to ways of speaking (no more screaming and lisping), to language (we are no longer to be 'Miss So-and-so'). The change is also present in the body: hours in the gym are required to create, not necessarily an inflated muscle man, but a male-athletic body. The category of the sportsman, and to a large extent that of the leatherman, is centred on this notion of the masculine body. The opposition here is not merely femininity/masculinity but male/female: the body is to be what-is-specifically-male, thus apparently rooting the new gender style in physiology, the social in the biological.",

A comparison of genetic marker types in evidence semen stains and/or saliva stains to the corresponding genetic markers in the blood of a suspect may exclude the man as the perpetrator of the crime. If the genetic markers match, identification is inconclusive but may tend to support other circumstantial or eyewitness evidence of guilt. Potential for error is particularly high with physiological stain evidence because of its susceptibility to physical and chemical degradation. Furthermore, secretions (vaginal fluids, saliva, perspiration) from the victim are commonly mixed with the evidence specimens (semen, saliva) of the assailant. Certain genetic markers from the victim may mask those of the assailant. In many US crime laboratories there are no professional qualifications or requirements for the analysts assigned to this type of work. There is little administrative enforcement of quality control.

      "abstract": "Previous qualitative research on traditional measures of sexual orientation raise concerns regarding how well these scales capture sexual minority individuals' experience of sexuality. The present research focused on the critique of two novel scales developed to better capture the way sexual and gender minority individuals conceptualize sexuality. Participants were 179 sexual minority (i.e., gay, lesbian, bisexual, pansexual, queer, asexual) individuals who identified as cisgender (n = 122) and transgender (n = 57). Participants first completed the new scales, then provided qualitative responses regarding how well each scale captured their sexuality. The Sexual-Romantic Scale enabled the measurement of sexual and romantic attraction to each sex independently (same-sex and other-sex). Participants resonated with the way the Sexual-Romantic scale disaggregated sexual and romantic attraction. Although cisgender monosexual (lesbian/gay) individuals positively responded to the separation of same- and other-sex attraction, individuals with either plurisexual (bisexual, pansexual, or fluid) or transgender identities found the binary conceptualization of sex/gender problematic. The Gender-Inclusive Scale incorporated same- and other-sex attraction as well as dimensions of attraction beyond those based on sex (attraction to masculine, feminine, androgynous, and gender non-conforming individuals). The incorporation of dimensions of sexual attraction outside of sex in the Gender-Inclusive Scale was positively regarded by participants of all identities. Findings indicate that the Sexual-Romantic and Gender-Inclusive scales appear to address some of the concerns raised in previous research regarding the measurement of sexual orientation among sexual minority individuals.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Over 60 percent of Americans have some sort of family pet. Although studies have explored the personality and demographic correlates of pet ownership, none have considered whether religious characteristics may influence not only pet ownership, but the kind of pet Americans own. Drawing on data from the 2018 General Social Survey, we examine the religious antecedents of pet ownership in general as well as owning a cat or a dog, taking into account factors previously associated with owning certain pets (e.g., urban vs. rural residence, political affiliation). Although religious tradition and biblical literalism generally do not predict pet ownership, frequent worship attendees and the most conservative evangelicals report owning fewer pets. Religious characteristics also predict Americans’ ownership of particular pets. Most notably, we find a strong, negative association between worship attendance and cat ownership. We theorize potential mechanisms. On the one hand, certain personality types might simultaneously attract some Americans toward religious participation and away from pets, and cats in particular. Alternatively, to the extent that pet ownership is a partial substitute for human bonding and interaction, Americans more deeply embedded within a religious community may have less need (or time) for pets generally, and specifically more independent “roommate pets,” like cats.",

      "abstract": "Racialized Sexual Discrimination (RSD), also referred to as “sexual racism,” is widely reported among young sexual minority Black men (YSMBM). Though RSD is driven in part by sexual scripts and racial stereotypes, little is known about YSMBM’s experiences with RSD with respect to their sexual positioning roles. Using data from a cross-sectional web-survey of YSMBM (N = 726), a multivariate Kruskal Wallis test was conducted comparing YSMBM who identified as mostly bottom, versatile, or mostly top, on the degree to which they were affected by four RSD experiences, as well as the frequency with which they encountered these experiences. Men identifying as mostly bottom reported significantly stronger negative reactions to same-race rejection and encountering sexual role assumptions than men identifying as mostly top. Men identifying as versatile encountered same-race rejection significantly more frequently than men identifying as mostly top. Men identifying as mostly bottom encountered White superiority significantly more frequently than men identifying as mostly top. RSD may impact YSMBM differentially based on sexual position. These findings may have implications for culturally competent clinical practice, as well as analytic implications (e.g., estimating more complex statistical models) for sexual racism research, which remains an important yet underexamined field in the health sciences.",

Drawing on interviews with and ethnographic research of older male hockey players in two Canadian cities, this article finds that while those in late midlife (ages 54–71) continue to enact patterns of male relationships associated with younger men, those in later life (ages 71–82) break with these masculine patterns. Instead, their team relationships involve joking about themselves in the locker room (instead of mocking others) and an ethic of care. Many defined true or close friendships as those which extended beyond sport. These findings suggest that men's alignment with the dominant sporting masculinity of the young is not static over the life course and may wane in certain arenas as men reach later life.",

      "abstract": "Recent research has shown that by the age of 4, preschool children tend to associate social power with the male gender. The present study examined this association with a group of children from a Maya community in Guatemala, where gender inequalities are high, and tested the prediction that a strong gender hierarchy reduces girls’ perception of themselves as being dominant in dyadic power situations. However, contrary to our predictions, we did not find that children associated power with the male gender. In Experiment 1, we asked 4 to 7 years-old children ( N = 70) to identify themselves with a dominant or subordinate character in same-gender and mixed-gender relationships. In contrast, to what was previously observed with French children, the results showed no significant difference between male and female participants, both of whom strongly identified with the dominant character. In Experiment 2, we asked 4 to 6 years-old participants ( N = 70) to assign a gender to a dominant and subordinate character and found a strong own-gender effect, with all participants, males and females, assigning their own gender to the powerful character. Again, this contrasts with previous findings indicating that children from France, Norway and Lebanon did consistently associate power with the male gender. The absence of a male-power association in Maya children is discussed in terms of cultural differences regarding exposure to gender stereotypes, power values and representations of female-male comparisons.",

      "abstract": "Abstract People with disabilities are ten times more likely to suffer from abuse than their typical peers. When lacking knowledge about abuse indicators, these persons are, evidently, unable to report it, which can lead to repeated abuse. Moreover, in many cases, these people do not know that they have the right to decide, refuse, be asked permission (every time), rethink a decision or change their minds. On the other hand, sexuality is often mistaken for sex. Actually, the concept of sexuality is much wider and includes identities, roles, intimacy, pleasure and spirituality. Sexual education and counseling must not be a one-time “talk” (that usually takes place during puberty), but a process of communication, counseling and support which starts at early ages, continues during the school years and goes further, during adulthood. The emotional, psycho-sexual, social, ethical and spiritual aspects also continue their development in the adult life and it is only natural to be properly approached at these ages as well.",

One strategy for dealing with this problem is to remove the binary and allow athletes of different sexes to compete together. Firstly, since there are different ways of 'mixing' athletes together, a distinction between two major kinds will be introduced: 'mixed sports' (sports with an allocated position for a number of males and females in a team, which retains the binary) and 'unisex sports' (sport participation of all athletes together based on merit, with no need to distinguish between sexes). Secondly, I shall offer a strategy for the modification of existing sports and the creation of new sports that would accommodate athletes of different sexes in 'unisex sports'. This means paying attention to how sports are constructed and which abilities/skills they test. For unisex sports, two kinds of logic are suggested: 'balance of abilities/skills logic' proposes that we should seek a balance of what we presently understand as female and male (together with sex-neutral) abilities/skills to be included in the sporting challenge; whereas 'complexity logic' proposes the creation or modification of sports so as to test for a wider spectrum of abilities/skills.",

      "title": "TRANSGENDER INCLUSION AND GIRLS’ SPORTS A Look at What’s at Stake",
      "abstract": "Sports are social conventions through and through. There is nothing natural or predetermined about who gets to play and what one must do to win. But how sports are structured says a lot about what society values and whose interests it sees as top priorities. Hence the culture war over girls’ sports. This paper seeks to identify what society values about organized sports and suggest how a society that strives to prioritize girls as highly as boys and transgender girls as highly as cisgender girls should allocate athletic opportunities.1To date, the loudest voices in the fight over girls’ sports have been the most extreme. On one side are those who argue that transgender girls are girls and must always be treated as such.2 On the other side are those who argue that sex is determined at birth and can never be changed.3 The arguments are absolutist both in the sense that they call for categorical inclusion (or exclusion) of transgender girls in girls’ sports and in the sense that they hold across different contexts outside of sports.This is a mistake. The analysis of transgender girls’ participation in girls’ sports must be qualified and contextual. Transgender inclusion in sports is different from transgender inclusion in prisons. Transgender inclusion on Little League teams is different from transgender inclusion in elite sports. Moreover, inclusion in a world in which transgender girls physically dominate cisgender girls is different from inclusion in a world in which transgender and cisgender girls are more evenly matched.This paper’s focus is on sports and on what is at stake for participants and society more generally when society allocates athletic opportunities to transgender and cisgender girls. It identifies the benefits that organized sports provide to participants and nonparticipants. It then offers a normative argument for how these benefits should be allocated and explores what these normative goals mean for the structure of girls’ sports and the participation rights of transgender athletes. The paper considers not only whether transgender girls should be included in girls’ sports—and if so under what conditions—but also whether girls’ sports, as a distinct category, should continue at all.Part I identifies the three core benefits of organized sports: (1) basic benefits, (2) special benefits, and (3) group benefits. The basic benefits of sports are the physical and psychological advantages received by all those who participate. The special benefits of sports are the prizes, recognition, and rewards received by only the athletic winners. The group benefits of sports are the benefits that nonparticipants receive from sports. These benefits include both the pleasure fans get from seeing something difficult done well and, more significantly, the enhancement to self and social esteem that members of a socially salient group gain from having one of their own succeed. Parts II–IV consider how a society that cares equally about transgender and cisgender girls, and seeks to provide equivalent benefits to both, should structure athletic opportunities.Part II focuses on the basic benefits of sports. It argues that all individuals are equally entitled to the basic benefits of sport: the physical and psychological benefits that flow from participating rather than winning. Moreover, this part contends that if society cared about sports only because of the basic benefits they provide to participants, there would be no reason to distinguish between cisgender and transgender girls and little reason to distinguish between the sexes in sports at all.Part III focuses on the special benefits of sports: the prizes, recognition, and scholarships that make sports so valuable for a lucky few and which are—more than the basic benefits—the focus of fighting over athletic resources. Unlike the basic benefits, the special benefits must be distributed based on merit to retain their meaning and value. The hard question is how to determine who should compete against whom and how to define the categories from which winners are drawn. This part contends that while society might be able to shift to unisex competition categories as the basis for allocating special benefits, to the extent that sex-segregated categories remain in place, they must be enforced fairly. The part then turns to the question at the heart of the fight over transgender access to women’s teams: what does fair enforcement of the “female” sports category require? It argues that the female sports category is both an ability category and a status category and, as such, its confines cannot be determined without considering the group benefits that flow to transgender and cisgender girls.Part IV focuses on the group benefits of sports. It begins from the premise that transgender and cisgender girls are equally entitled to the group benefits of sports and considers what participation rules best further this goal. First, the paper considers eligibility rules that divide the female athletic category into cisgender and transgender divisions. It concludes that for transgender girls, such a separate-but-equal approach is not equal. Next, the paper considers eligibility rules that unite transgender and cisgender girls and explores the effects of inclusivity under three possible empirical realities: (1) transgender girls are no better on average or at the extreme than cisgender girls, (2) transgender girls are better on average than cisgender girls but not better at the extreme, and (3) transgender girls are better at the extreme and disproportionately win athletic prizes and scarce resources. The paper argues that only under the last condition does transgender girls’ inclusion in girls’ sports reap group benefits for transgender girls at the expense of comparable group benefits for cisgender girls and only then are restrictions on transgender girls’ participation warranted.Structuring athletics in a way that optimizes benefits for both transgender and cisgender girls requires understanding what society values about organized sports. Yet, even with such understanding, translating social values into organizational structures is complicated because different values call for different rules. The paper concludes by identifying which values dominate in which athletic contexts and suggesting context-specific eligibility rules that treat trans and cis girls with equal concern and respect.The fight over access to athletic opportunities and resources is heated because much is at stake for participants and for the social groups with which they identify. This part describes the benefits that flow from participation in organized athletic competition. First, there are internal and individualistic health benefits that all participants receive simply from playing. I refer to these as basic benefits.4 Second, there are external and individualistic benefits that a lucky few winners receive in the form of prizes, awards, recognition, and scholarships. I refer to these as special benefits.5 Third, there are benefits to nonparticipants because of their group membership. They include benefits that flow to those who identify as fans. More importantly, they also include benefits that flow to those who socially identify with the winners. I refer to these collectively as group benefits. In the remaining parts, I consider how these benefits should be allocated and what the implications are for the structure of girls’ sports.Organized sports are widely associated with a range of physical and psychological benefits for participants.6 These basic benefits flow, or are believed to flow, to all participants simply from playing. Skill level and competitive success are irrelevant.Most direct are the benefits to participants’ physical health. Moderate exercise has been shown, for example, to improve bone density and to lower the risks of heart disease, diabetes, and some cancers.7 Physical activity is also associated with improved mental health, specifically, lower levels of depression and higher levels of creativity.8 The health benefits of physical activity are so clear and extensive that some scholars have argued that women’s athletic participation should be treated as a public health issue.9Somewhat more tenuous are the benefits to participants’ character. Participation in organized sports is widely thought to develop character by teaching skills such as teamwork, leadership, and discipline.10 The evidence for such benefits is more anecdotal and less rigorous than for the physical benefits. Nonetheless, they are widely ascribed to and are often cited as a reason to encourage children’s participation in organized sports. Indeed, the International Charter of Physical Education and Sports adopted in 1978 by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) proclaimed that “[e]very human being has a fundamental right of access to physical education and sport” because such activity is “essential for the full development of [their] personality.”11More tenuous still are the benefits to participants’ life choices. Although any causal link is unproven, much has been made of the correlation between athletic participation and better lifestyle choices and outcomes for children. Students participating in high school sports have higher grades, better attendance, and higher graduation rates than their nonathlete peers.12 They are also more likely to attend and graduate from college.13 Teenage student-athletes are less likely to smoke cigarettes,14 and teenage girls who participate in sports are less likely to engage in sexual activity or become pregnant.15Organized sports also provide some participants—those who win—with a distinct set of particularly valuable external benefits. Winners enjoy the excitement, pride, and joy of victory. Sometimes, they also enjoy more concrete and tangible benefits. They may set records, win prizes, qualify for more prestigious teams or leagues, and garner attention and acclaim for their accomplishments.For high school athletes, preferential treatment by colleges is a particularly valuable and sought-after special benefit for winners. The recent lawsuit against Harvard University alleging discrimination against Asian Americans revealed the magnitude of the preference.16 According to the plaintiffs’ analysis of Harvard’s admissions data, athletes who were ranked 4 on a scale of 1 to 6 had a 70% chance of acceptance, while nonathletes with the same score had a .076% chance of admission.17 This preference is consistent with that found almost twenty years earlier by James Shulman and William Bowen. In their book The Game of Life, Shulman and Bowen looked at admissions data for thirty selective colleges and found that athletes were give a 48% boost in admissions—a boost that was considerably higher than that for legacies (25%) and for racial minorities (18%).18Moreover, the very best athletes receive not only admissions help but also financial rewards. Approximately 180,000 students annually, the top 1%–3% of high school athletes, receive over $3.6 billion in scholarship support from NCAA schools,19 with an average scholarship amount of $18,000.20 The best of this group, approximately 2% of college athletes, receive opportunities to play professionally.Even for those who do not play, organized sports confer benefits. Most general are the benefits—excitement and fun—that fans get from watching their favorite athletes and teams play and win. More discrete, and more significant from a social justice perspective, are the benefits that accrue to members of socially salient groups as a result of seeing members of their own group celebrated and rewarded. As Mark Kelman explained, nonparticipants who identify socially with athletic winners receive benefits from increased self-esteem, from role modeling, and from the reduction of cultural subordination.21Self-esteem is mediated both by one’s own treatment as an individual and by the treatment received by members of one’s group.22 One’s self-esteem may be enhanced by seeing members of one’s group perform well and be treated with respect and adulation, as occurs when members of one’s own group are athletic stars.23 Conversely, self-esteem may be undermined by seeing members of one’s group devalued and disrespected.24 Moreover, associational self-esteem may be particularly important for members of subordinated groups.25Role models encourage healthy behaviors and life choices by those who identify with them.26 Individuals are more likely to “model themselves after members of their own groups than outsiders.”27 As a result, athletic nonparticipants benefit from having in-group role models who encourage athletic participation and healthy habits. As Kelman explained, female athlete role models not only encourage younger girls to participate in sports—and reap the accompanying health benefits—but also model and encourage a broader range of positive behavior—goal focus, intensity, competitiveness—that is advantageous for girls across contexts.28 While the benefits to self-esteem probably require some parity in how female and male stars are treated, the benefits from role modeling seem to require only the existence of a critical mass of group-identified winners.”29Finally, the celebration of athletic stars enhances the status and esteem accorded to all members of their socially salient group and can change the social meaning and status of group membership. The celebration of female athletes, for example, reinforces a vision of women as autonomous agents that is at odds with more traditionally sexist conceptions of women as passive sexualized objects for a heterosexual male gaze.30 Celebrating female athletes’ strength and agency chips away at cultural sexism for all women and enhances women’s social regard and status.Sports provide individuals and groups with important benefits. Much is at stake, therefore, in the distribution of athletic opportunities. The next three parts consider how the basic, special, and group benefits of sport should be allocated—to whom, on what terms, and for what social ends—and consider what these normative goals mean for the structure of girls’ sports.For participants, the basic benefits of sports are neither scarce nor rival.31 All athletic participants receive the health and character benefits that flow from organized sports, and one person’s receipt of them does not deprive another of the same benefits. Nonetheless, because the basic benefits of sports flow from participation opportunities that are often limited, the basic benefits of sports become in effect both scarce and rival. In this part, I consider how a society concerned about the basic benefits of sports should, under conditions of resource scarcity, structure and allocate athletic opportunities for transgender and cisgender girls.One way to distribute scarce benefits is based on merit, where merit is defined by some relevant measure of ability or effort. Jobs, for example, are awarded based on qualifications and performance. Sometimes benefits are distributed in this way to achieve some independent external end. Imagine scarce spots in cardiac surgery residency programs or scarce government contracts to mechanical engineers to rebuild the nation’s bridges. In both cases, there are external reasons related to public health and safety that justify allocating the scarce resources based on merit as measured by relevant performance. Other times, resources are distributed based on merit to encourage particular kinds of behavior. Consider a teacher trying to motivate her students to read. Allocating prizes based on numbers of books read—in other words, based on merit as measured by effort—would serve her goals well.A merit-based distribution of sports’ basic benefits—where merit is measured by athletic ability or performance—is difficult to justify on either ground. The basic benefits of sports are akin to core health and education resources. Distributing such health benefits to those who are most athletic—and likely healthiest—seems unlikely to further any important social goal. Instead, doing so would likely weaken society overall by degrading the status of the weakest and increasing the gap between the privileged and the poor. While awarding the basic benefits to those who are physically strongest probably would incentivize health-conscious behavior among some individuals, it would also punish and deprive those who are the weakest and most infirm. Awarding opportunities for health and well-being to those who already possess both, and denying opportunities to those who lack them, seems at best nonsensical and at worst unjust. As Jane English observed, “[i]f Matilda is less adept at, say, wrestling than Walter is, this is no reason to deny Matilda an equal chance to wrestle for health, self-respect, and fun.”32There is perhaps more normative appeal in allocating the opportunity for basic benefits based on need. Under this view, those who need such benefits to reach basic levels of health and functioning are most entitled to them. Martha Nussbaum and Amartya Sen are perhaps most strongly associated with this view. They have argued that a just society must distribute resources so as to guarantee that all individuals have the basic capabilities necessary for a good human life—chief among which are health and thought33 “as cultivated by an adequate education.”34 Norman Daniels similarly has argued that health care must be distributed so as to give everyone the ability for “normal species functioning,”35 with more resources going to those who need more to maintain or achieve normal functioning.36As a practical matter, need does sometimes drive resource allocation decisions in education and health care. While state constitutions require that all children be given a basic minimum education, the federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) requires that resources be allocated based on need.37 The goal of the IDEA is to provide students with handicaps with “a free appropriate public education” in the “least restrictive environment.”38 What this means in practice is that schools must devote extra resources to handicapped children to permit them to achieve the same basic educational goals that most nonhandicapped students can achieve with far fewer resources.39 Disabled students who need more resources to achieve proficiency are given more resources—they are given preferential treatment as compared to other students who would benefit from the resources but “need” them less.In health care, too, under both private and state-sponsored insurance plans, more resources and benefits go to those who need them to achieve basic levels of health and functioning. Indeed, rather than capping all individuals at the same level or expense of care, insurance programs direct far more resources to those whose impairments—from hearing loss to mobility problems to the need for dialysis—require more interventions to achieve basic levels of functioning.40Transgender advocates, at times, seem to support a need-based distribution of athletic opportunities. Transgender girls, they emphasize, are an “‘especially vulnerable population’”41 with a particularly strong need for the basic benefits that sports confer.42 Such need, they suggest, creates a privileged entitlement to athletic resources.While perhaps conceptually appealing, a need-based allocation of athletic opportunities is infeasible. First, it is not clear how to measure need or what type of need should count. Is need to be measured against a baseline of physical health, against a stable level of emotional well-being, or against particular performative athletic skills? Second, need assessments—whatever metric is chosen—must be individualized. Even if some types of group membership may be associated with particular vulnerabilities, it does not follow that all members of a group are more vulnerable or needy than non-group members. Individuals have varied group memberships, some associated with privilege and others with disadvantage. Membership in a particular group, such as being transgender, is not a good proxy for overall need. It is too simplistic to say that a transgender boy, by virtue of his gender identity, is more in need of the physical and mental health benefits of sport than a cisgender girl who is overweight or a cisgender boy suffering from depression. Yet individualized need assessments of all students seeking to participate in recreational school sports are not possible. Assessing and scaling the relative need of all students who might want to participate would be too costly and difficult.Since a merit-based distribution is unappealing and a need-based distribution impractical, a third option is to give all students equal access to the basic benefits. Such a distribution is consistent with and bolstered by the widely shared view that all individuals have an equal moral entitlement to basic health care and education.The idea that “everyone has a right to a minimum of ‘decent,’ ‘reasonable,’ ‘basic,’ ‘essential,’ or ‘adequate’ health care … commands widespread (though not universal) consensus,”43 explained law professor Einer Elhauge. Philosophers largely agree. In their book, Social Justice: The Moral Foundations of Public Health and Health Policy, Madison Powers and Ruth Faden argued that social justice requires that all individuals be provided with a sufficient level of health and a reasonable life span.44 According to John Rawls, a basic minimum of health care for all individuals is necessary for a stable democracy.45A commitment to equal basic health care infuses public policy as well as political philosophy. As Erin Brown explained, a commitment to a basic minimum undergirds the patchwork of federal statutes that provide healthcare benefits for groups that might not be covered by employer-sponsored insurance, such as “Medicare, Medicaid, the Veterans Administration health system, TRICARE for active duty military and their families, the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA), and, most recently, the ACA [Affordable Care Act].”46 Indeed, Representative John Lewis, urging his colleagues to vote for the ACA, appealed to their sense of justice: “We have a mission. We have a mandate. We have a moral obligation to lead this nation into a new era where health care is a right and not a privilege.”47A similar commitment to a basic minimum exists in the context of education. Theorists contend that a basic education is foundational to good citizenship. As Debra Satz explained, “[e]ducation has long been recognized as a ‘foundation of good citizenship,’ a necessary condition for full membership in the political community.”48 Schools teach “future citizens to evaluate different political perspectives that are often associated with different ways of life.”49 Such civic education is critical, Amy Gutmann agrees, and “[t]he social stakes for liberal democracy … are high. Absent mutual respect, citizens cannot be expected to honor the liberal principle of nondiscrimination.”50Access to a basic minimum education is in fact an individual right. Every state constitution includes an education clause obligating states “to establish and operate public schools that provide children with a basic minimum or adequate education.”51 Though the right to a basic minimum is not always realized, it is recognized.While not going so far as to require that all students receive athletic opportunities, an equal-access approach recognizes and protects students’ equal moral entitlement under conditions of scarcity to the basic benefits of sport. One way to ensure equal access to athletic opportunities would be to make sports unisex and to reconfigure them so that sports require and reward more equally the abilities of both girls and boys.52 As Jane English has argued, “[w]e should develop a variety of sports, in which a variety of physical types can expect to excel.”53 Scholars focused on transgender athletes have made similar arguments. Irena Martínková, for example, has called for a shift to unisex sports that have been redefined to be “inclusive for athletes of all sexes.”54In the real world, creating sports that equally recognize and reward the aptitudes of women and men is likely to be challenging. The very small number of sports that currently fall into this category—perhaps dressage, riflery, long-distance swimming, and car racing—hints at the difficulty of this endeavor. Encouraging people to adopt these newly configured sports is also likely to be challenging. Certainly, new sports do arise and gain popularity,55 but there is also a lot of stickiness in people’s athletic preferences. Indeed, the ten most popular sports in the world have been the same for the last ninety years.56 Certainly, the process of modifying or creating new sports and shifting athletic preferences, if possible at all, would take time.A more practical, though certainly less perfect, way to ensure equal access to athletic opportunities would be to shift existing sports to a unisex model and have spots allocated by lottery rather than performance. Existing sports tend to favor and reward male attributes and abilities, and this may explain in part why men are more drawn to sports than women. Nonetheless, if schools were to create robust and diverse unisex athletic offerings that were open to all without regard to performance, girls and boys—both transgender and cisgender—would have access to the basic benefits of sports that while perhaps not perfectly equal was functionally and practically so.It may be, though, that participants prefer sex-segregated teams—at least at times—even when participation is not performance based. Boys may prefer playing with boys and worry that girls will change the nature of their game. Girls may prefer playing with girls and worry that boys will marginalize or condescend to them. Girls may also feel that rules designed to protect them or the fairness of play in coed competitions are patronizing.57Conceding to this reality, however, makes ensuring that participants have equal access to the basic benefits of sports more challenging. English has argued that under conditions of sex segregation, equal funding is key to equal access for girls.58 “Rights to the basic benefits dictate immediate changes in the distribution of our sports resources,” English explained, requiring “equal facilities—everything from socks to stadiums” and “equal incentives.”59 Girls’ and boys’ teams must, in other words, be the same in terms of the numbers of opportunities they provide students and the nature of these opportunities.Most important when it comes to transgender students is category assignment. For transgender girls, equal access to the basic benefits of sports requires their access to and inclusion on girls’ sports teams. Requiring transgender girls to compete on boys’ teams would stigmatize them by labeling them as boys. It would also undermine the emotional health benefits of sport and likely discourage play.60 Requiring transgender girls to play in their own category would likely have similar effects. While segregation of cisgender girls and cisgender boys in sports is generally not viewed as stigmatic to girls, segregation of cisgender and transgender girls is, often, viewed as stigmatic to transgender girls.61 For transgender girls relegated to a “separate-but-equal” trans category, the basic benefits of sports would be undermined and diminished by the message that they are not in fact “real” girls.For cisgender girls, transgender inclusion might affect their access to the special benefits of sport, but it should have no meaningful effect on their access to the basic benefits. Opposition to transgender girls’ inclusion in girls’ sports centers on the claim that if transgender girls compete directly against cisgender girls, the latter will lose. When it comes to the basic benefits, however, winning does not matter and prizes are not the point. The basic benefits come from playing and flow as readily from recreational sports as from elite-level sports. Including transgender girls on girls’ sex-segregated recreational teams—where opportunities to play are equally available to all regardless of sex or ability, and where girls’ and boys’ teams are equally funded—would not deprive cisgender girls of equal access to the basic benefits of sports.62If society cared about organized sports only because of the basic benefits participants derive from them, there would be no reason to deny transgender girls access to girls’ sports, and the issue of transgender girls’ inclusion would probably not be terribly fraught.63 Transgender girls would need access to girls’ sports teams to have equal access to the psychological benefits of sports. Meanwhile, cisgender girls would lose little, if anything, by having girls’ sporting opportunities randomly distributed among a pool of potential participants that included both transgender and cisgender girls.What is at stake with athletic opportunities is not, however, only the basic benefits of sports. Indeed, the fight over transgender girls’ inclusion in sports is not primarily about access to the basic benefits; it is instead about who gets the special benefits of sports—the prizes, recognition, and rewards that go to only a few. When it comes to these benefits, distributions based on principles of equality or need hold little appeal. Only allocations based on merit—where merit is determined by performance—allow the special benefits to retain their meaning and symbolic value. On this, both sides of the culture war seem to agree.64 What is less clear is who should compete against whom.This part considers three distinct eligibility categories within which merit-based allocations of special benefits could be made: unisex open categories, unisex ability categories, and sex-based categories. It argues that while a",

      "title": "Sexual Conflict",
      "abstract": "Abstract Although females and males share a common interest in successful reproduction, the sexes often maximise their reproductive success (fitness) in mutually incompatible ways. Two basic forms of sexual conflict are recognised: Interlocus sexual conflict reflects a conflict of interest over the outcome of an interaction between sexes (e.g. to mate or not?), with some genetic loci evolving to enhance male fitness at females’ expense and other loci evolving to promote female fitness by mitigating male‐imposed harm. This conflict drives the evolution of sexually antagonistic male strategies such as coercive behaviours and morphologies, toxic ejaculates and infanticide, and female counter‐adaptations that confer resistance to such strategies. Intralocus sexual conflict reflects divergent selection on a shared trait whose expression is influenced by the same loci in both sexes, such that selection on one sex can displace the other sex from its phenotypic optimum. It selects for genomic adaptations that permit the evolution of sexual dimorphism. Key Concepts: Sexual conflict arises because strategies that maximise the fitness of one sex can reduce the fitness of the other sex. Two basic forms of sexual conflict are recognised: interlocus (between genetic loci) and intralocus (within a genetic locus). Interlocus sexual conflict is a conflict of interest over the outcome of some interaction (e.g. to mate or not?), mediated by different genetic loci in each sex. Sexual conflict can lead to sexually antagonistic coevolution and sexual ‘arms races’, whereby adaptations that benefit males at females’ expense select for counter‐adaptations in females that mitigate male‐imposed harm. Interlocus sexual conflict is manifested in a variety of traits that increase male reproductive success but harm females in the process, including behavioural harassment and coercion, morphological armaments such as genital spines and chemical manipulation via ejaculate components or pheromones. Intralocus sexual conflict is a conflict of interest over the expression of a shared trait that is subject to sex‐specific patterns of selection but influenced by the same genetic loci in both sexes. Intralocus sexual conflict selects for modifications to the genetic basis of trait expression that allow each sex to evolve towards its phenotypic optimum, resulting in sexual dimorphism. Intralocus sexual conflict challenges the ‘good genes’ model of sexual selection because females that mate with high‐quality males may produce low‐quality daughters. Sexual conflict may increase the costs of sexual reproduction, reduce mean fitness in populations and (in theory) even promote population extinction. The study of sexual conflict has become one of the most important and dynamic areas in evolutionary biology.",

      "abstract": "Nonsexually offending psychopaths (N = 32) were compared to sexual homicide perpetrators (N = 38) and nonviolent pedophiles (N = 39) on select Comprehensive System Rorschach variables (Exner et al., 1993). Results indicate similarities among the groups in pathological narcissism, formal thought disorder, and borderline level reality testing. Nonsexually offending psychopaths are distinguished by their lack of interest in and attachment to others and their seemingly conflict-free internal world. While both sexually deviant groups evidenced interest in others and appear to experience a very dysphoric internal world, the sexual homicide perpetrators are distinguished by high levels of obsessional thought and an inability to disengage from environmental stimuli. Pedophiles show significantly more characterological anger, which may stem from their general inadequacy, cognitive rigidness, less alloplastic (acting out) style, and their introversive inability to gratify their needs. Rorschach differences add to our understanding of sexual deviation and violence among these three groups. © 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Inc. J Clin Psychol 56: 757–777, 2000.",

      "abstract": "Objetivos: Conocer la sexualidad en los adultos mayores, a partir de una revisión de investigaciones previas, realizadas en el ámbito internacional; Material y métodos: investigación no experimental, cualitativa, descriptiva retrospectiva, transversal. Se han utilizado como instrumentos de recojo de información fichas, y como técnicas la observación, el análisis, y la síntesis, el método seleccionado fue el deductivo. Se revisaron 15 investigaciones realizadas en diversos países referidas a la sexualidad del adulto mayor. Resultados: Se han encontrado algunas descripciones sobre actitudes sexuales, en diversos pueblos con anterioridad al año 100 Antes de Cristo, y recién en el siglo XX se empieza a investigar la sexualidad desde el punto de vista científico, con los aportes de Balzac, Jung (1969) y Sigmund Freud (1856-1939). Existen factores y mitos que afectan y están relacionados con la sexualidad del adulto mayor. La existencia de un declive gradual con la edad, en la actividad e interés sexual, en el caso de los varones se produce a partir de los 60 años, la actividad sexual más frecuente son las caricias y tocamientos, seguidas del coito, también se observa una mayor actividad sexual en las mujeres mayores que han tenido intensa actividad sexual en la juventud. Un alto número (74% hombres, 42% mujeres) practican la masturbación, la relevancia del sexo decae a partir de los 56 años de edad, llegando a considerarse como nada o poco importante en el 57% de las personas mayores de 65 años. Conclusiones: La sexualidad incluye todas las formas de expresión, desde la aproximación, el tacto, la intimidad emocional, la compañía, la masturbación y no solamente el coito. Es un aspecto importante que en la vejez debe continuar siendo una fuente de placer y no una fuente de inquietud y frustración.",

      "abstract": "From observations of free-swimming and narcotised fish and by the use of preference experiments it has been shown that the sword-tail of the male acts as an important visual stimulus for the release of aggressive behaviour in other males but has no significance to the female. Mature males show a preference for large body size in a sexual partner and may begin the courtship behaviour pattern with other fish of either sex unless the visual stimulus of the sword-tail or aggressive actions are perceived. The response of the female to the vent-butting stage of the male in the courtship movements acts to release either the sexual or the aggressive display pattern in the courting male. The sexual behaviour of the female consists of a decrease in avoidance activity which appears to be related to the reproductive cycle and no-co-operation by the female is required for copulation to occur. Certain other observations are described and their possible significance is discussed.",

      "abstract": "Using an online experiment with two distinct dishonesty games, we analyze how dishonesty in men and women is influenced by either thinking or learning about the dishonesty of others in a related, but different situation. Thinking is induced by eliciting a belief about others' dishonesty in a different game. We find that such belief elicitation (1) increases males' (but not females') dishonesty and (2) has no influence on participants' beliefs about the dishonesty of others in the game that they themselves play. Learning is induced by receiving a signal about the actual honest or dishonest choices of others in a different game. We find that the level of unethical behavior provided in such a signal (1) increases females' (but not males') dishonesty and (2) is positively correlated with participants' beliefs about the dishonesty of others in the game that they themselves play. We conclude that gender matters when examining how unethical behavior spreads. Both genders update their beliefs about others' dishonesty in the same way when presented with information about others' choices, but dishonesty in men is triggered by merely thinking about others' dishonesty, while women only respond to actual information on others' dishonesty.",

When the male was tested before the female stimulus person (traditional order), each sex received more favorable ratings on traits usually considered socially desirable for the sex. When the female was tested before the male (counter traditional order), female stimulus persons continued to receive more favorable ratings on traits usually associated with females than the male stimulus persons, but they also received more favorable ratings on traits usually associated with males.

De nombreux travaux attestent de la relation entre cette « homosociabilité permissive » et l’engagement dans des pratiques homosexuelles. Cet article analyse ce processus à partir d’une enquête ethnographique de longue durée dans une équipe de basket de haut niveau composée de 9 basketteuses (dont 6 sont engagées dans des pratiques homosexuelles) et de leur entraîneur femme homosexuelle. Plus précisément, ce travail étudie les modes de construction d’une carrière « d’homosexuelle » en identifiant les étapes, les contextes et les réseaux relationnels qui déterminent l’apprentissage de la technique et du goût pour les effets. Cependant, toutes les joueuses étudiées ne s’engagent pas dans les pratiques homosexuelles et celles qui le font entretiennent des rapports variables à ce mode de sexualité. Ces usages différenciés des pratiques homosexuelles, présentés dans un deuxième temps, se structurent dans l’interaction entre un système de dispositions spécifique et un contexte particulier.",

      "abstract": "The current study explores how gender, gender-diversity, and strong interests are associated with camouflaging in autistic adults. Seventy-two autistic adults completed an online survey, including measures characterizing the frequency/intensity of their strong interests and self-reported camouflaging, comprised of assimilation, masking, and compensatory behaviors. Adults self-reported their gender (18 men, 30 women, 24 non-binary) and whether they identified as a gender minority (n = 41). Camouflaging varied as a function of gender identity, gender-diversity, and strong interests: non-binary adults, followed by women, reported the most camouflaging behaviors. Women and non-binary adults reported more masking-related behaviors, and non-binary adults and gender minority individuals were distinguished by heightened assimilation-related behaviors. Greater camouflaging was predicted by more frequent engagement with strong interests and experiencing more distress when disengaging from these interests. Further research is needed to examine any connection between engaging with strong interests and the experience of burnout often associated with intense or lengthy camouflaging. These results add to the growing understanding of the association between camouflaging and gender, and provide a first step to understanding connections between strong interests and camouflaging. Clinical implications for supporting autistic individuals with camouflaging experiences are discussed.",

      "title": "The Relationship between Physical Qualities and Activity Profiles of International Women’s Sevens Players",
      "abstract": "Due to its inclusion in the recent Olympic Games, women’s Rugby Sevens has experienced a marked increase in popularity. As a result of the sports’ emergent nature the player profile and performance demands of women’s Rugby Sevens remain poorly understood.\r\n\r\n\nRugby Sevens is a modified game of 15-a-side Rugby Union, played under similar laws but with fewer players per side and for less total game time. The sport is played in a tournament format with multiple games played in one day and across a 2 to 3-day period. Rugby Sevens is one of the few true contact sports played by females and is therefore unique in this regard.\r\n\r\n\nA lack of research into the specific demands of the game and physical qualities of the players means that the majority of training decisions for the sport are based on research performed on males playing either Rugby Sevens or other Rugby codes. As sex differences specific to elite sport performance are known to exist, basing training prescriptions for females on male-specific research requires a number of assumptions to be made, which is unfair and potentially inappropriate to female athletes of any playing ability.\r\n\r\n\nBased on the identified gaps in the literature, the purpose of this thesis was to first characterize 1) the physical qualities of players; and 2) the game demands of international women's Rugby Sevens; and 3) to then examine the interaction between these aspects of the game. To achieve these aims, it was important in Study 1 to first identify physical qualities that discriminated playing rank in women’s Rugby Sevens. Then, in Study 2, the characteristics of game activity and physiological demands of international women's Rugby Sevens were profiled and further investigated for how these demands changed in relation to key contextual factors such as: game half, game outcome, game margin, tournament day and playing position. Study 3 examined game demands in further detail specifically relating to the tactical phases of play; attack and defense. The interaction between tactical phase demands and game outcome was examined in order to profile successful style of play. Finally, Study 4 examined the relationships among physical qualities, game demands and contextual factors with the aim of identifying the physical qualities important for success at the international level.\r\n\r\n\nThe international game of women’s Rugby Sevens is a physically demanding game, requiring athletes to run at and maintain high-speeds while under significant physiological strain. High- speed running ability across games and relative to minutes played was positively related to a number of contextual factors including game half, game outcome, game margin and opponent rank. High-speed running demands were consistently greater in defense than attack. To support the demands of the international game, women’s Rugby Sevens players are required to have well- developed strength, aerobic fitness, speed and repeated-sprint abilities. The development of these physical qualities, which were also found to underpin in-game activity and physiological profiles, will help to support successful game outcomes.\r\n\r\n\nCollectively, this thesis has provided a foundation and pragmatic level of knowledge on elite performance in women’s Rugby Sevens. Specifically, the development of physical qualities that support high-speed running ability may best prepare and maintain women for international-level competition in Rugby Sevens.",

      "title": "Relationship Dynamics around Depression in Gay and Lesbian Couples",
      "abstract": "Research on intimate relationship dynamics around depression has primarily focused on heterosexual couples. This body of work shows that wives are more likely than husbands to offer support to a depressed spouse. Moreover, when wives are depressed, they are more likely than husbands to try and shield their spouse from the stress of their own depression. Yet, previous research has not examined depression and relationship dynamics in gay and lesbian couples. We analyze in-depth interviews with 26 gay and lesbian couples (N = 52 individuals) in which one or both partners reported depression. We find evidence that dominant gender scripts are both upheld and challenged within gay and lesbian couples, providing important insight into how gender operates in relation to depression within same-sex contexts. Our results indicate that most gay and lesbian partners offer support to a depressed partner, yet lesbian couples tend to follow a unique pattern in that they provide support both as the non-depressed and depressed partner. Support around depression is sometimes viewed as improving the relationship, but if the support is intensive or rejected, it is often viewed as contributing to relationship strain. Support is also sometimes withdrawn by the non-depressed partner because of caregiver exhaustion or the perception that the support is unhelpful. This study points to the importance of considering depression within gay and lesbian relational contexts, revealing new ways support sustains and strains intimate partnerships. We emphasize the usefulness of deploying couple-level approaches to better understand depression in sexual minority populations.",

One inquiry concerned the parent identification patterms most likely associated with androgyny and undifferentiation. ANother inquiry considered differences between the masculinity or femininity of androgynous adolescents and these sex-role behaviors as represented in masculine and feminine adolescents, respectively. Similarly, the sex-role differences for masculine, feminine, and undifferentiated adolescents were investigated. The white, middle-class Ss included 142 male and 193 female college students (average age under 19 years). Parent and S sex-role scores, as well as identification scores, were based upon adjective check list self-descriptions and parent descriptions obtained from the S's. Androgynous males most frequently identified with a nonstereotypic mother combining masculine and feminine qualities, whereas undifferentiated males more often identified with a stereotypically feminine mother (p less than .01). No differences in female identification emerged. Both sexes of androgynous Ss revealed masculine attributes similar to those of masculine Ss but lacked many of the femine qualities of feminine Ss. A blending of sex-role dispositions in androgyny was inferred.",

      "abstract": "Social categorization of faces occurs along multiple dimensions such as race and gender and influences interpersonal interactions widely. Does social categorization of faces along different dimensions take place in parallel or give priority to some faces along a specific dimension? Across seven studies, we proposed and empirically tested a social task demand hypothesis that social categorization of a particular group of faces occurs in priority along one dimension (race or gender) in response to specific social task demands. Study 1 showed behavioral evidence that other-race faces are more densely clustered into one category, whereas same-race faces are more distantly separated into two (male and female) categories. Studies 2-4 showed electrophysiological evidence for earlier spontaneous racial categorization of other-race faces but earlier spontaneous gender categorization of same-race faces during an individual face recognition task. Studies 5-7 manipulated social task demands and provided electrophysiological evidence that early processes underlying racial or gender categorization of other-race or same-race faces were inhibited or facilitated by task demands of evaluating gender roles or group membership of perceived faces. Our findings indicate that the priority of racial or gender categorization of other-race or same-race faces varies dynamically to meet social task demands of managing intergroup and cross-sex interactions.

      "abstract": "When parent-offspring relations in sexually reproducing species are viewed from the standpoint of the offspring as well as the parent, conflict is seen to be an expected feature of such relations. In particular, parent and offspring are expected to disagree over how long the period of parental investment should last, over the amount of parental investment that should be given, and over the altruistic and egoistic tendencies of the offspring as these tendencies affect other relatives. In addition, under certain conditions parents and offspring are expected to disagree over the preferred sex of the potential offspring. In general, parent-offspring conflict is expected to increase during the period of parental care, and offspring are expected to employ psychological weapons in order to compete with their parents. Detailed data on mother-offspring relations in mammals are consistent with the arguments presented. Conflict in some species, including the human species, is expected to extend to the adult reproductive role of the offspring: under certain conditions parents are expected to attempt to mold an offspring, against its better interests, into a permanent nonreproductive.",

      "abstract": "This chapter focuses on the performance of impoliteness, through the lens of insults and other mocking language. Impoliteness has been documented as a tool men use to perform masculinity and bond with other men. Disney and Pixar films reflect this practice by portraying insults as associated naturally with masculinity, and often frame insults between men as silly and rapport-building. Female characters insulting others isn’t typically seen as “funny” in Disney, with some clear exceptions, including older characters (highlighting the “sassy old lady” trope). There is also some evidence that the more recent characters of color have more impolite utterances, suggesting that women of color are also an ideological exception to polite femininity. Discourses of masculinity in Disney and Pixar sanction insults as an expression of emotion, but portray more straightforward forms of affection as less common and/or less desirable. For femininity, the opposite discourse is upheld: polite forms are framed as natural, or desirable ways to express feeling, but insults have negative consequences.",

A questionnaire was developed and randomly distributed among 480 adolescent boys and girls in Ramat Hasharon, Israel. The research used a 2 (lack or existence of steady date) X 2 (sex of perceived adolescent--boy or girl) X 2 (sex of subjects) X 3 (subjects' grade level--8th, 10th, or 12th grade) factorial design. Analyses of variance results supported the four hypotheses. In addition, the steady-dating factor was found to be significantly more important to male than to female subjects.

On average, adolescents showed moderate levels of ambivalence. Younger adolescents, students from the highest school track, adolescents with less positive body image, those with higher love attitudes, those who did not take the initiative to have intercourse, and those feeling pressured to have sex showed higher levels of ambivalence during their decisions. Higher levels of decisional ambivalence about having intercourse were associated with a later age at the time of first intercourse and with a lower probability of contraceptive use. This study concludes that some levels of ambivalence are common in young people's decisions about having coitus as they have to negotiate contradictory sexual scripts, beliefs, and needs.",

      "title": "Schone schijn of niet? Een fake good/fake bad onderzoek naar de invloed van een mannelijke of vrouwelijke onderzoeker op de sociale wenselijkheid bij een vragenlijst over emancipatie",
      "abstract": "Sociaal wenselijk gedrag is een fenomeen dat voor bijna iedereen bekend zal zijn, of het nu is om jezelf in bescherming te nemen of om een ander niet te kwetsen. Het aanpassen van gedrag of mening om niet af te wijken van sociale normen komt veel voor, zowel in het dagelijks leven als in wetenschappelijk onderzoek. Veel voorkomende situaties zijn: het niet geven van een eerlijke, negatieve mening over iemand anders of het niet willen bespreken van persoonlijke informatie over financien of seksueel gedrag. Dit gedrag komt ook terug in wetenschappelijk onderzoek naar onder meer politieke en maatschappelijke opinies. Het kan er voor zorgen dat resultaten onbetrouwbaar worden en onderzoek onbruikbaar wordt. Het blijkt dat onderzoeken naar persoonlijke gegevens, zoals stemgedrag of seksualiteit, gevoelig zijn voor sociaal wenselijk gedrag. Respondenten in een onderzoek met gevoelige vragen geven antwoorden waarmee ze een betere indruk van zichzelf denken achter te laten of geven antwoorden die beter aansluiten bij de algemene publieke opinie. Om dit sociaal wenselijk gedrag in onderzoek te ondervangen, is het belangrijk te weten wanneer er een grote kans is op sociaal wenselijk gedrag door respondenten en welke maatregelen dit gedrag verminderen. \r\nEen onderwerp waarvan wordt verwacht dat het gevoelig is voor sociale wenselijkheid, is emancipatie. Er zijn al veel gelijke rechten tussen mannen en vrouwen, vooral in de westerse wereld, maar nog steeds blijkt dat vrouwen op veel gebieden een achtergestelde positie hebben ten opzichte van mannen. Vrouwen krijgen minder salaris voor hetzelfde werk, bekleden minder posities op topniveau en zijn meer verantwoordelijk voor zorgtaken dan mannen (Portegijs, 2010). Een actuele situatie is de verkiezing van een nieuwe Amerikaanse president. Was Barack Obama bijna acht jaar geleden de eerste gekleurde president van Amerika, nu is Hillary Clinton in de race om de eerste vrouw te worden die deze functie bekleedt. Dat niet iedereen even gelukkig zou zijn met een vrouwelijke president, komt naar voren in het onderzoek van Streb et al. (2008). In de publieke opinie was er grote steun voor een vrouwelijke president van Amerika, maar in het onderzoek naar de sociale wenselijkheid van die opinie bleek dat het een heel gevoelig onderwerp is. Ruim een kwart van de respondenten gaf aan zelfs van slag te zijn bij het vooruitzicht dat een vrouw leider zou worden van het land en stelde de antwoorden voor de opiniepeiling overdreven positief te hebben ingevuld (Streb et al, 2008).\r\nSociale wenselijkheid is hiermee een interessant onderwerp om verder te onderzoeken, vooral in combinatie met een maatschappelijk relevant thema als emancipatie. In deze scriptie staat de volgende onderzoeksvraag centraal: heeft het opnemen van geslachtkenmerken van de onderzoeker in de instructie en vragenlijst invloed op de sociale wenselijkheid van de respons? De vragenlijst die in dit onderzoek wordt meegenomen is afkomstig van de Eurobarometer 2015. Dit is een onderzoek dat eerder door de Europese Unie is uitgezet om in verschillende Europese landen te meten wat de opinie is over emancipatie en ongelijkheid tussen mannen en vrouwen. Nederland is niet meegenomen in het onderzoek, wat betekent dat de vragen zijn vertaald alsmede zijn aangepast aan de onderzoeksvraag van deze scriptie. \r\nHet onderzoek is verricht volgens de fake good/fake bad methode om te meten in welke mate de vragenlijst gevoelig is voor sociaal wenselijke antwoorden. De fake good/fake bad methode is niet bedoeld om de eigen mening van respondenten te achterhalen, maar om te bepalen welke antwoorden sociaal wenselijk of sociaal onwenselijk zijn. Wanneer er een significant verschil bestaat tussen deze twee mogelijkheden, is er sprake van een vragenlijst met gevoelige vragen.",

      "abstract": "Four studies investigated children's explanations for family resemblance and species-typical characteristics, under different conditions of biological parentage and rearing environment. Participating were 226 children between 3 and 11 years. Children Children were presented with a number of different tasks, some involving people and some domestic animals. Each task involved interviews in which children predicted what kinds, of physical and behavioral characteristics offspring would be most likely to demonstrate under normal biological parentage and rearing, adoptive rearing, inter-uterine transplant parentage and rearing with own species, or inter-uterine transplant parentage and rearing with transplant species. In all studies, particularly those involving non-human animals, there was a strong tendency for children of all ages to draw on essentialist explanations for their predictions. Among the youngest children (3-4 year olds), psychological intentional explanations were common. It was not until 6 to 7 years that explanations clearly began to refer to physical processes and putative biological mechanisms. The period between 4 and 6 years appeared to be a transitional phase where performance and explanations were more variable and seemed to be highly task-dependent. Biological-based, although often inaccurate, explanations for inheritance increased dramatically around 10 to 11 years. (Contains 11 references.)

      "abstract": "Friends play important roles throughout our lives by providing expressive, instrumental, and companionate support. We examined sexual orientation, gender, and age differences in the number of friends people can rely on for expressive, instrumental, and companionate support. Additionally, we examined the extent to which people relied on same-gender versus cross-gender friends for these types of support. Participants (N = 25,185) completed a survey via a popular news website. Sexual orientation differences in number of same-gender and cross-gender friends were generally small or non-existent, and satisfaction with friends was equally important to overall life satisfaction for all groups. However, the extent to which people's friendship patterns demonstrated gender-based homophily varied by sexual orientation, gender, and age. Young adult gay and bisexual men, and to some extent bisexual women and older bisexual men, did not conform to gendered expectations that people affiliate primarily with their own gender.",

      "abstract": "Emerging adulthood is a time of great transition, including but not limited to the commencement of “adult roles” and responsibilities. The present study examined emerging adults’ (EAs’) perceptions of transitional (i.e., cohabitating, marriage, parenting) and gradual (i.e., religious beliefs, political beliefs, managing own health) roles. Participants were recruited from a small liberal arts college (N = 88) and from Amazon’s Mechanical Turk platform (N = 181). They were surveyed on the age at which they anticipated or reported achieving the examined roles and their current self-efficacy for the roles. Female EAs reported intending to or achieving the transitional roles at a significantly later age than female EAs of the late 20th century (ps ≤ .001, ds 0.77–0.95). Additionally, female EAs anticipated role achievement for cohabitating, marriage, parenting, and religious beliefs at later ages than male EAs (ps &lt; .05, gs 0.33–1.33). Moreover, male and female EAs differed in a few role-specific self-efficacies if they had not yet achieved the desired adult role (e.g., marriage, parenting; ps &lt; .05, gs 0.62–0.98), but did not differ if they had already achieved the role. Lastly, the difference between EAs’ age and their role achievement largely did not predict their role-specific self-efficacies. The results provide additional insight into EAs’ expectations and current perceptions of themselves and may be useful to individuals who work regularly with EAs who are apprehensive about the extent to which they are “on time” and “ready” to engage in the examined transitional and gradual roles.",

On the one hand, there is an impulse toward persons of their own sex that is abnormally intense, the satisfaction of which has a good effect, and is natural to them; on the other, is public sentiment which stigmatizes their acts, and the law which threatens them with punishment. Before them lies mental despair,—even insanity and suicide,—at the very least, nervous disease; behind them, shame, loss of position, etc. It cannot be doubted that, under these circumstances, states of necessity and compulsion may be created by the unfortunate natural disposition and constitution. Society and the law should understand these facts.

      "title": "Précis of<i>The evolution of human sexuality</i>",
      "abstract": "Abstract Patterns in the data on human sexuality support the hypothesis that the bases of sexual emotions are products of natural selection. Most generally, the universal existence of laws, rules, and gossip about sex, the pervasive interest in other people's sex lives, the widespread seeking of privacy for sexual intercourse, and the secrecy that normally permeates sexual conduct imply a history of reproductive competition. More specifically, the typical differences between men and women in sexual feelings can be explained most parsimoniously as resulting from the extraordinarily different reproductive opportunities and constraints males and females normally encountered during the course of evolutionary history. Men are more likely than women to desire multiple mates; to desire a variety of sexual partners; to experience sexual jealousy of a spouse irrespective of specific circumstances; to be sexually aroused by the sight of a member of the other sex; to experience an autonomous desire for sexual intercourse; and to evaluate sexual desirability primarily on the bases of physical appearance and youth. The evolutionary causes of human sexuality have been obscured by attempts to find harmony in natural creative processes and human social life and to view sex differences as complementary. The human female's capacity for orgasm and the loss of estrus, for example, have been persistently interpreted as marriage-maintaining adaptations. Available evidence is more consistent with the view that few sex differences in sexuality are complementary, that many aspects of sexuality undermine marriage, and that sexuality is less a unifying than a divisive force in human affairs.",

      "abstract": "Sexualized dance routines for young girls are becoming more and more common in dance competitions. The appropriateness of these dance routines is being debated by parents, dance instructors, and public audiences as prepubescent children are frequently presented in risqué costumes to perform sensual movements that critics argue are inappropriate for young performers. Supporters of sexually-themed dance routines, however, contend that the girls are only having fun, do not see the costumes and movements as sexual, and give performances that are considered acceptable within the context of a dance competition. Nevertheless, practitioners have the responsibility to create an environment that promotes the well-being and healthy psychological development of their young dancers. Research supports that sexualized dance routines for pre-pubescent girls are age-inappropriate and potentially harmful and should therefore not be included in children's dance performances.",

Still other researchers have focused on cultural frameworks or scenes of play, with the understanding that all that happens within those settings should be deemed playful. A list of such settings includes sports and games; gambling; festivals, parties, and masquerades; artistic and musical expression; jokes, rhymes, and storytelling; teasing and other forms of disrespect; rough‐and‐tumble behaviors; dramatic role performance and make‐believe; and adventurous pursuits like mountain‐climbing and skydiving.

      "title": "Individual differences in perceptual and cognitive decision-making in response to near identical options",
      "abstract": "Every day people deal with the “exploration/exploitation dilemma”: Deciding when to stay with the current option or move to a new one. Most research in the literature focuses on the influence that external variables exert on people’s decisions (e.g., punishments/rewards). However, little is known about how people deal with identical or nearly identical options in the absence of external bias. The general assumption present in both human and animal models is that, in the absence of obvious cost, individuals would naturally explore. This thesis directly tests this assumption in six experimental studies by examining people’s behaviour when facing identical or nearly identical options, both in perceptual and behavioural tasks.\nDespite the obvious differences existing between behavioural and perceptual tasks, people are essentially making similar decisions (to explore a different option; or to exploit the current option). Hence, the broad hypothesis under investigation is that similar tendencies should be found within the same person, across domains.\nFurthermore, because the impact of external bias was minimal in the tasks used, any differences in people’s explorative tendencies should be attributed to stable factors, such as personality traits. To this end, we individuated two broad personality frameworks (the Big Five Model and the Schizotypy construct). In Study 1-4 we examined how people deal with the trade-off between exploration and exploitation from a perceptual perspective, by using binocular rivalry (where an observer is faced with identical, and equally valid, perceptual solutions). In Study 1 we demonstrated that people high in the Openness to Experience trait significantly differed from other people in the way they flexibly explored and combined basic visual stimuli. In Study 2 we looked at whether differences existed in people’s tendencies to explore perceptual solutions following changes in transient emotional state (i.e., arousal) and found that general changes in one’s mood, but not specific type of mood, have a significant impact. In Study 3 we examined whether changes in alternations (i.e., fast or slow) between perceptual solutions were associated with stable personality traits and found that slower alternations were associated with Conscientiousness, characterised by self-control and determination. In Study 4 we examined whether abnormalities in the way perceptual stimuli are “flexibly” processed in people with schizophrenia can be similarly found in a non-clinical population. We found that increased schizotypy was associated with an increase of mixed percept during binocular rivalry. Study 5-6 examined how people deal with the trade-off between exploration and exploitation from a behavioural perspective, by using the Virtual Environment task, which was designed and developed specifically for this aim. The Virtual Environment task was inspired by the animal literature (i.e., the optomotor maze; van Swinderen, 2011) where flies need to choose between identical turning points to advance in the maze. Study 5 presents the findings from the six pilot task. Each version was sequentially developed to rule out potential confounding variables, which might have been responsible for the “unusual” stereotypical behaviour that emerged. That is, people displayed exclusively exploitative tendencies, with no exploration. Study 6 presents the findings from the virtual environment task. Here people showed variability in their explorative tendencies, however, against our prediction an increase of exploration was linked to those personality traits capturing self-discipline (Conscientiousness), rather than flexibility and the tendency to engage with possibilities (Openness to Experience).\nThis was the first evidence of important similarities between perception and behaviour in the way people deal with the trade-off between exploration and exploitation. For example, in relation to the number of decisions, or sampling, of the environment. Our findings also highlighted two important issues in the exploration/exploitation literature. First, they cast doubt on the assumption that humans have a “natural drive to explore” in the absence of rewards. As shown in the difficulties to design appropriate stimuli to observe a balance between exploration/ exploitation in the first place. Second, because our findings did not replicate data from the animal literature, they represent a cautionary tale in interpreting findings from the animal model to be considered valid for humans.",

Results replicated previous findings of a preference for stimulus persons who express \"appropriate\" sex-role interests, with feminine males being rated most negatively. However, as predicted, this effect was moderated by the attitudes toward women held by the research participants. Traditional participants showed a strong attraction preference for masculine male and feminine female strangers, but nontraditional participants were relatively nondiscriminating in their preferences. As attitudes slowly shift in a more egalitarian direction, individuals should become less constrained by current sex-role stereotypes. However, in view of the fact that all participants showed some degree of relative dislike for feminine males on all measures, freedom of role expression may remain more difficult for males than for females.",

      "abstract": "Fifteen women who identify themselves as lesbians were interviewed about their own development of gender identity. All the women involved in the study indicated a rejection of the traditional feminine role. This was often manifested before they were even aware of same‐sex attractions. However, they saw the traditional role for women as representing heterosexuality. To gain access to women, many even saw a need to achieve masculinity. Due to few or no visible lesbian role models and the rejection of the traditional female role, many, as children, chose the male role. This was reflected in: 1) taking the male role in play or fantasy, 2) being a “tomboy”, and 3) rejecting items of dress and play associated with female children. While none, as adults, still wanted to portray a male role, each still rejected traditional femininity. Thus these lesbians had to come to their own conclusions about what it meant not only to be women, but lesbians as well.",

      "title": "Weaponized sex: Defensive pseudo-erotic aggression in the service of safety",
      "abstract": "Problematic sexual behaviors are frequently encountered in the treatment of patients suffering Dissociative Identity Disorder and related forms of dissociative disorders. These may include unfortunate patterns of ready acquiescence or submission to overtly or potentially aggressive or sexual approaches/encounters, subtle and/or overt seductive signaling and behaviors, and even overt sexually provocative patterns of verbalizations and actions. This paper discusses the possibility that in some instances, sexual behavior has become weaponized; that is, deployed in circumstances under which assertiveness and/or aggression or other self-protective measures might be expected, probably because such behaviors were not within the range of the possible or were not understood as potentially successful for some victims of trauma. Clinical manifestations are described and discussed. An animal model in which sexual behaviors substitute for aggressive behaviors is described. A speculative hypothesis is offered, postulating that in some cases, such patterns in traumatized humans might represent an epigenetic response to exogenous trauma. Exploration of this model may lead to improved understandings and approaches to trauma victims who manifest such behavior, hopefully destigmatizing them further, facilitating reduction of their shame and guilt, and supporting their recoveries. Clinical interventions are suggested.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Twenty‐six gay, 24 lesbian, and 49 heterosexual (19 male and 30 female) individuals who were separated from their relationship partner for about 6 months provided reasons why their relationship ended and rated their current separation distress. Relative to partners in heterosexual couples, those in gay or lesbian couples did not differ in reasons for the separation or in level of separation distress. Aspects of relationship quality assessed shortly before the separation occurred did not predict later separation distress. However, individuals who indicated that problems with intimacy were the cause of the separation were unlikely to be distressed by the separation, whereas individuals who indicated that problems with communication were the cause of the separation were likely to be distressed by the separation. Separation distress was positively related to the severity of neurotic symptoms reported when the relationship was intact and was negatively related to the extent to which the separation was expected. It is concluded that separation distress is more strongly related to personal strategies for coping with stress than to relationship‐related events leading to separation.",

      "abstract": "Previous work has documented adolescents' gender stereotype endorsement, or the extent to which one believes men or women should embody certain traits. However, understanding of gender stereotype endorsement in gender diverse adolescents - those who identify with a gender different from their assigned sex at birth - is limited. Gender diverse adolescents' unique lived experiences with gender raise the question of whether they endorse gender stereotypes with the same frequency as cisgender adolescents. In this study, we investigated two primary research questions: (1) if gender diverse (N = 150) and cisgender (N = 174) adolescents (13 - 17 years) or their parents differed from one another in their endorsement of gender stereotypes; (2) the relationship between adolescents' and their parents' endorsement of gender stereotypes, and adolescents' predictions of their parents' endorsement of stereotypes. We found (1) no significant differences between gender diverse and cisgender adolescents in endorsement of gender stereotypes, perceptions of their parents' gender stereotype endorsement, and parents' gender stereotype endorsement, though parents endorsed stereotypes less than adolescents; and (2) adolescents' endorsement of gender stereotypes showed a weak positive association with their parents' gender stereotypes and the adolescents' predictions of their parents' stereotype endorsement, though neither correlation was significant. These results suggest that, in our sample, explicit stereotype endorsement was rare among gender diverse and cisgender adolescents and their parents.",

In the last five years she has become painfully aware that men’s sexuality is different from women’s. Her experiences have certainly been broader than those of most women in her mother’s and grandmother’s generations. Joan came of age in the I97os in a relatively sophisticated urban environment, and she absorbed the notion that sexual equality meant that men and women were basical ly the same-or would be if they were allowed to be. She is thus perplexed as to why men act the way they do, and bitter when they do it. Her philosophy and upbringing did not prepare her for the differences between men’s and women’s sexuality or for her emotional reactions to them.",

Individuals engage in physical activity during leisure-time and also during in many other activities such as walking to work, home maintenance, shopping and child care. Physical activity also occurs on the job is this is referred to as work physical activity. Prior studies have shown that non-work physical activity has a positive impact on health while work physical activity has a negative impact on health. Many prior studies have relied primarily on leisure-time physical activity, which typically constitutes only about 10% of non-work physical activity and does not capture specific information on the intensity or duration of the activity. This study addresses these limitations by constructing measures of physical activity from the American Time Use Surveys, which are all-inclusive and capture the duration of each activity combined with its intensity based on the Metabolic Equivalent of Task (MET). Non-work physical activity tends to be significantly lower for Blacks, Hispanics, other racial groups than for Whites and lower for males than for females. These adjusted differentials are consistent with racial, ethnic and gender differentials in health. About 25-46% of the differentials in non-work physical activity can be attributed to differences in education, socio-economic status, proxies for time constraints, and locational attributes.",

      "title": "Mate Choice, Sex Roles and Sexual Cognition in Vertebrates: Mate Choice Turns Cognition or Cognition Turns Mate Choice?",
      "abstract": "The idea of “smart is sexy,” meaning superior cognition provides competitive benefits in mate choice and, therefore, evolutionary advantages in terms of reproductive fitness, is both exciting and captivating. Cognitively flexible individuals perceive and adapt more dynamically to (unpredictable) environmental changes. The sex roles that females and males adopt within their populations can vary greatly in response to the prevalent mating system. Based on how cognition determines these grossly divergent sex roles, different selection pressures could possibly shape the (progressive) evolution of cognitive abilities, suggesting the potential to induce sexual dimorphisms in superior cognitive abilities. Associations between an individual’s mating success, sexual traits and its cognitive abilities have been found consistently across vertebrate species and taxa, providing evidence that sexual selection may well shape the supporting cognitive prerequisites. Yet, while superior cognitive abilities provide benefits such as higher feeding success, improved antipredator behavior, or more favorable mate choice, they also claim costs such as higher energy levels and metabolic rates, which in turn may reduce fecundity, growth, or immune response. There is compelling evidence in a variety of vertebrate taxa that females appear to prefer skilled problem-solver males, i.e., they prefer those that appear to have better cognitive abilities. Consequently, cognition is also likely to have substantial effects on sexual selection processes. How the choosing sex assesses the cognitive abilities of potential mates has not been explored conclusively yet. Do cognitive skills guide an individual’s mate choice and does learning change an individual’s mate choice decisions? How and to which extent do individuals use their own cognitive skills to assess those of their conspecifics when choosing a mate? How does an individual’s role within a mating system influence the choice of the choosing sex in this context? Drawing on several examples from the vertebrate world, this review aims to elucidate various aspects associated with cognitive sex differences, the different roles of males and females in social and sexual interactions, and the potential influence of cognition on mate choice decisions. Finally, future perspectives aim to identify ways to answer the central question of how the triad of sex, cognition, and mate choice interacts.",

The present study targeted to explore the predictive role of sexual functioning and problematic pornography use on life satisfaction in three cohorts related perspective, considering generational identity (Gen X, Gen Y, Gen Z). This research was conducted on a multigenerational sample, given the acknowledged role of sexuality in life satisfaction, considering age and generational characteristics. In general, previous articles do not work with more than one generation at a time or do not focus specifically on generational cohorts. The relationship between life satisfaction and sexuality has been much discussed in previous research, but not in intergenerational studies. Most articles focus mainly on the younger population, data regarding the older age group is scarce. Sexual functioning and sexual dysfunctions are often targeted psychological variables of sexuality. Problematic online pornography use is however a less researched topic, especially in the case of older generational cohorts, like Gen X and Baby boomers. As formerly presented, sexual functioning has a key role in adult life satisfaction, but there is a scarcity in cohort-based approach, when generational identity is considered.",

      "abstract": "It is difficult to develop a universal classification or list of characteristics that will consistently identify a child sexual offender. Child molesters are masters at presenting a facade that makes them indistinguishable from the rest of the population. “The great fallacy that sex offenders are hiding in bushes or lurking in trees and this kind of stuff is a crock…we’re the guy who lives next door, we’re the guy that’s coaching your kid’s baseball team, and we’re the priest at the church.”¹ Researchers have developed a variety of classifications such as Fixed vs. Regressed offenders, Situational vs. Preferential offenders, Incestuous vs. Non-incestuous offenders, or Socially competent vs. Socially incompetent offenders, but none of these classifications captures the vast array of individual characteristics or social circumstances of all child sexual offenders. There are, however, patterns of behavior and personality characteristics that have been associated with offenders who are inclined to sexually molest a child. One such pattern of behavior is victim selection and manipulation. Offenders will not only select a victim they are physically attracted to but one who they believe they can control. Offenders exercise great caution when selecting their victims and are very methodical about grooming and manipulating their victims into submission. From the offender’s perspective this will reduce the chances of being arrested, prosecuted and jailed for their crime. If the victim does not report the abuse no one will ever know.",

It also incorporates the understanding of others' sexual desires, and how to approach and manage intimacy with another person. Although sexual development and sexuality are founded in biology (Harden, 2014; Rodgers & Rowe, 1993), they also evolve from new life experiences that become more prevalent in adolescence, including the tendency to form close, dyadic relationships with peers of the same and other sex, and increased autonomy to spend more time with peers without the presence or supervision of parents or other adults (Impett & Tolman, 2006; Savin-Williams & Diamond, 2004; Zimmer-Gembeck, Ducat, & Collins, 2011; Zimmer-Gembeck, 2002).

Evidence suggests that a relationship may be placed at risk during the grief process, with different forms and rates of grieving between the couple creating barriers to effective communication and increasing feelings of vulnerability. Fifty-one adults who had experienced the loss of a baby as a result of miscarriage or stillbirth took part in this preliminary study to identify gender differences in coping strategies used by males and females in dealing with their loss. Results suggested not only gender differences in chosen coping strategies, but also differences between women depending on the type of loss experienced (ie miscarriage or stillbirth). While men tended to worry, use social support and ignore the situation, women were more likely to seek spiritual support, use tension reduction, wishful thinking and seek support from others who had experienced the same loss. A tendency to use self-blame was also evident in the responses of the female subjects, in particular women who had suffered a miscarriage.©1997 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",

      "abstract": "Consensual nonmonogamy (CNM) is an overarching term for relationship orientations that differ based on the degree to which consensual sexual and emotional needs are fulfilled outside of a dyad. Despite the diversity of CNM relationship orientations and growing research examining CNM, it is unclear whether the sexual attitudes, inclination to approach/avoid sexual stimuli (i.e., erotophobia-erotophilia), and sociosexuality differ among individuals who identify with distinct CNM relationships. Further, as the agreements made in CNM relationships permit extradyadic relationships, important differences might emerge for CNM and monogamous individuals. A convenience sample (N = 641) of individuals who self-identified as monogamous (n = 447), open (n = 80), polyamorous (n = 62), or swinger (n = 52) provided ratings of their sexual attitudes, erotophobia-erotophilia, and sociosexuality. Results indicated that swingers had the most permissive and instrumental attitudes, were the most erotophilic, and were the most unrestricted sexually. Conversely, monogamists scored the lowest on these traits. No differences emerged between relationship orientations for attitudes toward communion and birth control. These findings have important implications for sexuality research because they reinforce the view that some underlying differences and similarities exist between monogamous and CNM individuals.",

      "title": "Sexual activity, sexual thoughts, and intimacy among older adults: Links with physical health and psychosocial resources for successful aging.",
      "abstract": "Research on close relationships in later life has received increased attention over the past decade. However, little is known about sexuality and intimacy in old age. Using cross-sectional data from the Berlin Aging Study II (BASE-II; Mage = 68 years, SD = 3.68; 50% women; N = 1,514), we examine age differences in behavioral (sexual activity), cognitive (sexual thoughts), and emotional (intimacy) facets of sexuality and investigate associations with physical health and psychosocial resources for successful aging. Older age was associated with less sexual activity and fewer sexual thoughts, but not with differences in intimacy. Relative to a reference sample of 22- to 36-year-olds within BASE-II (N = 475), the average older adult reported considerably fewer sexual activity and thoughts (ds > .60), but only slightly lower intimacy (d = .20). Substantial heterogeneity existed among older adults, with almost one third of the 60- to 82-year-olds reporting more sexual activity and thoughts than the average younger adult. Examining correlates of sexuality among older adults revealed that, covarying for diagnosed illnesses and performance-based grip strength, psychosocial factors (e.g., partnered, relationship satisfaction) accounted for considerable shares of variance in sexual activity and intimacy, whereas age and gender explained more of the variance in sexual thoughts. Some psychosocial factors exhibited similar-sized associations with all sexuality facets, whereas other factors operated in more facet-specific ways. To illustrate, participants reporting more loneliness also reported less sexual activity and less intimacy, but not fewer sexual thoughts. We discuss implications of our findings for theories of successful aging. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved).",

      "abstract": "There is no universal definition of child sexual abuse. However, a central characteristic of any abuse is the dominant position of an adult that allows him or her to force or coerce a child into sexual activity. Child sexual abuse [CSA] may include fondling a child’s genitals, masturbation, oral-genital contact, digital penetration, and vaginal and anal intercourse. Child sexual abuse is not solely restricted to physical contact; such abuse could include noncontact abuse, such as exposure, voyeurism, and child pornography. Abuse by peers also occurs.",

      "abstract": "Der Singstreit in humanethologischer Perspektive Traditionen gesungener Wortgefechte sind von zahlreichen voneinander unabhängigen Kulturen in der ganzen Welt bekannt. Ethnographische Quellen über mehr als 20 Singstreit-Traditionen, unter anderem auch moderne subkulturelle Phänomene, wurden auf Form und Funktion der Praktiken untersucht. Die beobachteten Singstreite weisen eine Reihe gemeinsamer Merkmale auf: Eine große Mehrheit der Praktiken werden fast ausschließlich von Männern ausgeführt, folgen strengen formalen Regeln, implizieren Status und Belohnung und dienen als Mittel der Aggressionskontrolle und Konfliktlösung bis hin zur etablierten Gerichtsbarkeit. Der Singstreit ist für die Teilnehmer kostspielig und riskant und kann daher als ”honest signalling” im Sinne von Zahavis ”Handicap-Prinzip” verstanden werden. Die Charakteristika des Singstreits entsprechen den verhaltensbiologischen Kriterien des Turnierkampfes: ein ritualisiertes Duell männlicher Artgenossen, eine adaptive Verhaltensstrategie im Zusammenhang mit sexueller Selektion und Rang, bei der durch regelhafte Abfolge schwere körperliche Beschädigungen vermieden werden. Die kulturübergreifende ähnlichkeit der Singstreit-Praktiken lässt vermuten, dass es sich hier um ein ererbtes Muster einer musikalischen Kommunikationsstrategie handelt. Die Traditionen verblassen mit zunehmender Zivilisation, können jedoch auch in urbanen Subkulturen (Rap) in ähnlicher Form neu entstehen. Wir folgern, dass (a) Funktionen musikalischen Verhaltens im intrasexuellen Wettbewerb und (b) Gesang als hoch-ritualisierter Modus der verbalen Kommunikation im Dienste von Aggressionskontrolle und sozialer Stabilität wesentlich zur Evolution kognitiver und performativer musikalischer Fähigkeiten des Menschen beigetragen haben.",

      "abstract": "Sex differences in jealousy responses to sexual and emotional infidelity are robust in samples of heterosexual adults, especially in more gender egalitarian nations. However, investigations of when and how these differences develop have been scant. We applied two forced choice infidelity scenarios in a large community sample of high school students (age 16-19, N = 1266). In line with previous findings on adults using the forced choice paradigm, adolescent males found the sexual aspect of imagined infidelity more distressing than adolescent females did. Nevertheless, there was no effect of age on the jealousy responses, and age did not moderate the sex difference. There were neither any effects of three covariates (having had first sexual intercourse, being in a committed romantic relationship, and sociosexuality), neither as markers of pubertal maturation nor as psychosocial environmental stimuli. Future research needs to investigate even younger samples in order to specify at what age the sex difference in jealousy responses emerges.",

S s were 54 preschool and kindergarten boys and girls. Trios (N = 18) of S s were formed, and each trio included a younger friend, an older friend, and a same-sex peer who was unfamiliar to either friend. Friendship condition, sex, and order of pairing of friends and nonfriends within trios were the independent variables of interest. Significant order × condition and order × sex × condition interactions were not attributable to separation. Rather, when dyads composed of a younger friend and a nonfriend were the first trio members to play together, high frequencies of ignoring and rejecting behaviors occurred. These behaviors were more common for female than for male dyads.",

Older women showed less achievement motivation and had a greater need for affiliation than young adult and midlife women. Career women had a more internalized locus of control than homemakers and students.

Family sex communication has been studied with a limited range of adolescent sexual behaviors but not sexual fantasy or desire. Two measures of family sex communication were compared and examined in relation to measures of sexual fantasy, desire, attitudes, and behavior among a sample of 522 females and males in their late adolescence. An expanded range of sexual behaviors was assessed. Family sex communication was not associated with level of sexual fantasy, desire, attitudes, or most sexual behaviors. Causal inferences cannot be made, but parents might consider talking openly with their children about sexual matters without fearing that such communication will ignite their sexual desire or prompt sexual behavior.

      "abstract": "While most studies on sexuality in later life report that sexual desire declines with age, little is known about the exact nature of age effects on sexual desire. Using self-reported dyadic sexual desire relating to a partner, dyadic sexual desire relating to an attractive person, and solitary sexual desire from a large (N > 8000) and age diverse (14.6-80.2 years) online sample, the current study had three goals: First, we investigated relationships between men and women's sexual desire and age. Second, we examined whether individual differences such as gender/sex, sexual orientation, self-rated masculinity, relationship status, self-rated attractiveness, and self-rated health predict sexual desire. Third, we examined how these associations differed across sexual desire facets. On average, the associations between age and both men and women's sexual desire followed nonlinear trends and differed between genders/sexes and types of sexual desire. Average levels of all types of sexual desire were generally higher in men. Dyadic sexual desire related positively to self-rated masculinity and having a romantic partner and solitary desire was higher in people with same-sex attraction. We discuss the results in the context of the evolutionary hypothesis that predict an increase of sexual desire and female reproductive effort prior to declining fertility. Our findings both support and challenge beliefs about gender/sex specificity of age effects on sexual desire and highlight the importance of differentiating between desire types.",

Mean age of first use of each drug was compared to mean age of first arrest, of first robbery/theft, and of first drug dealing.In this sample, approximately 59% of adolescents had already robbed and/or stolen, 38.6% had already been arrested, 32.3% had prior history of drug dealing, 24.1% had depression, and 9.6% had conduct disorder. Prevalence of conduct problems was 65.2%. Tobacco, alcohol, marijuana and cocaine were used before the first robbery and/or theft, first drug dealing, and first arrest.The fact that drug use onset preceded illegal acts suggests that the latter are the consequence of the consumption of the former, or perhaps, the consequence of \"social invisibility\" (feeling of not belonging to anything or to anybody) by which these youths undergo.Labeling these youths as conduct-disordered adolescents may cloud a rather different reality, and it may submit them to more social isolation and stigmatization as well.",

      "abstract": "Accepted at the Journal of Social and Personal Relationships Abstract: Support for a spouse with psychological distress can be expressed in many different ways. Previous research indicates that support expression is shaped by gender, but we do not know much about how support within marriage is provided in response to a spouse’s distress outside of a different-sex couple context. In this study, we analyze dyadic data from 378 midlife married couples (35-65 years; N = 756 individuals) within the U.S. to examine how men and women in same- and different-sex relationships provide support when they perceive that their spouse is experiencing distress. We find women in different-sex couples are less likely to report taking care of their distressed spouse’s tasks or giving their distressed spouse more personal time and space compared to women in same-sex couples and men. We also find that men in different-sex couples are less likely to report encouraging their spouse to talk compared to men in same-sex couples and women. Being personally stressed by a spouse’s distress is positively associated with providing support to that spouse, whereas feeling that a spouse’s distress is stressful for the marriage is negatively associated with providing support. This study advances understanding of gendered provisions of support in response to psychological distress in marriage, moving beyond a framing of women as fundamentally more supportive than men to a consideration of how these dynamics may be different or similar in same- and different-sex marital contexts.",

      "abstract": "Intersexed children are born with genitalia and/or reproductive organs that do not look like those of most biological males or females. Doctors and parents usually assign an intersexed child a gender at birth or during early childhood. Occasionally, an individual will reject his or her gender of assignment and will want to take on a different gender role. Some clinicians and intersex advocates instruct parents to accept an intersexed child's expressions of gender identity and to support the child's gender role change. There is a risk, however, that parents may resist or prevent a child's gender transition due to their own discomfort with the idea or based on a physician's recommendation. A statutory framework that allowed intersexed minors to complete a social gender transition, coupled with a provision equating parental interference with this transition with actionable neglect, would protect intersexed children's autonomy and prevent the trauma that can result from a forced existence in a gender role with which a child does not identify. The proposed framework would likely survive a constitutional challenge by the parents of an intersexed child because the harm caused by the parental decision to interfere with a child's gender expression removes such interference from the realm of constitutionally protected parental decisionmaking.",

      "title": "Moral essentialism and generosity among children and adults.",
      "abstract": "Children and adults view many characteristics in an essentialist way-as innate, immutable, and biological. Prior work has typically investigated essentialism regarding broad domains (e.g., gender rather than maleness/femaleness). Using the example of morality, the current work asked whether individuals view different components of 1 domain (goodness/badness) differently and whether such views might influence behavior. Five- to 8-year-olds reported more essentialism than adults; however, both children and adults viewed goodness in more essentialist terms than badness. Although views of morally relevant characteristics in general did not significantly predict generosity (Study 1), essentialist views of the recipient did influence generosity (Studies 2 and 3). Adults shared fewer resources than would be expected by chance with people whose badness was described in essentialist terms (and consequently more resources than would be expected by chance with people whose badness was described in nonessentialist terms), an effect that did not appear to be driven by demand characteristics and that persisted even when both descriptions explicitly noted that the character would always remain bad. Although adults reported less essentialism than children, essentialist descriptions appeared to influence their behaviors more. This work highlights the need to investigate essentialism regarding specific domain components (e.g., goodness/badness) in addition to the domain overall (e.g., morality), partially because essentialism impacts behavior differently across components. Findings also suggest that emphasizing situational factors contributing to wrongdoing and a transgressor's ability to change may benefit people when they have committed moral violations.

Overall, respondents tended to be politically liberal, not highly religious, and supportive of marriage equality for same-sex couples. Women were more likely than men to be in a committed relationship. Virtually all coupled gay men and lesbians had a same-sex partner, whereas the vast majority of coupled bisexuals were in a heterosexual relationship. Compared with bisexuals, gay men and lesbians reported stronger commitment to a sexual-minority identity, greater community identification and involvement, and more extensive disclosure of their sexual orientation to others. Most respondents reported experiencing little or no choice about their sexual orientation.

      "abstract": "Some prejudices share cross-cultural patterns, but others are more variable and culture specific. Those sharing cross-cultural patterns (sexism, ageism) each combine societal status differences and intimate interdependence. For example, in stereotypes of sex and age, lower status groups—women and elders—gain stereotypic warmth (from their cooperative interdependence) but lose stereotypic competence (from their lower status); men and middle-aged adults show the opposite trade-off, stereotypically more competent than warm. Meta-analyses support these widespread ambivalent (mixed) stereotypes for gender and age across cultures. Social class stereotypes often share some similarities (cold but competent rich vs. warm but incompetent poor). These compensatory warmth versus competence stereotypes may function to manage common human dilemmas of interacting across societal and personal positions. However, other stereotypes are more variable and culture specific (ethnicity, race, religion). Case studies of specific race/ethnicities and religions reveal much more cultural variation in their stereotype content, supporting their being responses to particular cultural contexts, apparent accidents of history.

      "title": "Active phenotypic assortment in mate selection: Self‐descriptions and sought‐for attributes of mates in dating advertisements",
      "abstract": "Assortative mating results both from social homogamy (coming for similar environments) and active phenotypic assortment (seeking a mate with desired attributes). Dating advertisements provide a means of assessing the role of active phenotypic assortment in the absence of social homogamy. The relative frequency of mention of different attributes (given limited advertising space) is informative regarding the salience of these attributes in active phenotypic assortment. Sex differences in self descriptions and in attributes desired in others in dating advertisements provide a means of evaluating sociobiological issues. Data were analyzed from 191 ads placed by females and 253 ads placed by males seeking to meet members of the opposite sex. The most frequently mentioned attributes are age, race, occupation, moral characteristics, and physical attractiveness. While close to 80 per cent of the advertisers provided information concerning their own race/ethnicity, only a minority of those providing such information limited their quest for a partner to members of their own race/ethnicity. There is substantial assortative mating for religion, family background, status, and educational attainment, yet these attributes are rarely (religion and education) or never (family background) mentioned in advertisements, suggesting that assortative mating on these dimensions may be solely a consequence of social homogamy.",

      "title": "Child sexual abuse : Disclosure, social support and subjective health in adulthood",
      "abstract": "Child sexual abuse (CSA) is a known risk factor for ill-health. It is assumed that the health consequences are worse if the abuse has been considered severe or if the child has been exposed to cumulative trauma, e.g. physical abuse or other stressful life events. However, symptom development seems to vary widely between individuals. According to developmental theories the dynamic interplay between environmental and individual conditions creates a course toward either healthy or maladaptive outcomes. Social support has been shown to have a strong influence, direct or indirect, on abuse sequelae – a higher amount of support is related to better psychological functioning. However, adult victims may have difficulties forming close relationships with others due to lack of trust and other abuse aftermath. Further, despite a high risk for ill-health victims often fail to disclose the abuse. If they do tell they are not rarely met by negative reactions, which has been related to worse outcome. Delayed disclosure is related to intrafamilial abuse, closeness to the perpetrator, multiple perpetrators, age at onset and severe abuse. The victim may experience a psychological disclosure dilemma: the need to tell in order to get support is weighed against the risk to receive negative reactions. Thus, the overall aim of the thesis was to contribute knowledge concerning the relationship between child sexual abuse, disclosure, social support, and subjective health in adult women reporting experiences of sexual child maltreatment. Methods. The thesis was based on a study with a cross-sectional design using retrospective data about abuse and disclosure experiences as well as current data about health and social support. Participants (n = 152, aged 20-60 years) were recruited by advertisements in a membership magazine published by a national organisation for sexually abused women providing activities for support and healing, as well as in staff magazines for municipal employees in the Stockholm area. Data was retrieved by both a semi-structured interview and questionnaires. Analyses included quantitative methods (variable-approach and person-approach) as well as qualitative methods. Results. The results showed that disclosure characteristics were more prominently related to health than sexual abuse characteristics. Moreover, in spite of experiences of severe abuse and negative reactions after disclosure it was possible to get access to health enhancing social support in adulthood. The relation between disclosure-related events and health was dependent on source and type of reaction, in favour of partner and friends. A positive reaction from a partner was strongly related to subjective health. It may be crucial for victims of CSA who have problems with trust and intimacy to get emotional support, acceptance and respect from a partner in overcoming these feelings. Further, two groups of women reporting good health in spite of severe abuse were found by cluster analysis. The groups were among other things characterised by a high proportion of women who had formerly been active members in the support organisation. A qualitative analysis of the member’s experiences from the organisation showed that a victim process altering the victim identity over time seemed to constitute an important part of the individual development. However, few members who had gone through crucial steps of the victim process seemed to remain in the organisation passing the knowledge on to new members, thus creating a chronic structural problem for the organisation to deal with. Conclusions. Social support is a crucial protective factor for victims of child sexual abuse, a group highly at risk for and ill-health and adverse outcome. Victims of child sexual abuse seek and receive social support in various ways depending on severity of abuse, timing of disclosure and choice of disclosure receiver. Thus, the whole disclosure process during life is important to consider when studying disclosure-related events in relation to social support and health. Further, different methods of analyses may contribute to the understanding of how risk and protective factors interact. Both variableand person-based methods pointed at the importance of resources like self-esteem and social support above the amount of risk factors for health outcome. Finding ways to combine self-help with professional help might be fruitful and constitutes a further challenge for psychiatry when it comes to the task of developing new and effective care for this group.",

      "abstract": "Most men show genital sexual arousal to one preferred gender. Most women show genital arousal to both genders, regardless of their sexual preferences. There is limited knowledge of whether this difference is driven by biological sex or gender identity. Transgender individuals, whose birth sex and gender identity are incongruent, provide a unique opportunity to address this question. We tested whether the genital responses of 25 (female-to-male) transgender men followed their female birth sex or male gender identity. Depending on their surgical status, arousal was assessed with penile gauges or vaginal plethysmographs. Transgender men’s sexual arousal showed both male-typical and female-typical patterns. Across measures, they responded more strongly to their preferred gender than to the other gender, similar to (but not entirely like) 145 cisgender (nontransgender) men. However, they still responded to both genders, similar to 178 cisgender women. In birth-assigned women, both gender identity and biological sex may influence sexual-arousal patterns.",

      "title": "FEMALE = SUBMISSIVE and MALE = ASSERTIVE Sexuality-priming leads to gender-based self-perception and automatic behavior",
      "abstract": "Sexuality is a domain in which gender stereotypes thrive. A cultural standard for the sexual experience and expression of women and men prescribes different gender roles in sexuality. Women�s sexual role is submissive and tender, men�s assertive and dominant. These sexual roles reflect the stereotypical view of women as more communal and men as more agentic. If gender stereotypes and sexual roles are activated by sexuality cues, this may have consequences for subsequent thought and behavior. Specifically, following reminders of sex, men�s and women�s self-perceptions may become more gender-stereotypical, and they may identify more strongly with their respective sexes. Moreover, research on prime-to-behavior effects has shown that priming affects a person�s momentary self-representation (the �active self�), which can lead to corresponding behavioral effects (e.g., Wheeler, DeMarree, & Petty, 2007). Thus, after sex-priming the prescriptive gender stereotypes of sexual submissiveness among women and sexual assertiveness among men may manifest themselves in participants� non-sexual social behavior. In four studies, sexuality was primed using visual (Study 1) and verbal (Study 2 through 4) material. Sex-priming led to a gender-based self-perception, i.e. women�s communal orientation was more pronounced relative to their agency, whereas for men the opposite was true (Study 1 and 4), heightened identification with one�s own gender (Study 2), and prompted greater submissiveness in women (Study 3 and 4) and greater assertiveness in men (Study 3). More specifically, in Study 3 changes in participants� signature size were unobtrusively measured after sex-priming to check for changes in assertiveness. Men�s signatures were larger following sex-priming whereas women�s were not. In Study 4 sex-primed women hesitated longer before interrupting an experimenter chatting on the telephone, thus revealing a more submissive approach to social interaction. In sum, these findings support the hypothesis that following sex-priming, self-perception and social behavior �tune in� to gender stereotypes. The potentially detrimental effects of casual �sex-priming� in everyday life on self-perceptions and mixed-sex social interactions are discussed.",

The role of disrespect, a factor that might serve as an abrasive in marriage, was investigated. Couples above average on disrespect spent more time apart on days when there had been a big fight, considerable annoyance, or anger; couples below average on disrespect spent more time together on days when there had been a big fight, considerable annoyance, or anger. This finding suggests that therapy for couples with a presenting problem of insufficient contact may first have to deal with abrasive factors.",

Analyses revealed that sex differences in masculinity and sex role attitudes increased across grades, but not sex differences in femininity. Pubertal timing was not associated with this gender divergence, although the evidence is equivocal for boys.

      "abstract": "Little research has been conducted to examine paraphilic sexual interests in nonclinical samples. The little that exists suggests that atypical sexual interests are more common in men than in women, but the reasons for this difference are unknown. In this study, we explored the prevalence of paraphilic interests in a nonclinical sample of men and women. We expected that men would report greater arousal (or less repulsion) toward various paraphilic acts than women. We also examined putative correlates of paraphilias in an attempt to explain the sex difference. In all, 305 men and 710 women completed an online survey assessing sexual experiences, sexual interests, as well as indicators of neurodevelopmental stress, sex drive, mating effort, impulsivity, masculinity/femininity, and socially desirable responding. As expected, significant sex differences were found, with men reporting significantly less repulsion (or more arousal) to the majority of paraphilic acts than women. Using mediation analysis, sex drive was the only correlate to significantly and fully mediate the sex difference in paraphilic interests. In other words, sex drive fully accounted for the sex difference in paraphilic interests. The implications of these findings for understanding the etiology of atypical sexual interests are discussed.",

Other questions included examining how the interviewees viewed a situation where a girl shows and/or says no and a boy still ignores her sexual integrity.\n\nThe study was based on six qualitative interviews.\n\nThe interviewees considered non-verbal communication about both yes and no to sex in a sober condition superior to verbal communication. The study also showed that the sexual responsibilities for girls increase during intoxication, while the responsibilities for boys decrease. A majority of the interviewees considered that a girl who didn't want to participate in sex must be very explicit when expressing her no, and if not, there was an understanding that a boy can misinterpret or ignore a no. Rape was by some defined as an act done against one's will, while others claimed that several explicit nos had to be infringed to classify it as rape.",

However it occurs often in dynamically developing firms that ethical norms are not kept and this process is observed by lack of equal chances to get a job  people without connections remain without work. Due to different research the very serious problem is a phenomena of mobbing. Psychological terror or mobbing in working life involves hostile and unethical communication which is directed in a systematic manner by one or more individuals, mainly toward one individual, who, due to mobbing, is pushed into a helpless and defenseless position and held there by means of continuing mobbing activities. These actions occur on a very frequent basis (statistical definition: at least once a week) and over a long period of time (statistical definition: at least six months´ duration). Because of the high frequency and long duration of hostile behavior, this maltreatment results in considerable mental, psychosomatic and social misery.",

Especificamente, se busca indagar tres areas relativas a la construccion de la identidad de genero: los imaginarios de feminidad y masculinidad, las relaciones y practicas afectivo-sexuales, y el autoconcepto corporal. Se parte de la hipotesis de que existe una diferencia de genero clave para entender la vivencia de estas tres areas por parte de los sujetos: las mujeres, tras la adquisicion de una diversidad funcional fisica, encuentran mas barreras a la hora de construir o rehacer una vida afectivo-sexual satisfactoria y sustentar un autoconcepto corporal positivo que sus homologos masculinos. La diversidad funcional fisica supone el paso de la posesion de un cuerpo “valido” (supuestamente capaz, productivo y reproductivo) a uno “no-valido” (concebido como incapaz, improductivo y no-reproductivo), esta investigacion plantea como hipotesis que los cuerpos resultantes suponen un cuestionamiento al modelo dicotomico y binario sexo-genero ya que no cumplen con los preceptos definitorios de la masculinidad y la feminidad hegemonicas.

Specifi-cally, it seeks to investigate three areas: femininity and masculinity imaginaries, relationships and affective-sexual prac-tices, and self-concept. It starts from the assumption that there is a gender difference which is key to understand the experience of these three areas by the subjects: women, following the acquisition of physical disability, experience more barriers in satisfactorily building and reshaping their emotional and sexual life, and sustaining a positive self-concept, than their male counterparts. Physical disability involves the passage of possessing a valid (capable, productive and reproductive) to a non-valid one (conceived as incompetent, unproductive and non-reproductive). This research raises as hypotheses that resulting bodies pose a challenge to the dichotomous model and sex-gender binary as they do not meet the defining precepts of hegemonic masculinity and femininity. To test this hypothesis we proceeded to the application of a qualitative methodology through performing six body routes, three men and three women with spinal cord injury.",

Here, we contrast play with two well-understood forms of behavior—exploration and exploitation—and investigate the hypothesis that at least some forms of play have objectives that are distinct from both information gain and reward. In both a foraging task reminiscent of classical decision-making studies and a more naturalistic setting (interacting with a commonly available playset), we analyzed US children’s behavior when given a prompt guiding them to explore, exploit, play, or do whatever they wanted to do. We found in both experiments that children’s behavior differed significantly and systematically across conditions. These results suggest that play does not merely involve seeking information or reward but is a distinct mode of behavior with other motivations. In particular, when they were instructed to play, children preferentially generated new goals and attempted to accomplish them.",

The four groups were consistently similar in terms of frequency of partnership types (men with lovers, one-night-stands, other partners), monogamy, types of sexual behaviors with men and women, number of occasions of different behaviors, condom use during sex, and history of childhood sexual abuse. The four groups also had similar scores in most of the psychosocial variables usually related to condom use. These similarities validate the clustering of these four populations under a common category (Latino or Hispanic) for reporting and prevention purposes. This does not imply, however, that small scale interventions tailored to the specific cultural nuances of different national groups may not have an added strength. In the few cases where intraethnic differences were found, Mexican MSM were more likely than men in the other groups to receive ejaculate both in the rectum and in the mouth. These differences were not accounted for by the other variables examined and requires further investigation.",

      "title": "A sex difference in the context sensitivity of dominance perceptions",
      "abstract": "Although dominance perceptions are thought to be important for effective social interaction, their primary function is unclear. One possibility is that they simply function to identify individuals who are capable of inflicting substantial physical harm, so that the perceiver can respond to them in ways that maximize their own physical safety. Another possibility is that they are more specialized, functioning primarily to facilitate effective direct (i.e., violent) intrasexual competition for mates, particularly among men. Here we used a priming paradigm to investigate these two possibilities. Facial cues of dominance were more salient to women after they had been primed with images of angry men, a manipulation known to activate particularly strong self-protection motivations, than after they had been primed with images of angry women or smiling individuals of either sex. By contrast, dominance cues were more salient to men after they had been primed with images of women than when they had been primed with images of men (regardless of the emotional expressions displayed), a manipulation previously shown to alter men's impressions of the sex ratio of the local population. Thus, men's dominance perceptions appear to be specialized for effective direct competition for mates, while women's dominance perceptions may function to maximize their physical safety more generally. Together, our results suggest that men's and women's dominance perceptions show different patterns of context-sensitivity and, potentially, shed new light on the routes through which violence and intrasexual competition have shaped dominance perceptions.",

      "abstract": "F or the chronic pain sufferer, sexual expression may become distorted, inhibited, sublimated, alienated, demanding or fearful-patterns frequently seen in people who view sexual activity as a duty or a means of procreation. The idea that sexual activity will cause, precipitate, or aggravate the pain may yield reluctance to participate, thus further anxiety and depression, which can diminish sexual function. Yet the human need and desire for sexual warmth is not negated by pain. Sexuality does not stop when pain strikes, it merely changes. Some form of sexual expression is possible for, and the right of any, regardless of disability, according to Weinberg(1). Although illnesses and surgical procedures may produce sexual difficulties, none have more devastating effects than diseases of the neuromuscular system(2). Any impairment of parasympathetic nerve activity, or loss of muscular and/or skeletal movement-such as with multiple sclerosis, muscular dystrophy, or arthritis-can involve sexual dysfunction. The most difficult position for people with restrictive movement is the one most frequently used for intercourse. Although the male-on-top position allows good vocal and visual communication, a female with arthritis may be unable to abduct and rotate her hips for the supine position(3). Alternative sidelying and rear-entry positions may be less strenuous and may ease the partner's fear of causing pain. Major tranquilizers, skeletal muscle relaxants, and narcotics are a major part of some pain treatments but a diminished libido and potency are common side effects. Patients need to be informed about these effects and should be helped in timing their doses. Peter Koestenbaum writes, many people conceptualize their dissatisfaction with life in terms of sexual problems, but their real difficulty lies in",

      "abstract": "I propose a theory that puts the notion of two sexual attractions into a precise, testable form, and then I mesh it with the periodic table model of the gender transpositions described previously (Pillard & Weinrich, 1987). I define a limerent sexual attraction, active in eroticizing the physical and personality characteristics of a particular Limerent Object, and a lusty sexual attraction, active in producing erotic arousal when encountering a new Lusty Object. Three hypotheses then account for much of what we know about sexual orientation: (a) Limerence and lustiness are experienced by both men and women—but there is an average difference in the ease with which each can be elicited in a particular sex. Limerence is experienced by most women in our culture as an autonomously arising desire, whereas lustiness, when it occurs, is experienced mostly as a reaction to particular stimuli. Lustiness is experienced by most men in our culture as an autonomously arising desire, whereas limerence, when it occurs, is experienced mostly in reaction to particular stimuli. (b) In some people the limerent attraction can be indifferent (or nearly so) to the sex or gender of the Limerent Object. (c) The lusty attraction is rarely indifferent to the sex or gender of the Lusty Object. Individuals may vary in their readiness to respond to the two kinds of attraction. Some of this variability can be understood in the light of the periodic table model described previously, and some of it can be understood in the light of cultural conditioning and socialization. The result is a theory that deduces many of the major facts about sexual orientation from only a small number of hypotheses.",

By comparing the real and the ideal choose by sex, in a general form, it founded that both sexes would have the same tendency by choosing a different person but with similar characteristics of their actual couple.

      "title": "Sexual Initiation and Developmental Changes",
      "abstract": "ADOLESCENCE IS A UNIQUE developmental stage in the life cycle of human sex and sexuality. During this stage, young people experience relatively rapid changes in cognitive, emotional, and physical capacities, and also in family and social relations (e.g., growing autonomy from parents, greater peer affiliation, and gender dynamics). All these domains have significant effects on sexual behaviors. As an implication that these rapid changes occur, we expect sexual behaviors and their determinants to differ by age. The factors that motivate a 14-year-old to engage in sexual intercourse and use condoms may not be the same as those for a 17-year-old. Fundamental data that focus specifically on developmental changes in sex and sexuality during adolescence are lacking. Without these data, interventions run the risk of developing a “one size fits all” approach, which because of its insensitivity to age differences may fail for adolescents as a whole, and may not be effective for any specific age group. One reason for the lack of data on developmental changes in sex and sexuality is that such data are difficult to collect. Aside from obvious political and ethical issues that these studies create, there are operational and analytic complexities in conducting the necessary studies. The report by Rosenthal and colleagues clearly struggled with these challenges and overcame many of them to emerge with some important insights into the age-related difference in adolescents’ reasons for engaging in sexual intercourse. Under ideal conditions, investigators conducting adolescent developmental studies would recruit and enroll early adolescents, then follow and assess them regularly until they are late adolescents or young adults. Such a longitudinal design allows for within-subject analysis of changes, which is the gold standard for tracking age-related changes. This design contrasts with cross-sectional data analyses, in which early adolescents are compared with middle or late adolescents on the basis of age, using a between-subject analysis. Between-subject analyses may be biased by cohort effects. Temporal shifts in sexual and contraceptive behaviors may confound the interpretation of age differences. For example, a school district may enact a sex education curriculum program at different grade levels, which could shift norms in these grades. Although prospective research is needed, it is difficult to retain adolescent participants, especially high-risk adolescents, over a period of time sufficient to observe hypothesized changes. Adolescents move in and out of study catchment areas, change addresses within catchments, and become lost to follow-up evaluation, or they may change their minds about participating in the study after one or more visits. These problems contribute to mounting attrition rates as the studies continue. Rosenthal and colleagues used an innovatively combined cross-sectional and longitudinal design. They were able to retain 75% of their sample through at least five of a possible seven study visits over 3 years, and thus could examine within-subject changes over time in adolescents’ reasons for having sex. Because initiation of sex is a one-time event, the investigators conducted a between-subjects cross-sectional analysis for this behavior, comparing younger and older adolescents. Assuming factors that vary by age are developmentally based, this study provides important insights into developmentally based reasons for initiating sex and engaging in sex thereafter. A review of the study results makes it apparent that the adolescents’ reasons for initiating sex were similar to the reasons for having sex once they had become sexually active. Peer-related sexual behavior was reported by younger girls as a reason for having intercourse, whereas relationship factors (i.e., physical or emotional attraction) were a reported reason among older girls. This makes sense in light of theoretical and empirical developmental data, which suggest that peers may be an important influence during early to middle adolescence, and that relationship factors are relatively more important during later adolescence. It was disturbing to see results suggesting that younger adolescents are being coerced into having intercourse. Of the girls who initiated sex when they were younger than 15 years old, 21% reported as a reason for initiating sex that their partner made them feel they had to have sex. Similarly, younger age was associated with adolescents’ reports that partners making them feel they had to have sex was a reason for having sex. These findings suggest that sexual coercion should be another focus of interventions targeting younger adolescents. This study provides powerful evidence of the need for adjusting interventions to account for the developmental differences described. Future studies are needed to explore factors that account for different developmental trajectories and investigate developmentally based reasons for using or not using condoms and contraceptives.",

      "abstract": "Previous work shows a significant relationship between gender orientation and being religious in samples of college–age and adult men. Before entering later life, men with a feminine orientation have greater religious involvement than other men. In a sample of older men from three Massachusetts counties, this study assessed the bearing of men’sgender orientation and gender ideology on their religious involvement. Gender orientation more than masculinity ideology was found to be a reliable predictor of older men’sreligiousness. Similar to studies of younger men, a feminine orientation was a significant determinant of the older men’s religious participation, commitment, and intrinsic orientation. Older men who define self in very masculine terms, however, engaged in a quest religiosity. When the masculinity ideology contains norms that prescribe the virtues of a traditional masculinity and acquiring status, men’s religious orientation was extrinsic (or means) oriented. These important findings are discussed in terms of how masculinity is at times a barrier to men’s private devotion and at other times can be a trigger to questing.",

      "title": "Patterns of fluctuating asymmetry in sexual ornaments predict female choice",
      "abstract": "Abstract Extravagant secondary sexual characters are assumed to have arisen and be maintained by sexual selection. While traits like horns, antlers and spurs can be ascribed to intrasexual competition, other traits such as extravagant feather ornaments, displays and pheromones have to be ascribed to mate choice. A number of studies have tested whether females exert selection on the size of male ornaments, but only some of these have recorded female preferences for the most extravagantly ornamented males. Here I demonstrate that female choice can be directly predicted from the relationship between the degree of fluctuating asymmetry and the size of a secondary sexual character. Fluctuating asymmetry is an epigenetic measure of the ability of individuals to cope with stress, and it occurs when an individual is unable to undergo identical development of an otherwise bilaterally symmetric trait on both sides of its body. There is a negative relationship between the degree of fluctuating asymmetry and the absolute size of an ornament in those bird species with a female preference for the largest male sex trait, while there is a flat or U‐shaped relationship among species without a female preference. These results suggest that females prefer exaggerated secondary sexual characters if they reliably demonstrate the ability of males to cope with genetic and environmental stress. Some species may demonstrate a flat or U‐shaped relationship between the degree of fluctuating asymmetry and the absolute size of an ornament because (i) the genetic variance in viability signalled by the secondary sex trait has been depleted; (ii) the secondary sex trait is not particularly costly and therefore does not demonstrate condition dependence; or because (iii) the sex traits can be considered arbitrary traits rather than characters reflecting good genes.",

      "abstract": "Gender identity disorder of childhood refers to a rather rare disorders, but according to the literature girls with the disorder in the future may become homosexual or transsexual. The necessary diagnostic criterion for gender identity disorder of childhood is the presence of a constant desire to belong (or the conviction of belonging) to the opposite sex, coupled with a strong denial of the behavior, characteristics and/or clothing specific to the registered sex. Usually the disorder is manifested in the preschool years, but for diagnosing it is necessary that it manifests before the onset of puberty. Both sexes may have a rejection of anatomical structures inherent in his own sex; however, such unusual display is rare. Patient V. came to the appointment with psychiatrist with parents 3 years ago. During the interview reported that she starts to feel the boy at the age of 9 years. This announcement provoked outrage from parents. With the beginning of the critical days began to position herself in a male person. The patient met all diagnostic criteria for gender identity disorder of childhood. The patient underwent a course of systemic therapy combined with nootropics. Currently, patient name is the name of a female, the patient wears women's clothing, identifies herself as a woman. The patient continues to meet with a psychotherapist, is satisfied with the treatment, thoughts on sex change does not express. Thus, in the case of diagnosis of this disorder can become effective systemic therapy in combination with nootropics.

      "abstract": "Gender-based victimisation (GBV) is commonly experienced by transgender individuals, and can include physical or sexual violence; social, workplace, or housing discrimination; or family or social rejection. In addition to overt forms of GBV, transgender individuals experience gender identity-related microaggressions: subtle, frequently-occurring aversive events that convey nonaffirmation or rejection of an individual's gender identity. The degree to which a transgender individual is socially perceived as the gender with which they identify, sometimes referred to as passing, as well as sociodemographic factors such as annual income and race/ethnicity, have been previously linked with experiencing overt GBV. This study aimed to quantitatively assess whether self-rated degree of passing, age, annual income and being a person of colour were associated with the frequency with which transgender individuals experience less overt identity-related victimisation in the form of gender nonaffirmation microaggressions. Among an age-diverse sample of US adolescent and adult transgender persons (n = 224) who responded to 14 situational prompts of nonaffirmation microaggressions, adolescents experienced the highest average weekly frequency of nonaffirmation microaggressions (M = 2.16, SD = 1.48). Factors significantly associated with increased average weekly frequency of nonaffirmation microaggressions included lower degree of passing and lower income, while older age was associated with lower frequency of microaggressions.",

In this study we examined experiences of intimate relationships and sexuality in 20 young men, aged 22–31 years, who had sexually offended during adolescence. The participants were interviewed and the transcripts were thematically analysed. The main picture observed was that of young men with unfulfilled needs and a low capacity to meet those needs. Additionally, the men’s experiences of intimate relationships and sexuality seemed to be affected by their experience of having sexually offended. Some men longed for closeness with a partner but were afraid of getting too close. Others distanced themselves from relationships, claiming that they did not need others. These findings may demonstrate the men’s self-protective strategies for handling their identification as sexual offenders. These 20 men could also have been struggling with universal questions about closeness and sexuality while bearing other burdens, such as mistrust in others and feelings of shame, that interfered with this struggle.",

For example, for males the exercise of their sexuality can have options as women, men and transvestites. It is against the grain of the erotica of the 19th century that Freud invented the concept of drive, dissociating the sexuality of the instinct and any other thing programmed in a knowlegde that precedes the games drive and its possibilities.In the cases discussed, the single object are women who become inaccessible, and then the eroticism, transgression and games are played with another male.\r\nKey words\r\nHomosexuality, Exclusive objet, Sexual pleasure",

      "abstract": "Abstract For children as well as adults, object categories (e.g., dog, animal, car, vehicle) serve as a rich base for inductive inferences. Here, we examine children's inferences regarding categories of people. We showed 4‐year‐old children a picture of an individual (e.g., a white woman), taught them a novel property of the individual (e.g., is good at a new game called zaggit), and examined children's projections of that property to other individuals. Experiment 1 revealed that children used the broad category person as an inductive base: they extended the novel property to other people, regardless of their race or gender, but not to non‐human animals or artifacts. However, naming prompted children to use more specific social categories as an inductive base. When the target individual was identified as a member of a named, novel social category, children were more likely to extend the property to members of the same race‐based (Experiment 2) or gender‐based (Experiment 3) category as the target. Implications of naming in children's formation of social categories based on race or gender are discussed, and the consequences on the emergence of stereotypes are considered.

      "abstract": "Abstract Chapter 5 argued that there are rare cases—the paradigm wrongful life cases—in which procreating is wrong because the resultant child’s life is predictably not worth living. Are there other cases in which procreation is wrong because of children’s expected quality of life? The chapter’s first section develops a view of what all parents owe their children. Next it is argued that in same-individual choices (having a child with disadvantage versus having the same child without disadvantage), the importance of procreative freedom is outweighed by consideration of the child’s interests. It is contended in the next section that procreative freedom carries greater weight with different-number choices (having a child with disadvantage versus not having a child) than it does with same-individual and same-number choices (having a child with disadvantage or, by delaying conception or aborting and conceiving again, having a different child without disadvantage). Turning to same-number choices, we encounter the much-discussed “nonidentity problem.” Various strategies for resolving this problem are identified and appraised, and a solution suggested. The final section recapitulates major findings from the previous sections, draws connections among them, and elicits implications for the ethics of procreating in a variety of circumstances in which prospective parents may find themselves.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The sexual behavior of the Japanese monkeys of the Arashiyama B troop was studied in two mating seasons. Rank order of adult males (10 years old or over) had no positive correlation with mating activity. High-ranking males did not always attain high reproductive success. Some correlations were found between age, rank, and mating-partner selection. Some adult male-female dyads showed remarkable and long-term proximity. Some kind of psychological peculiarity is postulated within these dyads; although they were unrelated, most of them avoided mating, just as in related dyads. It is suggested that \"affinity\" may suppress the sexual drive, regardless of kin relationship. Zusammenfassung Bei erwachsenen männlichen Japanmakaken (Macaca fuscata; ab 10 Jahre) gibt es keine statistisch sichere Korrelation zwischen Rangstellung und Paarungshäufigkeit. Ob eine Kopula stattfindet, wird mehr vom Weibchen als vom Männchen bestimmt. Ob ein brünstiges Weibchen sich mit einem Männchen paart, hängt nicht nur von der Ranghöhe des Männchens ab, sondern auch von anderen Faktoren (z. B. sozialen Beziehungen). Als Paarungspartner bevorzugt ein ranghohes Männchen ein ranghohes Weibchen mittleren Alters. Blutsverwandte oder in enger Beziehung zueinander stehende Tiere vermeiden Kopulationen miteinander. Paarungspartner stehen in der Regel in keiner besonderen sozialen Beziehung zueinander. Psychologische \"Affinitäten\" scheinen die Sexualmotivation zu hemmen.",

      "abstract": "In Dionne Brand’s What We All Long For, race and queerness function together within a normative construction of time. The child/adult spectrum, which is also the innocence/experience spectrum, is portrayed as a racist and homophobic social convention that – along with the imagination of a particular future into which the child will mature – restricts the experiences and maturation potential of immigrant and racialized children in Canada. Brand’s text critiques this assumption that the future can be imagined, and alternative conceptions of time appear in several forms, from the characters’ own embodiments of time as they leave (or refuse to leave) childhood behind, to the recurrence of anachronistic figures (specifically the ghost and the baby-faced adult), to the ending with its compellingly negative representation of the future of the novel’s youth. Ultimately, the desiring child stands not for the affirmable future but for our inability to know what happens next – or what will come to constitute the human and the political realm in this “next.” This condition of unknowing precludes the possibility of determining – and placing limits upon – types of people.",

While this double constraint exists for all sportswomen involved in “masculine” sports, it is particularly strong for “professional” sportswomen who are more dependent than the others on the federations’ identity policies, aimed at maintaining the distinction between the sexes. Thus, they attempt to achieve corporal conformity, which is a more or less difficult task depending on their “inversed” gendered dispositions. This generic process does not imply homogeneity of the gender behaviour of these sportswomen. Indeed, their professional practices and ways of running their private lives vary according to their social and gender trajectories.",

      "abstract": "The genetics of behaviour in horses is just starting. The interest of including behavioural traits in selection has been only recently underlined. Moreover, it is a difficult question to tackle in horses as animals are dispersed in a variety of environmental conditions. There are some undirect indications based on comparisons of breeds or families. Behavioural similarities in animals issued from the same sire or belonging to the same breed are oberserved in foals and adult horses both in freely expressed behaviours (play, distance to the dam) as well as in reactions to experimental situations (emotional or learning tests). Stereotypic behaviours seem to appear more frequently in some breeds and / or families. The relative weight of environmental and genetic factors on the determinism of behavioural traits seems to differ according to the trait being considered. Moreover the observed differences between families or breeds can as well be related to epigenetic factors (maternal effect for example). It seems possible and promising to include behaviour in horse selection but it is necessary to have clear objectives in the trait seeked, the way it can be measured and to evaluate the impact of environmental factors.",

The purpose of this secondary data analysis was to qualitatively analyze adolescents' thoughts about and experiences with sexual pleasure. The study sample consisted of 56 sexually experienced, ethnically diverse, predominantly female adolescents who were participating in a Web-based intervention to promote healthy sexual decision making. Comments on one message board, \"Sexual Pleasure: Does It Matter to You?,\" provided an opportunity to examine adolescents' thoughts about and experiences with sexual pleasure, as well as their communication with partners about that topic. Adolescents' comments demonstrated that they experience difficulties with pleasure in their sexual relationships. Adolescents generally believed that men are more likely than women to feel pleasure due to differences that include biology, understanding of one's body, and control over partnered sexual behavior. Adolescents defined inequality of received pleasure differently and discussed contexts in which inequality may be acceptable. Adolescents expressed motivation to communicate with partners about sexual pleasure. However, their statements suggested they often lack the skills to do so. Future prevention and intervention programs should equip adolescents with skills to communicate with partners about sexual pleasure.",

      "title": "Paternal Behavior from a Neuroendocrine Perspective",
      "abstract": "How hormones and neuromodulators initiate and maintain paternal care is important for understanding the evolution of paternal care and the plasticity of the social brain. The focus here is on mammalian paternal behavior in rodents, non-human primates and humans. Only 5% of mammalian species express paternal care, and many of those species likely evolved the behavior convergently. This means that there is a high degree of variability in how hormones and neuromodulators shape paternal care across species. Important factors to consider include social experience (alloparental care, mating, pair bonding, raising a previous litter), types of care expressed (offspring protection, providing and sharing food, socio-cognitive development), and timing of hormonal changes (after mating, during gestation, after contact with offspring). The presence or absence of infanticide towards offspring prior to mating may also be a contributor, especially in rodents. Taking these important factors into account, we have found some general trends across species. (1) Testosterone and progesterone tend to be negatively correlated with paternal care but promote offspring defense in some species. The most evidence for a positive association between paternal care and testosterone have appeared in rodents. (2) Prolactin, oxytocin, corticosterone, and cortisol tend to be positively correlated. (3) Estradiol and vasopressin are likely nuclei specific—with some areas having a positive correlation with paternal care and others having a negative association. Some mechanisms appear to be coopted from females and others appear to have evolved independently. Overall, the neuroendocrine system seems especially important for mediating environmental influences on paternal behavior.",

Presenting complaints generally focus on guilt or difficulty with one's sexual partner.

Sex of the absent parent was found to be correlated with the type behavior manifested; absence of the father with acting-out and absence of the mother with acting-in behavior. This relationship existed regardless of whether parental absence precipitated the problematic behavior or merely aggravated and caused pre-existing problems to become worse. The propensity of children of absent fathers to act-out and of absent mothers to act-in was shown to be related to whether children were aware of their parents' incarceration. This association was true of those children who were told their parents were in prison but untrue of those offspring who were led to believe that their mother or father was absent for other more socially acceptable reasons.",

This study tested the hypothesis that the feature of the nude self-image most responsible for its correlation with gender dysphoria is the imagined vulva. The subjects were 220 nonhomosexual male outpatients who reported sexual arousal while imagining themselves with one or more features of the female anatomy. Autogynephilia and gender dysphoria were assessed with questionnaires. The findings confirmed that men who are sexually aroused at the thought of having a vulva are more likely to want to be women.",

Reflecting this, testosterone often declines in new fathers and lower testosterone is linked to greater caregiving. Given these roles, there is strong interest in factors that affect testosterone, including early-life experiences. In this multidecade study, Filipino sons whose fathers were present and involved with raising them when they were adolescents had lower testosterone when they later became fathers, compared to sons whose fathers were present but uninvolved or were not coresident. Sons’ own parenting behaviors did not explain these patterns. These results connect key social experiences during adolescence to adult testosterone, and point to possible intergenerational effects of parenting style.",

      "abstract": "A growing number of individuals expressly choose to remain childless, yet research exploring these intentions in men remains scarce. This study examines the experiences, subjective reasoning, and decision-making processes of voluntarily childless Australian men near the median age for first-time fatherhood. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 11 Australian-resident men (28–34 years; M = 31; SD = 1.48). Participants were selected from the Men and Parenting Pathways longitudinal cohort study ( N = 609) based on having stated they did not want to have children “at all.” Data were collected and analyzed using interpretative phenomenological analysis. Analysis identified a superordinate theme; Fatherhood: The door is still ajar, which was marked by the men’s reluctance to unequivocally commit to a childless future. Subordinate themes were The Realization, The Talk (or lack of…), The Rationale, and The Pressure. At the normative age for transitioning to parenthood, role choices are salient. Overall, men’s decision-making process to not have children appears to be fluid and influenced by intrinsic and extrinsic factors. Despite changing social trends and acceptance of divergent life trajectories, these men are acutely aware that their intentions place them outside the norm. In policy and practice, it is important to recognize the changing norms around fatherhood timing and support voluntarily childless men and couples in constructing their identities, life course, incongruent decisions, and relationships.",

Sex therapy is not a simple, mechanistic procedure, but a multifocused therapeutic intervention that attends to individual, couple, and sexual dimensions. If the couple learns attitudes and skills of intimacy, nondemand pleasuring, and multiple stimulation, these will hopefully inoculate them against sexual difficulties with age. Cognitions about being an intimate team, accepting variability in individual and couple sexual expression, and setting realistic expectations are crucial to prevent relapse.",

      "title": "Barriers to Moderate Physical Activity in Adult Lesbians",
      "abstract": "ABSTRACT ABSTRACT Adult lesbians are not sufficiently physically active to achieve physical and psychological health benefits. Lesbians are one of the least understood minority groups. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to use an ecological framework to identify factors internal to individuals and present in their social environments that may impede participation in regular physical activity. Twenty-one self-identified lesbians aged 22 to 61 years participated in one of four focus groups. The lesbian participants reported many general barriers (i.e., obstacles to participation regardless of sexual orientation) similar to previous research with other populations of women, not stratified by sexual orientation, such as being too tired and the lack of a physical activity partner. A number of lesbian-specific barriers (i.e., obstacles unique to being a lesbian) were also identified, such as the lack of lesbian-focused physical activity groups and the lack of same-sex family memberships to fitness facilities. In conclusion, for many of the general barriers, some of the proven and effective traditional intervention strategies are likely to be effective in increasing physical activity participation rates in the lesbian population. However, barriers related to sexual orientation are likely deeply entrenched in the socio-cultural system of American society and require a societal rethinking of attitudes towards lesbians, a cultural change that is not as easily amenable to traditional health promotion interventions.

      "abstract": "Research on self-perceived sexual attractiveness has predominantly focused on the importance of physical appearance, overlooking nonphysical traits that may contribute to these self-perceptions. The present study examined and compared the importance of a variety of traits for self-perceived sexual attractiveness. Self-identified heterosexual, gay, and bisexual men (N = 1,801) and heterosexual, lesbian, and bisexual women (N = 1,092) completed an online questionnaire examining self-perceived sexual attractiveness, body esteem, sexual esteem, adherence to gender norms, and sexual experience. Body esteem and sexual esteem were significant predictors of self-perceived sexual attractiveness, regardless of gender and sexual orientation. Adhering to a masculine gender norm was a significant predictor among all groups (to varying extents) but heterosexual women. Adhering to a feminine gender norm was a significant predictor among heterosexual men and bisexual women. Finally, sexual experience was a significant predictor for all men and bisexual women. Furthermore, while body esteem was a predictor across all groups, for most individuals it did not appear to be of primary importance, with either sexual esteem or masculinity proving to be of greater importance. These findings suggest the need to consider traits related to both physical and nonphysical factors for improving an individual's self-perceived sexual attractiveness.",

Structured interviews with one or the other of the spouses were conducted in a sample of welfare applicants\\recipients in the states of Florida, Georgia, West Virginia, and New Jersey. In a multivariate analysis of the data, two polity variables emerge as of overriding importance in predicting marital intactness: mode of decision making and strategy of conflict resolution. Marital decision making, or who actually makes the decisions, has the highest association with marital intactness for whites. For blacks, however, the most important indicator of family power is conflict resolution, or whose decision prevails when the spouses' interests conflict. A greater number of respondents report husband dominance in marriage and about equal numbers of blacks and whites report democratic decision making. There is no evidence of black matriarchyneither normative nor behavioral. There is a greater polarization of significant others for spouses than for white. Background variables {degree of homogamy in terms of fathers'1 occupation and spouses' educational attainment) are differen tially related to marital intactness for blacks and whites. Conclusions underscore the variety of conditions which can be associated with both intact and dissolved marriages for each racial group.",

There was no indication that the age differences in conflicts and misconducts were due to age differences in the ability to cope with the environment.

      "abstract": "Abstract 1. The social relationships in a group of Icelandic horses without a mature stallion were studied. The horses were all familiar to each other. Mutual grooming and play relationships, spatial associations, dominance-subordinate relations and the effect of kinship on these relationships were analysed. 2. The social structure was clearly dominated by the behaviour of the adult mares. The horses preferred to form bonds within their social class (sex/age) and they kept close proximity with their friends. The group was effectively divided into two social subgroups, adult mares as one group and adult geldings and sub-adults as another group. The sub-adults and adult geldings formed associations, which were based on mutual grooming and play, while the adult mares did not play. Differences between the sexes were evident. Males played more than the females, had more playing partners and were more popular as playmates. 3. Aggression rates were low. The dominance hierarchy was linear. Adult mares ranked higher than adult geldings, sub-adults and the foals. Rank was significantly correlated with age. The closer the adult mares were in rank, the more they groomed with each other. Such relationships were not found amongst the other social group. 4. Kinship was calculated between all pairs of animals for up to 4 or 5 generations. Allogrooming and play frequencies and proximity were all positively correlated with kinship. Adult mares, which were close in the dominance hierarchy, were on average more related than those further apart. 5. The social relationships in the Icelandic herd were, to some extent, different from relationships reported from unmanaged and feral horse-herds with mature stallions and bachelors. Our results suggest that adult mares groom more in groups without a stallion. Furthermore, they have more preferred partners than in natural harems and their partners are other adult mares, not their weaned offspring as seems to be the case in feral herds. The sub-adults also seem to be more socially active in the absence of stallions. Interestingly, in the Icelandic group, the adult mares showed stallion like behaviours, like mounting and protecting foals. Only by studying the behaviour and the nature of the relationships of horses in groups of different compositions, can we expect to gain a comprehensive understanding about individual social strategies and cognitive capabilities of the species. Such knowledge is valuable for management and welfare of the horse.",

      "abstract": "Abstract How does human behavior come to be gendered, and how do gendered behaviors change or remain stable over time? Although men and women, as well as girls and boys, are largely similar psychologically and behaviorally, there are some areas of gender difference. These include gender identity; sexual orientation; childhood play behaviors, such as toy, playmate, and activity preferences; personality characteristics, such as aggression and empathy; and some specific spatial, mathematical, and verbal abilities. The incidence of many psychiatric disorders also differs by sex. These gender differences appear to result from numerous factors and their interactions. These include genetic information on the sex chromosomes; concentrations of gonadal steroids, particularly testosterone, before and shortly after birth; socialization by parents, peers, teachers, and strangers; and cognitive developmental processes. Gender identity also is a mechanism for acquiring gendered behavior; based on this identity, children self‐socialize gendered behavior. These factors have been shown to act individually to influence gendered outcomes. They are also likely to interact with one another to shape gender development, but little research has investigated these interactions. An understanding of gendered development is important for addressing differences between the sexes in social roles and economic status, and should also be relevant to understanding and ameliorating psychiatric disorders that differ by gender. A complete understanding will probably require developmental systems approaches to understanding change and stability over time, but, thus far, such approaches have been uncommon.",

      "abstract": "Speech carries a wealth of information about the speaker aside from any verbal message ranging from emotional state (sad, happy, bored, etc.) to illness (e.g., cold). Central features are a speaker’s gender and their sexual orientation. In part this is an inevitable product of differences in speakers’ anatomical dimensions, for example on average males have lower pitched voices than females due to longer, thicker vocal cords that vibrate more slowly. Arguably much more information has been learned by a speaker as they construct their gender or identify with a particular sexual orientation. Differences in speech already begin in young children, before any marked gender-related anatomical differences develop, emphasizing the importance of behavioral patterns. Gender, gender identity, and sexual orientation are encoded in speech in a range of different phonetic parameters relating to both phonation (activity of the vocal folds) and articulation (dimensions and configuration of the supraglottal cavities), as well as the use of pitch patterns and differences in voice quality (the way in which the vocal folds vibrate). Differences in the size and configuration of the supraglottal cavities give rise to differences in the size of the acoustic vowel space as well as subtle differences in the production of individual sounds, such as the sibilant [s]. Furthermore, significant and systematic gender-specific differences have been found in the average duration of utterances and individual sounds, which in turn have been found to have a complex relationship to the perception of tempo.",

Despite the diversity of CNM relationship orientations and growing research examining CNM, it is unclear whether the sexual attitudes, inclination to approach/avoid sexual stimuli (i.e., erotophobia-erotophilia), and sociosexuality differ among individuals who identify with distinct CNM relationships. Further, as the agreements made in CNM relationships permit for extradyadic relationships, important differences might emerge for CNM and monogamous individuals. A convenience sample (N = 641) of individuals who self-identified as monogamous (n = 447), open (n = 80), polyamorous (n = 62), or swinger (n = 52) provided ratings of their sexual attitudes, erotophobia-erotophilia, and sociosexuality. Results indicated that swingers had the most permissive and instrumental attitudes, were the most erotophilic, and were the most unrestricted sexually. Conversely, monogamists scored the lowest on these traits. No differences emerged between relationship orientations for attitudes towards communion and birth control. These findings have important implications for sexuality research because they reinforce the view that some underlying differences and similarities exist between monogamous and CNM individuals.",

      "title": "An Ethological Perspective on Homosexuality during Adolescence",
      "abstract": "An ethological perspective is presented as an alternative to traditional developmental approaches to adolescence. From an evolutionary point of view, the onset of reproductive capability during adolescence marks the significance of this time during the life course. Thus, the apparent anomaly of male and female youth \"preferring\" not to engage in heterosexual activities that have the potential to maximize genetic fitness but to participate in homosexual activities that do not have the same adaptive repercussion poses a challenge for an ethological perspective to interpret. To better understand an ethological perspective, basic ethological principles are applied to the emergence and expression of homosexuality during adolescence. First, evidence bearing on the genetic etiological under-pinnings of homosexuality within humans is reviewed through an examination of (a) behavioral genetic studies and (b) hormonal research. Next, adaptive considerations are presented, in particular the prevalence of homosexual behavior among various animal species and human societies, as well as evolutionary pressures that maintain a stable level of homosexuality in the human population. Balanced polymorphism and kin selection are reviewed as answers to the ultimate or functional question. Finally, the \"naturalness\" of adolescent homosexuality as an outcome of an ethological perspective is proposed. Homosexuality is thus presented as a sexual orientation that is not so much a matter of choice but of biological necessity.",

      "abstract": "I ' N DISCUSSING the adjustment of the individual to his age and sex roles, I shall be using the term role to refer to an internally consistent series of conditioned responses by one member of a social situation which represents the stimulus pattern for a similarly internally consistent series of conditioned responses of the other(s) in that situation. Dealing with human behavior in terms of roles, therefore, requires that any item of behavior must always be placed in some specified self-other context. By way of further clarification it is necessary to call attention to the distinction between the use of the term role to refer to a modal system of responses which constitutes the culturally expected behavior and the particular system of responses with which a specific individual operates. Thus, when we speak of the individual's ability to perform in his sex role, we refer to the relation which his behavior, in situations in which sex classification is relevant, bears to some modal pattern expected in a given cultural or subcultural group. On the other hand, even though he may deviate widely and may properly be said not to be acting in the proper role, his own particular self-other pattern is his role also. If a middle class husband is indifferent and irresponsible and expects his wife to support and stabilize the family, he is not manifesting the particular complex of behavior we expect from the role of the husband, but he nevertheless has a particular role in his marriage. We may refer then to cultural roles and unique roles. The distinction is most obvious when we have a person equipped with both a cultural and a deviant pattern. The present discussion is directed to the consideration of the problem of adjustment to the cultural role or roles assigned to a given age and sex classification. Adjustment is usually indicated negatively as the degree of maladjustment. We may assume that the amount of tension, anxiety and frustration generated by the attempt to discover and play a given role is an index of the individual's adjustment to such a role. It is not the purpose of this paper to discuss particular problems which individuals encounter in adjusting to culturally defined roles required of them because of membership in given age, sex, class, caste and other social",

Sports attempt to tolerate gay male athletes when they contribute to the overarching ethos of sport—winning—but try to taint the creation of a gay identity within sport that would see homosexuality and athleticism as compatible. Still, by proving themselves successful in sport, and meeting most other mandates of hegemonic masculinity except for their sexual identity, gay male athletes show that hegemony is not seamless and that there is a possibility of softening hegemonic masculinity in the sporting realm.",

      "title": "Behavioral and neuroendocrine consequences of social subjugation across adolescence and adulthood",
      "abstract": "Abstract Background Social subjugation is a very significant and natural stressor in the animal kingdom. Adult animals defeated and subjugated during establishment of dominance hierarchies or territorial encounters can be highly submissive in future agonistic interactions. While much is know about the biological and behavioral consequences of winning and losing fights in adulthood, little is known about adolescence; a developmental period noted for impulsivity and heightened agonistic behavior. The present studies were undertaken to determine if the behavioral and neuroendocrine consequences of social subjugation are comparable in adolescent versus adult Syrian golden hamsters ( Mesocricetus auratus ). Male siblings were studied from adolescence into adulthood following exposure to counterbalanced episodes of either a benign stressor, i.e., isolation in a novel cage, or the more severe stressor of social subjugation. Results As adults, hamsters with a history of social subjugation in adolescence show high levels of aggression toward intruders as compared to siblings subjugated in adulthood. Sibling controls subjugated in adulthood are highly submissive with little or no aggressive behavior. However, when subjugated in adulthood, hamsters with the earlier history of subjugation are no different than their sibling controls, i.e., adult subjugation promotes submissive behavior. Sexual motivation is high in adult hamsters with adolescent subjugation and testosterone levels remained stable over adulthood. In contrast, sibling controls subjugated in adulthood show lower levels of sexual motivation and reduced levels of testosterone. Release of cortisol during agonistic encounters is blunted in animals subjugated in adolescence but not adulthood. Measures of anxiety are reduced in hamsters with adolescent subjugation as compared to their sibling controls. Conclusion These data demonstrate a pronounced difference in behavior and neuroendocrinology between adolescent and adult hamsters in their response to social subjugation and suggest adolescence is a resilient period in development.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Arthropods are sexually dimorphic. An arthropod individual usually differentiates into a male or a female. With very low frequencies, however, individuals with both male and female morphological characters have repeatedly been found in natural and laboratory populations of arthropods. Gynandromorphs (i.e., sexual mosaics) are genetically chimeric individuals consisting of male and female tissues. On the other hand, intersexes are genetically uniform (i.e., complete male, complete female or intermediate in every tissue) but all or some parts of their tissues have either a sexual phenotype opposite to their genetic sex or an intermediate sexual phenotype. Possible developmental processes (e.g., double fertilization of a binucleate egg, loss of a sex chromosome or upregulation/downregulation of sex-determining genes) and causal factors (e.g., mutations, genetic incompatibilities, temperatures or endosymbionts) for the generation of gynandromorphs and intersexes are reviewed and discussed.",

      "title": "Interpersonal Context as an Influence on Sexual Timetables of Youths: Gender and Ethnic Effects",
      "abstract": "Abstract We investigated whether the nature of the relationship with a partner (a serious vs. casual relationship) influences youths' sexual behaviors and attitudes. We asked 452 youths, ages 18–25, drawn from 4 ethnic groups (White, African American, Latino, and Asian American) about their own past sexual behavior (personal sexual timetables) and about acceptable ages for youths, in general, to engage in different sexual behaviors (normative sexual timetables). Students answered these questions twice: once when describing partners in a serious relationship and once when the partner was not well known. The results revealed that the interpersonal context had opposite effects on normative and personal timetables. Although sexual explorations were more acceptable with a serious partner, youth generally began sexual activities with a partner they did not know well. As predicted, the interpersonal context influenced the sexual timetables of White adolescents more than other groups, although only under certain conditions. Contrary to predictions, the effect on interpersonal context on sexual timetables was similar for both genders. Additionally, women had more restrictive timetables than men, and Asian American adolescents held more restricted timetables than other",

      "abstract": "Abstract In the domesticated Zebra Finch, unpaired males behaved sociably towards one another, but could be provoked to fight by the sight of a female nearby; the amount of fighting shown depended on the distance to the female. Qualitatively similar aggressive behaviour was provoked between males by the sight of a male, and between a male and female by the sight of another female. However, males were less effective than females in provoking fighting between females, and pair-bonded females were more effective than non-bonded females in provoking fighting in mixed or male dyads. Homosexual pair bonds had a similar effect to heterosexual ones in stimulating attacks on a male, but had not effect on aggressive behaviour towards a female. The aggressive behaviour seen could not be due to redirection of aggression, since the stimulus properties which were necessary to provoke attack on another individual were those relevant to sexual behaviour, and were different from those necessary to elicit attack on the individual itself. It is shown that in other cases of apparent redirection of aggression in sexual contexts, a similar conclusion can be drawn, indicating a link between the motivational systems controlling sexual and aggressive behaviour. Since stimuli from an individual may both sensitize a bird to respond aggressively to stimuli from other individuals, and elicit attack by the bird on the individual itself, a distinction between these modes of action (similar to TINBERGEN'S distinction between releasing and motivational effects) is necessary.",

      "abstract": "We examined for sex differences in possible risk factors for depression, manifestations of depression and associated help‐seeking and coping styles in a socially homogeneous cohort without any sex difference in lifetime rates of depression. The sexes did not differ on measures of depression, dysfunctional attitudes, perception of important interpersonal relationships, experience or perceived impact of life events. Women scored more highly on measures of neuroticism, were more dependent and were more likely to engage in self‐consoling behaviours and coping styles. Recklessness as a coping style was the only item endorsed more frequently by men, posing the question of whether current measures take into consideration the male experience of depression. The findings suggest that many putative depressiogenic risk factors over‐represented in women do not, by themselves, create depression but require a triggering factor or certain social conditions for their expression.",

      "abstract": "Progress toward gender equality has slowed or stalled in recent years, primarily because gender stereotypes and roles are changing more quickly for women than men. Women are increasingly free to behave more like men, whereas a similar freedom for men (to behave more like women) has been slower to emerge. Expectations governing men remain rigid: They are discouraged from showing weakness/vulnerability and encouraged to assert masculinity by demonstrating strength/toughness. These expectations undermine men’s emotional flexibility, which not only harms their physical health and well-being but also systematically impedes gender equality efforts. We summarize both the direct and indirect consequences of men’s relative emotional inflexibility, as well as cultural and psychological barriers to men’s emotional flexibility development. We then provide empirically based policy recommendations for cultivating emotional flexibility in men, which could in turn foster their physical and mental health, undermine traditional gender stereotypes, and promote broader gender equality in the United States.",

The following findings should be emphasized: 1. Schizoid persons can be distinguished well from other persons on the basis of their experience of family. 2. A clear delimitation of schizoid persons from neurotic persons is possible only when the factor of sex is considered. 3. Schizoid women differ from neurotic women in terms of their distinctive mother experience: The mothers of schizoid women are marked by a weak ego and are apprehensive and extremely permissive. 4. Schizoid men differ from neurotic men both in terms of a distinctive mother experience and a distinctive father experience. In their case, a negative mother imago is contrasted with an ambivalent father imago. Neurotic men, on the other hand, possess a mother imago nearly as positive as that of healthy men, although they do exhibit a distinctly more negative father imago. 5. Schizoid women differ from schizoid men in terms of a distinctively negative mother imago. Whereas the mothers of schizoid women are experienced above all as exhibiting a weak ego and traits of dependency, the mothers of schizoid men are perceived more as being strong and independent.",

      "title": "Do Men Underreport and Mask Their Emotional Attachment to Animal Companions? The Influence of Precarious Masculinity on Men’s Bonds with Their Dogs",
      "abstract": "Males' underreporting of psychological issues, physical symptoms, and personal information is commonplace both in medical and psychological settings in North America. One explanation for this occurrence is men that endorse traditional forms of masculine gender roles underreport or mask their symptoms to avoid being perceived as less masculine. In a similar way, the thesis of the current study was males may also mask and underreport the strength of attachment to their animal companions due to masculinity concerns. These males may also have more difficulty explaining why the bond is of importance. To address these notions, we developed the Human–Animal Interaction Conflicts scale (HAIC) consisting of two psychometrically sound subscales that measure conflicts male owners may have related to their pets. The first subscale involves limiting affection conflict (LAC), which measures underreporting or masking affectionate behavior around animal companions. The second entails conflict explaining the importance of the bond (EBC), which results in males not providing clear or accurate remarks when attempting to describe the bond's significance. The results from linear regressions analyses support the hypothesis that males endorsing traditional forms of masculine gender (as measured by the Precarious Masculinity Scale) underreport or mask their affectionate behaviors toward animal companions. Similarly, these same men also report more difficulty placing into words the bond they have with their dogs. The current study not only has implications for mental health and medical providers but may also help explain past research where males self-report lower levels of attachment to dogs.",

The results of this study can be summarized as the following. First, either the exposure or stress of a woman's specific body parts like breast, waist, hips, or legs which can be sensed totally different from man's or the ironic disclosure of body parts always lapped around emphasizes femininity by giving full play the unique sexual beauty of a woman's body. Second, the desire of disclosure to have others' attention with the concealment as suggestive exposure expresses the eroticism. The modified eroticism is found different from the conventional concept and is based on the desire to make others notice one's existence continually by the sexual exposure dress particularly to entire the other sex, the dismantlement of changing an underwear to an outer-dress, and so forth. Third, both exposure of a woman's sexual body parts and expression of exposure to the utmost by laying a woman's entire body bare can mean sex liberty in the laissez-faire generation. This may suggest a pleasure-oriented way of thinking of the self-consolation rather than showing others, or feature the personality and the liberty endowed women with.",

      "title": "Undergraduates’ awareness of White and male privilege in STEM",
      "abstract": "Abstract Background It is well-documented that experiences in STEM courses for women and students of color are different from the experiences of White men. As part of a larger interview study, 183 college seniors from diverse gender and race backgrounds were asked their thoughts on whether the experience of being a STEM major was different for people of different races and genders. We use a framework of “science as White property”, derived from critical race theory, to frame this study and results. Results White men were largely unaware of any impact of race or gender. In contrast, women of color overwhelmingly report, consistent with results from a large body of prior research, that both race and gender impact their experiences as STEM majors. Students who acknowledged race and gender impacts did not always attribute these impacts to cultural or systemic factors (i.e., some reported women are underrepresented because they are less interested in STEM rather than a structural reason). Impacts identified that were attributable to systemic factors included impacts related to being a demographic minority (i.e., intimidation, feeling out of place, feeling pressure to work harder) and/or discrimination (i.e., job discrimination, bias against women or people of color and cultural assumptions implying the superiority of White people and men). A small number of students (mostly White women) stated that women or people of color benefit from their underrepresented status, often attributing this benefit to a perception of extra encouragement and opportunities. A common theme across categorizations was that women and students of color work harder than men and White people either because they are perceived to be harder workers or as a response to the sexism and racism they encounter. Conclusions We found that White men are largely unaware of the impacts of race or gender on the pursuit of a STEM degree. Additionally, with the exception of women of color, students are less likely to perceive race as having an impact on the experiences of students than gender. We conclude with a discussion of implications for future work related to gender and race representation in STEM.",

      "title": "The Age of Justinian",
      "abstract": "Sex and gender are not the same. Sex is biologically determined: except in extremely unusual circumstances, humans are born male or female. Gender is historically determined and relies on social practices that change across time and geographical location: codes of behavior that are culturally specific teach women and men to act in ways “appropriate” to their sex. That is why it is sometimes said that a woman is “acting like a man” or that a man is “acting like a woman”: they are behaving in ways that are believed, at the time, to be more suitable to the opposite sex. Masculinity and femininity are not, however, universal qualities shared by all cultures but are understood in different ways by different groups, and this understanding changes over time. Procopius - a sixth-century historian closely associated with Justinian and his general Belisarius - provides a good example of how gender roles were understood in the Age of Justinian when, in his History of the Wars, he describes the “manly valor” of Amazon women on the battlefield. In Procopius’s mind, men rather than women were the appropriate warriors: women who fought well must, by definition, exhibit male traits and be described in masculine terms. This gender “transgression” troubled Procopius sufficiently that he took pains to explain it away, arguing that “there never was a race of women endowed with the qualities of men and … human nature did not depart from its established norm.”",

In order to investigate the consequences of this sex difference for the way men and women are perceived, male and female college students rated the characteristics of men and women depicted in verbal descriptions accompanied by photographs in which they either smiled or did not smile. In control conditions these targets were rated without accompanying photographs. The findings showed that the absence of smiles had a greater impact on perceptions of women than on perceptions of men. When not smiling, women were perceived as less happy, less carefree and less relaxed than were men. Moreover, nonsmiling women were rated less happy, less warm, less relaxed and less carefree than the average woman, whereas smiling men were rated more favorably on those traits than the average man. These results suggest that different standards are applied to men and women. If women fail to perform expressive and warm nonverbal behavior, they will be evaluated more harshly than men.",

      "abstract": "On the basis of family histories, a series of psychoneurotic patients in a university psychiatric clinic was compared to a group of their contemporaries not selected as to mental disease. Minor illnesses and family difficulties were disregarded throughout. The results indicated that 2 concepts (intrafamily conflict and mental disease in some member of the family group) are important concomitants of neurosis. The following conclusions were suggested by the data. Mental illness in parents, separation of parents or lack of adjustment between them, rejection by parent figures, parental overrestriction, mental illness in siblings or disturbed relationships between them, and disruption of the subject's marriage are indicated considerably more frequently in those students suffering from psychoneurosis than in the university population at large. Death, prolonged physical illness or foreign birth of parents, extra relatives living in the home, sibling favoritism, lack of siblings, and factors relating to size of sibship or relative ages of siblings are found no more often in the neurotics than in the others. The margin of difference between the two sets of items is great enough to suggest that the same conclusions may be true for psychoneurotic people in general.",

Adolescents who identify as non-cisgender/heterosexual seem to have higher future aspirations, however, they have a more unstable emotional state, higher risky behaviors, and fear being prejudiced by health care professionals.

Interference behavior can take several forms, including highly aggressive acts (sexual interruption) as well as milder forms of interference (sexual harassment) that result in a reduced likelihood of mating to ejaculation. Most reported cases of mating interference behavior in primates occur in species where males actively mate guard, or attempt to ensure female fidelity through direct forms of sexual coercion. However, sexual harassment has also been found in female and immature primates for different behavior strategies.",

In many cases such a feature will have contributed to radiation into a new niche. It will also distinguish a newly evolved species from its ancestral species, providing a basis for reproductive isolation. Consequently recently evolved generally adaptive features are likely to be sexually stimulating or attended to in mate selection. Therefore, there is a good possibility that there are some biologically based mating preferences and sexual responses in humans that are expressed in most cultures.",

      "abstract": "* Abbreviations: GAS — : gender affirming surgery GAT — : gender affirmative treatment TGD — : transgender and gender diverse The intersection between gender identity and sexuality is complicated. In gender affirmative treatment (GAT), care is approached by listening to the youth, with the input of their parents and caregivers, to best understand how to affirm and validate their gender identity and expression in the context of their health and development.1 It may include any of the following: social interventions (eg, by using asserted name and pronouns), pubertal suppression, hormone treatment, or gender affirming surgery (GAS), with psychosocial support provided throughout.2 Although empirical support of GAT is growing, the literature often minimizes the fundamental, dynamic connection between intimate relationships and one’s sense of self. For example, intimate activities may be adapted to overcome or avoid gender dysphoria associated with certain sexual parts. Traditional labels (gay, straight, bisexual, etc) may be seen as inadequate and too restrictive given evolving identities. One’s gender label may influence power dynamics and roles in the relationship. Developmentally, young people are navigating these challenges with gender identity and sexuality simultaneously in a process that is not well understood or supported by medical providers. In this month’s issue of Pediatrics, Bungener et al2 examined sexual behaviors among transgender and gender diverse (TGD) youth during and after GAT. They reviewed previous research suggesting that at the time of referral, before any intervention, TGD youth had fallen in love, … Address correspondence to Jason Rafferty, MD, MPH, EdM, Department of Pediatrics, Thundermist Health Center, 450 Clinton St, Woonsocket, RI 02895.

      "abstract": "We examined reasons lesbian and bisexual adolescent girls have sex or, if sexually inexperienced, might have sex with girls or boys, and the role of internalized homonegativity in these relations and among lesbians. Girls were recruited online and classified as lesbian (n = 129) or bisexual (n = 193); the classification was validated. Love and pleasure were common reasons for having sex with girls, although more lesbian girls (LG) than bisexual girls (BG) endorsed love. BG, relative to LG, had sex with girls because they were curious or wanted to verify their sexual identity. Love and pleasure were motives for having sex with boys for BG. They were common reasons for potentially having sex with either sex among sexually inexperienced girls, but both were more likely for BG than LG for sex with boys. Internalized homonegativity did not mediate the relation between sexual identity and reasons for sex, but LG just with male partners were more homonegative than LG just with female partners. The findings indicate that LG and BG should not be combined into a single group, provide insights into the discordance between sexual identity and behaviors, and have implications for reducing risk for pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections among sexual minority girls.",

      "title": "Lost opportunities: How gendered arrangements harm men",
      "abstract": "Traditional gendered arrangements—norms, roles, prejudices, and hierarchies—shape every human life. Associated harms are primarily framed as women’s issues due to more severe consequences women face. Yet, gendered arrangements also shape men ’s relationships, career paths, and health. Current work on gender equity overlooks men’s perspectives. Despite benefits they gain from out-ranking women, men’s position paradoxically entraps them in restrictive roles, compelling them to prioritize dominance. An inclusive framework challenges prevailing narratives by considering personal costs borne by men. Identifying with a man’s traditional role is a mixed privilege, as five gendered arrangements show for men who subscribe to them: 1. Masculine norms can restrict men’s choices and are associated with adverse health trajectories; 2. Some men’s disengagement from communal roles denies them positive outcomes associated with caring for others; 3. Hostile sexism fosters antipathy, fueling tension in some men’s interactions with women; 4. Benevolent sexism forces some men into scripted interactions, preventing genuine connections and burdening them with unrealistic breadwinner and protector roles; 5. Societal shifts in gender hierarchies can elicit threat responses in men, depending on intersections with social class and racial identities. Understanding costs to men calls for more empirical research. Gender equity for men, whose circumstances differ from those of women, would enable men to make informed choices and achieve better outcomes for themselves—paralleling the progress women have made in many areas of life. Striving for equity for all genders can ultimately enhance overall human well-being.",

Ss were 120 ten-year-old boys and girls from Jewish populations differing in their fidelity to the cultural patterns of Eastern-European Jews. The less traditional group attained more differentiated scores on four measures—even when verbal ability was controlled. On two additional measures the differences did not reach statistical significance. Among both groups girls drew more sophisticated pictures on the Figure Drawing Test than did boys. Additionally, more traditional girls obtained more differentiated scores on Object Assembly—a direction of sex difference opposite to that usually obtained in Western cultures. On Block Design and Embedded Figures the higher scores attained by girls did not reach statistical significance. Sex differences on Rod and Frame were in the usual direction; i.e., boys obtained more differentiated scores than did girls.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT The literature on child sexual abuse stresses the importance of assessing the congruence between the child's language and developmental level. However, only anecdotal examples have been cited in the literature to describe children's language of sexuality. In the present study, 90 investigative interviews were randomly selected and content analyzed to identify children's terminology of private body parts and sexual abuse activities. The analyses indicated that 37 different words and phrases were used to describe private body parts. More than one third of the children used the term \"private\" to represent a vagina, breasts, a penis, and/or an anus. \"Touching\" was the most frequently used term in describing sexual abuse. Female children were more expressive than male children in describing sexual parts and/or sexual abuse. Younger children used a wider range of words than older children to clarify sexual body parts and sexual activities. In general, children's choice of words can imply various meanings and the interviewer cannot assume the meaning of certain slang terms without clarifying them. Interviewers can use \"what\" and \"how\" questions to clarify the meaning directly from the children.",

Play arises through the interaction of factors within the individual with those resident in the environment. All possible places to play can be described as either indoor or outdoors. Rural children and those in low child density areas may have some distance to travel to play with friends. Outdoor play patterns can be severely constrained both by the more difficult travelling and also by the lack of flat play spaces. The low usage of grassed areas for play was felt to be a reflection of management policy rather than of low popularity with the children. It is very difficult to assess the play \"value\" of play equipment. Unfortunately, children's use of the equipment did not reflect the range of play forms associated with individual items as predicted.",

Third, these norms, beliefs, and practices are continually influenced by the process of acculturation as these men try to adjust to life in the United States.

Some infants—among them good feeders—may refuse food when a meal is delayed, or give other signs of a disturbance in the relation to the mother. The author observes that young infants—even as early as in the second month—would in wakeful periods after feeding lie on the mother's lap, look up at her, listen to her voice and respond to it by their facial expression; it was like a loving conversation between mother and baby. Such behaviour implies that gratification is as much related to the object which gives the food as to the food itself. A very slow taking of food often implies lack of enjoyment of libidinal gratification; this, if coupled with an early and marked interest in the mother and in other people, suggests that object-relations are partly used as an escape from persecutory anxiety attaching to food.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Although early research and the popular press have characterized college men as universal beneficiaries of uncommitted sex, emerging research notes considerable variability in men's sociosexuality (i.e., uncommitted sexual beliefs, desires, and behaviors). This study examined how diversity in sociosexuality is tied to the ways in which attachment orientations, conformity to masculinity norms, and homosocial engagement (i.e., nonromantic same-sex bonds) are organized across individuals. Latent profile analysis of 495 college males (ages 17 to 25, 62% White, 83.5% heterosexual) detected five subgroups: Fully Unrestricted (10% of sample; high on sociosexuality and conformity to masculinity norms); Cognitively Unrestricted (36%; comparable to Fully Unrestricteds but low on sociosexual behavior), Fully Restricted (30%; opposite on all constructs when compared to Fully Unrestricteds); Avoidant (16%; similar to Fully Restricteds but with greater attachment avoidance); and Discrepant (8%; above average on sociosexual behavior but discordant within and across constructs). There were notable demographic, personality, and behavioral differences among the subgroups (e.g., nearly 50% of the Discrepants self-identified as sexual minorities; Fully Restricteds were the most religious; Avoidants were the most shy). Findings indicate that college men's sociosexuality is highly nuanced and suggest the need for additional work to understand how attachment, masculinity norms, and homosociality shape men's sexual relationships.

      "abstract": "Gendered differences in participation in active lifestyles (encompassing sport, physical activity, and physical education) are well established, with young men typically participating in more activities than young women. This paper uses a theoretical approach inspired by Bourdieu’s notions of habitus, field and capital to explore the ‘how’ and ‘why’ of these differences. Drawing on mixed-methods data obtained from questionnaires ( n = 332) and semi-structured interviews with 33 young men and 37 young women aged 15–16, we present two gendered trends which explain gendered differences in active lifestyle participation. Firstly, in this research, young men participated in more activities than young women, viewing their participation as integral to their identity, their sense of self. Young women, in contrast, viewed sport as an ‘optional’ extra, something they could do, if they wished. Secondly, in relation to the differences in the type of activities participated in, young men were more likely to participate in traditional team sports, whereas young women chose to engage in gym/fitness activities to promote appearance and feminine attractiveness. We argue that the gendered norms which dictate ‘appropriate’ gendered active identities are damaging to both young men and women who may wish to deviate from these norms. Social capital is allocated to gendered bodies in accordance with these norms, influencing how young people are viewed in their social hierarchies. A gender-neutral narrative which destabilises gendered sporting norms whilst simultaneously celebrating diversity is needed to promote a safe and inclusive environment where all young men and women can engage in sufficient physical activity.",

If the female is sexually mature and she has been sufficiently stimulated by the male's courtship, she opens her vaginal plates in response to one of the male's copulation attempts and coitus ensues. Very young males and females are alike in that they elicit courtship, but they do not perform the courtship behaviors themselves. However, when they are 1-2 days old, the males' behaviors change; they begin to court attractive flies and, at the same time, become relatively unattractive to other males I. Thus, when they are mature, females are attractive and males are not, whereas males perform courtship and females do not. By using single-gene mutations and other genetic techniques to perturb the flies' ability to court or elicit courtship, it has been possible to determine why, on a number of levels, these behaviors are sex-specific. Sex appeal Experiments with mutant males that cannot see or smell normally have revealed that females provide visual, olfactory and contact stimuli to the courting male x. Evidence for visual stimuli is provided by observations of blind no-rec@tor-potentialA and glass males, which cannot perform orientation and, con- sequently, spend less time courting than normal males. Mutant optomotor-blind males, which are unable to respond to horizontally moving stimuli, behave ~e males that are totally blind; this implies that movement of the female is a visual stimulus to the courting male s. Hydrocarbons extracted from females stimulate normal males to court each",

      "title": "Third Gender Politics: Hijra Identity Construction in India and Beyond",
      "abstract": "Indian law has only recently stopped criminalizing what was perceived as deviant homosexual behavior and started extending full citizenship rights to its queer populace. The government’s attempts to regulate sexual behavior was often steeped in antiquated Orientalist colonial practices that rendered non-binary subjects voiceless. Indian youth who identify as hijras, a third gender who are usually born male but present as female, often experience alienation and stigmatization both at home and in diaspora. This leads to what I call ideological diaspora – internal diaspora founded in cultural and physical exile even at home. Systematic marginalization makes hijras subaltern subjects, which affects the lives of diasporic youth trying to create dialogic identities. While hijras are usually either absent or objects of ridicule in Western media portrayals, looking at rather than through the third-gender subject is one way to allow the assertion of identity. This may take place through sensitive portrayals of hijras in film and novels, or through publications and autobiographic texts that allow for complex narratives and voice. Third-gender youth growing up in ideological and/or literal diaspora need these representations to feel a sense of community and move from being seen as Other to “another.”",

      "abstract": "Rape is a sexual act committed against a person without consent or without explicit consent. This is a very serious form of sexual violence and violates human rights. Rape can occur in a variety of contexts, including during an intimate relationship, by someone you know, or even by a stranger. This can cause deep physical and emotional trauma to victims, as well as having far-reaching impacts on society as a whole. It is important to take steps to prevent rape and provide support to victims. Rape carried out on women or men usually causes very severe trauma to them. Usually, the person becomes uncomfortable, insecure, and afraid of meeting people. He will feel alone forever, and think about ending himself, because he thinks that he is no longer pure. Usually, rape is committed by someone or several individuals, known or unknown, who deliberately rape the victim. Rape may occur because the perpetrator likes the victim, or because the perpetrator wants revenge on the victim, or there is something else. Women are creatures of God Almighty who are very perfect, because they give birth and breastfeed. In Indonesia, there are still many cases of rape that occur against women and children. The motive may be because the perpetrator likes the victim, or the perpetrator just wants revenge on the victim, or it was planned long ago by the perpetrator. Rape against women or girls is a form of sexual violence that occurs when someone commits a sexual act against a woman without her consent. This may include vaginal, anal, or oral penetration, as well as other sexual acts carried out with violence, threats, coercion, or the woman's inability to provide valid consent. Rape against women is often a form of expression of systematic gender inequality and domination. It is important to remember that rape does not only happen to women, but can also happen to men or individuals of various other gender identities. Nevertheless, rape of women is often in the spotlight due to its high prevalence and serious impact on the well-being of women and society as a whole. Therefore, it is important to continue fighting sexual violence and fighting for gender equality to create a safe and inclusive society for all individuals.",

Effects of sexual music videos on viewers' gender schemasResearch suggests that music videos with sexual content have an effect on viewers' attitudes towards gender roles, including gender roles in the context of a sexual relationship [11,7,5].These findings are explained by two theories of cognition, namely, the Social Learning Theory and the Priming Theory.The Social Learning Theory claims that individuals learn from modeled behaviors [12].In this view, the repetition of stereotyped depictions of men and women in the media help shape children's gender schemas, leading children to perceive masculinity and femininity in more traditional and rigid ways [13].Priming may also play a role in how viewers perceive the sexual content of a music video.According to Priming Theory, different stimuli activate different schemas, or blueprints of a construct, which can influence cognition or behavior [14].If audiences consider music videos to be a heavily sexualized media overall, or a particular artist to have a hypersexual persona, they may view individual videos with sex-related schemas already Identifying sexual content in music videosResearch has shown that music video imagery has often been",

      "abstract": "The article reviews data, much of rather recent origin, bearing on the assumption that human personality is more plastic in infancy and childhood than in adulthood. The available data permit the following conclusions: l. We have no compelling evidence of a predictable relationship between child training practices and later personality. 2. Severe psychological stresses can have as marked effects in adulthood as in infancy and childhood, sometimes having greater effects in adulthood than in childhood. 3. Important personality changes occur after childhood (in the absence of treatment) including the disappearance of marked psychological disorders. 4. Infants reared according to ostensibly ideal methods of infant care show no greater immunity to mental illness than do other children reared differently. Infants reared under apparently inadequate or harmful circumstances do not necessarily develop psychological disorders. 5. Resemblances between patterns of behavior in children and adults can be explained without the hypothesis of a special impressionability or vulnerability of personality in childhood. 6. The initial immobility and the prolonged physical dependency of children upon adults places them at a special disadvantage in that they cannot readily change their environments to obtain new experiences. A lack of new experiences may give to the personality a pattern which appears more fixed than it really is. The assumption that the human personality is more plastic in infancy and childhood than in adulthood remains unproven. Neither is it disproven. We need much further research in this area and this research may eventually show that the human personality is more plastic during childhood in some respects, but not in others.",

      "abstract": "The present study investigated female sexuality by examining a range of experiential, historical, attitudinal, and behavioral variables, and conceptualizing sexual orientation along several dimensions on a heterosexual/homosexual continuum. The focus was on determining what, if any, important etiological factors emerged, as well as differences in behavior, attitudes, and preferences among women with various sexual orientations. It was concluded that a nonconventionality factor could be interacting with certain experiential and situational variables to produce a bisexual or homosexual lifestyle. Consequently, the ideosyncratic variable nature of such a paradigm could partially explain inconsistencies in past research. Results of this study were comparable to previous ones indicating that the women were similar (across sexual orientations) in their emphasis on emotional aspects of a relationship, history of heterosexual dating and coitus, few (relative to males) sex partners, and a less (than males) actively assertive sexual pattern of behavior. Future research might include males in the investigation of the role of a nonconventionality factor in sexual orientation. Also, relationship between cognitive/perceptual styles and sexual orientation could be explored.",

      "abstract": "Background. For people with intellectual disabilities there is a difficult balance to be struck between empowering people to claim their sexual rights and protecting them from abuse. Hypothetically, services should be guided by whether a particular person with intellectual disabilities has the capacity to consent to sexual relationships. However, there has been little agreement on how to define such capacity. This study examines the issue of capacity to consent to sexual relationships using a functional approach. Method. Adults with intellectual disabilities ( n =60) and young people presumed in law able to consent ( n =60) were assessed for their sexual knowledge and vulnerability to abuse. Results. Adults with intellectual disabilities were significantly less knowledgeable about almost all aspects of sex and appeared significantly more vulnerable to abuse, having difficulty at times distinguishing abusive from consenting relationships. Nevertheless, some adults with intellectual disabilities scored highly on all measures, especially if they had relatively high IQs and had had sex education. Conclusions. The reasons for the poorer knowledge and increased vulnerability of people with intellectual disabilities are discussed and it is recommended that they should have on-going access to sex education. Implications of the findings for definitions of capacity to consent to sexual relationships are considered.",

The aspiration to show existence of gender differences in manifestation and interrelation of aggression of boys and girls and their parents acted as the purpose of this work. By means of Vilkokson's W-criterion for the independent selections the significant distinctions by the sexual sign both at teenagers, and at parents were proved.

Erectile disorder, as withother sexual dysfunctions, may be caused by, or associated with a number of diseases that impact the cardiovascular and nervous systems. However, men who have few physical problems may also experience the disorder due to psychological factors. Men who suffer from ED due to psychogenic factors are believed to differ from functional men in five key cognitive and behavioral domains. Barlow and Sbrocco (1996) used these differences to formulate a model of male sexual dysfunction that explicitly addresses the cognitive mechanisms involved in ED. The model proposes that a key point in the development of ED is whether or not a man feels challenged or threatened when experiencing a discrepancy between expected and actual performance. Men who are challenged by the experience typically have the skills necessary to identify and alleviate the discrepancy in performance. They are believed to use positive outcome expectancy and confidence to overcome suboptimal sexual performance and maintain function. In contrast, men who are threatened by discrepancies between expected and actual performance may expect a negative outcome and have little faith in their ability to sexually perform.",

      "abstract": "The Swiss penal code of 1942 requires the presence of a psychiatrist in all decisions about termination of pregnancy and of sterilization. The so called sexual revolution of the last 20 years has brought about a dissociation of the traditional psychosexual behavior, where eroticism, affection, and desire of a child do not integrate as harmoniously as before. Narcissistic libido, inherent in all of us, can make an individual want a baby for reasons other than normal, but as a reflection of a parent, as a toy for an infantile mother, as a termination to free, sexual life, felt as sin, for a young couple, as a hope for the future, as the rival of one of the parents, as a remedy for something lost. These are just some of the reasons why contraception, completely accepted on a conscious level, can be rejected on an unconscious one, leading to unwanted pregnancies. Family planning, through a better and deeper psychological preparation of its personnel, should better identify patients more at risk of contraceptive failure, and the unconscious resistances of individuals and couples. This very important task can be started in schools with sex education, and in family planning centers with sexual therapy for the couple. This new approach would imply an increased interest for psychology on the part of doctors assisting young couples.",

      "title": "The Co-Occurrence of Autism and Gender Diversity",
      "abstract": "Gender diversity refers to gender expressions and/or gender identity experiences that vary from the common experiences of gender. Gender-diverse people may be gender nonconforming, gender nonbinary, gender fluid, gender exploring, transgender, and so forth. Some gender-diverse individuals experience gender dysphoria and/or gender incongruence and may require gender-affirming supports, including gender-affirming medical interventions. The co-occurrence of autism and gender diversity has been highlighted in a series of studies internationally as well as through rich community expressions. Studies in gender-referred individuals reveal high rates of autism traits as well as high rates of existing autism diagnoses. Studies in autistic populations reveal greater gender diversity characteristics. The long-term course of gender diversity in autistic individuals is poorly understood. Clinical guidelines have been developed for adolescents with the co-occurrence, but much work remains: No gender-related measures have been developed and tested for use in neurodiverse populations, no programs exist to support gender-diverse neurodiverse adults, and little is known about co-occurring mental health profiles, risks, or protective factors for people with the co-occurrence. The inclusion of this chapter on co-occurring autism and gender diversity within a book on “co-occurring psychiatric conditions” is problematic, because gender diversity is not a “psychiatric condition,” but instead a form of human diversity. The diagnosis of Gender Dysphoria is useful only insomuch as it allows individuals to obtain necessary gender-related supports. The authors’ choice to include this chapter in this book reflects a compromise, motivated by the need for educating both autism and gender specialists in this common co-occurrence.",

      "abstract": "Abstract This study compared the family characteristics, victimization histories, and number of perpetration offenses of juvenile offenders who admitted to having had sex with animals to juvenile offenders who did not. The study found that 96% of the juveniles who had engaged in sex with nonhuman animals also admitted to sex offenses against humans and reported more offenses against humans than other sex offenders their same age and race. Those juveniles who had engaged in sex with animals were similar to other sex offenders in that they also came from families with less affirming and more incendiary communication, lower attachment, less adaptability, and less positive environments. Those juveniles who had engaged in sex with animals reported victimization histories with more emotional abuse and neglect and a higher number of victimization events than other offenders. This would seem to indicate that sex with animals may be an important indicator of potential or co-occurring sex offenses against humans and may be a sign of severe family dysfunction and abuse that should be addressed in the arenas of psychological intervention, juvenile justice programs, and public policy.",

A child who comes into the world wanted is already loved. Later on, he himself will give love because his 1st contact in the world was a happy one. Most children will go through thumb sucking and masturbation, which is normal and innocent behavior. Toilet training is another important factor in sex education. According to our attitude the child will learn that this part of his body is good or bad. By the age of 3 or 6, children learn to discover the difference in sex from our attitude to each other, and when parents practice double standards, the child is confused and worried. Children's curiousity for knowledge is insatiable. If parents find they are embarressed by their children's questions about sex, it is better to put off answering than to convey the impression that something is not quite nice. 11-year old females should be prepared for menarche with knowledge, and fathers should explain to their sons about voice changes, night emissions and fantasy dreams. Masturbation is normal during adolescence, and the only harm comes from wrong anxiety about it. If 2 young people wish to have premarital intercourse, we must have the courage to tell them that chastity remains a value whether they accept it or not. Education for family life means taking account of the child's attitudes and sex values as a future marriage partner and parent.",

      "abstract": "The major emphasis of recent literature on adolescent sexuality and pregnancy has been on the important social consequences of early sexual activity; little attention has been given to the risk factors that serve as antecedents to an unplanned adolescent pregnancy. Although the risk factors for early initiation of sexual activity vary in different populations of adolescents they include the transition to puberty peer and sibling influences poverty family structure and function poor school achievement other problem behaviors and inadequate contraceptive use. Adolescents living in poverty are more likely than their middle-class counterparts to begin sexual activity at an early age and to become pregnant in adolescence. Other aspects of family structure that place adolescents at risk are single-parent families large numbers of siblings lack of parental supervision and a pregnant adolescent sister. The adolescents negative experience with school also has been associated with teen pregnancy. In many cases there is a clustering of risk-taking behaviors such as smoking alcohol and drug abuse unprotected sexual intercourse and driving while intoxicated. Social influences including the sexual behavior of best friends appear to be key in determining age at onset of sexual activity among teenage girls while level of physical development and free testosterone levels exert a greater impact on adolescent males. Another risk factor is the 9-12 month median delay between the onset of teen sexual activity and the 1st attempt to seek family planning care from a medical provider. To assess these risk factors physicians who care for adolescents should elicit information about family social background friends school and career plans drug use and physical development. Preventive efforts will be successful only when they address the complexity of the issue of adolescent sexuality.",

Sexism as a form of bias is the primary focus of the study, but racism and ableism as other forms of bias are also examined. Sex equity is not achieved in any of the categories of fiction, non-fiction or myths/legends entries. Females, both adult and child, are numerically under-represented whether they are primary, secondary or background characters in the entries. Females as the subjects of poems are also numerically under-represented. Neither is balance achieved in illustrations in the readers. There are fewer illustrations of females than there are of male, shared or genderless illustrations. Non-white characters are also under-represented and the {llustrations depict these characters in the countries of their origin, not in a contemporary Canadian context. Disabled people were entirely absent from one series, while the three disabled people in the other two series were females. None of the disabled characters was male. Both female and male characters conform to sex-role stereotypes of behaviour and personality. Male characters are aggressive, indevendent, dominant and active while female characters are quiet, neat, interested in their appearance, aware of the feelings of others, gentle and tactful.",

      "title": "Who is hurting whom: Self-harm in adolescence",
      "abstract": "In adolescence, the system of values, the ways to find pleasure, the experience of being loved, being a male or a female, are put to the test due to the presence of sexually mature body. In many cases, what goes relatively smoothly in normal development can be stressful for some adolescents. Despite that, adolescents find ways to respond and to use their experiences constructively, in an effort and with a desire to enter the social and sexual world of adults. Still, there are adolescents whose experiences are completely different and whose adolescence is riddled with problems. They live haunted by their own fantasies and no matter how much they try to keep the cause of suffering or hatred outside themselves, they inevitably face the experience of their bodies being the source of abnormality and of not being able to do much else but giving in to illness. Crucial change that should take place in adolescence for an individual to reach psychic maturity is the weakening of relations with primary objects, which enables the creation of new object relations. In self-harming adolescents, however, there is inability to give up the bond with the mother - any internal attempt to break this bond brings the feeling of unbearable loss. Basically, the adolescent's relationship with their mother is highly ambivalent, and the feelings fluctuate from intense hatred to intense love. Careful monitoring brings up the conclusion that these are narcissistic personalities with primitive and punishing superego. In this article, we have used the psychoanalytic theoretical concepts as a basis for understanding the psychopathology and psychodynamics of adolescents whose act of intentional and conscious attacking of one's own body is one of the main reasons for seeking psychiatric help, which will be illustrated by presenting individual and milieu therapy of an adolescent girl treated at the Day Hospital for Adolescents of the Institute of Mental Health.",

(It is therefore ironic that some people would now make AFR available to unmarried couples, and/or make marriage available to more sorts of pairs and even more remarkable that, under existing domestic partnership law, Mrs White might have got at least as much had she never married Mr White).",

      "abstract": "Abstract Children essentialize gender from a young age, viewing it as inborn, biologically based, unchanging, and predictive of preferences and behaviors. Children's gender essentialism appears to be so pervasive that it is found within conservative and liberal communities, and among transgender and cisgender children. However, it remains unclear what aspect of gender the children participating in past studies essentialized. Such studies used labels such as “girl” or “boy” without clarifying how children (or researchers) interpreted them. Are they indicators of the target's biological categorization at birth (sex), the target's sense of their own gender (gender identity), or some third possible interpretation? This distinction becomes particularly relevant when transgender children are concerned, as their sex assigned at birth and gender identity are not aligned. In the present two studies, we discovered that 6‐ to 11‐year‐old transgender children, their cisgender siblings, and unrelated cisgender children, all essentialized both sex and gender identity. Moreover, transgender and cisgender children did not differ in their essentialism of sex (i.e., whether body parts would remain stable over time). Importantly, however, transgender children were less likely than unrelated cisgender children to essentialize when hearing an ambiguous gender/sex label (“girl” or “boy”). Finally, the two studies showed mixed findings on whether the participant groups differed in reasoning about the stability of a gender‐nonconforming target's gender identity. These findings illustrate that a child's identity can relate to their conceptual development, as well as the importance of diversifying samples to enhance our understanding of social cognitive development.",

The present study was designed to examine interpretations in a sexual disagreement situation within young dating couples. Forty-five heterosexual couples classified into one of three distinct stages of involvement were asked to complete several questionnaires requesting background and sexual information, and respond to six brief scenarios describing dating situations. It was hypothesized that the respondent's sex, couple's dating stage, woman's type of \"No\" response, and the level of intimacy were related to the following: a man's reaction to his date's refusal of unwanted sexual advances, and any future consequences to the couple's dating relationship. Results from MANOVAs and ANOVAs indicated that while many men, in general, would comply with a date's refusal, a substantial percentage of men would use some type of coercion to continue advances after a woman refused. Each man's compliance was found to be influenced by the particular dating stage and intimacy level in which he and his partner were involved. These findings indicate the dating situation is highly complex and susceptible to misinterpretation.",

      "abstract": "Many situations in human life present choices between (a) narrowly preferred particular alternatives and (b) narrowly less preferred (or aversive) particular alternatives that nevertheless form part of highly preferred abstract behavioral patterns. Such alternatives characterize problems of self-control. For example, at any given moment, a person may accept alcoholic drinks yet also prefer being sober to being drunk over the next few days. Other situations present choices between (a) alternatives beneficial to an individual and (b) alternatives that are less beneficial (or harmful) to the individual that would nevertheless be beneficial if chosen by many individuals. Such alternatives characterize problems of social cooperation; choices of the latter alternative are generally considered to be altruistic. Altruism, like self-control, is a valuable temporally-extended pattern of behavior. Like self-control, altruism may be learned and maintained over an individual's lifetime. It needs no special inherited mechanism. Individual acts of altruism, each of which may be of no benefit (or of possible harm) to the actor, may nevertheless be beneficial when repeated over time. However, because each selfish decision is individually preferred to each altruistic decision, people can benefit from altruistic behavior only when they are committed to an altruistic pattern of acts and refuse to make decisions on a case-by-case basis.",

Many of these young people will cope well with the heterocentric attitudes and prejudices prevalent in secondary schools and the wider community and make the transition into adulthood having learned how to mask their sexual preferences or develop effective coping mechanisms to deal with homophobia. Some will succumb to the pressures they experience and seek less ideal solutions that include drug use and promiscuity. Some will take their own lives.

Thus for young children we have administered toy and activity preference tests, and when children choose the toys or activities that their own sex typically prefers, we say they are becoming sex-typed. For somewhat older children, in whom personality characteristics have become fairly well stabilized, we have looked for clusters of personality traits that are thought to distinguish the sexes. Thus a boy has been called sex-typed-that is, masculine-if he becomes assertive, energetic, competitive, and independent; a girl is sex-typed in so far as she becomes kind, empathic, responsible, and sensitive. There was a period of interest in androgyny-that is, in the idea that individuals could have the characteristics of both sexes, and were better off psychologically if they did. This work provided a counterweight to the more traditional assumption that becoming sex-typed was a normal, expected, and indeed, healthy aspect of development.",

These exchanges can occur outside of a long-term partnership, which itself could be considered a commitment to the accessibility of reproductive currencies provided by each partner. The current study investigated whether young adults who are not in acute need of resources intentionally attempt reproductive currency exchanges outside of dating relationships or formal committed relationships such as marriage; and whether young adults have awareness of being the target of such attempts made by others. College students ( N = 475) completed a brief survey assessing their own attempts to exchange reproductively relevant currencies, as well as others' attempts to make these exchanges with them. Men were more likely to report making attempts to trade investment for sex and women were more likely to report attempted trades of sex for investment. Participants' experiences of exchange attempts initiated by other individuals mirrored these patterns. Men were more likely to report another individual trying to trade sex for their investment, and women were more likely to report another individual trying to trade investment for sex with them. The vast majority of these attempted exchanges took place outside of existing relationships, although a small portion did lead to short or long-term relationships.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT: Data are presented regarding the determinants of sexual behavior in men and women aged 46 to 71 years. Stepwise multiple regression analyses were made, involving a variety of physical, psychologic and social measures as independent variables. The level of sexual functioning in younger years, the age and sex of the subject, as well as subjective and objective health ratings, each were found to make independent contributions to the total variance in sexual behavior. A much larger number of variables influenced sexual behavior in men than in women. In women relatively fewer variables — past sexual enjoyment, marital status, and age — were the most significant determinants. These data confirm previous observations that for women the presence of a sexually capable, socially sanctioned partner is a crucial determining influence. Some of the implications of these findings are discussed.",

      "title": "Manufacturing consent or playing the game : an analysis of gender power relations in two sport related organisations",
      "abstract": "The goal of this study is to examine the dynamics under-pinning the reproduction or transformation of gender power relations within two sport organisations. Across society we have images of women making ground and experiencing far greater prospects than ever before. Yet, on the other hand, this is bound up with continuous examples of little progress in work. For instance, while there are more opportunities for women across work than at any other point in the 20th Century, they continue to be segregated from men in a large number of jobs. Similar gendered patterns of progress are reflected in sport. There are now far more female participants in sport, however they remain concentrated in 'appropriate' sports which reflect historical images of femininity. Broadly, sport and work also dictate stereotypical images for male participants. While broad levels of change are occurring across society, central to this thesis is whether dominant patterns of gender relations are transformed or reproduced at the micro level of sport- related work. Critically sport organisations are selected because sport's history continues to demonstrate patterns of male dominance. Secondly, the growth of sport provision has occurred in a service area, an arena traditionally dominated by women workers. Finally, sport is one of the few sectors which traverses both the public and private industries, providing the basis for a comparative study. Therefore, employment within sport provides an opportunity to examine the ways in which gender power relations are challenged or reproduced when two diverse sets of relations meet. The theoretical framework draws heavily from feminist theory, particularly radical, socialist feminist and post-structuralism. A qualitative research strategy provides the framework for a comparative case study methodology. Seventy-five interviews were conducted across the two case study organisations, which are located in the North. Past Times is a contracted out leisure centre and Sporting Goods a privately owned sports clothing and equipment firm. Both companies are in the service industry but come from two diverse backgrounds. Sporting Goods developed from a manufacturing heritage and Past Times is breaking away from direct local authority control as a result of CCT. At the time of the research both establishments were experiencing high levels of organisational change. While Past Times breaks with tradition in having a female manager and Sporting Goods contrasts with a traditional management structure, hegemonic masculinity dominated across both organisations. Overall gender power relations were reproduced through day-to-day practices that appeal to, and perpetuate, common sense understandings of men and women's roles at work. The sport environment provided a critical site for the strengthening of homosocial relationships among men and enabled the identification of three interacting components of gender: bodies, identities and sexualities. These components together contribute to the ongoing construction of a logic of difference which is more highly defined in the sport environment.",

Studies 1 and 2 showed that men's (but not women's) gender self-esteem (but not personal self-esteem) was positively related to sexual prejudice: The more positive heterosexual men's gender self-esteem, the more negative their attitude toward homosexuality. Studies 3 and 4 showed that this link appears specifically among men motivated to maintain psychological distance from gay men. Study 5 experimentally manipulated the perceived biological differences between homosexual and heterosexual men. The previously observed link between men's gender self-esteem and sexual prejudice appeared in the control and no-differences conditions but disappeared in the differences condition. These findings are discussed in terms of men's attitudes as a defensive function against threat to masculinity.",

      "abstract": "Gender role identity tends to shape an individual’s self-concept, playing a significant role in shaping their behaviour and interpersonal relationship patterns across different societies, races, and ethnicities. This study explores the relationship between perceived parenting styles (authoritarian, authoritative, and permissive for both parents) and gender role identity in young adults, and also the pattern of gender role identity of parents and their offspring. The sample consisted of 100 young adults (M=20.60, SD=1.98) and both of their parents (father and mother). Both the young adults and their parents responded to the Bem Sex-Role Inventory, whereas only young adults responded to the Parental Authority Questionnaire. Descriptive statistics showed that out of 100 young adults, 38% identified as androgynous, followed by feminine (29%), masculine (12%), and undifferentiated (21%). 54% of male young adults rated themselves as androgynous, whereas 46% of females identified as feminine. A considerable proportion of the parents reported themselves as androgynous (both 48%). A significant correlation was found between permissive parenting style in mothers and undifferentiated gender role identity in young adults (r= 0.75, p= 8.1e-05). A positive, moderately significant correlation was also found between fathers' permissive parenting style and masculinity in young adults (r= 0.83, p= 0.00093). This information will help us understand parents' role in gender identity formation and may also help us formulate management plans in terms of the parent-child relationship and their gender role identity.",

      "abstract": "1. The functional sexual phases of four species of Pacific coast gastropods with protandric consecutive sexuality have been investigated with regard to the conditions which control the change of sexual phase and particularly with respect to the influence of association or mating on the individual's sexuality. 2. In none of these species nor in six species previously studied is association a prerequisite for the development of the functional male phase, although isolation of these males after a prolonged mating period usually terminates the male phase promptly. 3. In nine of the ten species studied intimate association or permanent mating of the young male with one or more individuals in the female phase tends to accentuate the masculine characteristics and to postpone sexual transformation by prolonging the male phase. In five of these ten species the influence of association is very conspicuous; in four it is apparent but not conspicuous; in only one is the evidence inconclusive. 4. There seems to be no evidence that the accentuation and prolongation of the male phase by association is due to any masculinizing chemical secretion or hormone which passes through the water from the body of the female to that of the male, as some investigators have assumed; it seems more probable that stimuli received by the male through the sense organs in his penis and tentacles during association with the female are of such a nature as to influence his masculine characteristics, presumably by the mediation of hormones secreted within his own body. 5. Sexual maturity and sexual metamorphosis in these mollusks, like other types of metamorphosis in animals, are subject to environmental influences and can be accelerated, postponed or inhibited experimentally, but the sequence of sexual phases cannot be reversed.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The lack of data and protocols in identifying, diagnosing and treating sexual disorders in general and erectile dysfunction in particular tend to favor the maintenance of myths and ignorance, with serious impact on the quality of life of all individuals and couples affected. The objective of this study was to identify the main characteristics and correlates of erectile dysfunction which are key elements in improving the diagnosis procedure, comorbidities prevention and the implementation of efficient treatment protocols, the aims of our main research project. Preliminary data of an erectile dysfunction screening in a Romanian population are discussed. Keywords: sexual disorders, erectile dysfunction, screening INTRODUCTION Sexual activity is very important for most individuals, regardless of age, sex or sexual orientation. However, throughout our lifespan, different changes at the physical or psychological level may influence, among others, our sex life. Moreover, most women and men occasionally experience sexual difficulties. If these sexual difficulties prevent the individual or couple from enjoying sexual activity during any phase of the sexual response cycle (desire, arousal, orgasm and resolution) and if they cause distress and interpersonal problems, sexual disorders are very likely to be present. Since people tend to avoid talking about their sexual problems, many people develop various myths about what is and what is not normal when it comes to sex life. Society, media or religion tend to shape unrealistic or dysfunctional images of sexual behavior. The lack of acknowledgement of certain disorders and over diagnosing others are, to a certain extent, common phenomena. Sexual disorders can also be often mistaken for various symptoms of several other mental disorders (such as affective and anxiety disorders) as they appear together quite frequently. The lack of data and protocols in identifying, diagnosing and treating these disorders tends to favor the maintenance of myths and ignorance, with serious impact on the quality of life. Erectile dysfunction (ED), also known as (male) impotence, is one of the most frequent sexual disorders; ED is defined as the inability to achieve or maintain an erection of the penis sufficient to permit a satisfactory sexual intercourse (Coman, 2004). Although ED is referred to as a benign pathology, it has a significant negative effect on the patients, their couple lives and their socioprofessional performances. The incidence and prevalence of ED have grown remarkably lately, not only because of the population aging effect and of the increasingly higher action of risk factors on the general population, but also because of the beginning of use, at the end of the last millennium, of oral medication against this pathology, medication that had the role to raise awareness of the masculine population regarding this pathology. The socio-cultural prejudice and the perception that ED is part of the aging process have led to a poor addressing of elderly men to doctors [contrary to the general perception, Helgason (1996) indicates that 13% of the patients aged 50 to 80 consider sexual activity to be very important, 29% see it as important, 41% consider occasional sexual acts to be pleasant and only 17% consider sex not to be important]. Most patients turn to medical assistance only in severe cases of the pathology, when the diagnosis and the treatment are more complex and costly. On a global level, the prevalence of ED is over 500 million men; estimative data (Ayac et al., 1999) predict a doubling of the prevalence of ED in 2025, this problem becoming thereby a serious public health issue. Among the Eastern European countries, Romania has the highest prevalence of ED, 25% in the general population, which means that one out of four men experience such difficulties. According to the CLOSER study (Porav-Hodade, et al., 2007) ED is even more frequent in older men; more than half of men over 50 years of age have different levels of ED. …",

      "title": "Toward Prevention of Childhood Sexual Abuse: Preschoolers’ Knowledge of Genital Body Parts",
      "abstract": "This study examined preschool children’s knowledge of their genital and non-genital body parts. Results indicated that almost all preschool children knew the correct terms for their non-genital body parts, but few knew the correct terminology for their genitals. The importance of this skill in preventing childhood sexual abuse is discussed. Childhood sexual abuse (CSA) is a serious public health problem. Although definitions vary state by state and in various research programs, CSA is generally defined as sexual contact between a child (under the age of 18) with a person who is at least 5 years older. According to the American Psychological Association (2001), a central characteristic of any abuse is the dominant position of the adult that allows him or her to force or coerce the child into sexual activity. Child sexual abuse may include fondling a child's genitals, masturbation, oral-genital contact, digital penetration, and vaginal and anal intercourse. However, it is not solely restricted to physical contact; such abuse could include non-contact abuse, such as exposure, voyeurism, and child pornography. With close to 100,000 confirmed cases of CSA in the United States during 2005 (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2007), efforts to prevent CSA are needed. One public health approach to the prevention of CSA offers child-focused personal safety education programs, usually implemented in schools and preschools. The primary focus of most school-based personal safety programs is to strengthen a child’s ability to recognize and resist assault (primary prevention), although they often have a secondary prevention focus as well. The secondary prevention objective is to encourage victims to disclose abuse and to improve adults’ responses to these disclosures so that children can receive early intervention and protection to reduce the negative consequences of sexual exploitation (Wurtele, 1998). Successful disclosure of abusive incidents relies partly on the child’s ability to describe inappropriate activities involving the genitals and to correctly label the genitals. When children disclose CSA using incorrect or idiosyncratic terminology (e.g., “She touched my monkey,” or “He kissed my muffin”), they may not be understood and are thus unlikely to receive a positive, supportive response to their disclosure. In contrast, disclosure using correct terminology is more likely to be understood, resulting in a more positive outcome for a child—e.g., by ending the abusive situation and obtaining therapeutic assistance for the child (Kenny, Thakkar-Kolen, Ryan, Runyon, & Capri, 2008). Furthermore, children who lack sexual knowledge may be more vulnerable to sexual abuse. Some sexual offenders avoid children who know the correct names for their genitals because this suggests these children have been educated about body safety and sexuality (Elliot, Browne, & Kilcoyne, 1995). One convicted offender (who had assaulted 75 children by the time he was stopped) reported that when children knew the correct terms for their different body parts, he would leave them alone (Sprengelmeyer & Vaughan, 2000). Along with facilitating disclosure, teaching proper names for all body parts helps children develop a healthy, positive body image (Wurtele, 1993; Wurtele, Melzer, & Kast, 1992). As Honig (2000) states, it gives children “naming power” (p. 17) just as they have the power to",

      "abstract": "Previous research has shown people assume gender inversion regarding descriptive stereotypes of gay men and lesbian women. Specifically, people believe the preferences of gay men and lesbian women are similar to straight women and men, respectively. However, there is an unexplored tension between the preferences and competencies of gay men and lesbian women in gender counter-normative domains. Across six studies (three main: N = 1,369; three supplementary: N = 1171), we show a divergence between what gay men and lesbian women are expected to do and how well they are expected to do them. Gender inversion did not adequately explain in what domains people anticipated competence from gay men and lesbian women. Instead, gay men and lesbian women were seen, through society’s and participants’ eyes, as relatively low status and incompetent compared to straight men and women across occupations (Studies 1–3), particularly by straight people (Studies 2–3).",

      "abstract": "Across three experiments (total N = 1,149), we examine whether bisexual men (more so than women) are viewed as similar to their same-gender gay counterparts and whether bisexual women (more so than men) are viewed as similar to their same-gender heterosexual counterparts. We find support for the notion that bisexual men are stereotyped as more similar to their gay counterparts than bisexual women are. These perceptions of bisexual targets’ stereotypical similarity to their gay counterparts were linked to identity-denying perceptions that bisexual individuals are “actually gay,” a belief held more strongly about bisexual men (vs. women). Bisexual men and women were viewed as possessing stereotypically heterosexual characteristics to similar extents, although bisexual women (vs. men) were indeed more strongly characterized by the identity-denying belief that they are “actually heterosexual.” Collectively, these findings suggest that bisexual men and women encounter different challenges to their identities that may require different interventions.",

ISD is multicausal and multidimensional and manifests differently for males and females. Precipitating factors include traumatic sexual experiences, negative self-image, sexual guilt or shame, deviant or variant sexual behavior, relationship difficulties, and a chronic sexual dysfunction. Regardless of whether the male or female experiences ISD, the effect on the couple is that the cycle of positive anticipation, pleasure-oriented intercourse, and a regular rhythm of sexual contact is replaced by anticipatory anxiety, unsuccessful intercourse, self-consciousness, and avoidance. This article outlines a therapeutic plan for establishing resilient sexual desire by emphasizing intimacy, pleasure, satisfaction, and realistic sexual expectations.",

      "abstract": "Research on the causes of homosexuality frequently treat it as a matter of disturbed gender identity and/or gender role. Recently, attempts have been made to link cross-gender behavior among boys with adult homosexuality. Often this research presumes a common biological determinant to both the childhood behavior patterns and homosexuality in adulthood. Authors have described such childhood cross-gender behavior in boys as part of a \"prehomosexual\" configuration. This paper argues that the research to date suffers from (1) a failure to differentiate such concepts as gender identity, gender role and sexual orientation, (2) a reliance upon potentially inappropriate dichotomies in describing such concepts, (3) problematic interpretations of research that makes few distinctions between human sexual behavior and sexual behavior among rodents, and (4) the contradictions implicit in seeking simple biological determinants of constructs (such as cross-gender behavior) that are culturally determined. The author argues that any potential biological factors contributing to sexual orientation must be mediated by a complex sequence of experiences and psychosocial factors. Therefore, the essentialists' search for a simple congruence between physiological or biological traits and homosexuality may be expected to fail.",

Depending on the survey, researchers can use self-reports of lesbian, gay, or bisexual (LGB) identity, same-sex partner cohabitation, same-sex sexual attraction, or same-sex sexual behavior. All measures come with their own limitations. To illuminate differences in these measures, this study examines the intersections between self-reported sexual identity, attraction, and behavior among a nationally representative sample of U.S. men and women aged 15-45. I explore how and when the three measures align, examine the determinants of self-identifying as gay or bisexual based on sexual behavior and attraction, and assess gender differences in the patterns. I find that about 20% of women and 10% of men aged 15-45 would comprise the LGB community if it were defined to include those who report at least one of the following: gay or bisexual identity, any same-sex attraction, or same-sex sex in the last year. This is much higher than the 6.4% of women and 3.6% of men aged 15-45 who self-identify as LGB. I conclude with recommendations that can aid in measurement of the LGB population, and discuss implications for using certain measures over others when conducting research on the LGB community.",

      "abstract": "Previous studies have often revealed differences between the acknowledgment of same-sex attraction and rates of bisexual or homosexual identification. This study contends that social influences (including the perception that same-sex sexual attraction is not gender normative) as well as prejudice toward bisexual persons (biphobia), may help explain this discrepancy. In this study, the authors tested whether, in line with a social identity approach, manipulating social factors regarding the gender normativity of bisexuality influenced participants’ self-perceptions of their sexualities and expression of biphobia. Male and female participants (N = 416) were randomly assigned to read one of two narratives comprising fictitious neurological research evidence, which claimed that their own gender was more naturally bisexual than the other gender (Condition 1), whereas a control group (Condition 2) did not receive any information regarding the gender normativity of bisexuality. Results indicated that men endorsed significantly more same-sex attraction when bisexuality was presented as being more normative for their gender. Gender-normative information produced no significant difference in terms of men's sexual behavior and identity, or women's sexual attraction, behavior, and identity. Results also indicated no significant differences between conditions in biphobia toward bisexual persons of either gender. Irrespective of condition, male and female participants endorsed significantly more biphobia toward bisexual men than bisexual women.",

      "title": "Determinants of Juvenile Deviant Behavior",
      "abstract": "Abstract. Deviant behavior of minors manifests in various forms and with different degrees of intensity, influenced by external social environments and the individual characteristics of the minor's personality, which shape their reactions to various life challenges. Behavior that deviates from generally accepted expectations can be either constructive or destructive, and deviant behavior, accordingly, can be positive or negative. The evaluation of such behavior is based on the social consequences of the deviation. The article establishes that within the framework of criminological research, the focus is on negative deviant behavior of minors, which may result in criminal responsibility (in accordance with the Criminal Code of Ukraine) or may not lead to such responsibility (e.g., withdrawal from social contact, self-isolation, or avoidance of societal norms and interaction with others; behavior contrary to common communication norms, such as rudeness; alcohol consumption by minors, which may not yet lead to offenses but is socially unacceptable; behavior that violates aesthetic or moral standards but is not illegal, such as extreme forms of tattooing or piercing; protest behavior, for instance, ignoring traditions or deliberately breaking etiquette; or actions by minors that have the objective signs of criminal offenses, but the perpetrators have not yet reached the age of criminal liability). The article states that there is no single theory of deviant behavior, including among minors. However, all researchers agree on the following point: eliminating certain factors can significantly reduce the likelihood of deviant behavior, but only a systematic approach to addressing all determinants of deviance provides grounds to talk about a high probability of significantly reducing or partially eradicating such actions. Deviant behavior is a complex form of social behavior influenced by a range of interconnected factors. Thus, in each case of deviant behavior, it is insufficient to investigate only biological, psychological, or social factors. A comprehensive approach that considers all these factors together is necessary, as such behavior results from the unsuccessful socialization of youth: due to disruptions in the processes of identification and individualization, such individuals are prone to \"social disorganization,\" where cultural norms, values, and social ties are either absent, weakened, or in conflict with each other. It is important to create conditions for preventing negative deviant behavior, particularly through the promotion of a healthy lifestyle, fostering a favorable socio-psychological climate in the child's environment, and providing opportunities for personal self-realization in society.

Because of this precariousness, they argue that men feel especially threatened by challenges to their masculinity.

Studies 1-3 document a robust belief in (a) the precarious nature of manhood relative to womanhood and (b) the idea that manhood is defined more by social proof than by biological markers. Study 4 demonstrates that when the precarious nature of manhood is made salient through feedback indicating gender-atypical performance, men experience heightened feelings of threat, whereas similar negative gender feedback has no effect on women. Study 5 suggests that threatening manhood (but not womanhood) activates physically aggressive thoughts.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Sexual well-being plays an important role in the quality of life. Against this background, we provide an economics-based approach to the relationship between the Big Five personality traits and various dimensions of sexuality. From a theoretical viewpoint, personality influences sexual well-being not only by how a person feels about sex, but also by how the person behaves in a sexual relationship. Personality shapes information sharing about sexual preferences, the way dissonant sexual preferences of the partners are handled, and the extent to which a person is committed to promises made to a partner. Using a large representative dataset from Germany, we find that personality traits play a role in a person’s own sexual satisfaction, in (the self-assessment of) fulfilling their partner’s sexual needs and desires, in sexual communication, in actual and desired frequency of sex, and in extradyadic affairs. Conscientiousness contributes to a mutually beneficial sex life and increases a person’s commitment to their partner. The opposite holds true for neuroticism. While extraversion and openness to experience help realize a mutually beneficial sex life, we find no evidence that they have a commitment value. On the contrary, extraversion is associated with lower commitment to the partner. Agreeableness contributes to higher commitment. However, agreeableness appears to make people more reluctant to express their sexual needs and desires.",

      "title": "Early life maternal sociality predicts juvenile sociality in blue monkeys",
      "abstract": "Abstract Maternal effects are widespread in living organisms though little is known about whether they shape individual affiliative social behavior in primates. Further, it remains a question whether maternal effects on affiliative behavior differ by offspring sex, as they do in other physiological systems, especially in species with high levels of adult sexual dimorphism and divergence in social niches. We explored how direct and indirect experiences of maternal affiliative behavior during infancy predicted affiliative behavior approximately 1–6 years later during the juvenile period, using behavioral data from 41 wild blue monkey juveniles and their 29 mothers, and controlling for individual age, sex, and maternal rank. Female juveniles spent less time grooming with any partner and with peers the more maternal grooming they received during infancy, whereas males groomed more with any partner and with peers. Similarly, the more that mothers groomed with other adult females during subjects’ infancy, female subjects played less with peers, and male subjects played more as juveniles. Further, this maternal effect on social behavior appears specific to early life, as the same aspects of mothers’ sociality measured throughout subjects’ development did not predict juvenile behavior. Overall, our results suggest that both direct and indirect experience of mother's affiliative behavior during infancy influence an individual's affiliation later in life that sexes respond differently to the maternal affiliation, and that the first year of life is a critical window.",

      "abstract": "The uncontrollable retractability of the testes during cold, fear, anger, sexual arousal, and defecation is the basis for castration anxiety and fear of object loss including body parts. The scrotum is associated with the anal area, which is considered \"dirty,\" leading to the concept that sex is \"dirty.\" Because of the fear that a testicle can fall off, boys tend to achieve bowel training later and with more difficulty than girls. Hor monal changes in prepuberty and puberty, which cause increased size and sensitivity, also increase the masturbatory urge. Feeling guilty about masturbation, a boy may think that he has damaged his sac and testes when he perceives that the left testicle hangs lower than the right, a normal state. In cases of cryptorchidism, both sterility and homosexual problems play an im portant role: physically, if bilateral, sterility and feminizing of the male ensue; psychologically, he develops a depression about his procreative inability and fears homosexual attack. Such attacks are more likely to happen to the cryptor chid boy. The pediatrician is urged to regularly examine the boy in various positions, particu larly before age six. We must caution the pediatrician that his tendency to make a cursory examination may be caused by fears of being accused of making homosexual overtures.",

      "title": "ASSESSMENT OF SUBJECTIVE SEXUAL EXPERIENCES OF OLDER ADULTS",
      "abstract": "Abstract There is extensive research focusing on sexual dysfunction, decreased frequency, and sexual effects of aging, however few studies explore older adults’ subjective sexual experiences. Consequently, ageist myths prevail that older adults are neither sexually active nor desirous and the quality of their sexual activity must be extremely poor due to dysfunction and older bodies. The aim of this study was to determine how older adults assess their sexual experiences, what aspects are important, and their sexual outlook through survey research with a sample of individuals age 60+ (N=556). The results found older adults are overwhelmingly positive about their sexual experiences along with a realistic recognition of aging effects. Almost all, 85%, are sexually active, partnered and/or solo sex. Satisfaction is high indicated by 45% extremely/very satisfied with both quality and frequency and by a majority rating recent sexual experiences above average on a 1 to 10 scale and a third ranking it as “great sex” (8+). Their positivity is further evidenced as 80% describe their recent sexual experiences as fun and 67% answered exciting, despite 60% also recognizing it is predictable and more challenging, and 72% admitting it’s not their best sex ever. Sexual desire remains high as the majority look forward to their next sexual experience and 70% anticipate an unlimited number of orgasms in their future. Consistent trends were found across all 4 age groups. This study’s findings are significant for reframing the myths and demonstrating that older adults are sexually interested and having overwhelmingly positive sexual experiences.",

      "abstract": "Abstract.— Sexual selection (defined as the change in genotypic or phenotypic frequencies of mated versus total population frequencies) and sexual isolation (defined as the deviation from random mating in mated individuals) show different evolutionary consequences and partially confounded causes. Traditionally, the cross-product estimator has been used to quantify sexual selection, whereas a variety of indexes, such as Yule V, Yule Q, YA, joint I, and others have been used to quantify sexual isolation. Because the two types of estimators use different scales, the effects of both processes cannot be monitored simultaneously. We describe three new related statistics that quantify both sexual selection (PSS) and sexual isolation (PSI) effects for every mating pair combination in polymorphic traits, as well as measure their combined effects (PTI = PSI X PSS). The new statistics have the advantage of providing information on every mating pair combination, quantifying the effects of sexual selection and isolation in the same units, and detecting asymmetry in sexual isolation. The ability of the new statistics to ascertain the biological causes of sexual selection and sexual isolation are investigated under different models involving distinct marginal frequencies, mate propensity, and mate choice coefficients. We also studied the use of classical isolation indexes applied on PSI coefficients, instead of on raw data. The use of the classical indexes applied to PSI coefficients considerably reduces the statistical bias of the estimates, revealing the good estimation properties of the new statistics.",

      "abstract": "In Japan as elsewhere, sport is strongly coded as a masculine field. Nonetheless, women have long played sports at elite and popular levels despite considerable, continuing disadvantages in material resources, media attention and ideological support. I propose four reasons for the surprising profile of Japanese sporting women over the past century. Japan has long placed importance on its success in the Olympic Games; as the Games were opened up to female events, national ambition motivated Japan to improve opportunities for elite female athletes and celebrate their success. A second factor is extensive corporate sponsorship of a range of individual and team sports at elite levels for both male and female employees, which opened up opportunities to women for intensive training and national and even international participation. Moreover, sporting accomplishment more generally in Japan has foregrounded trained effort and focused on commitment rather than 'natural' ability or brute strength. And mainstream notions of Japanese personhood are sociocentric, not individuated. Sociality is as much a norm of masculine conduct as of feminine conduct, and gender dichotomies are more relational than absolute. Together, these factors offer a compelling rationale for female sporting performance in Japan's modern century and some optimism for further gains in the future.",

This cross-sectional study (1) measured young adults' extent of knowledge and attitudes toward later-life sexuality, general sexual attitudes, and sex as leisure views and (2) tested whether knowledge about elderly sexuality, gender, sexual attitudes, and sex as leisure views explain/predict attitudes toward later-life sexuality. Data were collected using survey methodology (N = 270; 55.2% women) and analyzed with descriptive statistics and multiple regression. Young adults reported medium knowledge levels and relatively tolerant/permissive attitudes toward later-life sexuality. They also tended to have permissive general sexual attitudes and to view sex as leisure. In turn, young adults' general sexual attitudes and viewing sex as leisure predicted their acceptance of later-live sexuality, while gender and knowledge levels did not. These findings address meaningful knowledge gaps and contribute to sexual health education combating ageism.",

The results did not show any significant actor-observer difference; in general both spouses attributed their own and their partners' affairs to similar causes. Most frequently mentioned were situational factors and a need for novelty and excitement. Only one sex difference did show up: a need for sexual variety was more often attributed to males than to females. The attribution of marital deprivation and aggression were significantly related to jealousy. Among males, the attribution of a need for variety was linked to jealousy, while among females, perceived pressure of the extramarital partner appeared to be an important factor. Other situational attributions were not related to jealousy. It is suggested that jealousy has a somewhat different meaning for males andfemales, and that this difference is typical for sex roles in general.",

However, socially based characteristics (e.g., positive personality traits, common interests) are also desirable in potential mates. It was predicted that people who are weaker on evolutionarily advantageous traits (i.e., less attractive women, less wealthy men) would emphasize alternative, socially desirable traits to compensate for these perceived deficiencies. One hundred fifty-one Internet personal advertisements were analyzed for attractiveness, income, mention of physical attributes, and mention of other positive personal characteristics. Results were generally consistent with predictions. In males, both wealth and attractiveness were related to decreased emphasis on other positive personal characteristics, while in women, emphasis on physical attributes (but not objectively rated physical attractiveness) was negatively related to emphasis on other positive personal characteristics.",

      "abstract": "La toma de declaración de los menores en los procedimientos judiciales puede hacerla el juez directamente o a través de los profesionales que auxilian a éste. El valor que se le va a dar a estas declaraciones o testimonios de los menores, va a depender de la concepción o idea de la credibilidad del menor que se tenga. Frente a quienes como Gardner creen que las declaraciones de los menores son producto de la fantasía o mentira, otros autores como Clemente y Padilla demuestran mediante un estudio, que los menores no mienten y por tanto, su testimonio debe ser creído y tenido debidamente en cuenta. Habiéndose probado ya que los menores tienden a decir la verdad, se va a analizar si el sexo es una variable mediadora en la veracidad de sus testimonios. Nuestra hipótesis es que el sexo no influye en la veracidad del testimonio de los menores. Se realiza un estudio con 295 menores de ambos sexos y de edades comprendidas entre 6 y 11 años. Se les divide en dos grupos: uno de ellos va a presenciar una agresión verbal simulada y el otro una situación normalizada sin agresión. Ambos grupos van a ser preguntados sobre la escena que han presenciado. Posteriormente, se les va a intentar manipular a ambos grupos facilitándoles cuatro posibles bloques de información: la persona actora de la agresión en un futuro va a ser o no su profesor o profesora y ésta es una buena o mala persona. Finalmente, todos los grupos vuelven a ser preguntados por segunda vez sobre lo que han visto. Los resultados obtenidos muestran muy a las claras que el sexo no influye en el testimonio de los menores, de hecho se obtienen idénticos índices de veracidad y de mentira tanto cuando presencian la agresión como cuando no lo hacen. Sin embargo, el hecho de presenciar o no la agresión sí que es altamente significativo en la veracidad o no del testimonio de los menores: cuando la presencian prácticamente todos dicen la verdad y cuando no, el índice de veracidad baja ostensiblemente. Otro dato muy reseñable es que cuando se les intenta manipular a los varones y a las mujeres con variables de presión e imagen, el testimonio de los menores no varía significativamente. Por lo tanto los menores, tanto varones como mujeres, no cambian su versión de los hechos cuando se les intenta manipular, no importándoles su posible futura relación de subordinación o no, con respecto a la persona actora de los hechos de la agresión verbal ni la imagen que de ésta se les proyecta. A la vista de estos datos, se concluye que tanto los varones como las mujeres menores de edad, independientemente del sexo, vierten testimonios veraces cuando son preguntados sobre un hecho que han presenciado y dichos testimonios veraces no se ven alterados por intentos de manipulación por parte de una tercera persona.",

Gender-incongruent responses to recent events like #gamergate implies that the gender of the participant is not paramount to experience, but that their beliefs about gender roles are. To explore the role of sexist beliefs on experience in sexist games, we created three versions of a game that were identical except for the presence of sexist imagery and/or dialogue. We show that enjoyment of sexist games is not predicted by player gender, but by the player's pre-existing beliefs about gender. Furthermore, avatar identification is the pathway through which enjoyment is facilitated. Finally, sexist dialogue does not improve the play experience for anyone rather it harms experience for players of all genders who do not hold sexist beliefs.",

In this qualitative study on a small sample of elderly married Korean people, men were found to be sexually frustrated while their wives reported marital dissatisfaction. The men persistently asked for sex with the belief that consistency of active sexual expression is important in keeping their masculinity. Although they eventually have sex with their wives, the men were found to remain sexually frustrated for over several days because of their wives' initial disregard of their sexual advances. This disregard was mainly due to the husbands' involvement in extramarital sexual affairs.",

In Study 1a (N = 158) and 1b (N = 155), we found that compared to heterosexual men, participants stereotyped gay men more on young- than elderly-stereotypical traits. Participants represented bisexual men not as \"somewhere in between\" the stereotypes about heterosexual and gay men, but were characterized more by young- than elderly-stereotypical traits. In Study 2 (N = 106), we reasoned that because of their sexual orientation, both older gay and bisexual men would be viewed as atypical subtypes of older men, considered to be heterosexual by default. As atypical subtypes, both older gay and bisexual men may be stereotyped less on traits associated with elderly men and more on traits associated with their sexual orientation membership, namely young-stereotypical traits. Consistently, compared with older heterosexual men, both older gay and bisexual men were perceived as less typical of older men, and their perceived atypicality accounted for them being stereotyped less as older and more as younger men. The results have been examined for intersectional stereotyping research and practical implications are discussed.",

The results suggest that children of authoritative parents do not perceive adults to offer a more discursive moral atmosphere than children of other parents do; rather these children are more likely than others to think that adults will justify moral rules specifically in terms of equality in social relations. An unexpected finding was that children of permissive parents tended to judge that adults would legitimise judgments by pointing to the consequences of action for other people.",

In addition, it is also to find out how to communicate used in the disclosure or concealment of sexual identity to heterosexual men. using descriptive qualitative research methods. Data collection method used was an interview, with a number of informants 5 gay men. The results showed: (1) The process of self-disclosure of gay people to heterosexual male friends goes through a fairly long stage starting from being able to identify themselves, disclosure to the other immediate environment and finally to heterosexual men. (2) The purpose in self-disclosure is to foster a sense of being understood, accepted and equalized by his male friends.

      "abstract": "The term ‘sex roles’ encapsulates male–female differences in mate searching, competitive traits that increase mating/fertilization opportunities, choosiness about mates and parental care. Theoretical models suggest that biased sex ratios drive the evolution of sex roles. To model sex role evolution, it is essential to note that in most sexually reproducing species (haplodiploid insects are an exception), each offspring has one father and one mother. Consequently, the total number of offspring produced by each sex is identical, so the mean number of offspring produced by individuals of each sex depends on the sex ratio (Fisher condition). Similarly, the total number of heterosexual matings is identical for each sex. On average, neither sex can mate nor breed more often when the sex ratio is even. But equally common in which sex ratio? The Fisher condition only applies to some reproductive measures (e.g. lifetime offspring production or matings) for certain sex ratios (e.g. operational or adult sex ratio; OSR, ASR). Here, we review recent models that clarify whether a biased OSR, ASR or sex ratio at maturation (MSR) have a causal or correlational relationship with the evolution of sex differences in parental care and competitive traits—two key components of sex roles. We suggest that it is more fruitful to understand the combined effect of the MSR and mortality rates while caring and competing than that of the ASR itself. In short, we argue that the ASR does not have a causal role in the evolution of parental care. We point out, however, that the ASR can be a cue for adaptive phenotypic plasticity in how each sex invests in parental care. This article is part of the themed issue ‘Adult sex ratios and reproductive decisions: a critical re-examination of sex differences in human and animal societies’.",

While the older children were in nearly perfect agreement with the adults on both dimensions, the younger children (a) agreed less well with the older subjects regarding consensual stereotypes, and (b) showed poorer discriminative awareness of other-sex than of own-sex stereotypes.

In these loss-of-balance situations, adults tend to maintain hold of the object, instead of freeing both hands to aid in balance recovery. The current study investigated the ontogeny of this behavior by examining if infants also maintain hold of objects when experiencing a fall. Sixteen newly standing infants were video-recorded while standing and holding a toy and standing while not holding a toy. Similar to adults, when infants experienced a loss of balance, they did not drop held objects. However, maintaining hold of objects only partially interfered with the use of upper-limb protective strategies while falling. These results suggest that the tendency to maintain hold of an object while falling is present early in development and with little independent standing experience.",

      "title": "Play and Mate Preference: Testing the Signal Theory of Adult Playfulness.",
      "abstract": "The overwhelming majority of play research concerns juveniles. However, a full understanding of the phenomenon requires knowledge of play and playfulness across the life spans of those animals, including humans, who play in adulthood. The authors investigate a theory of play based on Darwin's concept of sexual selection that may account for the existence of play among adult humans. The authors hypothesize that playfulness becomes a highly desired characteristic in potential long-term mates but also that the reasons for desiring playful mates differ for males and females. The authors suggest that for males, playfulness in females signals youth and, hence, fecundity; for females, playfulness in males signals nonaggressiveness. They test these hypotheses using mate-preference data. Key words: adult play and playfulness; play and mate preference; play evolution; sexual selectionIf a wild animal habitually performs some useless activity, natural selection will favour rival individuals who devote the time and energy, instead, to surviving and reproducing. Nature cannot afford frivolous jeux d'esprit. Ruthless utilitarianism trumps, even if it doesn't always seem that way.-Richard Dawkins, The God DelusionPlay is quintessential jeux d'esprit, but because nearly all, if not all, mammals, many birds, and members of numerous other species play (Burghardt 2005), it also presents one of evolution's most vexing problems. Play appears to be not only nonutilitarian but is often downright dangerous. It seemingly wastes time and energy, opens players to injury and occasionally even to death, and leads, at times, to a lack of vigilance that may expose them to predation (Bekoffand Byers 1998; Bjorklund and Pellegrini 2002; Fagen 1981; Pellegrini and Bjorklund 2004; Symons 1978; for an alternate view see Martin and Caro 1985; Power 2000). So, why does play exist?In 1998 at a combined meeting of The Association for the Study of Play and the Society for Cross-Cultural Research, one of us-Garry Chick-delivered a keynote address titled What is Play For? (Chick 1998, 2001). In it, he expressed his worry about traditional theories of play (as described in, e.g., Ellis 1973) and their failure to explain adequately the existence of play. Most of these theories are outdated and all but useless because they do not lead to testable predictions. Additionally, and as important, they fail to address play and playfulness among adults. (We regard play as the behavioral manifestation of playfulness that, in turn, is the propensity to engage in play.) In contrast, Chick proposed a theory, based on Darwin's concept of sexual selection, that is not only relevant to adult play and playfulness but also permits the generation of testable hypotheses. Specifically, Chick postulated that play and the personal characteristic of playfulness, among adult humans, send signals, or messages, to the opposite sex of important information regarding the signaler's suitability as a long-term mate. Moreover, the content of the signals sent by males and by females differs. Through play and playfulness, males signal their nonaggressiveness while females signal their youth and fecundity. This article presents and tests hypotheses based on Chick's signal theory of adult playfulness.Proximate and Ultimate CauseChick's proposal rested on an explicitly evolutionary perspective. Therefore, we distinguish two types of explanation we believe apply to play and playfulness to understand them from an evolutionary perspective. In biology, proximate cause refers to something immediately responsible for some other action or event. This contrasts with ultimate cause, generally a reference to an evolutionary explanation. In an influential 1961 paper, biologist Ernst Mayr wrote that proximate and ultimate causes deal with how and why questions respectively. For example, how do birds determine when to migrate? They migrate because they have internal biological clocks that alert them to fly north (in the Northern Hemisphere) for reproduction and south for the winter. …",

      "abstract": "<h3></h3> It can be a great challenge for men and women to learn to deal with a rheumatic disease and its consequences. There are numerous indications in scientific literature that men and women react differently to stress. It has, for instance, been proposed that female reactions are characterized by a \"tend-and-befriend\" pattern, while male behavior is characterized by a \"fight-or-flight\" pattern. \"Tend and befriend\" refers to behavior that involves protection of offspring (tending) and seeking out the social group for mutual defense (befriending). A fight-or-flight pattern is characterized by confronting the stressor (fight) or flee (flight), either literally or through avoidant coping, such as social withdrawal. There are also other examples from daily life suggesting that women and men indeed react differently. For example, women show more emotions and like to talk with other women about their problems, while men perhaps process emotions by seeking distraction such as watching soccer with other men. Social roles are also different for men and women. Women more often take care of the children and do a larger part of the housekeeping. These differences in roles and coping between men and women may affect the psychological impact of a rheumatic disease. This would suggest a gender-sensitive approach in research and health care. In this presentation, I will review research that used a gender-sensitive approach and present the results with regard to gender differences in psychological impact and ways of coping in people with rheumatic diseases. <h3>Disclosure of Interest</h3> None Declared",

      "title": "[Contraception in adolescence: knowing is not enough].",
      "abstract": "Sexuality is the source of the biological, psychic, and social changes of adolescence. Contraception, by modifying some aspects of sexuality, can change the usual course of adolescence. Sexuality is a new experience for adolescents and is submerged in the same confusion and uncertainty as other areas of their lives. The experience of health personnel in contraception over the years has been gained in prescription for adults, who unlike adolescents are members of stable couples who have found their places in society. Women seeking contraception have usually experienced pregnancy and verified their fecundity, thereby consolidating their identities, unlike the adolescent who is still unsure of her femininity. Contraception for adolescents, by blocking 2 stages in the life of a woman (proving fecundity and experiencing maternity) is an obstacle to the total achievement of adulthood. The connection between sex and pregnancy is recognized by a 13-year-old in a theoretical way, but is not always integrated as a practical reality. Many adults have difficulty accepting the contraception requests of adolescents because they do not feel it is morally right for adolescents to have direct sexual experiences rather than daydreams. The reality of adolescent sexual lives is quite different from what most adults adults imagine it to be. Mental integration of contraception for an adolescent requires acceptance of the link between sex and pregnancy and a mental representation of oneself and one's behavior in which sexuality is considered a possibility. Many adolescents believe that they are too young to become pregnant, or are unable to make the link between sex today and pregnancy in the future, or do not perceive a possible pregnancy in negative terms. After they perceive the need for contraception and develop a desire to meet the need, adolescents must gain knowledge of the different methods available. Choice of a method will be influenced by the degree of efficacy of the method, its cost, facility of use, the frequency of intercourse, secondary effects, social or religious prohibitions, desire to keep contraceptive use secret, and the possibility of involving the partner. Failure to use the chosen means may be caused by such external factors as absence of a nearby family planning center or lack of money, or by internal factors. THe presence of an adult at the contraception consultation may be perceived by the adolescent as a means of control. The consultation may signify to the adolescent a demand for recognition of the reality of his affective and sexual life, a rite of passage, a means of transgressing parental prohibitions, and an indication of acceptance of the dissociation of sexuality from fertility. The presence of the girl's mother can complicate the consultation. Very often the health care professional confuses the role of parent with the medical role, feeling a moral responsibility beyond helping the adolescent avoid pregnancy or abortion. The best course is to be available to listen to the adolescent without prejudice in order to permit the establishment of room for reflection and maturation.",

While it may appear ground-breaking to see people in their seventies and eighties navigating (re)invention of self and sexuality within mainstream media, upon closer inspection–in particular, Season Four–the inherent contradictions common to postfeminist texts are exposed. Initial offerings from Grace and Frankie extend to positive representations of ageing sexuality, female agency, and self-efficacy; however, these themes are rather negated as the seasons progress. Such incongruities feature notions of what might be considered as effective ageing: a dualism in which ageing femininity is both celebrated and fought; discourses of empowerment via rigorous, yet relatively ineffective, corporeal self-maintenance/somatic discipline; a sexualised 'feminism' which also features the women as variously alone, but dependent upon their ex-husbands, each other, or their children; and a postfeminist 'makeover' paradigm in which the pendulum swings between preservation and restoration, individualism and conformity. Albeit within neoliberal and postfeminist discourses, Grace and Frankie, while flawed, remains an important text in which visibly ageing bodies, ageing sexuality, and non-normative identification are elevated and explored.",

The addition of more than one extra X and/or Y chromosome to a normal male karyotype is less frequent and has its own distinctive physical and behavioral profile. This study examines the behavioral similarities and differences in individuals with 48,XXYY compared to 48,XXXY and 49,XXXXY. The participants include 11 males with 48,XXYY and 13 males with 48,XXXY and 49,XXXXY. Using the Vineland Adaptive Behavior, the Achenbach Child Behavior Checklist, and the Reiss Personality Profiles, parents are asked to characterize the behavior and personality of their boys with sex chromosome tetrasomy and pentasomy. Males with 48,XXYY have higher overall adaptive scales in daily living skills, socialization, and communication compared to males with 48,XXXY and 49,XXXXY. Both groups are at risk for maladaptive behavior, although 48,XXYY males are at a higher risk for internalizing and externalizing symptoms. 48,XXXY and 49,XXXXY function at a lower cognitive level and their behavior is often immature for their chronological age. Both groups display interests in helping others, but have a low tolerance for being rejected or teased.

The explanation of this variation is not established, but I have hypothesized that it is partially caused by the hormonal concentrations of both parents around the time of conception. The present note suggests how this hypothesis might accommodate recent sex ratio findings relating to 'psychosexual restriction', female genital cutting, sexes of prior sibs, finger length ratios, the autism spectrum disorder, parental occupation and maternal eating disorders. Tests of such suggestions are offered, and it is hypothesized that: (a) in women, Manning's R (the ratio of the lengths of the 2nd and 4th digits) is positively correlated with offspring sex ratio (proportion male); (b) women who have undergone female genital cutting (FGC) have high androgen levels; (c) offspring sex ratio correlates positively with 'masculinity' of parental occupation, the correlation being mediated by testosterone levels. It is noted that the lines of evidence for three hypotheses (James', Manning's and Baron-Cohen's) are mutually supportive.",

In six studies the hypothesis that muscularity is one such cue is tested. As predicted, women rate muscular men as sexier, more physically dominant and volatile, and less committed to their mates than nonmuscular men. Consistent with the inverted-U hypothesis of masculine traits, men with moderate muscularity are rated most attractive. Consistent with past research on fitness cues, across two measures, women indicate that their most recent short-term sex partners were more muscular than their other sex partners (d s = .36, .47). Across three studies, when controlling for other characteristics (e.g., body fat), muscular men rate their bodies as sexier to women (partial r s = .49-.62) and report more lifetime sex partners (partial r s = .20-.27), short-term partners (partial r s = .25-.28), and more affairs with mated women (partial r = .28).",

Therefore, the reason for the evident gender differences in game preferences and play styles has to be sought either within the individuals or the video game medium itself. Gender stereotypes, like all social stereotypes, are cognitive structures aimed at helping to categorize a person in a social group on the basis of attributes that are believed to be characteristic for the whole group as well as for its individual members.

In this study, we compared the experiences of 110 formerly married gay fathers who were currently in relationships with men, 44 formerly married gay fathers who were currently single, and 14 gay fathers who remained married to women. In an Internet survey, we examined relationship satisfaction, parenting stress, sexual orientation disclosure, and gay identity among these men, all of whom had become fathers in the context of heterosexual relationships. Results showed that gay fathers who were currently married to women reported lower relationship satisfaction, affection, consensus, and lower overall dyadic adjustment in their current relationships. Formerly married gay fathers who were currently single or currently in relationships with male partners reported greater openness about their sexual identities than did still-married gay fathers. The men who were currently in relationships, however, did not report differences in relationship cohesion or parenting stress as a function of partners' gender. In summary, self-identified gay men who were currently in relationships with women reported less openness about their sexual orientation and lower relationship satisfaction, but not more parenting stress than did formerly married gay fathers.",

      "title": "SEXUALITY IN CHILD CUSTODY DECISIONS*",
      "abstract": "For gay and lesbian parents, child custody decisions have progressed considerably since the time it was generally accepted by courts that homosexual parents were per se unfit for custody. Most states now employ an orientation blind standard or nexus test, meaning that the court will not take a parent's orientation into account unless there is evidence of harm to the child. Although this is a step in a positive direction, there are unforeseen costs. Orientation blindness may seem neutral on the surface because nexus tests usually employ the term “sexual orientation,” but the question of harm is applied only to homosexual parents and not heterosexual parents. Gay and lesbian parents who wish to raise sexual orientation claims about the positive aspects of role‐modeling and community inclusion may be discouraged from doing so because parent‐child role‐modeling has traditionally been seen as recruitment, predation or the disruption of “normal” sexual development when the parent is gay or lesbian. Key Points for the Family Court Community: Gay and Lesbian parents have strong incentives to argue against parent‐child imitation. Heterosexual parents are not similarly constrained about positive modeling for their children. Orientation‐blind standards may not be neutral in the application because of the strong social belief in parent‐child imitation. If courts are aware of the disincentives that lesbian and gay parents have against arguing for positive modeling, they can more neutrally apply the orientation standards.",

      "title": "Missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls: A case for abuse screening in at‐risk paediatric populations",
      "abstract": "American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) people experience the highest rates of homicide and violence in the USA and Canada.1 This propensity for violence and sexual crimes has manifested as the crisis referred to as Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls, with more than 5000 young women having suffered homicide, kidnapping or trafficking in the USA.2 AI children are not exempt from these statistics. When compared to non-AI populations there is a statistically significantly higher proportion of AI/AN reporting of emotional, physical and sexual abuse.3 This same disparity is also true regarding emotional and physical neglect.3 Abuse and violence affect all communities, but as paediatric providers, many of the patients we treat lack the vocabulary, maturity or both to express their needs, rendering them particularly vulnerable. These conversations can be difficult, especially when there is fear that the questions asked might alienate or offend the families we are trying to serve. Medical trainees are often uncomfortable in screening for child abuse, particularly, during encounters where the signs are subtle or unrelated to the chief complaint. Medical schools and residency programmes often lack the curriculum needed to educate trainees on how to approach suspected abuse cases or the resources available to families.4 Additionally, the lack of a standardised approach to survey for abuse further complicates effective recognition and management. However, evidence suggests that residents who learn to address family psychosocial issues, including violence and abuse, are more likely to screen for these issues in practice and ultimately connect patients with needed resources.4 Several validated screening tools, including the International Society for Prevention of Child Abuse and Neglect (IPSCAN) Child Abuse Screening Tool for Children (ICAST-C) and Escape Form have demonstrated effectiveness at screening children for abuse.5, 6 The Escape Form evaluates risk based on the patient's history, the development of the child, the appropriateness of interaction between the child and caretakers, the consistency of the physical examination compared with the history, if there was a delay in seeking care and other safety concerns.6 Results from this form provide an ‘at-risk score’ that creates an objective manner of evaluation that can allow for consistency in evaluation. Review of this model has demonstrated an increase in abuse screening, trainee comfort with screening and most importantly, an increase in detection of cases that is five times higher when compared to cases of children that were not screened.6 The American Academy of Pediatrics offers several resources through ‘The Resilience Project’ aimed at addressing violence and toxic stress at both the medical practice and policy levels.7 This online resource provides tools for families, care givers and providers who treat children and youth exposed to violence.7 The implementation of the ‘Training Toolkit’ may prove valuable to trainees and early career physicians, helping them to learn the different types of violence that our paediatric patients may experience. The expanding education on patient and family-centred communication throughout clinical training may better equip future paediatricians to identify abuse and develop the confidence to start the appropriate dialogue to curb its effects. This national crisis of violence against AI/AN women and girls challenges paediatricians to find ways to address the gap in protecting girls from becoming the missing and the murdered. Screening both for abuse and family wellness is a critical step for paediatricians in addressing this crisis. Gaining the confidence to implement these skills can be undoubtedly challenging. Structured teaching and guidance can empower residents to identify abuse and will be a life-changing event for trainees and the families we treat.",

      "abstract": "Normal Pubertal DevelopmentSOMATIC CHANGESPuberty is characterized by an increase in growth rate and the appearance of striking somatic sex differences. The onset of these changes actually antedates the appearance of secondary sex characteristics by a few years. Thus, sexual maturation is a considerably longer process than the period of visible changes induced by marked incremental increases in gonadal hormones. Unlike boys, girls augment their body fat noticeably at 7 years of age; by 16 years of age girls have twice as much fat as boys.Total body water reflects lean body mass, which is made up primarily of muscle and skeletal tissues. At 9 years of age, total body water increases significantly in boys and signals the onset of more rapid growth in lean body mass. Muscle mass in boys doubles between the ages of 10 and 17 years, and skeletal mass doubles between ages 12 and 16 years. During adolescence boys exceed girls in all body measurements except hip width and body fat.The changes in body constituents during puberty are reflected more impressively by increases in height and weight. The initiation of the adolescent growth spurt precedes the onset of secondary sex characteristics by approximately 1 year in boys and girls.",

An early view of sexual aggression that focused on hostile aggression was that only a small sub-group of males would be aroused by sexual violence. Some personality correlates of rape proclivity have been investigated. Hall et al. reported that attitudinal correlates were much stronger, and few studies have found personality correlates to be as important as attitudinal ones. Friends were reported as providing much more pressure for sexual activity, and as being more likely to condone sexual aggression in certain situations, than were friends of control subjects. Gwartney-Gibbs et al. found that almost twice as many males with sexually aggressive peers reported coercive or enforced intercourse than did males with no sexually aggressive peers.",

      "title": "Editors' Note: Citizenship and Nationalism",
      "abstract": "Editors' Note Citizenship and Nationalism The connection between citizenship and nationalism has not been given enough consideration by U.S. historians of women in the last thirty years,1 despite the dramatic developments in the field of women's history. Perhaps, or at least in my case, it took living outside the United States to realize this. It is readily evident today that women in the United States and most other Western democracies remain second-class citizens even after being granted the right to vote and accorded varying degrees of equality of opportunity in the work force and educational institutions. This is because they continue to lack three basic freedoms enjoyed by men under most constitutional or other democratic forms of government: freedom from inferior legislative, constitutional or juridical status (usually meaning fewer individual economic, educational, and legal opportunities and choices enjoyed by mainstream men); freedom from fertility and family discrimination (fewer reproductive rights, including access to abortion and inferior position within traditional family hierarchies); and 3) freedom from fear (fewer protections from the uncontrolled and often ignored violence against women throughout the world). In other words, a common inferior or second-class citizenship has been imposed on women throughout the world. Why is this the case? The major reason stems from traditional male origins of definitions of democratic citizenshipÂ—definitions now employed in the new emerging democracies of Eastern Europe and Russia and most of the Third World. However, another reason lies in the fact that feminists and historians of women have not usually focused on the general meaning of citizenship for women in their respective countries until recently. Instead, they have championed certain aspects of male citizenship , such as equal political and legal treatment under the law, rather than trying to transform male definitions of citizenship to meet the societal requirements of women. This is why we need a feminist approach to international lawÂ—to make sure that human rights include women's rights. We must rethink the definition of national and global citizenship based on equality of rights so that they include those rights which correspond to women's experiences and needs, as they are reflected in different countries all over the world. 1996 Editors' Note 7 The history of citizenship for women in the United States and under United Nations' covenants demonstrates that equal rights in the areas of work and education, while a necessary starting point for obtaining firstclass citizenship for women, has not been enough because such equality is typically based on male standards. Yet women do not exist on an equal footing with men in either postindustrial or less developed nations. In labor forces all over the world, for example, equal treatment (and its opposite, special or protective treatment) are still defined by men and do not offer women true equality. Equal treatment invites women to perform as \"ideal [male] workers\" without the flow of domestic services historically provided male workers by women.2 This inequality was quickly recognized by overworked feminists in the 1970s when they said: \"I need a wife.\" Special treatment of women workers in the past has resulted in protective legislation discriminating against average working women and in the present to creating special, usually inferior, \"mommy tracks\" for professional women. Neither legal /cultural approach results in equality or full citizenship for women. Unless women simply want to aspire to act as, and be treated like menÂ—despite the odds against achieving this statusÂ—equitable, not simply equal, treatment of women must be included in any definition of national or global citizenship in the future. As feminists attorneys have said: \"the rhetoric of human rights, on both the national and international levels, regards women as equal citizens [when they are not], as 'individuals' subject to the same level of treatment and the same protection as men. But the discourse of 'traditional values' may prevent women from enjoying any human rights, however, they may be described [because male standards are still the norm].\"3 Likewise, nationalism, be it after the American Revolution or the Irish RisingÂ—or in the former Yugoslavia and other recently liberated communist nationsÂ—was usually not favorably disposed toward the needs or rights of women.

      "abstract": "The central premise of this paper is that a significant amount of sex offending stems from unusual or inappropriate sexual preferences that appear in early adolescence, are relatively stable, and immutable. In other words, they are like the more ordinary sexual preferences with which we are familiar. As such, they generate sexual impulses that are insistent. Individuals will be strongly tempted to act on them, alternatives to satisfying them will be unfulfilling, and complete long-term control of such impulses is unlikely. Yet since individuals with sexual preferences for inappropriate objects or activities are neither morally nor legally permitted to act on them, they find themselves in a terrific bind. The public is, to some extent, correct in not trusting the individuals with such preferences and thus in attempting to monitor or control them. However, most efforts to do so appear ineffective and counterproductive. Recidivist sex offenders are particularly worrisome. The possibility of voluntary castration for such offenders, in lieu of preventive detention or other more restrictive measures, is explored.",

      "abstract": "A great deal of research has examined math development in males versus females. Some studies indicate that males do better on standardized tests of mathematics achievement, whereas females get better grades in math class than males. Other studies find no gender differences in math development, or that differences depend on factors such as the type of math problem included on the tests. Further, there is evidence that gender differences in math test performance are not stable over time, with accumulating evidence that these differences are narrowing in more recent cohorts. In addition to evidence concerning sex differences in math grades and test performance, there is evidence that there are sex differences in math attitudes, with females showing higher levels of math anxiety and less confidence in their math ability than males, controlling for their math performance. Additionally, there is evidence that stereotypes exist such that teachers and parents believe that males are better at math than females, even when males and females have comparable levels of math skill. Moreover, when this math stereotype is activated before taking a math test, stereotype threat ensues and female performance is negatively affected. A wide range of factors, including biological differences, sociocultural factors, including stereotypes, and differences in math attitudes and interests, are likely to act in concert to account for male-female differences in mathematics achievement and decisions to enter math-intensive careers.",

Although HM derides men for acting in a domineering manner, it characterizes men as designed for dominance. By reinforcing the perceived stability of gender hierarchy, HM may undermine women’s motivation to seek change.",

      "abstract": "Does affirmation of familial self have a distinct buffering function compared to affirmation of close other (friend, partner) self or individual self? We addressed this question in an East-Asian culture (China) that places particularly high value on familial self. Familial self-affirmation (compared to other forms of self-affirmation as well as low affirmation) curtailed the mortality salience–induced intolerance to birth-control policy (Experiment 1), reduced female participants’ performance detriments—due to stereotype threat—on mental rotation (Experiment 2), and diminished the disadvantageous influence of negative feedback on further interest in information about one’s weaknesses (Experiment 3). Close other self-affirmation, devoid of family context, was no more potent than individual self-affirmation or low affirmation. The findings underscore the utility of distinguishing among different sources of self-affirmation, highlight the relevance of familial self-affirmation to self-affirmation theory, and call for research testing the germaneness of familial self (and, more generally, the construct of family) in other Eastern, as well as Western, cultures.",

      "title": "Frequency of Female Copulations with Multiple Males and Sexual Selection",
      "abstract": "Female animals often copulate with more than a single male during one fertile period. I suggest that female propensity to engage in such multimale copulations is caused by constraints on female mate choice set by the availability of males. A simple graphic model of mate choice after formation of pair bonds suggests that the probability of female engagement in copulations with multiple males should be inversely proportional to the availability of preferred mates at the time of mate choice. This problem will be present whenever males and females establish pair bonds, and the male availability constraint on female mate choice will be more important for mating systems in which males attract only a single or few females. Monogamy thus particularly often sets the stage for sexual selection via multiple matings. Male availability to females during mate choice differs between mating systems, and the relative frequency of female copulations with multiple males should be inversely related to male availability. If females attempt to adjust their precopulatory mate choice by copulating with additional males, sexual selection resulting from choice of copulation partners should reinforce precopulatory sexual selection. Patterns of male and female extrapair copulations and patterns of extrapair paternity in birds are in accordance with this scenario.",

Simmons ruled that the death penalty is a disproportionate punishment for persons under the age of eighteen, in violation of the Eighth Amendment's prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment. Perhaps the most compelling reasons the Roper Court offered for its decision were those that drew upon recent scientific insights into the bio-psychosocial aspects of adolescent development to corroborate the view that juveniles are less culpable for their crimes than adults. Court made three bold findings in distinguishing juveniles from adults: 1) A lack of maturity and an underdeveloped sense of responsibility are found in youth more often than in adults...These qualities often result in impetuous and ill-considered actions and decisions; 2) Juveniles are more vulnerable or susceptible to negative influences and outside pressures, including peer pressure....Youth is....a time and condition of life when a person may be most susceptible to influence and to psychological damage; and 3) The character of a juvenile is not as well formed as that of an adult. personality traits of juveniles are more transitory, less fixed. Although Roper will always be best known as the case that abolished the juvenile death penalty in America, the decision is at least equally noteworthy for its endorsement and application of scientific findings relating to adolescent developmental immaturity. This article considers the implications of Roper's findings for the application of the Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights extended to juveniles in Gault.",

Ethnographic research has documented the social acceptance of nonbinary gender roles and non‐hetero sexualities in numerous societies, challenging the idea that homosexuality and transgender identities are deviant or pathological and contributing to political movements for LGBTQ rights in many countries. While in Euro‐American societies, sexuality is commonly assumed to be an essential part of identity derived from the gender of one's desired partner, ethnographic evidence shows that people do not universally regard sexual behavior or desire as related to identity or believe that the gender of one's desired sexual partner(s) determines one's sexuality.",

      "abstract": "Twenty-one heterosexual women who were or had been married to bisexual or homosexual men and had children by them responded to a 28-page questionnaire that explored their experiences as wives and mothers. All of the married women expected a lasting, monogamous marriage. Only three had partial knowledge of their husband's sexual orientation before marriage. All of them went through a painful grief reaction when they learned that their husbands had emotional or sexual, or both, attachments to other men. The suffering was aggravated by feeling deceived or stupid for not having guessed the truth. What made it difficult for them to seek support from family and friends was the fear of encountering social disapproval or ostracism. They were afraid for themselves, their husbands, and their children. At the time of the study 11 of the 21 82women were still married and living with their husbands, but most of them felt unsure that the marriage would last. Ten were in transition, separated, or divorced. Only three of the still married wives had complete confidence in the future stability of their relationships. These marriages were characterized by good communications, husbands who considered themselves bisexual, and an open marriage contract whereby wives could have heterosexual affairs. Findings cannot be generalized from this small convenience sample, but will hopefully encourage further research. The writers are also soliciting more subjects to enlarge the sample.",

      "title": "MODELS OF SEXUAL SELECTION ON A QUANTITATIVE GENETIC TRAIT WHEN PREFERENCE IS ACQUIRED BY SEXUAL IMPRINTING",
      "abstract": "The evolution of a quantitative genetic trait under stabilizing viability selection and sexual selection is modeled for a polygynous species in which female mating preferences are acquired by sexual imprinting on the parents and by exposure to the surviving population at large. Stabilizing viability selection acts equally on both sexes in the case of a sexually monomorphic trait and on males only in the case of a dimorphic trait. A genetically fixed sensory or perceptual bias defines the origin of the scale on which the trait is measured, and the possibility is incorporated that female preferences may deviate asymmetrically from the familiar—either toward or away from this origin. When viability selection is strong relative to sexual selection, the models predict that the mean trait value will evolve to the viability optimum. With intermediate ratios of the strength of viability to sexual selection, a stable equilibrium can occur on either side of this viability optimum, depending on the direction of asymmetry in female preferences. When viability selection is relatively weak and certain other conditions are also satisfied, runaway selection is predicted.Corresponding Editor: M. Morgan",

To the extent that gender‐role expectations, in turn, drive an individual's life chances and options, the sex of the individual is an important causal agent upon the individual's life experiences. Two separate explanations are available to help understand the determination of a person's sex at birth: (1) sex determination is random, or (2) sex determination is facultative or biased. We argue that sex is not determined at random, but that a woman's reactions to environmental parameters will bias her toward giving birth to a daughter or to a son. Family structure and the mother's evaluation of the father are offered as two candidates that bias the sex determination away from chance or randomness.",

We found that it was not possible to classify either sex as more robust or longer lived since relative longevity was conditional on age (young or old), cage conditions (solitary confinement or grouped cages), and treatment (starvation, irradiation, or density). Implications of these findings are discussed including selective survival, demographic selection, a framework for male-female mortality differentials, and an evolutionary perspective on gender differences in longevity.",

They do not perceive a discrepancy between their actual and desired number of hours spent on leisure activities. Persons with a low leisure satisfaction are younger and have a pessimistic outlook. They perceive internal barriers (personal interest, capacity) that block them from spending more time on some leisure activities. Persons with medium leisure satisfaction perceive external barriers (time, money, circumstances) that block them from spending more time on some leisure activities. A tentative conclusion is that people from lower social classes more often belong to this latter group (medium leisure satisfaction), while people from middle social classes more often are characterized by a low leisure satisfaction. People from high social classes report most leisure satisfaction.",

As a means to address nonverbal communication in sexual situations, the authors focused this study around the question of what do traditionally-aged college students believe constitutes nonverbal consent? Participants included 27 undergraduate students, ages ranging from 18 to 24 years. Findings revealed a series of 12 nonverbal behaviours that exhibited different forms of what the participants saw as constituting affirmative sexual consent. These behaviours included sex noises and/or heavy breathing, nodding, display or use of a contraceptive, arousal, and removing another individual’s clothing, among others. The authors utilise Sexual Scripts Theory and previous literature to analyse the findings. The main key implication from this study is that without a contextual setting, nonverbal indicators of sexual consent are difficult to interpret and highly conditional.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Human females exhibit greater social interest and skills relative to males, appearing in infancy, suggesting biological roots; however, male and female infants may be treated differently, potentially causing or amplifying sex differences. Here, we tested whether sex differences in social motivation emerge in infant monkeys ( n = 48) reared in a controlled postnatal environment. Compared to males, females at 2–3 weeks looked more at conspecifics’ faces ( d = 0.65), especially the eyes ( d = 1.09) and at 4–5 weeks exhibited more affiliative behaviors ( d = 0.64), including gesturing, looking and proximity to familiar and unfamiliar human caretakers. In sum, converging evidence from humans and monkeys suggests that female infants are more social than males in the first weeks of life and that such differences may arise independent of postnatal experience. Individual differences in social interest have wide-ranging developmental consequences, impacting infants’ social interaction quality and opportunities for learning. Understanding the evolution of sex differences and their developmental emergence is necessary to best support infants with varying levels of sociality.",

      "abstract": "This paper is a systematic review and meta-analysis on sexual orientation identity development milestones among people who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, or another sexual minority identity (LGB+). Common milestones measured in the 30 studies reviewed were becoming aware of queer attractions, questioning one’s sexual orientation, self-identifying as LGB+, coming out to others, engaging in sexual activity, and initiating a romantic relationship. Milestones occurred in different sequences, although attraction was almost always first, often followed by self-identification and/or sexual activity; coming out and initiating a romantic relationship often followed these milestones. Meta-analysis results showed that the mean effect sizes and 95% confidence intervals varied by milestone: attraction [ M age =12.7 (10.1, 15.3)], questioning one’s orientation [ M age =13.2 [12.8, 13.6]), self-identifying [ M age =17.8 (11.6, 24.0)], sexual activity [ M age =18.1 (17.6, 18.6)], coming out [ M age =19.6 (17.2, 22.0)], and romantic relationship [ M age =20.9 (13.2, 28.6)]. Nonetheless, results also showed substantial heterogeneity in the mean effect sizes. Additional meta-analyses showed that milestone timing varied by sex, sexual orientation, race/ethnicity, and birth cohort. Although patterns were found in LGB+ identity development, there was considerable diversity in milestone trajectories.",

      "title": "Sharing the same world: boys' relations with girls during their last year of primary school",
      "abstract": "Abstract This paper explores the effect of cross gender relations on the construction of boys' masculine identities. The findings are based on data gathered from a year long empirical study of 10 to 11‐year‐old boys set in three UK junior schools. Although masculinity is defined against femininity and boys needed to mark out a set of distinctions from themselves and girls, I found that most boys categorized girls as different (they are not us) rather than oppositional, and the most common reaction was one of detachment and disinterest. Rather than maintaining that there are two separate worlds, I argue that there are two complementary gendered cultures, sharing the one overall school world, which are further nuanced by social class and race/ethnicity. Although there was a tendency of boys to dominate space and girls were often excluded from playground games, many girls refused to be dominated by boys, and some were able to deliberately exercise power over them.

To protect anonymity, all names of places and people have been changed, and in order to further disguise each school's identity the number of pupils on roll has been rounded to the nearest 25. SATs are Standard Assessment Tasks (Tests), which pupils take at the ages of seven, 11 and 14 in English, Mathematics and Science. This draws on work by Bourdieu (1986 Bourdieu P (1986) The forms of capital in: J. Richardson (Ed.)

The relatively high proportions of Indian and Jewish pupils at Highwoods and Petersfield means that ethnicity is also likely to have had a significant influence. A major influence in pupil's orientations to schooling came from their parents. Nearly every boy told me that 'gay' was the worst (in the sense that it was the most hurtful) name that they could be called. This is similar to Thorne's (1993 Thorne B (1993) Gender play: girls and boys in school New Brunswick Rutgers University Press [Google Scholar], p. 123) analogy of 'money in the bank'. In her study she argues that a boy called John was able to integrate with the girls without derogation because of his 'unquestioned masculinity' which stemmed, amongst other things, from his sporting prowess. Thorne makes the analogy of John being able to 'spend' his masculinity like 'money in the bank', which means that he had plenty of it. In her empirical study Renold (2000 Renold, E. (2000). 'Coming out': gender, (hetero)sexuality and the primary school. Gender and Education, 12: 309–326. [Taylor & Francis Online], [Web of Science ®] , [Google Scholar], p. 319) found a total of nine out of 21 boys talking about ' \"fancying\", \"asking girls out\" and being \"boyfriends\" ' (to girls). For safety, both boys and girls usually went through intermediaries when 'asking each other out'.",

      "abstract": "Despite extant evidence of negative peer treatment of transgender adolescents and adults, little is known about how young children perceive transgender peers, particularly those who have socially transitioned or are living in line with their gender rather than sex at birth. Whereas children have been shown to be averse to gender nonconformity in peers, because many transgender children appear and behave in ways consistent with their expressed gender (but not their sex at birth), it is unclear how children evaluate these identities. In 2 studies, we investigated 5- to 10-year-old children's (Ntotal = 113) preferences for transgender versus gender-\"typical\" peers who either shared their gender identity or did not. We also examined whether children categorized transgender peers by their sex or expressed gender, as it might inform their evaluations. Children preferred cisgender peers over transgender peers; however, they also liked peers of their own gender rather than the other gender (e.g., female participants preferred girls over boys), demonstrating that the oft-documented own-gender bias plays an important role even when children are reasoning about transgender peers. Children did not reliably categorize transgender peers by sex or gender; yet those who categorized transgender peers by their sex showed greater dislike of transgender peers. The current studies are the first to investigate cisgender children's attitudes toward transgender children and suggest that perceptions of gender categorization and conformity play a role in children's evaluations of transgender peers.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Gender role identity tends to shape an individual’s self-concept, playing a significant role in shaping their behaviour and interpersonal relationship patterns across different societies, races, and ethnicities. This study explores the relationship between perceived parenting styles (authoritarian, authoritative, and permissive for both parents) and gender role identity in young adults, and also the pattern of gender role identity of parents and their offspring. The sample consisted of 100 young adults (M=20.60, SD=1.98) and both of their parents (father and mother). Both the young adults and their parents responded to the Bem Sex-Role Inventory, whereas only young adults responded to the Parental Authority Questionnaire. Descriptive statistics showed that out of 100 young adults, 38% identified as androgynous, followed by feminine (29%), masculine (12%), and undifferentiated (21%). 54% of male young adults rated themselves as androgynous, whereas 46% of females identified as feminine. A considerable proportion of the parents reported themselves as androgynous (both 48%). A significant correlation was found between permissive parenting style in mothers and undifferentiated gender role identity in young adults (r= 0.75, p= 8.1e -05 ). A positive, moderately significant correlation was also found between fathers' permissive parenting style and masculinity in young adults (r= 0.83, p= 0.00093). This information will help us understand parents' role in gender identity formation and may also help us formulate management plans in terms of the parent-child relationship and their gender role identity.",

      "abstract": "The human tendency to impose costs on those who have behaved antisocially towards third parties (third-party punishment) has a formative influence on societies, yet very few studies of the development of this tendency exist. In most studies where young children have punished, participants have imposed costs on puppets, leaving open the question as to whether young children punish in real third-party situations. Here, five-year-olds were given the opportunity to allocate desirable or unpleasant items to antisocial and neutral adults, who were presented as real and shown on video. Neutral individuals were almost always allocated only desirable items. Antisocial individuals were instead usually allocated unpleasant items, as long as participants were told they would give anonymously. Most participants who were instead told they would give in person did not allocate unpleasant items, although a minority did so. This indicates that the children interpreted the situation as real, and that whereas they genuinely desired to punish antisocial adults, they did not usually dare do so in person. Boys punished more frequently than girls. The willingness of preschoolers to spontaneously engage in third-party punishment, occasionally even risking the social costs of antagonizing an anti-social adult, demonstrates a deep-seated early-developing punitive sentiment in humans.",

      "title": "Neuroendocrine Influences on Human Sexuality",
      "abstract": "While prenatal sex hormones guide the development of sex-typical reproductive structures, they also act on the developing brain, resulting in sex differences in brain and behavior in animal models. Stemming from this literature is the prominent hypothesis that prenatal neuroendocrine factors underlie sex differences in human sexual orientation, to explain why most males have a preference for female sexual partners (gynephilia), whereas most females display a preference for male sexual partners (androphilia). Convergent evidence from experiments of nature and indirect markers of prenatal hormones strongly support a role for prenatal androgens in same-same sexual orientations in women, although this finding is specific to a subset of lesbians who are also gender nonconforming (“butch”). More gender-conforming lesbians (“femmes”) do not show evidence of increased prenatal androgens. The literature has been more mixed for male sexual orientation: some report evidence of low prenatal androgen exposure, while others report evidence of high androgen levels and many other studies find no support for a role of prenatal androgen exposure in the development of androphilia in males. Recent evidence suggests there may be subgroups of gay men who owe their sexual orientation to distinct biodevelopmental mechanisms, which could account for these mixed findings. Although this research is young, it is similar to findings from lesbian populations, because gay men who are more gender nonconforming, and report a preference for receptive anal sex, differ on markers of prenatal development from gay men who are more gender conforming and report a preference for insertive anal sex. This chapter concludes with future research avenues including assessing whether multiple biodevelopmental pathways underlie sexual orientation and whether neuroendocrine factors and other biological mechanisms (e.g., immunology, genetics) interact to promote a same-sex sexual orientation.",

The correlates of father absence early (before age 5) or late (between 5 and 11) in childhood were studied in a sample of college-aged women; father absence was due to either death or divorce. In comparison to father-present controls the father-absent subjects showed few deviations in such personality measures as degree of sex-role typing, attitudes toward romantic love, sex-role traditionalism, manifest anxiety, or locus of control. There did appear to be some attitudinal differences about the acceptability of sexual intercourse for the father-absent groups, but there were no differences in the amount of heterosexual behaviors actually reported. The father-absent subjects did not differ from the controls on various measures of nonverbal behavior to male interviewers. Reasons for the lack of agreement with a study by E. M. Hetherington are discussed; the primary factors of relevance seem to be age of the subjects at testing, SES, race, ethnicity, education, and family composition.",

Interestingly, Sexual Selection is often used to investigate the origins of sports, arts, humor, religion and other phenomena that, in several languages, are simply called “play.” Despite their manifested differences, these phenomena rely on shared psychological processes, including playfulness. Further, in such behaviors there is usually considerable individual variability, including sex differences, and positive relationship with mating success. However, Sexual Selection is rarely applied in the study of play, with exception to what is concerned as infant training behavior for adult sex roles. We offer an integrated grounding of playful phenomena aligning evolutionary propositions based on sexual selection, which might stimulate further exploration of playfulness within evolutionary perspective.",

This includes: the management of the anatomy, physiology and sexual behaviourof the young boar, that influences its performance as an adult. Normal reproductive activity in boars is coordinated by the endocrine and nervous system. Abnormal activity in one or more of these areas can result in reproductive problems. For the development of the sexual behaviour is important to considerer plays and social conditions of rearing of penmates. Play in animals is common in mammals, frequent in young and is not oriented to satisfy the immediate needs and carries appreciable costs in energy, time and even physical risk. Although, play contributes to the development of several functions that take place in the adult. Sexual behavior begin as early as 1 month of age in boars; mounting activity of penmates is observed more frequently for males than females. Some authors emphasized the importance of social conditions during rearing, due to the sexual activity showed in pubertal boars.",

      "title": "Reproductive Tactics of Male Savanna Baboons",
      "abstract": "Abstract The strongly related parameters rank, age and period-of-residence determine which reproductive tactics a savanna baboon male will use primarily. Baboon males go through the following phases with respect to the use of mating tactics, as they are longer in the group and thus grow older and, as a rule, drop in rank: Phase 1. Peripheral, relatively little social contact, low mating success, building up of a social bond with a few females. Phase 2. High mating success, based on individual fighting ability, social bonds mainly with females that are, or will soon be, sexually attractive. Phase 3, variant a. (Males that were very successful in Phase 2). Considerable time devoted to guarding infants conceived in phase 2 and to the mothers of those infants. Mating activity drops sharply compared to Phase 2. Phase 3, variant b. (Males that did not go through a very successful Phase 2). Low mating success through whatever tactic, relatively peripheral. Phase 4. Relatively high mating success, partly through collaboration with other males. Considerable time is invested in the care for potential offspring and their mothers. Phase 5. Diminishing share in the total mating activity in the group. The support for infants is spread over a relatively large class of infants conceived after immigration. Social contact with a large number of females. The data did not show the relation between agonistic rank and mating success predicted by ALTMANN'S priority-of-access model. A modification of the model is presented, which allows for coalition formation among males that are too low in rank to be successful on their own. This model could not fully explain, however, the exceptional success of some middle ranking males. The theory of Coalition games can give insight in the processes that lead to distributions of mating success that depart from the modified priority-of-acces model. The lack of agreement between the data and the original priority-of-access model cannot be explained by higher selectivity of the high ranking males. The only qualitative parameter of consorts obtained, according to which high ranking males had an advantage, is the time of the day on which mating activity takes place. This is a direct result of the way in which males obtain their consorts. Consorts are often formed in the sleeping trees during the night or in the early morning. In that situation single, strong males have an advantage in conflicts against coalitions of lower ranking males. Lower ranking males have a relative advantage later in the day, when conflicts are fought out on the ground.",

      "abstract": "Social hierarchies occur across human societies, as well as in non- human animals. Thus, humans and other social species must navigate these relationships. Human infants can detect when one individual outranks another by using cues of formidability: they expect individuals who are smaller or who have fewer allies to defer in zero-sum conflicts. But do children prefer or avoid high-ranking individuals? Some non-human animals avoid high-ranking individuals, presumably to avoid provoking potentially costly conflict, while others, including bonobos prefer them. In human society, relation- ships with high-status individuals can provide benefits such as re- sources, know-how and protection. The present studies investigated whether children ages 21-31 months prefer or avoid high-status individuals. In Exp 1.0, children watched a right of way conflict between two puppets in which one puppet ’won’ because the other deferred. 18/21 toddlers reached for the puppet that won. Exp. 2.0 started with the same type of standoff, but one puppet knocked the other pup- pet down in order ’win’. In this case, 18/22 toddlers instead reached for the puppet that got knocked over and lost. Four additional experiments controlled for alternative explanations for the main findings. Thus, very young children prefer novel individuals who prevail in zero-sum conflicts but only when their opponents defer–not when they win through force. These results suggest that humans, from a very early age not only recognize relative status. They also incorporate it in their decisions about whether to approach or avoid others in a nuanced way that differs from our nearest primate relatives.",

      "title": "Spousal Agreement on Sex Preferences for Children and Gender Gaps in Children's Education",
      "abstract": "Abstract Using data from 60 countries, we measure how much couples agree on sex preferences for children and whether differences in sex preferences are associated with gender gaps in children's education. Results show extensive disagreement in sex preferences for children, with husbands far more likely to want more sons but their wives more likely to prefer having equal numbers of boys and girls, wanting more daughters, or having no preference. India has the highest share of agreement on sex preferences (59 percent), and Niger has the lowest (32 percent). The association between couples’ sex preferences and gender gaps in education differs considerably by country. In some countries, girls have worse outcomes when their parents agree on son preference and better ones when parents agree on daughter/no preference. But there are numerous counter‐examples as well. Gender gaps in education appear more often when wives hold son preference but not their husbands than the reverse combination. Agreement on daughter/no preference is the only category that is systematically associated with better outcomes for girls relative to boys (although even here there are caveats). Balanced preference (wanting as many boys as girls) is an ambiguous category with heterogenous patterns in terms of educational gender gaps.",

      "abstract": "Using ethnographic and survey data on low-income families residing in Boston, Chicago, and San Antonio, we examine the relationship between women's patterns of union formation and their experience of physical and sexual abuse. Both sets of data suggest that women who have been physically or sexually abused are substantially less likely to be married or to be in stable, long-term cohabiting relationships. The data also suggest that the timing and different forms of abuse may have distinctive associations with union formation. Women who have experienced abuse beginning in childhood, particularly sexual abuse, are less likely to be in sustained marriages or stable cohabiting relationships and instead are more likely to experience transitory unions: multiple short-term, mostly cohabiting unions with brief intervals between them. Women who have not been abused in childhood but experience adult physical abuse, however, are less likely to be in either a marriage or a cohabiting union, long-term or transitory; and some have withdrawn from having relationships with men. The relevance of these findings for the decline of marriage among low-income women and men is discussed.",

      "abstract": "Recent studies suggest that body height has an effect on the intensity of jealousy among men and women. Since short men and both short and tall women are regarded as less attractive, they could be at greater risk of being cheated by their partners and therefore more jealous. Numerous studies have documented sex differences in jealousy about a partner’s sexual and emotional infidelity with a person of the opposite sex. However, the partner’s ex as a rival has been neglected in the literature. Therefore, in this study the relationships between height and jealousy about two types of infidelity among 112 heterosexual men and 314 women were investigated. Infidelity scenarios included two types of rival: new rival and partner’s ex. As expected on the basis of prior studies, men were more jealous of sexual infidelity and women of emotional infidelity. Both sexes reported greater jealousy over a new rival than over partner’s ex. Among men, there were no relationships between height and jealousy, while among women, significant linear and curvilinear relationships were found for sexual infidelity with an ex-girlfriend. Jealousy was lowest among tall women and highest among short and medium-height women. The results were interpreted within the framework of evolutionary psychology.",

Gender identity encompasses an individual's biological sex (genitalia), knowledge of membership in a gender category (core gender identity), felt compatibility with one gender group (gender compatibility), felt pressure for gender conformity (gender typing and gender roles), and sexual orientation (heterosexuality, homosexuality or bisexuality). The salient phases, characteristics, and determinants of gender identity development and the distinctions among the different constructs are presented. Gender identity represents a psychological achievement and covers a wide spectrum of gender‐fluid characteristics, whose determinants are scientifically known to be both biological (genetic and hormonal) and social cognitive (parenting, stereotyping, gender roles). Low gender compatibility and discontent with one's own gender are some of the possible factors associated with gender identity disorders and gender variance phenomena such as transsexualism.",

Rooted in our culture's longstanding ambivalence regarding leisure and its concerns about children's vulnerability, claims about troublesome toys also reflect anxiety about children's increased susceptibility to non‐familial influences, their growing access to toys, and an expanded toy industry, as well as an active social movement sector. Typically, these claims argue that toys represent undesirable values, and that children who play with the toys acquire those values. Parallel arguments may be found in claims regarding other forms of popular and material culture. Interactionists should be wary of making or accepting these claims, because rather than treating children's play as a topic (or empirical study, such claims locate meaning in objects, rather than actors.",

      "abstract": "World research has shown that adolescent and young adult women and girls have significantly \"poorer\" self-esteem than men and boys, on a variety of previously validated self-esteem measures. There is no consensus on reasons for this, and a variety of factors have been proposed: some adolescent girls have a preoccupation with facial and body features, and this leads to a global negative evaluation of self-characteristics; the measures themselves are biased towards describing self-characteristics on which men and boys are likely to evaluate themselves more favourably; and in an often-sexist world, women and girls experience (or anticipate) many structural disadvantages, in education, career and promotion, which lead girls to \"internalise\" an image of themselves as less able or worthy than men and boys. A separate literature on the sexual abuse and exploitation of children and adolescents has found that (a) sexual exploitation and maltreatment often has a sequel in impaired self-concept and self-esteem and (b) sexual maltreatment is twice as likely to occur in women and girls. It is puzzling that differential levels of child sexual abuse have not been advanced in many studies as an explanation of gender differences in self-esteem in the large-scale studies we review, although this effect is confirmed by clinical and social work literature.",

In dit proefschrift worden de effecten onderzocht van blootstelling aan merken die een hoge status of hoge aantrekkelijkheid uitstralen op de zelfperceptie en gedrag. Dit onderzoek is verricht vanuit een evolutionair perspectief. De centrale hypothese is dat mannen worden meer beinvloed worden door merken die een hoge status en een hoge competentie uitstralen. Vrouwen worden verwacht meer beinvloed te worden door merken die een hoge fysieke aantrekkelijkheid en een sterke verfijning uitstralen. De resultaten laten zien dat mannen die status consumptie belangrijk vinden, hun status lager waarderen na blootstelling aan een foto van een hoge status auto. Mannen rapporteren ook een lagere assertieve gedragsintentie, en laten lager status gedrag zien na blootstelling aan een man die een hoge merkcompetentie uitstraalt. Mannen blijven echter in dit geval wel een hogere sociale dominantie te rapporteren, terwijl ze dat niet laten zien. Vrouwen waarderen de eigen aantrekkelijk hoger na blootstelling aan foto´s die een hoge fysieke aantrekkelijkheid uitstralen, zeker wanneer zij het belangrijk vinden hun fysieke uiterlijk te vergelijken. Daarnaast rapporteren vrouwen een hogere assertieve gedragsintentie en laten zij meer hoge status gedrag zien na blootstelling aan een vrouw die hoge merkverfijning uitstraalt. De conclusie van dit proefschrift dan mannen zich in het algemeen meer laten intimideren door merken met een hoge status, terwijl vrouwen merken geassocieerd met een hoge aantrekkelijkheid zien als een bron van inspiratie.",

In this study, 71 heterosexual men were randomly assigned to one of two mate availability priming conditions, mate scarcity or mate abundance, and subsequently completed measures of sociosexuality as well as infidelity intentions. Results indicated that men in the mate abundance condition reported stronger sociosexual attitudes and desires, and among those currently in relationships, stronger infidelity intentions. These findings were contrasted with those from a separate sample of 66 heterosexual undergraduate women. Mate scarcity had no effects on women's sociosexuality or infidelity intentions. Findings suggest that when mates are scarce, men will adopt a sociosexual orientation aimed at maintaining a single partner.",

      "abstract": "Although bisexual men report lower levels of mental health relative to gay men, few studies have examined the factors that contribute to bisexual men's mental health. Bisexual men are less likely to disclose, and more likely to conceal (i.e., a desire to hide), their sexual orientation than gay men. Theory suggests that this may adversely impact their mental health. This report examined the factors associated with disclosure and with concealment of sexual orientation, the association of disclosure and concealment with mental health, and the potential mediators (i.e., internalized homophobia, social support) of this association with mental health.An ethnically diverse sample of 203 non-gay-identified, behaviorally bisexual men who do not disclose their same-sex behavior to their female partners were recruited in New York City to complete a single set of self-report measures.Concealment was associated with higher income, a heterosexual identification, living with a wife or girlfriend, more frequent sex with women, and less frequent sex with men. Greater concealment, but not disclosure to friends and family, was significantly associated with lower levels of mental health. Multiple mediation analyses revealed that both internalized homophobia and general emotional support significantly mediated the association between concealment and mental health.The findings demonstrate that concealment and disclosure are independent constructs among bisexual men. Further, they suggest that interventions addressing concerns about concealment, emotional support, and internalized homophobia may be more beneficial for increasing the mental health of bisexual men than those focused on promoting disclosure.",

      "title": "Permissiveness, Permission, and Aggression: The Effect of Adult Presence or Absence on Aggression in Children's Play",
      "abstract": "It has become conventional to think of an adult's permissiveness toward a child as representing neutralization of adult control. By behaving permissively (acceptantly, nonjudgmentally, etc.), the adult is thought to be freeing the child from his presence and authority, and in some loose sense to be permitting the child to behave as he would in the absence of any adult. Such thinking has emphasized the punitive or threatening aspects of adultchild relations. Adult permissiveness is seen as a way of reducing the child's fear of adult punishment and thus as a way of encouraging him to express in behavior those impulses whose expression he knows to be normally unacceptable to adults. Such thinking about permissiveness has been the basis for explanations which have been advanced for a frequent finding about aggression in doll play. It has repeatedly been observed that aggression in doll play increases over time or from session to session (i, 2, 5, 6, 8, 9). This finding has typically been explained by reference to the adult experimenter's acceptant and nonjudgmental interaction with the child and the fear-reducing effect this interaction has. For example, in discussing recent evidence confirming the finding, Levin and Sears state that",

Findings show that women are more willing to move for their partner’s career. Childless women are more likely to move with their partners to pursue their own work or education than childless men, whereas mothers are less likely to report this than fathers. Gender ideology and division of household responsibilities do not explain the gender differences in migration behavior. They are more important for individuals’ willingness to move for their partners, with particularly pronounced gender differences among nonegalitarian respondents.",

UK adults (N = 354) completed an online mixed-methods survey on sexual consent during sober, alcohol- and/or drug-involved sex. Qualitative data were analyzed using thematic analysis. Themes for capacity to consent were: (1) \"There is no normative understanding of substance-involved sexual consent,\" (2) \"Moving beyond the binary of consciousness versus incapacitation\" and (3) \"Substance-involved sexual decisions are viewed as irresponsible.\" The findings illustrated that capacity to consent is nuanced and multidimensional, and that people's understandings and experiences of capacity to consent to substance-involved sex are not solely individual, but rather, they are also shaped by their environment. We call for a multidimensional view of capacity to consent, where a standard of \"unimpaired,\" rather than sober, is used and modeled by academics, legislators, and educators.",

Pourtant, un certain nombre d’etudes suggere que des schemas plus complexes puissent etre en jeu : choix mutuel, facilitation sociale ou des femelles choisissent le meme mâle. On en sait peu sur la facon dont le reseau social pre-reproduction pourrait influencer ces preferences et en particulier sur l’impact des relations entre femelles a cette periode sur ces phenomenes de choix communs de reproduction. Dans la presente etude, nous avons teste l’hypothese que le reseau social pre-reproduction influence les chois ulterieurs de reproduction chez l’etourneau sansonnet. Cette espece presente les caracteristiques interessantes de preferences sociales marquees entre femelles hors reproduction et d’une polygynie facultative. Le suivi des preferences puis du choix de partenaire dans des contextes naturalistes (volieres) a permis de montrer 1) que les femelles associees socialement tendent a choisir des partenaires et sites communs, 2) que les mâles montrent des preferences marquees pour certaines femelles, 3) que les femelles moins «sociables » ont moins de chance de se reproduire par rejet des autres femelles et non interet des mâles. Les affinites entre femelles permettent y compris une polygynie « pacifique », d’ou la reduction des couts potentiels lies aux conflits. Ces resultats concordent avec des observations de terrain, rendant compte de femelles partageant partenaires et sites sans agressivite, et expliquent l’agression au contraire observee dans des situations experimentales ou des femelles etrangeres sont mises en presence d’un meme mâle.",

Whereas variations in parental attitudes and behaviors are often hypothesized as critical antecedents, experimenters seem to be regarded as generalized adult figures, impersonal behavior initiators, and data recording machines. If the child is indeed responsive to such qualities in his parents as warmth, permissiveness or restriction, sex roles, etc., then he should build up certain expectations and anticipatory sets associated with the occurrence of such qualities in other significant adults. Yet studies designed to manipulate child behavior have generally failed to consider or control for relevant experimenter characteristics. Some attention has been directed to the presence or absence of adults as a factor affecting child behavior (14), but the effects of E attributes or behaviors have been largely neglected. One of the more obvious, readily defined E attributes that might be considered to influence a child's responses is sex status. Interactions with male versus female experimenters may be expected to involve some differences in response sets of the experimental children. A few recent studies have varied sex of E as part of the experimental design. Gewirtz and his colleagues (6) in two studies of attention seeking with variation of adult",

In many cases sexual communication is improved because of contraception; in many cases it has a negative influence, caused mainly by the mental immaturity of the partners, by their emotional instability, or by their sociocultural background. Negative sexual side effects of contraception are usually caused, in the woman, by a conflict with the traditional image of the woman as mother, and by an unconscious desire of fertility; in the man they are usually caused by the long-accepted identification of sexual potency with reproductive ability, and by fears for the newly acquired freedom of the female partner. Positive or negative psychological effects of contraception vary, but not greatly, according to the method used. A sympathetic and experienced doctor can furnish good advice on the matter.",

According to the result of the survey, the problem seemed to lie in the gap between men and women; men want sexual intercourse with women, while many women are satisfied with emotional affection. Discontinuance of intercourse is mainly caused by the loss of women's interest in sex. The responses to 'What kind of sexual relationship do you want to have with your spouse?' and other questions showed that whether women want to have sexual intercourse or not is not simply caused by a physical problem such as decrease of sexual desire or pain during intercourse, but is affected by various factors such as the affection to the spouse, physical and mental satisfaction by intercourse and a different way of thinking about sex. Also the survey showed even though both men and women wanted to have a 'casual conversation' or 'showing affection daily', in actual life they lacked having conversations and had little physical contact except for sex. For aging couples to keep matured sexual relations, it is more desirable to build the couples' relationship with casual conversation and physical contact, and also enjoy slow sex, such as pillow talk or caressing one another and not focusing on sex only.",

Because women generally carry responsibilities both at home (unpaid labour) and in the outside world of employment (paidwork), time for leisure is often lacking.

A tennis-playing woman is deemed 'wrongly' at leisure, benefiting from a class status that allows her husband to maintain her, while a resting woman may be seen as lazy, neglecting her children, or unmindful of her household responsibilities. As for sport, whatever women's sports participation and sporting prowess, because it is imbued with notions of muscularity, muscle strength, bulk, speed, sweat, robust 'combat' and relentless competition, traditionally sport has been viewed as a male realm.",

      "abstract": "Prairie voles are a monogamous species and males show paternal behavior. After mating, paternal responsiveness increases gradually during the gestation period, peaking before young are born. We examined the importance of cohabitation with a female and the time course for a gradual intensification of paternal care. Males housed with their brothers since weaning were separated. Each male was housed alone, with a strange female, or with a brother. A male housed with a female remained with her either until mating occurred or throughout gestation. Males in each group were tested for paternal behavior 3 times, in early, mid and late gestation periods. Males that were housed alone attacked the young more than those housed with another vole. A male exposed to a female, whether he had mated or not, engaged in more parenting than a male exposed to a brother. A male that remained with his mate during the gestation period was more parental than an isolated male that was housed alone. Contact with another vole reduces infanticidal tendencies; brief physical contact with a female, with or without mating, intensifies paternal responsiveness; and further cohabitation is not essential.",

      "abstract": "Emerging adulthood is a developmental period characterized by the exploration, shaping, and negotiation of many aspects of identity, including religiousness and spirituality, sexual orientation, and gender identity. Such aspects of one’s identity have implications for psychological and sexual well-being. Previous research has indicated that religiousness/spirituality, sexual orientation, and gender identity may have implications for sexual well-being and sexual distress. However, the intersectional relationships between these aspects of identity and sexual distress among emerging adults have yet to be investigated. Accordingly, the current study examined the role of religiousness/spirituality, sexual orientation, and gender identity in predicting sexual distress in emerging adults. A sample of 266 adults aged 18–30 years old completed an online survey assessing sexual distress, various dimensions of religiousness/spirituality, sexual orientation, and gender identity. Multiple hierarchical regression analysis indicated that minority sexual orientation and four dimensions of religiousness/spirituality (daily spiritual experiences, forgiveness, religious and spiritual coping, and religious support) significantly predicted greater sexual distress. These results indicate that sexual distress is minimally influenced by sexual orientation, thus suggesting that specific aspects of religiousness/spirituality may be important for buffering against sexual distress among emerging adults.",

      "abstract": "Conventional sex education that focuses mainly on the biology of the reproductive system, the use of contraception, and the negative outcomes of sexual behaviour – such as acquiring sexually transmitted infections – is extensively used in Austrian schools. However, topics such as sexual pleasure, sexual orientation, consent and emotional well-being, or the impact of online media on mental health are briefly if not at all included, thereby inadvertently distancing young people from the emotions involved in their developing sexuality. Applying emotional literacy in sexuality education can contribute to addressing rather than occluding young people’s emergent sexual and social identities, enabling individuals to more effectively understand and manage their emotions and develop empathy for themselves and others. However, reiterating conventional practices in sex education reinforces the values that heterosexuality and heterosexual behaviour are the norm, that sexual practices have an implicit risk involved, and that non-heterosexual sexualities are unimportant in sex education, or are at best ‘tolerated’. Consequently the dominant nature of heteronormative gender associations in the education system makes alternative sexual relations and practices marginalised, stigmatised or persecuted. It is crucial for sex educators, school and public health policy makers to realise that supporting the development of children’s emotional literacy in sexuality and its social context is key to building their sexual identity, nurturing respectful and ethical relationships early and to fostering their health and well-being throughout their lives. Moreover, enabling young people to participate in implementing comprehensive sexuality education would make their lessons more realistic and effective.",

Despite the prevalence of this view, there is limited evidence to support it. The present study sought to empirically assess the merit of this view. A total of 119 college students responded to seven situations involving a distressed other. Although women's responses were longer and contained more talk about emotions, women also talked more about instrumental actions than did men. Men devoted a greater proportion of their responses to talk about the problem and a larger proportion of their problem talk involved denying the problem. However, there were substantial similarities between men and women in the relative frequencies of different types of supportive responses used, and sex differences accounted for small percentages of variance. In contrast, situation exerted a strong, consistent influence on the responses of men and women alike.",

By high school, most young people are making many decisions on their own: who their friends are, what cars they want to drive, how they will spend their Friday nights, where they will work, where they will go to college. Each of these decisions is, of course, shaped by outside forces such as school, family, and peer groups. However, perhaps the most difficult of these decisions are made with some of the least discussion, and are met with the most severe consequences. These are the decisions of body, sexuality, and sex. Most teenagers are faced with making sexual decisions in a vortex of misinformation, excitement, stigma, and fear. Society frowns upon teen sexuality, often meeting sexual discussion with avoidance or condemnation. Teens are not supposed to talk about sex; or if they talk about it, they are not supposed to have it; but if they have it, they are not supposed to do it outside of socially and morally acceptable standards. At a fundamental level, we as a society do not provide teens with complete information about sex and their bodies. We expect them to make choices without the necessary information, and the choices they make are often punished, in a framework of legal, social, and familial responsibility.",

      "abstract": "Ageism refers to discrimination and prejudice based on age-related stereotypes. Forms of prejudice such as sexism and racism have been investigated in relation to morality; however, little extant research has considered ageism and moral identity. The purpose of this study was to investigate, among younger adults, whether moral identity symbolization – that is, the desire to appear moral to others (i.e., public morality) – and/or moral identity internalization – that is, wanting to be more moral (i.e., private morality) – was associated with ageism among younger adults. College students, ages 18–29 (N = 688, 75.00% female) enrolled in a psychology course at a large public university in the southern U.S. completed a survey which included the Self-Importance of Moral Identity Scale and Fabroni Scale of Ageism. Men had higher levels of ageism than women. Moral identity symbolization was not associated with ageism; however, moral identity internalization was associated with lower ageism. Results regarding gender are consistent with previous studies finding greater intolerance among men. Among younger adults, moral identity symbolization may not be related to ageism since attitudes about older adults are not germane to public morality the way racism or sexism are. Younger adults who internalize their moral identity – that is, they wish to be a more moral person – may engage in less stereotyping and prejudice towards older adults.",

At present, empirical support favors the premise that solitude, when expressed in social contexts, is a risk factor for peer adversity. It remains unclear, however, whether this risk applies equally for solitary-anxious versus unsociable children, or varies by type of adversity (i.e., peer rejection, exclusion, victimization). Less well examined is the premise that that negative peer experiences precipitate or exacerbate social withdrawal and solitude. Available evidence implies that peer adversities maintain or exacerbate rather than instigate children's solitary propensities. Theoretical and empirical innovations are considered as a means of further illuminating the interplay between solitude and peer adversities within and across developmental epochs.",

Compared to the U.S. adult population, respondents were younger, more highly educated, and less likely to be non-Hispanic White, but differences were observed between gender and sexual orientation groups on all of these variables. Overall, respondents tended to be politically liberal, not highly religious, and supportive of marriage equality for same-sex couples. Women were more likely than men to be in a committed relationship. Virtually all coupled gay men and lesbians had a same-sex partner, whereas the vast majority of coupled bisexuals were in a heterosexual relationship. Compared to bisexuals, gay men and lesbians reported stronger commitment to a sexual minority identity, greater community identification and involvement, and more extensive disclosure of their sexual orientation to others. Most respondents reported experiencing little or no choice about their sexual orientation. The importance of distinguishing among lesbians, gay men, bisexual women, and bisexual men in behavioral and social research is discussed.",

Here, I review new studies that have contributed to the understanding of these associations and outline potential avenues for further research. Findings show that extraversion is the most important personality trait in sexual behavior (number of lifetime sexual partners, involvement in casual sex, marital infidelity, condom use, male and female sexual dysfunction, sexual coercion, and sexual harassment) and that neuroticism, agreeableness, and conscientiousness are also associated with these outcomes. Extraversion has emerged as the most important personality trait for fertility in men but appears relatively unimportant for fertility in women. Findings for other personality traits are somewhat mixed, probably because of variations in research design, and further prospective studies are recommended to address potential bidirectional associations. Further research is also needed in adolescent samples, in understudied topic areas (e.g., sexually transmitted infections, biomarkers of fertility), and on personality similarity between sexual partners in samples from both poor and developed nations.",

Sociosexuality occurs in primates (prosimians, monkeys, and apes) in many forms including urinary marking, facial expressions, vocalizations, grooming, playing, mounting, and anogenital sniffing, touching, inspecting, and rubbing. Sociosexual behavior takes place between individuals of various combinations of ages and sexes. In some species such as bonobos, sociosexual activity starts in infancy and can occur as many as 30 times a day, while in other species like chimpanzees, it starts later in life and is less frequent. Sociosexual behavior can take the form of sexual competition—competition between members of the same sex for a mate in the form of fighting or even blocking ovulation in less‐dominant individuals. Sociosexuality is interpreted as strengthening relationships, acts of dominance, reparation after fights, and reducing tension. Most data on nonhuman primate sociosexuality indicate that behaviors occurring outside of reproduction may increase future matings and/or reproductive success.",

From data derived from the longitudinal Sydney Men and Sexual Health (SMASH) cohort, more than 40% of the men in regular relationships employed one of the strategies that would, under the conditions described in the definition above, constitute negotiated safety. Negotiated safety has been adopted by a significant number of men and, although it is axiomatic that it is not unconditionally safe, negotiated safety is a reasonable and a safe strategy when honesty and trust is part of the sexual interaction.

This can make a course rewarding, because class participation and engagement is often not an issue, but it also makes a course problematic because students can prioritize previously held beliefs over the content and theory they study in the course. There are two main approaches to teaching diversity courses in the social sciences: (1) data-driven teaching, which prioritizes presenting evidence and data about racial and ethnic disparities to 'prove' to students that discrimination exists, persists and is widespread or that a particular historical perspective is most accurate, and (2) theory-driven teaching, which prioritizes efforts to understand the role and function that discrimination and social construction plays in societies, by examining concepts such as race, class, and sex, and teaching students to challenge their discriminatory beliefs and attitudes and/or their hegemonic views about particular historical events.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Unwed pregnancy in young women was conceptualized as a motivated goal interactively determined by both personality and situational factors. The primary behavioral correlate indicat_-e of this predisposition is inadequate use of readily available birth control techniques (D.C.) for the sexually active female. In addition, sex frequency and the situational variable of degree of stability of the sexual relationship were also expected to be related to the_motivation for motherhood. If this model is appropriate, then significant interactive differences should be found in fantasies about having children as a function of these variables, with stronger motivation (more fantasy) expected in inadequate B.C. users, involved in higher sex frequency, in more stable relationships. In addition to the obvious fantasy effects, it was expected that motivational differences of the same sort would also be reflected by measures of sex role style and gender identification on a more unconscious level. Subjects were 129 sexually active unmarried college women. The evidence is supportive of the hypothesis that unwed pregnancy is a motivated event rather than simple bad luck. Conclusions also concern themselves with the possibility that situational events (stability of relationships) may change personality structure. (Author)",

      "abstract": "Abstract Heterosexual men report less distress at infidelity from female interlopers than male interlopers. In addition to presenting no risk of cuckoldry, men could also perceive these women as additional sexual opportunities if they assume mutual interest from the female interloper. The current study considered this possibility by experimentally manipulating the sex role assumption of a female interloper (either masculine or feminine presentation) for expected sexual interest in men. Heterosexual men reacted to infidelity from hypothetical long‐term romantic partners in two experiments. The extrapair mate was another man, a feminine woman, or a masculine‐presenting woman. Although infidelity elicited an overall negative reaction, men reported less distress when the extradyadic partner was female. The feminine woman was additionally regarded as affording the most sexual opportunity. Effects were particularly amplified when this information included images of the extradyadic partner. Studies provide evidence for complementary hypotheses based on intrasexual conflict and intersexual opportunities.",

      "abstract": "Male homosexuality can be understood as an expression of the\r\ngender of the self. Three aspects of the self are proposed in a\r\nhypothetical model of the homosexual male and compared to the\r\nheterosexual male and female. One aspect is subjectivity and\r\nthis study hypothesizes that the subjective experience of the\r\ngender of the self is associated with homosexuality and\r\nheterosexuality. The remaining two aspects are both\r\nobjectivities. It is hypothesized that sexual preference is the\r\nobjective expression of the gender of the subjective self. It is\r\nhypothesized that sexual preference is not related to biological sex (sexual identity).\r\nThe two objective attitudes are defined as the extremities of\r\na continuum of spontaneity: from involved objectivity to\r\ndetached objectivity. This difference in spontaneity within a\r\nhomosexual group describes the differential development of\r\nhomosexual identification: from a developed homosexual role to\r\nan under-developed or absent homosexual role. The absence or\r\ndevelopment of the homosexual role are differences in\r\nspontaneity and these differences are associated with measures\r\nof psycho- and socio-pathology.\r\nTraditionally, homosexuality has been understood to be an\r\noutcome of a different sexuality. This study shows that \r\n\r\nsexuality is not related to homosexuality as a subjective\r\nexpression of self. Sexual preference is, however, the objective\r\nexpression of that subjectivity.\r\nSex and gender are confounded in the literature. The\r\nconfusion of the sex and gender literature, and the perplexity\r\nof the homosexuality literature, is partially resolved by the\r\nseparation of two distinct but inter-related frames\r\nreference. These are the sociological and the psychological\r\nframes of reference.\r\nThe results strongly support the conclusion that\r\nhomosexuality is related to the subjective experience of the\r\nself and that homosexuality is an objective expression of that\r\nsubjectivity as a sexual preference. Homosexuality is not\r\nsynonymous with sexual preference or homosexual role, it also\r\nincludes the psychological precursor of the subjective\r\nexperience of gender, that is, gender identity.\r\nThere is empirical support for a proposed persons-grammar\r\ntheory of personality that uses a psychological frame of\r\nreference. Overall the results support this theoretical\r\ndevelopment and models of homosexuality, anxiety, and psychosis\r\nutilizing this theoretical framework.",

Do children possess the sort of meta-theory of acting that adults possess? In two studies we find that, unlike adults, children between the ages of 3–5 do not think that a realistic actor is better at portraying a characteristic than a nonrealistic actor, nor do they prefer one to the other. As they develop, they come to understand that realistic acting is different from nonrealistic acting, but unlike adults, children think that a nonrealistic, pretense-like portrayal is more difficult to achieve than a realistic representation of an emotional or physical state. These findings show that children's metarepresentational understanding of acting is relatively immature at age 5, and that their understanding of this specific domain of pretense lags behind their understanding of pretense in general.",

From the total NKPS-sample 12,1 per cent did not feel (entirely) accepted by their family. Theoretical assumptions were that people may not feel accepted by their family because they are ‘difficult’, e.g. by exhibiting personal problems; another reason might be that they are ‘different’, for instance because they have made non-traditional life course transitions or differ from their parents in educational level or religious preference. Both quantitative and qualitative results confirm the first assumption rather than the second. Qualitative results revealed a gender difference in the mechanisms involved in a lack of acceptance by one’s family.",

      "abstract": "Abstract In decisions between equal and unequal resource distributions, women are often believed to be more prosocial than men. Previous research showed that fairness attitudes develop in childhood, but their – possibly gendered, developmental trajectory remains unclear. We hypothesized that gendered fairness attitudes might depend not only on the sex of the actor, but also on that of the interaction partner. To examine this, we tested 332 three to eight-year-old children in a paired resource allocation task, with both boys and girls acting as allocators and recipients. We found sex effects that gradually emerged during childhood: girls more than boys aimed to reduce advantageous inequality, and allocators of both sexes were more averse against male recipients being better off. Notably, girls exhibited an envy bias, i.e., they tolerated less when the resource allocation was in favour of boys than if it favoured other girls. We also observed a sex spite gap: unlike girls, even the oldest boys treated other boys with spite, i.e., they valued unfair distributions in their own favour over equal outcome alternatives. This pattern hints at contextualized gendered fairness preferences that evolve with age and are, next to other factors, possibly sharpened by same- and cross-sex past interaction experiences.",

In the current study, we sought to understand the role sexual attitudes have on sexual well-being among middle-aged and young-old adults. Using a diverse sample of participants over the age of 45 ( N = 384), a path model was analyzed to determine whether sexual attitudes contributed to sexual well-being. The model was then compared by gender. Results indicated: a) only age-relative sexual attitudes significantly contributed to sexual well-being; and b) the model was equally robust for both men and women, even though women held slightly more positive age-relative sexual attitudes than men. Therefore, among middle-aged and young-old adults, sexual well-being may be reduced by harboring negative ageist sexual attitudes. Efforts should be made to reduce stigma surrounding continued sexual activity and expression among the aged.",

However, psychologists have less knowledge about such people's everyday pursuits. In the present study, the authors examined authoritarian interest in film, live events, music, and reading. A predictable pattern of correlates emerged. For example, authoritarians enjoyed activities in which physical conflict was prominent, whereas authoritarians tended not to like entertainment that offered introspection. In general, the present results were consistent across 2 samples (N = 120, N = 90). Although men and women had significantly different preferences on over 0.5 of the leisure pursuits (e.g., men enjoyed action films more than did women), there were no significant gender differences in the magnitudes of correlates with authoritarianism. In general, leisure interests appeared to be partly manifestations or expressions of authoritarian tendencies.",

Such practice is contrary to recommendations in the 2006 Consensus Statement on Management of Intersex Disorders. When psychological preparation is lacking for aspects of DSD such as uncertainty about future gender identity, a false sense of urgency can propel parents to agree to genital surgery or removal of gonads without adequate understanding of the long-term consequences in adulthood. If physicians are uncomfortable discussing gender and sexual issues, they may not explore the feasibility of, or offer support for, alternative approaches towards sex atypicality. Families may draw unrealistic conclusions regarding the extent to which such interventions will relieve their distress and improve quality of life for the child and family. Failing to offer adequate psychosocial support to parents making irreversible decisions about DSD can raise significant ethical and legal concerns. Families may experience regret and anger when they make decisions on the basis of limited or even biased information while in an emotionally vulnerable state. Children's autonomy is violated when they are completely excluded from decision-making. We propose adoption of a holistic approach to emotionally and cognitively informed consent in this setting, with inclusion of psychosocial and peer support from the earliest stages.",

Cross-culturally, both sexes desire playful long-term mates and playfulness predicts relationship quality. It is yet to be tested, however, if playfulness is associated with number of long-term and short-term relationships. We hypothesized that specific playfulness dimensions would correlate with the number of lifetime short- and long-term relationships. Specifically, we expected that Lighthearted playfulness would be associated with more short-term relationships, while Other-directed playfulness would be associated with the number of long-term relationships. In total, 1191 Brazilian adults (mean age=28.7 years, SD=10.2) responded to online sociodemographic questions and playfulness inventory (OLIW). Other-directed playfulness positively predicted the number of short-term and long-term partners in men and the same was true for Whimsical playfulness in women. This suggests that playfulness is used by both sexes to compete for access to more and better mates, but in slightly different ways. For the first time, we show that playful adults have more partners and that playfulness can be used as a part of mating strategies.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Gender dysphoric individuals typically recount histories of prolonged conflict between their bodies and their minds to the effect that they believe they are born into the wrong body. Also, typically, they tell of an early onset of dislike and avoidance of activities appropriate to their genetic sex and affinity with and practice of behavior patterns appropriate for their preferred sex. The conviction that they are bom into the wrong sex and better suited to the opposite sex arises from day to day events of living: a so-called living test. Once accepted into a program of counseling leading to sex reassignment surgery, the individual is required to live in the manner of the opposite sex, e.g., a male believing he is a female is required to live as a woman for a year to two years. This is called the real-life test. The present paper describes the self-test and self-testing experience of many transsexuals wherein they, on their own, undergo circumstances that challenge their conviction: “I really am a male,” or “I really am a female.” Thus, a transsexual undergoes two or three types of sequential testing in establishing a final sexual identity.",

      "abstract": "People with cognitive disabilities are commonly positioned as risky sexual subjects. This article discusses the discursive production of sexual normates in the form of desirable and normative able-minded sexual subjects, in scientific research on the sexuality and cognitive disabilities of younger and older individuals (in particular those with dementia). We identify three interrelated discourses: regulating sexuality; fostering sexuality; and preserving sexuality. The first of these, regulation, pathologises sexuality of people with cognitive disabilities as faulty and in need of restriction. The second discourse, fostering, is more affirmative and argues for educating for a 'healthy' sexuality of people with cognitive disabilities, to mitigate risks of abuse. This discourse is more salient with younger people. The third discourse, preservation, in contrast, is more visible with older people with dementia and affirms sexuality so long as it is consistent with a 'genuine' or 'authentic' sexuality of the past. In conclusion, scientific research reinforces the cultural ideal of the rational and autonomous individual (and as such the mature/adult) capable of making independent decisions and engaging in healthy, good sex, based on stable sexual identities. Findings demonstrate how age intersects with cognitive ableism to intensify the cultural anxiety that exists around the sexualities of people with cognitive disabilities.",

A temperature that is comfortable to men is as a rule too cool for women, and one that is acceptable to women is too warm for men. As a result buildings are usually overheated in winter for the sake of women and overcooled in summer to suit the men. Constitutional differences between men and women as well as differences in kind and amount of clothing worn are believed to be responsible for the double comfort standard, but according to the present study clothing differences appear to play a major role.

      "abstract": "Abstract In many sexually dimorphic and polygynous species, individuals exhibit social segregation by grouping with others of their own sex. Several proximate mechanisms have been proposed to explain social segregation: female avoidance of males, male avoidance of females, avoidance of harassment, male social affinity, female social affinity and activity budget asynchrony. Some of these have been tested in ungulate species, but few previous studies have been able to rigorously test, or distinguish between, these mechanisms because they have failed to examine the fission/fusion dynamics of groups. We tested these proximate mechanisms simultaneously in western grey kangaroos Macropus fuliginosus , by examining whether females, small males or large males instigated segregation by leaving mixed‐sex groups or joining individuals of their own sex or size class. Females, small males and large males left mixed‐sex groups as if leaving were independent of sex–size class. In contrast, large males joined male‐only groups more frequently than expected. These results suggest that the need for males to maintain contact with other males can contribute to the cohesion of male‐only groups and promote segregation. As male–male competition occurs in many polygynous species that sexually segregate, a comparable mechanism might be operating in other taxa, and should be examined further.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Variation in female mating performance can affect the direction and rate of evolution through sexual selection. The social environment determines the availability of mates and the competitive situation, and hence can influence mating strategies. However, these effects have to be considered within time constraints. Here we show that female sand gobies exposed to same-sex competitors (female-biased adult sex ratio, ASR) for a week before having physical access to males (i.e., a delayed male access; referred as prior exposure treatment) were more actively associated with the preferred male and took faster spawning decisions. However, these females mated more frequently with males with traits that did not ensure high egg survival. On the other extreme, females exposed to low same sex competition (male-biased ASR) simultaneously to the mate choice (i.e., an immediate access to males; referred as simultaneous exposure treatment) took more time to make their spawning decision. They also associated and spawned more often with males with good parental skills (i.e., males exhibiting more egg fanning behaviour). These male traits are associated with higher survival and better development of eggs. Our results provide experimental support for a trade-off between mate choice accuracy and speed, which depended on mating competition.",

      "abstract": "Sports practice is a way to be physically active. Despite public health efforts to support it, teenagers' sport participation is declining in some European countries. One reason for the decline is drop-out from sports practice. Various analytical frameworks have been applied to this issue but little is known about how teenagers understand their own pathway in the social context, ending with a drop-out from sports practice. This study aimed to identify reasons given by teenagers about sports practice drop-out situated within the circles of their everyday lives, through 100 semi-structured interviews. The results made it possible to classify the reasons for dropping out into five themes: friendship, body, family, school, and sport. Two processes lead to drop-out: constraints which prevent access to the circle of sports practice and/or a decision-making that brings them out of it. The respondents could mention one or multiple reasons, accumulating (snowball effect) or following one another (cascade effect). Depending on the moment of drop-out, some circles of social life played a preponderant role. The family seemed to be central in the decision to drop out during primary school, whereas sport itself and school were influential in middle and high schools respectively. The results showed that the more recent the drop-out, the more the teenagers planned to resume sports practice. These data are relevant for health education policies to prevent physical inactivity through sport. It is important not only to remove the constraints that prevent access to the circle of sports practice, but also to promote the most pleasurable sports experiences.",

      "abstract": "The aesthetic preferences of potential mates have driven the evolution of a baffling diversity of elaborate ornaments. Which fitness benefit—if any—choosers gain from expressing such preferences is controversial, however. Here, we simulate the evolution of preferences for multiple ornament types (e.g., “Fisherian,” “handicap,” and “indicator” ornaments) that differ in their associations with genes for attractiveness and other components of fitness. We model the costs of preference expression in a biologically plausible way, which decouples costly mate search from cost-free preferences. Ornaments of all types evolved in our model, but their occurrence was far from random. Females typically preferred ornaments that carried information about a male’s quality, defined here as his ability to acquire and metabolize resources. Highly salient ornaments, which key into preexisting perceptual biases, were also more likely to evolve. When males expressed quality-dependent ornaments, females invested readily in costly mate search to locate preferred males. In contrast, the genetic benefits associated with purely arbitrary ornaments were insufficient to sustain highly costly mate search. Arbitrary ornaments could nonetheless “piggyback” on mate-search effort favored by other, quality-dependent ornaments. We further show that the potential to produce attractive male offspring (“sexy sons”) can be as important as producing offspring of high general quality (“good genes”) in shaping female preferences, even when preferred ornaments are quality dependent. Our model highlights the importance of mate-search effort as a driver of aesthetic coevolution.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Gender‐based language is a product of a male–female dynamic that enhances the significance of a gender salience prototype—which usually includes a dimension of assertiveness and/or affiliation—that delineates what communicative behavior is expected for men and women. Early research focused on differences between men and women with less attention on the contextual nuances of gender‐based language. This focus resulted in a muddled understanding of when and why men and women use language differently and similarly. Contemporary research has prioritized understanding the diverse range of possible outcomes for male/female language use patterns (e.g., no differences, traditional differences, counter‐stereotypical differences) given contextual variations with a focus on gender salience and its prototype. This move has resulted in more success in predicting whether men and women will communicate differently and why the differences occur. Contemporary theorizing posits that a language difference between men and women is only a gender‐based difference if a psychological component draws on gender during language production; otherwise, it is a sex difference that has little to do with gender.",

This sex difference has been explained in terms of evolved psychological mechanisms or culturally transmitted social norms. We investigated whether sex differences in sensation-seeking have changed over recent years by conducting a meta-analysis of studies using Zuckerman's Sensation Seeking Scale, version V (SSS-V). We found that sex differences in total SSS-V scores have remained stable across years, as have sex differences in Disinhibition and Boredom Susceptibility. In contrast, the sex difference in Thrill and Adventure Seeking has declined, possibly due to changes in social norms or out-dated questions on this sub-scale. Our results support the view that men and women differ in their propensity to report sensation-seeking characteristics, while behavioural manifestations of sensation-seeking vary over time. Sex differences in sensation-seeking could reflect genetically influenced predispositions interacting with socially transmitted information.",

This apparent gender equality is investigated further: do young teens also profess equal ambitions of becoming professional athletes? Drawing on 81 interviews with 12- and 13-year-olds, the study suggest that the boys and girls make similar investments in sports, but there are clear gender differences in the ways they describe their future ambitions. The majority of the boys talk about wanting to become professional athletes and going 'all in', but very few of the girls do – the ambitious girls rather talk about skills development. The paper argues that cultural narratives thus shape young people's self-understanding and ambitions, both boys and girls may suffer consequences of this: in a sports-internal logic, the girls may be given limited practical possibilities, resources and support – but boys may risk regret, disappointment and wasting time and resources.",

In this study 50 upper-middle-class girls, 15 to 18 years old, were ranked by 200 classmates of each sex on various traits reputed to be social prerogatives (leadership, popularity, winning disputes, and possessing a positive self-concept) or bodily expressions (standing erect, being relaxed, and maintaining eye contact) of dominance status. Girls who exhibited these signs of dominance were perceived as fashionable, attractive, and well groomed. Athletic ability showed some relation to dominance but intelligence did not. Factor analyses confirmed this intelligence and dominance emerged as separate factors in each sex's perception of the girls. These results suggest that adolescent girls, like boys, compete for dominance in the ethological sense. Boys seem to strive for social success mainly through competence in athletics, and girls though cultivating an attractive appearance.",

LGBT strengths (e.g., resiliency derived from LGBT identity) may reduce the impact of social marginalization. However, it is unclear how LGBT strengths are impacted by SMs' other identities (e.g., racial/ethnic and/or gender). To address this knowledge gap, the present study examined data from the LGBT Stress/Strength project, a qualitative research study investigating minority stress and LGBT strengths in relation to drinking. Participants (N = 22) were self-identified SMs in the northeastern U.S. Transcripts from in-depth interviews were coded using thematic analysis. Participants reported social support from other SMs and empathy toward others were forms of LGBT strength. Sampled SMs assigned female at birth had more intergenerational friendships and relied more on social support than those assigned male at birth. In addition, Black, indigenous, and people of color (BIPOC) participants described social marginalization from within the LGBT community, which reduced their reliance on social support. Our results suggest that LGBT strengths are influenced by LGBT community members intersecting identities. More research can expand upon these results by investigating how the confluence of SMs identities and LGBT strengths impact health disparities.",

      "abstract": "misconduct could place a strain on family ties, but if so, the effect is not great enough to give clear statistical signs. If differences between future repeaters and confirmed repeaters are an indication of change, however, there is a shift in the way the boy is treated by the schools and the police. His grades apparently drop as he is more visibly delinquent, and he is likely to be shunted into special schools for behavior problem children. As a consequence he tends to be increasingly discontented with school. Also, the police apparently are more inclined to be suspicious of him. Both of these trends are almost inevitable social consequences of frequently getting in trouble. Whether or not they also raise the likelihood of further repeating is a possibility which merits further investigation. Related to the above trends is the shift away from adult-supervised youth groups and toward either gang activity or its opposite extreme, isolation. Here, again, the finding should be no surprise. The leaders of youth groups are understandably impatient with trouble-makers and may encourage them to leave organizations. Meanwhile, as a youngster gets in trouble frequently he may get to know more boys with a similar propensity to mischief. If he goes to a special school and spends time in detention his social contacts may become specialized. In many neighborhoods he may be isolated as less delinquent youngsters steer clear of him and of the trouble associated with him. In summary, then, a comparison between a predictive study of juvenile repeating and a retrospective study of the same phenomenon would indicate that home and neighborhood conditions alter only slightly, but school, police, and peer-group relations become worse. In this way, the repeater is propelled toward more serious delinquency not only by the forces which started him on his way but also by more intensified pressures in other areas of his life.",

      "abstract": "Is the tendency to morally prioritize humans over animals weaker in children than adults? In two preregistered studies (total N = 622), 5- to 9-year-old children and adults were presented with moral dilemmas pitting varying numbers of humans against varying numbers of either dogs or pigs and were asked who should be saved. In both studies, children had a weaker tendency than adults to prioritize humans over animals. They often chose to save multiple dogs over one human, and many valued the life of a dog as much as the life of a human. Although they valued pigs less, the majority still prioritized 10 pigs over one human. By contrast, almost all adults chose to save one human over even 100 dogs or pigs. Our findings suggest that the common view that humans are far more morally important than animals appears late in development and is likely socially acquired.",

Research shows, however, that this proposition holds true for men, but not for women. In three studies, one observational and two experimental, we explored a potential mechanism that explains why men and women diverge in their sexual reactions to a responsive opposite-sex stranger. Studies 1 and 2 showed that men, but not women, perceived a responsive stranger as more gender typical (masculine/feminine) and, in turn, as more attractive. Study 3 revealed that responsiveness increased men’s perception of partner’s femininity. This, in turn, was associated with higher sexual arousal, which was, in turn, linked to greater partner attractiveness and greater desire for a long-term relationship. These findings suggest that whether responsiveness affects perceptions of partner attractiveness varies in individuals, depending on the contextually based meaning of responsiveness.",

      "title": "SUBJECTS OF ENVY AMONG YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN: CONTEXTS OF DEVIANT BEHAVIOR",
      "abstract": "This article explores the propensity for deviant behavior and the objects of envy among young men and women. Specifically, it examines the following aspects: Appearance: Young individuals often experience jealousy regarding each other's physical appearance, clothing, hairstyle, and more. Envy of attractive attributes may drive both genders to engage in deviant behaviors, such as resorting to drug use or alcohol abuse to achieve these attributes. Social Status: Envy can also revolve around social status, encompassing factors like popularity, academic or athletic success, and group affiliations. Envious feelings related to these aspects may lead to deviant behaviors, including the use of violence or manipulation to attain desired status. Material Goods: Material possessions can be a focal point of envy, motivating young people to engage in theft, deceit, or illicit activities to acquire them. Power and Control: Envy of power and control may serve as another motivator for deviant behavior. For instance, the desire to wield power can lead to attempts to control others or resort to violence to achieve personal objectives. Deviant behaviors often stem from envy, as individuals may seek to obtain desired objects or statuses through wrongful means. For instance, a young man envious of a successful classmate may resort to grade forgery or cheating to attain similar success. Jealousy can also trigger conflicts and violence among individuals. For example, two girls envious of each other's attractiveness or popularity may engage in efforts to undermine each other's lives or even resort to physical aggression. The primary objective of this article is to identify the principal psychological and legal characteristics of envy among male and female students within the context of deviant behavior. The article's objectives include assessing the level of envy among male and female cadets and exploring gender-specific relationships between deviant behavior and envy across various subject areas. It is essential to note that envy alone is not the sole cause of deviant behavior; rather, it is one of several factors influencing young individuals and motivating them to engage in unlawful acts. Additional factors, such as inadequate social support, low self-esteem, or negative environmental influences, also significantly contribute to the development of deviant behavior. In conclusion, this study underscores that envy is not a moral sentiment and highlights the centrality of feelings of inferiority in the experience of envy. Moreover, gender differences in envy, prevalent among youth, tend to diminish as individuals mature.",

      "title": "13 Curiosity, Women, and the Social Orders",
      "abstract": "Like other passions, virtues, and vices -such as avarice 1 --curiosity was often judged in the early modern period less in absolute terms than in relation to social variables, whether explicit or implicit.Of these, perhaps the most prominent four were: rank; occupation; sex; age.Other variables that fed into judgments about curiosity included a person's state (in the sense of clerical-religious-lay or unmarried-marriedwidowed), location (urban or provincial), their being 'learned' or 'unlearned', and so on.Beyond the question of curiosity, scholarship on the general relation between such variables in the period has long emphasized that, to varying extents, they cut across each other. 2 While occupation and sex were plotted onto each other most closely of all, occupation and rank were also closely entwined.On the other hand, there was obviously more latitude in the relation between sex on the one hand and rank or age on the other.The interconnectedness, strong or weak, of such social variables was expressed by terms that cut across some of them.One's 'vocation' was an amalgam of rank, occupation, sex, and even of the right course of action in a given situation, according to the Calvinist moral theologian Jean de L'Espine: in a work published in 1587, he understood 'curiosité' as being a failure to follow one's vocation. 3A person's 'quality' could be a combination of rank and state (in one of the senses just listed).Or rank and occupation could be informally bundled together in what Keith Wrightson has called the language of 'sorts' --'the richer sort', 'the middle sort', and so on. 4 Starting out from the fact that the more curiosity was female and/or feminized in the early modern period, the more it was likely to be judged reprehensible, 5 I will take soundings to see what happens to this picture when it includes other social variables too.The soundings are taken mainly from mid-seventeenth-to early eighteenth-century northern Europe (before the more recognisably modern terminology of 'class' became dominant), mainly from France, but occasionally from the Germanic territories and England.My examples are too limited to produce firm conclusions, but might at least point to the question's complexity.By 'curiosity' I mean the recognisable family of terms (curieux, Kuriosität, and so on) which prominently designated in this period not just a passion, virtue, or vice but also certain kinds of objects ('curiosities'), as well as the relation between those objects and the 1 See Jonathan Patterson, Representing Avarice in Late Renaissance France (Oxford: forthcoming), chaps 1, 4. 2 E.g.",

Remarried adults, whether or not they brought children from a previous union into the remarriage, reported marital quality (happiness and conflict) equal to those in first marriages. They also reported more positive attitudes toward divorce, which were associated with higher divorce proneness (i.e., thinking about and taking actions toward divorce). Marriage type interacted with marital quality to predict divorce proneness, such that the association between low marital quality and divorce proneness was stronger for remarried individuals than for those in first marriages. This suggests that remarried adults may be more likely than adults in first marriages to take steps toward divorce when experiencing marital distress, possibly reflecting a weaker commitment to marriage .",

      "abstract": "The main task of generativity vs stagnation, Erik Erikson's seventh stage of normative psychosocial development, is to establish and guide the next generation through one's acts of care. Five broad statuses or prototypic styles of resolving the issues of this stage are proposed using combinations of (a) an individual's level of vital involvement, or active concern for the growth of the self and others, and (b) an individual's tolerance of different ideas, traditions, and values, which, by extension, determines the scope of caregiving concern. The Generative status is characterized by high vital involvement and tolerance, and represents the most positive psychosocial outcome. The Pseudogenerative-Agentic status is high in vital involvement and tolerance for self but not for others, while Pseudogenerative-Communal is high in vital involvement and tolerance for others but not for self. The Conventional status, high in vital involvement for both self and others, is low in tolerance across the board. Stagnant reflects the poorest psychosocial outcome, and is low in vital involvement and tolerance generally. A semistructured interview constructed to measure the statuses generated continuous and categorical ratings which were used to investigate inter-rater reliability and validity of the generativity prototypes (N=100). The dimensional scalings obtained higher reliability than the strictly categorical judgements, reaching acceptable levels. Convergence was",

      "title": "Something's Missing",
      "abstract": "Let's be frank: women got a bad hand in the poker game of sex assignment, biologically speaking. Beneath all those rousing female-empowerment slogans (I am Woman, hear me roar); and the table turning (Men are really the weaker sex!); and the power-suit bravado (publishing titan Judith Regan: have the biggest cock in the building[Newman 2005, 56]), there are certain anatomical facts to contend with. The degree to which these anatomical facts prop up the social inequities of gender is a long, entangled story, to say the least, and nowhere more entangled than within female psychology itself. To put it bluntly, women lack penises, and like it or not, you're assigned to a gender based on what's between your legs, and for some entirely mysterious reason, in every known culture, the fact of having or not having a penis predicts who gets the economic power, social privilege, and political control. Yes, rather inexplicably (especially to those of us without one), the majority of the advantages in the world just seem to accrue to the class of humans possessing this appendage. Just some zany coincidence? Vexing and absurd though all this may be, thus far in the course of human history it's a social fact (a few long-ago putative matriarchies aside), though, things have been improving (incrementally) on the gender-equity front lately, at least in certain regions of the globe. Though not entirely. And how does the female psyche contend with this cheery news? Well, there's feminism, social protest, the activism route: the female condition is just historically wrong. Then there's femininity, by which I mean that one can endeavor to acquire one of these crucial appendages on a time-share basis-also known as heterosexuality, pair bonding, or in its legally contractual form, marriage: the system by which a few of those social and economic penis-privileges are supposed to trickle down to women and their offspring. To those pursuing this option: strive to be eye-catching and tractable, try to keep the desperation concealed. Also keep in mind the downside of these time-share penises: they invariably come with actual men attached to them-often large, messy, demanding ones-which produces for many women (especially those with more refined sensibilities) no end of annoyance, that is, once you finally manage to corral one of these specimens and set up housekeeping. Hence the popularity of male behavior modification, a favorite female pastime of our day, though rather less popular with its subjects. Studies have shown that with years of dedicated daily instruction and a structured system of punishments and rewards, a majority of men can learn to put the toilet seat down or conform to the other domestic requirements that-according to current popular wisdom about relations between the sexes-provide the basis for much male-female fractiousness, so don't give up yet. It's sometimes been suggested that lacking the body part that confers social advantage puts the female sex, on the whole, in a slightly resentful position, which may occasionally express itself in a degree of overmanagement when it comes to such domestic interactions. This is, needless to say, a scurrilous stereotype, though who wouldn't be resentful about being handed the anatomical short straw, so to speak, at least until the happy day when having the shorter straw finally stops mattering, a day that has not quite arrived, despite all the wonderful social progress and everything. But as long as anatomy is still enlisted as the emblem of differences between the sexes, and as long as those differences are mapped onto the female psyche, with something's missing as the psychological substrata of so many aspects of everyday life, from body image, to relationships, to work-well, apparently small things will continue to matter a lot. Is anatomy destiny? Over the course of human history, cultures have endlessly vacillated when it comes to describing the differences between the sexes. …",

Offender(s) may deny homosexuality and confuse an aggressive active behaviour with a masculine (even macho) behaviour. They may project their homosexual feelings onto the victim. In the aftermath of rape, the victim may be ashamed of having lost control and may question himself about his real sexual identity. An aspect of female or male rape by a group of males may be an attempt to annihilate latent homosexual tendencies existing between members of this group. Surprisingly, in the short term, post traumatic disorder related to rape and pre-existing psychiatric disorder may develop separately, without substantial interaction. In the famous case of Schreiber described by Freud, homosexuality is assumed to play an important role in the development of paranoid schizophrenia. Cases in which schizophrenic patients (of both sexes) imagine being raped by a member of the opposite sex, may possibly challenge this opinion.",

The general opinion is that this group of people is characterised by specific psychological and physical functioning and they are thought to have distinct needs and expectations as regards family life. To verify and confirm the above, comparative research was undertaken to find out how young able‐bodied, blind and persons using wheelchairs evaluate marriage. The subject of the research was the importance ascribed to the hierarchy of values related to marriage and family, and the types of needs satisfied through these institutions of social life. The participants were asked to evaluate such phenomena as love, sexual life and parenthood as well as expressing their attitude and opinion on conjugal infidelity. The results obtained do not indicate any significant differences in attitudes and views presented between the groups under consideration. All valued marriage and family life very highly and had similar expectations, however, not all will be able to fulfil their needs and aspirations in these areas. It will be quite complicated, especially so for those who are disabled. All possible failures are caused by, first of all, negative attitudes of the society towards erotic activities of people with disabilities.",

Boys' masculine role preference was higher than the girls' feminine preference (t = 4.62, p < .0005), and there was no difference in same-sexed imitation scores (t = .24, p > .05). Boys' masculine preference was higher than their father imitation (t = 1.85, p < .05), and the girls had higher mother imitation than feminine preference (t = 1.85, p < .05). The interpretations were complicated by the fact that the girls' preference was in the masculine range. The results suggested that boys identify with a culturally defined, masculine role, that girls show a similar tendency, and that neither sex imitates the same-sexed parent consistently.",

In contrast, older children are thought to compare the stimuli or objects they categorize and to explicitly equate different category members. 2 habituation experiments were conducted in an attempt to determine whether 10-month-old infants are capable of explicit categorization. The approach taken was to insert nonmembers into the familiarization sequence in a categorization task. The nonmembers were designed so as to have a predictable effect on infants' performance whether or not these stimuli were included as infants processed the categorical information. The results suggest that infants do explicitly equate category members. Infants appeared to disregard the nonmembers in the familiarization sequence, basing their categorization response instead on the set of instances that were \"the same sort of thing.\"",

      "abstract": "School sports classes are a key part of physical and mental development, yet in many countries these classes are gender segregated. Before institutionalised segregation can be condoned it is important to tackle assumptions and check for an evidence-based rationale. This presentation aims to analyse the key arguments for segregation given in comment-form response to a recent media article discussing mixed school sports (Lawson, 2013).\r\n\r\nThe primary argument given was division for strength, ability or protection (75% comments). It is a common, but false assumption, that young female bones are more breakable or girls more fragile when given the same level of exercise. Schools already have fairly homogenous groupings due to age-based classes. At school age variation within gender is larger than variation between genders, yet there is no tendency to segregate a sports class on the basis of height or strength, only to segregate for gender.\r\n\r\nThe secondary argument was that keeping children separate avoids behavioural issues including self-consciousness, sexual harassment or discrimination (13% comments). As segregation isn’t realistic as a life-long strategy, we must question the validity of losing this controlled opportunity to teach respect. Indeed, people raised in segregated environments as minors have been shown to experience greater social anxiety in the adult world.\r\n\r\nSegregation moves gender politics to identity politics. There is no evidence for widely-held scientifically-valid reasons to segregate gender at school, yet it is socially accepted. Teaching curriculums are often blamed for specifying game-based activities, but there’s no physiological reason why in the UK boys play football and girls rounders, or in the USA soccer is considered a “girls sport” and baseball is “for boys”. Children’s development is shaped by the environment and value systems they are placed in. If we are to condone belief in individual variation over stereotyping the curriculums should enforce this.",

      "abstract": "This study was conducted on female students to see how their clothing lifestyle influenced their clothing prefrences and correlated with their sensitivity and lifestyle.The results were as follows : the fashion conscious type, who is aware of her appearance and enjoys getting dressed up, prefers contemporary clothing, is very sensitive, has great interest for new things and leads a life full of diversity. The non-fashion conscious type shows very little interest in clothing, does not like contemporary clothing and is not particularly sensitive. These facts are characteristic of a passive and introverted type. The dress code propriety type attaches importance to sticking to the conventional dress code, prefers traditional clothing and their lifestyle is tradition orientated. The self-assertive type wants to stick out and is excessively conscious of peer pressure, tendency to follow the mainstream. The functionally orientated type puts priority on the comfort of clothing, is not particularly sensitive and has few distinctive characteristics in their lifestyle.",

      "title": "437 - The elderly and their sexuality: specific challenges and the roleof the psychiatrist",
      "abstract": "Abstract The model of sexuality currently in force is a young, genitalized model, that does not tolerate failures and often forgets about affective communication, sharing and body contact. This model is also not compatible with the natural aging process, generating manymyths about sexuality in later life. Although a taboo subject, the majority (up to 70%) of healthy 70-year-olds revealedthemselves to be sexually active even with some sexual dysfunction reports. Low sexual desire (up to 43%) was the most prevalent reported sexual difficulty in women, and erectiledifficulties (up to 37%) were most prevalent among men. Aging impacts sexuality in various ways: age-related organic/metabolic changes in men and women; age-related affective and cognitive changes also in both genders; age-and duration-related changes in a couple’s dynamic interaction, which can lead to discrepancy between the partners and their sexual narratives. In the sexual response cycle, aging affects the stages of desire, arousal/excitement,plateau, orgasm, and resolution/refractory period both men and women. Depressed mood as well as the use of antidepressant drugs, deterioration of cognitive function and difficulties to communicate can cause loss of intimacy and emotional closeness which then may result in sexual withdrawal and difficulties. Repetitive experiences of failure increase even more the couple distress. There are also to consider medical conditions, medication side effects, loss of physical capacity, subjective loss of attractiveness, lack of a partner, institutionalization or living withtheir children, which can be obstacles to sexual activity in the elderly. Diagnostic workup has to integrate not only general medical, gynecological, urological andpsychiatric factors, but also take a systemic perspective which deals with the interaction pattern of the partners. Treatment of sexual dysfunctions in later life combines biomedical interventions with psychotherapeutic and psychosocial strategies. An essential therapeutic contribution for allcouples is, however, basic counseling and psychoeducation. Explaining how aging has an impact and how other individuals and couples experience these changes is an important step in empowering the couple, clarifying and correcting the sociocultural myths andencouraging the couple to build their very own sexuality.",

      "abstract": "The explosive growth in Internet use by men who have sex with men (MSM) to find sexual partners has been noted in the research literature. However, little attention has been given to the impact of participating in this online sexual marketplace for MSM of color, despite race and ethnicity as frequently used selection criterion in personal ads or profiles. Six focus group discussions (n = 50) and 35 in-depth qualitative interviews were conducted with African American, Latino, or Asian and Pacific Islander MSM in Los Angeles, which included discussion of their use of Internet sites to meet or interact with other MSM. Men reported race and ethnicity as a pervasive and powerful factor in facilitating or derailing Internet-mediated sexual encounters. The racialized interactions that MSM of color reported ranged from simple expressions of race-based preferences, to blatantly discriminatory or hostile interactions, and often demeaning race-based sexual objectification. Experiences of rejection and a perceived hierarchy of value in the sexual market based on race had definite costs for these MSM using these online sites. Furthermore, the private and solitary nature of seeking partners online meant that there was little to buffer the corrosive aspects of those negative experiences. These online dynamics have implications for the power balance in Internet-mediated sexual liaisons, including sexual decision making and sexual risk.",

      "abstract": "The ability to determine whether and when to bear children has become a prerequisite for womens full participation in modern life. To understand the role that abortion plays in womens lives it must be placed within the larger context of unintended pregnancy. The typical American woman wants to have two children. To do so she will spend roughly five years pregnant postpartum or trying to become pregnant and three decades trying to avoid pregnancy. Virtually all U.S. women have used contraceptives; however neither people nor contraceptive methods are perfect. Nearly half of all women have faced an unintended pregnancy and one in three will have an abortion at some point in their life. About half of women who unintentionally become pregnant turn to abortion. Women who make the decision to have an abortion understand the responsibilities of parenthood and family life. Six in 10 are already a parent. More than half say they want a child or another child at a later point in their life. Most cite concern or responsibility for someone else as a factor in their decision. (excerpt)",

      "title": "Female Ornaments and Signaling",
      "abstract": "Abstract Sexual selection researchers refer to a variety of morphological features that capture the visual attention of conspeci0cs (notably, those of the other sex) but do not function as weapons or shields but as ornaments (Bradbury &amp; Vehrencamp, 1998; the Latin root of the word means “to adorn or decorate”). Examples include patches of skin that are brightly colored, gatherings of colored feathers, feather plumes, and elongated or elaborated 0ns and tails. The same term, however, aptly applies to olfactory and acoustical traits that attract attention from conspeci0cs, notably in sexual contexts. In most animal species, males are the more ornamented sex (Andersson, 1994). Nonetheless, females in sex-role-reversed species, some socially monogamous species, some polygynous species with male territoriality or other mating systems, and some Old World primates possess ornaments. In Old World primates, female ornaments are referred to as sexual swellings—enlarged, often differentially colored anogenital areas. Old World primate females with multimale, multifemale social arrangements (e.g., most macaques, man- drills, baboons, and chimpanzees) typically possess sexual swellings, but so, to lesser degrees, do a monogamous gibbon and a harem polygynous langur (Dixson, 1998; cf. Pagel &amp; Meade, 2006). Female sexual swellings occur in other mammalian taxa and at least one species of bird (see review in Dixson, 1998). Relatedly, some female primates and other species display a sexual skin, a differentially colored anogenital region with- out accompanying edema (swelling).",

Adults prefer, for example, \"A zebra is like a horse\" to \"A horse is like a zebra,\" and \"The bicycle is near the building\" to \"The building is near the bicycle.\" This is because directional syntax requires more typical or prominent items (i.e., reference points) to be placed in the complement position. Three experiments with children ages 4-8 (N = 181) explored whether children share this sensitivity to directional syntax. Children of this age showed an incipient preference for framing reference points as complements. Stating, \"Girls do math as well as boys,\" which frames boys as the reference point for girls, may therefore actually teach children that boys set the standard.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Research provides evidence of a distinctive gendered landscape of mental illness, with women and men differing in the types of disorder they commonly experience – a landscape that is not specific to Western societies. While there are no marked gender differences in the rates of psychoses like schizophrenia or in dementia, women have higher levels of affective disorders, such as depression, and of anxiety disorders, and men have higher levels of substance abuse and conduct disorders. Consequently the observed gender difference in overall levels of mental illness depends on what disorders are included in the measure. The gendered patterning of mental disorders is now usually linked to differences between women and men in gender‐related tendencies to internalize or externalize their feelings, women more often internalizing their feelings and men more often externalizing them. While such differences may be influenced by genetic factors, they also relate to the socialization of women and men in childhood – a gender socialization that is linked to the expectations of what is required of them in adult life. Further differences in women's and men's social situations also have a direct impact on the gender‐related expression of feelings in the face of life events and difficulties.",

Whilst some youngsters misleadingly look as if they are 17 and sexually mature, others can almost literally be half their size and still be very much children in all respects. Physically mature 12-year-old girls may have to cope with confusing sexual feelings and experiences for which they privately feel emotionally unready, despite their apparent outward sophistication. Small 14-year-old boys who are late developers suffer agonies wondering if their bodies will ever change into those of men. The sense of being unable to control the body's physical destiny can bring enormous anxiety, frustration, anger, and distress, as acne takes a hold or breasts become too obvious a feature on a shy girl's body.

Most research and sexual assault prevention efforts have focused on sexual consent; however, we argue that consent and refusal should be considered in tandem.

In doing so, we highlight the similarities and distinctions between sexual consent and refusal processes. We also consider how alcohol use can complicate people's experiences with sexual consent and refusal. Finally, we offer recommendations for various stakeholders to consider. Of note, we encourage educators and researchers (1) to acknowledge the diverse and multifaceted nature of sexual consent and refusals and (2) to normalize sexual communication in contexts other than sexual assault.",

However, this also raises some questions, that is, while the girl games satisfy female players’ love fantasies, some female players begin to have idealized expectations about relationships and unconsciously compare real-life men with the male virtual characters in the games. In this study, we used in-depth interviews to find that virtual lovers fill the players’ real-life emotional deficits and relationship needs to a certain extent, and shape the idealized expectations of female players for relationships. However, the majority of female players’ perceptions of marriage are not influenced by the game, as female players do not compare their real-life male counterparts with the male virtual characters in the game. Moreover, we found that the depth of the parasocial relationship between female players and the virtual male characters in the game does not absolutelly make an influence on women’s satisfaction with real-life men in the same group.",

      "title": "P–487 Couples undergoing first level assisted reproductive techniques: An Actor-Partner interdependence model of dyadic adjustment, psychological symptoms, alexithymia and romantic attachment on body-image avoidance",
      "abstract": "Abstract Study question The study aims to assess the commonalities and interdependence of couples undergoing first-level Assisted Reproductive Techniques (ART) as regards body-image avoidance referred to body-image dissatisfaction. Summary answer Partners’ functioning seem specular yet not interdependent, as not showing a couple-as-a-unit modality of functioning. Body-image avoidance is only influenced by intra-personal variables. What is known already: Stressful bodily emotions and body perception related to infertility and ART are critical aspects for people desiring having children. Infertility undermines women’s self-esteem and body-image, damaging their self-identity as women, while in males infertility associates with body dissatisfaction referring to perceived reduced physical fitness and personal failure, thus undermining their body virility. For infertile women, body-image dissatisfaction associates with reduced marital adjustment, and vice-versa; yet no study has considered how males body-image dissatisfaction associates with marital satisfaction. Nonetheless, couples should be considered as a unit, considering that infertile couples’ adjustment is influenced by their own, and their partners’, perceived stress. Study design, size, duration The study follows a cross-sectional design and is part of an ongoing transversal and longitudinal project, started in 2012, investigating the well-being of couples undergoing ART. For the present study only a minority of the existing data were considered, thus only including couples at the first level of ART with the intent of investigating couples’ commonalities and interdependence before treatments pervasiveness increases. Participants/materials, setting, methods Minimum N = 79 couples needed to be considered according to Power analysis results. N = 118 couples aged 24 to 46 years (women Mage=34.92, SD = 3.98; men Mage=37.45, SD = 5.25) were included, and declaring trying to get pregnant from 1 to 8 years (M = 3.18; SD = 1.99) and to never had children, although 22.9% of women had at least an abortion. Participants completed the Body-Image Avoidance Questionnaire, Toronto Alexithymia Scale–20, Dyadic Adjustment Scale, Symptom Checklist–90-Revised and Experiences in Close Relationships Scale-Revised. Main results and the role of chance The sample presents non-clinical levels of functioning referring to their psychological symptoms, alexithymia and body-image avoidance. Multivariate rank tests show that females report significantly higher levels of body-image avoidance (stat=–5.73; adj.p=.001), psychological symptoms (stat=–4.58; adj.p=.001) and romantic anxious attachment (stat=–3.33; adj.p=.005). These differences were confirmed also after applying multiplicity control. Moreover, bi-variate Pearson’s r correlations show an association among partners’ dyadic adjustment (r=.293; p&amp;lt;.001), albeit their overall level of dyadic adjustment is low. Significant correlations among partners also emerged as regards psychological symptoms (r=.258; p&amp;lt;.001) and alexithymia (r=.16; p=.05). The couple-effect, thus considering the couple as the unit of analysis, was modeled through an Actor-Partner Interdependence Model. For both partners, dyadic adjustment’s actor-effect associates with body-image avoidance (women: β = 0.133, p=.026; man: β = 0.133, p=.026). Furthermore, for both men and women, psychological symptoms’ actor-effect associate to body-image avoidance (women: β = 0.467, p&amp;lt;.00; men: β = 0.499, p=.001). Comparing the level of influence of actor and partner effects among partners, the psychological symptoms’ actor effect results significantly more influential than the partner-effect (women: Δ = 0.378, p=.015; men: Δ = 0.587, p=.001). Only for males, alexithymia’s actor effect is significant (β = 0.499; p=.001). Limitations, reasons for caution Results should be considered in light of some limitations. Specifically, the cross-sectional study design, lack of a control group with no infertility issues, the use of self-report measures, homogeneity among couples and the sample small sample size (although sample size was appropriate to retain a power of at least .8). Wider implications of the findings: Results support the differentiation of gender-specific psychosocial interventions along the ART path, preventing and mitigating the negative impact of infertility and ART on body-image dissatisfaction and avoidance and on the couples’ well-being.

      "abstract": "Gender inequality in the marriage and family sphere is most pronounced in the different attitudes of men and women to marriage registration, because it is men who, as a rule, prefer common-law marriage, and women are forced to put up with a model of relationships outside of the marriage, which deprives her of the rights provided for legitimate spouses. The analysis of the negative consequences of this problem allowed us to propose the following. It is necessary to legislatively fix the legal consequences of a long-term cohabitation of a man and a woman for those cases when, due to the death of one of the actual spouses, the marriage cannot be registered, which will contribute to the protection of the rights and interests of the other spouse. One more form of gender inequality is the practice when, in the vast majority of cases, a marriage is dissolved and the child remains in the care of the mother. This may adversely affects the psycho-emotional state of fathers deprived of the opportunity to live with their child, and children who wanted to live with the father, and not with the mother. It is necessary to form a stable judicial position based on the unconditional equality of the rights of the child’s parents, which is why decisions on such cases should be made following a comprehensive study of all the circumstances that testify in favor of both the mother and the father. One more form of gender inequality is a violation of women’s rights. Many fathers evade the payment of alimony for the maintenance of children, which is why the mother is entrusted not only with the upbringing of the child, taking care of his health, education, development, but also with the duty of his property maintenance, the burden of which she bears alone. The results of the analysis make it possible to conclude that all these forms of gender inequality in marriage and family sphere should be investigated by not only legal science, but also psychology and sociology. It is vital as they have deep psychological, emotional and cognitive foundations that form differently in the minds of men and women and manifest themselves in different ways in their behavior.",

      "abstract": "Men who failed to achieve an adequate separation from their mothers are particularly prone to experience serious distress with their marriages during their middle years, when the wish for intimacy, coupled with a fear of closeness never resolved during infancy, is retriggered. An onslaught of biological, social, and psychological stresses force acknowledgement of previously denied needs for succor, plunging them into battle with their wife-surrogate mother. The resulting counterphobic, hypersexual, ofter self-destructive behaviors are usually falsely interpreted as oedipal. Clinical material in this report strongly suggests this distress is not primarily related to genital sexual issues or fears of castration, but more often concerns issues of autonomy and independence which typically involve the mother and which arose in the toddler or anal phase. Supportive evidence for this thesis from cross-cultural observations, child developmental studies, and primatology is presented, and the usefulness of this view in facilitating clinical work with such men is described.",

      "abstract": "Like everyone else, individuals whose bodies are different from the majority of the population on account of variations in their sexed development seek to live a fulfilling life: to be happy; to experience good health and mental well-being; to have agency and the freedom to choose how they live their life; and to be treated justly, equitably within society and not be subjected to harm by others. Like everyone else, their well-being is caught up with their sense of self, identity and narrative, 'their story' and, this is shaped by language, by the ways in which they are recognised by others, by their actions in the world and the actions of the world upon them. Clearly people with variations in sex development are likely to have to negotiate particular challenges in making sense of their embodiment and in realising certain common human aspirations – including intimate relationships and parenthood. So, alongside the usual cast list of those who play a key role in the shared and fundamentally human task of making sense of the self – parents, siblings or friends – or the key institutional settings of socialisation (education, employment), contemporary individuals with variations in sex development are also very likely to be shaped by extensive experience of clinical medical settings.",

      "abstract": "Dominance and submissiveness represent strong sexual arousal stimuli for a considerable part of population. In contrast to men's sexual dominance and women's sexual submissiveness, the opposite preferences represent an evolutionary enigma. Here, we studied prevalence and strength of particular preferences in general population by Internet-trap-method.The subjects who clicked the banner displayed in the web interface of e-mail boxes were allowed to choose icons with homosexual or heterosexual partner of different hierarchical position.Dominant partner was chosen by 13.8% men and 20.5% women, and submissive partner by 36.6% men and 19.8% women. Homosexual partners were chosen by 7.3% men and 12.2% women. The response times for the submissive and dominant stimuli did not differ while for the equal-status stimuli were significantly longer, suggesting that part of subjects with equal-status preferences probably intentionally mask their natural interests.Large number of people who chose unequal sexual partner suggests that hierarchical status plays important role in human mating system.",

      "title": "Gendered Word (or World): Sexism in Philippine Preschool English Language Textbooks",
      "abstract": "Adhering to the notion that language learning is necessarily a culture-learning process, this paper explores the issue of sexism in six Philippine preschool English language textbooks. The study adopts the qualitative-quantitative approach in examining the following categories: gender visibility (illustrations), “firstness”, occupational-role representations, character attributes, and interests and lifestyles. Data reveal that the textbooks seem to feature both genders; still, the males appeared more frequently than females in the illustrations of the textbooks. In terms of “firstness”, males appear before females more often; this could imply that the textbooks seem to favor males, thus, appearing to be sexist. Also, females are far less visible than men in occupational roles. The occupational roles for females are less diverse and are restricted to stereotypical types of occupation/profession while male occupations show a wider range, thus, providing them with more options than females. Moreover, about the same number of character attributes that is allocated to both genders. Females are usually attributed with their “good” looks and passivity; by contrast, males show aggression, dominance, and activity. In the textbooks analyzed, the number of interests, and lifestyles of females is higher than those of males. However, the females are more particularly represented in indoor activities, i.e., household chores. This paper likewise discusses the implications of the findings on language teaching, and learning.",

      "title": "WHEN GRANDPA SAYS SOMETHING RACIST: THE ROLE OF AGEISM IN YOUNG ADULT RESPONSES",
      "abstract": "Abstract Previous research has found that older adults endorse higher levels of racist attitudes than younger adults. However, little extant research has explored how young adults may respond to an older adult expressing racist views. One factor that may drive young adults’ responses is ageism, particularly stereotypes that older adults cannot handle disagreement or are incapable of changing their views. The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationships between ageism and young adults’ likely responses to an older adult relative making a racist statement. College students (N = 110; 75.8% female) completed an online survey in which they were given a scenario in which an older adult relative makes a racist statement and rated how likely they would be to respond in different ways. Factor analysis of the likely response items found four facets: confront, agree, avoid, and leave. Bivariate correlations found that ageism was associated with higher likelihood of agreeing or avoiding, and lower likelihood of confronting the older adult relative. There was no association between ageism and likelihood of leaving the situation. Young adults higher in ageism may be more likely to agree or avoid because of ageist stereotypes that older adults cannot handle disagreement or are incapable of change, and they may be more likely to agree with the racist statement because they may have higher levels of intolerance toward both older adults and other ethnic groups. Ageism may play a role in how young adults respond to older adults expressing intolerant views.",

The results tended to support the hypothesis that male adolescents manifest defense preferences more similar to those of their father than to nonrelated adult males but failed to support a comparable hypothesis concerning the adolescent's similarity of defense preferences to his mother versus nonrelated adult females. The adolescent males did not reveal defense preferences more similar to those of their father than of their mother nor were sex differences in defense preferences observed. An additional finding suggested that the adult males are more heterogeneous in their defense preferences than are adult females.",

      "abstract": "Darwin found that many animals had characteristics that were difficult to explain in terms of natural selection (i.e., the gradual process in which organisms better adapted to their environment survive and reproduce more successfully over sufficiently long time periods). He proposed a new selective force, sexual selection, which refers to the process generated by differential sexual access to opposite-sex mates. The process of sexual selection, in its classic conceptualization, consisted of two components: male–male competition, resulting in built-in weapons, and female choice, resulting in ornaments. Following Darwin, sexual selection is often divided into two forms: (1) intrasexual selection, in which members of one sex, most often males, compete with one another to gain sexual access to opposite-sex mates; and (2) intersexual selection, in which individuals of one sex, most often females, choose among individuals of the opposite sex as mates. The two forms of sexual selection have been investigated in humans across cultures, producing a large body of work on psychological similarities and differences between women and men in the context of mating. Post-mating sexual selection and its effect on sexual psychology have also gained increasing research attention in the last two decades. Two post-mating strategies in sexual selection are discussed: sperm competition (the competition between the sperm of two or more males to fertilize the egg(s) of a single female) and mate guarding (behaviors used to maintain reproductive opportunities and sexual access to a mate). Previous applications of sexual selection to sexual psychology and future directions in integration of multiple perspectives in evolutionary social sciences are discussed.",

These gender differences could be due to either different family risk factors affecting boys and girls or to boys coping differently in response to the same negative family events. These two alternative hypotheses form the basis of our analysis. Specifically, using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY), we assess whether and how (1) marital discord, (2) marital stability and change, (3) harsh discipline, and (4) maternal deviance impact three different outcomes for males and females: delinquency, alcohol use, and depression. Multivariate analyses reveal that, although females generally display more vulnerabilities to specific dimensions of family life than males, the responses to these risk factors are not constrained to gender‐stereotypic outcomes.",

There are no well-established or exhaustive explanations for the development of gender identity disorder. Gender identity appears to be established and influenced by psychosocial factors during the first few years of life. However, many authors have argued for biological factors, if not causative, may predispose an individual to a gender identity disorder. Because most gender dysphoric individuals have adamant requests for sex reassignment (many often already taking opposite-sex hormones supplied by other physicians), it is extremely difficult to engage the patients in treatment with anything other than surgical reassignment as the goal. However, because surgery is irreversible, it is important to engage these patients in psychotherapy, even if surgery is indicated. The therapist should be careful to base the goals of therapy on what is desired by the patient. Behavior therapy has been used to modify specific cross-gender behaviors of child with gender identity disorder.",

The results show that gender stereotypes of masculinity and femininity play an important role in the sexual behaviour of this population. Versatile individuals report higher likelihood of taking a pasivo sexual role when they perceive a sexual partner as being more masculine than themselves based on his appearing more macho, more aggressive, taller, endowed with a bigger penis, more handsome, or darker skinned. By contrast, respondents report more likelihood of taking an activo role when the partner is perceived as more effeminate, less aggressive, shorter, endowed with a smaller penis, less handsome, or of lighter skin colour. Nevertheless, the findings suggest that, although gender stereotypes play an important generic role, contextual and emotional circumstances may significantly affect sexual‐role behaviour in specific cases.",

Abuse is defined as an act of commission and neglect is defined as an act of omission in the care leading to potential or actual harm. Neglect may include inadequate health care, education, supervision, protection from hazards in the environment, and unmet basic needs such as clothing and food. Neglect is the most common form of child abuse. Physical abuse may include beating, shaking, burning, and biting. The threshold for defining corporal punishment as abuse is unclear. Rib fractures are found to be the most common finding associated with physical abuse. Psychological abuse includes verbal abuse, humiliation, and acts that scare or terrorize a child, which may result in future psychological illness of the child. Sexual abuse is defined as “the involvement of dependent, developmentally immature children and adolescents in sexual activities which they do not fully comprehend, to which they are unable to give consent, or that violate the social taboos of family roles.” Some cases of sexual abuse do not need to involve oral, anal, or vaginal penetration and may include exposure to sexually explicit materials, oral-genital contact, genital-to-genital contact, genital-to-anal contact, and genital fondling. A significant amount of child abuse cases frequently are missed by healthcare providers. For the diagnosis of child abuse to be made, there needs to be a high index of suspicion.",

Children's developmental level of gender constancy was predictive of the amount and the proportion of time they attended to an adult male and an adult female film model. As boys developed gender constancy, their relative preference for watching the male model increased significantly; as girls developed gender constancy, their relative preference for watching the female model increased, though not significantly. At the more advanced levels of gender constancy, boys watched the male model more than did girls. It was suggested that same-sex social learning may develop as a function of children's cognitive understanding of gender as an identifiable, stable and consistent human attribute.",

Teasing is mostly a disliked behavior that can be verbal or non-verbal meant to achieve a desired aim of the teaser on the teased target. It has various definitions, objectives and reasons. Teasing is double-edged; it can be innocent or malicious. The sample of this study consisted of 110 undergraduates (53 males and 57 females). It was carried out at five different intervals. It aimed to answer three questions concerning same-sex, cross-sex teasing categories and reactions. The findings of the study revealed that female-same-sex teasing expressions could be categorized under underestimation, criticism, physical appearance, academic competence, clothing, and imitation, whereas male-same-sex expressions could be categorized under underestimation, describing the target as an animal or something bad, physical appearance, relationships, cursing, and rumor. Teasing expressions directed from females to males could be categorized under underestimation, academic competence, and describing the target as an animal or something bad while teasing expressions directed from males to females could be categorized under physical appearance, underestimation, describing the teased target as an animal or something bad, clothing, and academic competence. The reactions of both females and males were the same as their reactions to the first teasing expression were mostly positive, and to the second one were mostly negative. The use of the teasing categories arrived at by the study were attributed to matters of interest among both same-sex and cross-sex. Impact of cultural background, mood, and mixing with others could also play a role in employing a certain teasing category or reaction to a teasing expression.",

      "title": "Resource acquisition and <scp>pre‐copulatory</scp> sexual selection",
      "abstract": "A bstract Sexual selection influences the evolution of phenotypic traits and contributes to patterns of biodiversity. In many animals, mating involves sequential steps. Often, individuals must secure resources that are essential for mating (nests, territories, food), and then after securing a resource, individuals engage in competition for access to limited opposite sex mates and gametes. A large body of empirical research and some verbal models have illustrated that resource acquisition can influence sexual selection. In general, though, we lack a priori predictions of when and how resource acquisition will influence sexual selection. Here, we use a mathematical framework to explore the link between resource acquisition and sexual selection on an advantageous mate‐acquisition trait across biologically relevant trade‐off scenarios. Our findings provide a set of testable predictions of how resource acquisition can influence sexual selection on mating traits. In general, selection on mate‐acquisition traits is expected to be heavily influenced by: (1) the episode of selection considered, and in particular, whether one considers selection associated with the mating pool only or selection associated with both the mating pool and pre‐mating pool; (2) whether resource‐acquisition and mate‐acquisition traits are positively associated or whether they trade off; and (3) the proportion of males with the resource‐ and mate‐acquisition traits.",

      "abstract": "One has to distinguish masculine sex behavior and estrogens alone or in combination with gestagens evoke feminine sex behavior. The central integrator for the induction of sex behavior is located in diencephalic nuclei. If sex hormones are lacking, the sex drive is fading off, except in women. Sex hormones are also responsible for the determination of those neutral centres controlling male or female sex behavior later in life in most species. Based on animal datas and on retrospective inquiries of homosexuals or mothers of homosexuals, a hypothesis for the etiology of homo-, bi- and hyposexuality has been developed by Dorner. Absence or deficiency of androgens in the critical phase of \"brain differentiation\" leads to male homo-, bi- or hyposexuality, respectively. If androgens become active in the critical phase of female differentiation, then the result will be female homo-, bi- or hyposexuality, respectively. This hypothesis will be critical evaluated.",

      "abstract": "Sexting is a common and healthy behavior in romantic and sexual relationships. However, not every relationship lasts. When a relationship ends, the fate of sexual content that was previously shared can be a source of discomfort, anxiety, or fear for individuals who may no longer trust their former partners. In extreme cases, intimate content may be leaked or misused by its recipient. To investigate opportunities for building safer sexting tools with breakups in mind, we conducted a survey with 310 U.S. adults who have sexted in the last year. We asked about their sexting practices, communication practices within their relationship about sexting, and preferences for their own sexting content after a breakup. We find that most people save sexts in some form, either actively (e.g., via screenshots) or passively (e.g., in chat history). There is no consensus around what one should do with an ex's content: although most (55%) want their content to be deleted at the end of a relationship, many others don't care (25%) or even hope their ex keeps the material (11%). However, most have never spoken to their partner about this preference. We end with design recommendations that support sexting while keeping the entire relationship lifecycle in mind.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Human adults often show a preference for scarce over abundant goods. In this paper, we investigate whether this preference was shared by 4‐ and 6‐year‐old children as well as chimpanzees, humans’ nearest primate relative. Neither chimpanzees nor 4‐year‐olds displayed a scarcity preference, but 6‐year‐olds did, especially in the presence of competitors. We conclude that scarcity preference is a human‐unique preference that develops as humans increase their cognitive skills and social experiences with peers and competitors. We explore different potential psychological explanations for scarcity preference and conclude scarcity preference is based on children's fear of missing out an opportunity, especially when dealing with uncertainty or goods of unknown value in the presence of competitors. Furthermore, the results are in line with studies showing that supply‐based scarcity increases the desirability of hedonic goods, suggesting that even as early as 6 years of age humans may use scarce goods to feel unique or special.",

      "abstract": "The bargaining behavior of children and adolescents from three cultures on a competitive resource distribution task was examined. Subjects played a game in which they alternated suggestions until they agreed on a distribution. The strongest effects were those obtained for culture. Indian bargainers negotiated longer, were more competitive, were more symmetrical in their competitiveness, and had larger discrepancies in their settlements than did either the Argentineans or the Americans. Americans were most compromising in their trial-by-trial offers and in their final outcome, suggesting a convergent bargaining style. Additional data suggest that the bargaining differences may reflect differences among the cultures in their general orientations, with Indians emphasizing both competitiveness and need derived from a “view of the world” that is based on scarcity or limited resources. Other findings indicate that the effects of age, sex, and experimental condition vary among cultures. An age effect was obtained only in India, where older bargainers negotiated longer and rejected a higher proportion of their opponent's offers than did younger bargainers. Male bargainers were more competitive than females in India and the United States, but a trend in the opposite direction was obtained for Argentinean bargainers. And a different pattern of condition effects for length of negotiations was obtained for the three cultures.",

Unlike other sports however, clothing for performance rather than fashion or cultural consumption remains under-researched. With increasing research on the gendered and sexualized nature of surfing alongside an increasing emphasis on female surfing as athletic performance, a paradox seems apparent. In warm-water competition, women deal with tensions associated with appearance, sponsorship driven by sexual objectification and functional surfwear that increases exposed body surface – while men's clothing epitomizes comfort, protection and ultimately a reduction in exposed body surface. Under the guise of athletic performance and celebrating female gains in the sport, a patriarchal thread seems to tie up a particular sex, gender and sexuality order that is neither new nor productive for high performance or full participation.",

      "abstract": "as evidenced by the altruist's own estimate of his altruism. 10. Approved traits such as altruism may not be projected by the non-insightful; they may, however, be projected by the insightful. 11. Altruism is related to the relative value with which relationships are regarded. Relationships which, while prevalent in lay or professional thinking or both, have not been substantiated by the present study include: 1. The individual who attends church or synagogue regularly is apt to be more altruistic than one who does not. 2. The inhibition or control of impulses or desires involved in altruistic behavior is conducive to neurotic symptomology. 3. Those attracted to the sciences are more altruistically inclined than those attracted to law, business, or engineering. 4. The political liberal or leftist is apt to be more altruistic than the conservative or rightist. 5. Professed ease in relationships is correlated with altruism. 6. An child is apt to be significantly more egoistic than the average. Perhaps in the long run the most rewarding product of this study is one that had not been consciously hypothesized: the precipitation from the matrix of a configuration of variables that appears fully consistent with Becker's concept of the sacred pole of the sacred-secular continuum. Appearing as it did as the first dimension to be extracted and accounting for a larger amount of the matrix variance than any of the other seven dimensions which followed (including configurations consistent with the constructs socioeconomic status and social acceptability), it would seem to grant considerable support to Becker's contention that the construct sacred is not only objectively possible but objectively probable.22 If the sacred can be shown by factor analysis to be a dimension underlying the surface relationships between many of the variables of interest to the contemporary sociologist and psychologist, then the construct warrants considerably more attention from the quantitatively-oriented investigator than it has received to date.",

      "abstract": "Age is the predominant risk factor for developing prostate cancer, leading to its description as an \"older man's disease.\" Changed sexual embodiment is a concern for men who develop prostate cancer, often compounding experiences of age-related sexual decline. Although research has examined heterosexual men's experiences of aging in the context of sexual embodiment after prostate cancer, gay and bisexual men have received little attention. This qualitative study used a material-discursive analysis, drawing on positioning theory and intersectionality, to explore constructions of aging following prostate cancer in 46 gay or bisexual men. Thematic decomposition of one-to-one interviews identified three subject positions: \"mastering youth,\" involving maintaining an active sex life through biomedical interventions, accessing commercial sex venues, or having sex with younger men; \"the lonely old recluse,\" involving self-positioning as prematurely aged and withdrawal from a gay sexual scene; and \"accepting embodied aging,\" involving the incorporation of changed sexual function into intimate relationships and finding pleasure through nonsexual activities. These subject positions are conceptualized as the product of intersecting masculine and gay identities, interpreted in relation to broader cultural discourses of \"new aging\" and \"sexual health,\" in which sexual activity is conceptualized as a lifelong goal.",

In the present study, black and white male and female college students were asked about specific acts of aggression which they had received from or directed toward a male or female. As predicted, males were likely to have both received and exhibited more forms of aggressive behavior, although females were somewhat more likely to have been honked at, to have been forced by a male to have sex, and to have slapped someone. Few racial differences were found, but it appeared that blacks might have been relatively more likely to exhibit physical aggression and whites to exhibit nonphysical aggression. Some differences were found in specific behaviors directed toward and received from males and females, but in general subjects said that they received more aggressive behaviors than they directed toward others. © 1992 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",

      "title": "Masculinities/Boyhood",
      "abstract": "The intersecting of masculinity studies and childhood studies since the 1990s has been expansive. Questions of gender have increasingly invoked questions of development, and demarcating boyhood has become a problem central to gender studies, indexical to more encompassing riddles of temporal masculinities and masculine temporalities. Motivation for theory and research on boyhood masculinities shifted considerably during the 20th century, from psychoanalysis and the popular reformatory “boyology” scene (first half of the 20th century) to the social and medical psychology of sex roles and gender dysphoria (1960s and 1970s) and gender identity disorder (1980s) to the current (1990s–2010s) culture wars over Schooling, Medicalization, sexual abuse and harassment, and heteronormativity. In the early 21st century, attention to boyhood masculinities derives its largest impetus from a heterogeneous spectrum of increasingly mainstreamed controversies, prominently including gender gaps and gender-specific drops in enrollment, literacy, performance, and retention, and purportedly related feminization or demasculinization of education (see Schooling: “Boy Problem,” “Boy Turn,” and Feminization). All of these controversies show a heavy Anglo-American slanting, with most publications emerging from the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, and Canada. Sections in this article provide an orientation to general academic venues (Encyclopedias, Journals, Synoptic Works) for introductory reading. Development of Gender Identity/Difference, Cross-Cultural and Non-Western Studies, Boys’ Geographies, and Ethnographies illustrate the broad angle of boyhood studies, while Historical Studies covers major Anglo-American (United States, Britain and Ireland, Canada, Australia) and emergent (Africa, Asia) contexts for scholarship. Other sections follow thematic interests more or less familiar to childhood studies researchers (Schooling, Sexualities, Representations and Mediations, Medicalization, Toys, Material Culture, and Technology). A separate section Boys’ Literature offers general, American historical, and British historical resources.",

      "title": "THE GENDER SYSTEM AND INTERACTION",
      "abstract": "▪ Abstract The gender system includes processes that both define males and females as different in socially significant ways and justify inequality on the basis of that difference. Gender is different from other forms of social inequality in that men and women interact extensively within families and households and in other role relations. This high rate of contact between men and women raises important questions about how interaction creates experiences that confirm, or potentially could undermine, the beliefs about gender difference and inequality that underlie the gender system. Any theory of gender difference and inequality must accommodate three basic findings from research on interaction. (a). People perceive gender differences to be pervasive in interaction. (b). Studies of interaction among peers with equal power and status show few gender differences in behavior. (c). Most interactions between men and women occur in the structural context of roles or status relationships that are unequal. These status and power differences create very real interaction effects, which are often confounded with gender. Beliefs about gender difference combine with structurally unequal relationships to perpetuate status beliefs, leading men and women to recreate the gender system in everyday interaction. Only peer interactions that are not driven by cultural beliefs about the general competence of men and women or interactions in which women are status- or power-advantaged over men are likely to undermine the gender system.",

      "abstract": "The persistent or recurrent difficulties of the woman to allow vaginal entry of a penis, a finger, and/or any object, despite the woman's expressed wish to do so\" is vaginismus. Early traumatic sexual experiences (e.g. sexual abuse), religious orthodoxy, low self-esteem and body image, negative attitudes about sexuality, lack of knowledge about sex and fear responses are some of the traditional etiological correlates of vaginismus. Vaginismus is largely a diagnosis of exclusion. An interview is crucial in differentiating the causes of this disease and it should involve the following key questions: -whether the contraction of the vaginal muscles was recorded from the first sexual contact and still remains a need for sexual satisfaction is achieved without relations vaginal or -symptom occurs for some time and what circumstances it bound or -contraction of the muscles is independent of the will, reflex and is at the very idea of sexual intercourse, and -that the contraction of the vaginal muscles occurs when you try to enter the member into the vagina which is very painful. The physical, gynecological and sexuological examinations exclude local causes of the disease. The mainstay of treatment in the majority of cases is psychosexual support. The cause of organic vaginismus is congenital malformation of the genital tract. It results from abnormal development of genital paramesonephric (Müllerian) ducts and the urogenital sinus, which are structures involved in the process of oviduct, uterus, and vagina organogenesis. This has strong implications in the practices of gynecology and sexuology in general, not only in adolescent gynecology and sexuology. Vaginismus with congenital malformation is an important problem in these fields.",

      "title": "INTRODUCTION: FEMINISM AND INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT",
      "abstract": "Women in much of the world lack support for fundamental functions of a human life. They are less well nourished than men, less healthy, more vulnerable to physical violence and sexual abuse. They are much less likely than men to be literate, and still less likely to have preprofessional or technical education. Should they attempt to enter the workplace, they face greater obstacles, including intimidation from family or spouse, sex discrimination in hiring, and sexual harassment in the workplace – all, frequently, without effective legal recourse. Similar obstacles often impede their effective participation in political life. In many nations women are not full equals under the law: they do not have the same property rights as men, the same rights to make a contract, the same rights of association, mobility, and religious liberty. Burdened, often, with the “double day” of taxing employment and full responsibility for housework and child care, they lack opportunities for play and for the cultivation of their imaginative and cognitive faculties. All these factors take their toll on emotional well-being: women have fewer opportunities than men to live free from fear and to enjoy rewarding types of love – especially when, as often happens, they are married without choice in childhood and have no recourse from bad marriages. In all these ways, unequal social and political circumstances give women unequal human capabilities.",

Play fighting may be seen between individuals of different size and power, especially if they reverse roles. Dominance-submission interactions often involve acts of power assertion among individuals who show reconciliation behaviors afterwards and who stay together in a stabilized hierarchical arrangement. Aggressive behaviors usually will not show such reversals, reconciliation, or stable pa%erns of affiliation. The literature on bullying, which was not founded on observation, has in all likelihood conflated these different behaviors; this confusion may help explain why bullying interventions often have li%le or no impact on changing children’s behavior.",

      "abstract": "The sexual abuse and exploitation of children is a serious problem. Adult sexual predators often use strategies known as grooming to entice their victims. These include targeting particularly vulnerable youth, gift giving, and systematically engaging in desensitizing sexual behaviors. Less commonly discussed is the notion of institutional grooming, the practice of strategically placing themselves in positions of public trust where they have access to children yet appear beyond reproach. Once situated, they can abuse children for decades without deterrence in spite of the fact that individuals around them may be aware–or partially aware–of their behavior. This article examines three cases, one involving a priest, another a football coach, and the third a pediatrician and considers the institutional practices and cultures that permit (or potentially permit) abuse and exploitation to flourish. Among other things it finds: confidentiality mandates and other codes of silence and secrecy impede information sharing; departmental or programmatic silos exist each with their own independent and competing agendas; confused reporting lines within the institution often end in the hands of powerful individuals who have an interest in non-disclosure; barriers exist to investing within the institution and reporting outside the institution often including mistrust and disempowerment of law enforcement and child protective services; extreme power differences exist between and among victims, predators, reporters, and other institutional players; and finally, intense loyalties personal, professional, and institutional are present. These factors produce institutional cultures that protect pedophiles and conspire against their vulnerable, individual, child victims.",

      "title": "[Sexual differentiation of the human brain].",
      "abstract": "Normal human development requires the compatibility between genetic sex (sex chromosomes), sex of gonades (tests or ovaries), genitalia (external and internal sex organs), somatic features (body characteristics) and psychic sex. The psychic sex, called frequently gender, consist of gender identity (self-estimation), gender role (objective estimation) and sexual orientation (hetero- or homosexual). It was believed that the psychic gender depends only on socio-environmental influences such as rearing, learning and individual choice. Although, the process of sexual differentiation of human brain is not completely elucidated, it has became recently evident that endogenous hormones more then socio-environmental factors influence gender differences. Experimental studies on animals revealed that transient action of sex steroids during perinatal period of life is crucial for the dymorphism of sexual behavior (male or female) in adulthood. It seems, that also in the human male neonates testosterone produced by testes perinatally takes the main role in the irreversible masculinization of the brain i.e. creation of the differences vs. female brain. The evaluation of patients with disturbances of sexual differentiation of external genitalia (the lack of the testosterone transformation into 5-alpha dihydrotestosterone in peripheral tissues of men or the inborn excess of androgens in women with the congenital adrenal hyperplasia) has served as a useful clinical model for understanding factors, affecting the formation of gender. In these individuals the formal sex established according to genetic sex and somatic sex may be incompatible with gender identity and role. However, it has been found that the female gender identity is most frequently associated with the presence of ovaries or the lack of gonads (gonadal dysgenesis), while the male gender identity appear most frequently in the presence of testicular tissue irrespective of female or hermaphrodite (intersex) phenotype. In genetic men with the absence of male genitalia formation, caused by the aberrant function of androgen receptor, the gender identity depends on the severity of the disorder: female gender identity in the complete androgen insensitivity syndrome and female or male gender identity in the complete androgen insensitivity syndrome and female or male in the partial androgen insensitivity. These clinical observations confirm the experimental data indicating androgen role in the male gender identity creation. This knowledge is necessary for the decision of the direction of surgical correction of sex organs in children with ambiguous genitalia, which should not depend on the expected efficiency to perform sexual intercourse, but mostly on the expected or already present individual gender identity.",

      "abstract": "Romantic relationships are an essential element of healthy living. Although difficulties in love are encountered often, it seems that three kinds of behaviors in a romantic relationship are more susceptible to physical or psychiatric disorders: playing (sexually transmitted disease), suffering (major depressive disorder or suicide), and stalking (violence or homicide). Oxytocin plays an important role in pair-bonding. Elevated plasma oxytocin concentrations have been observed in new lovers when compared with singles. It is hypothesized that those who display these dangerous behaviors in a romantic relationship might possess specific oxytocin receptor gene aberrancy and the resultant deviant pair-bonding pattern is likely to recur in successive relationships. It is postulated that a blunted oxytocin surge might be observed in playing, whereas exaggerated oxytocin surge might be observed in suffering and stalking. The distinction between suffering and stalking might stem from the difference in their aggression tendencies. Those who suffer displays aggression toward self, while those who stalk displays aggression toward others. The exaggerated oxytocin concentrations in people who suffer and people who stalk might not be suppressed by the discouraging attitudes of their partners and might be maintained by rumination. Considering the whole-body influence of oxytocin, intranasal oxytocin application or gene therapy should be used exclusively for those who display these dangerous behaviors and not for the general population. Future research is warranted to confirm this hypothesis with analysis of modifiers such as gender.",

To address this topic, we conducted a secondary data analysis of 57 human sexuality students’ narratives regarding the emotional and situational contexts of the first sexual image they recalled. We examined those narratives where participants reported that they saw was a “real person” either nude or engaged in sexual behavior. These participants reported viewing three kinds of sexual behavior or nudity: parental, other family members, and nonfamily. In examining participants’ immediate reactions and long-term reflections, we found that many participants, especially females, were confused or upset by what they saw, but few reported a lingering discomfort. Our results indicate that children would benefit from immediate, nurturant, and clarifying parental responses, particularly when children walk in on parents having sex.",

The chapter looks at the age at which adolescents have their first sexual experience with a person of the same sex, and how this compares with the age at which they feel they have established a more or less permanent identity as lesbian, gay or bisexual. It describes how this type of experience and patterns of desire or identity are linked to romantic relationships, sexuality and living patterns. Gender identity among adolescent and young adult women is to a lesser extent tied to absolute expectations and taboos in this area. There are also strong indications that males' homosexual encounters and identity are established earlier and perhaps more rapidly than that of females.",

      "abstract": "Structured interviews with 3.5-12-year-old children and their mothers were directed at documenting the development of 4 psychological categories of food rejection. The first to appear is rejection based purely on sensory characteristics, usually taste ( distastes ). Rejection based purely on anticipated harm following ingestion appears next (danger). Finally, the oldest children and adults show rejection based on the idea of what something is or where it comes from. This ideational type of rejection further differentiates into affectively laden rejections of substances that become offensive ( disgusts ) and more neutral rejections of substances as simply not food (inappropriate). A critical psychological feature of disgusting substances in adults is that they are \"contaminants\": they render an otherwise liked food inedible if present even in trace amounts, or if associated with a liked food. Contamination sensitivity is not present in the younger subjects, and appears gradually in the age range studied. Young children are unaware of the physical chemistry of solutions (e.g., diffusion and its lack of reversibility) and therefore do not show a \"contamination response.\"",

      "title": "Sex differences in unipolar depression: Evidence and theory.",
      "abstract": "A large body of evidence indicates that women are more likely than men to show unipolar depression. Five classes of explanations for these sex differences are examined and the evidence for each class is reviewed. Not one of these explanations adequately accounts for the magnitude of the sex differences in depression. Finally, a response set explanation for the sex differences in depression is proposed. According to this explanation, men are more likely to engage in distracting behaviors that dampen their mood when depressed, but women are more likely to amplify their moods by ruminating about their depressed states and the possible causes of these states. Regardless of the initial source of a depressive episode (i.e., biological or psychological) men's more active responses to their negative moods may be more adaptive on average than women's less active, more ruminative responses. The epidemiology of a disorder can provide important clues to its etiology. When a disorder only strikes persons from one geographical region, one social class, or one gender, we can ask what characteristics of the vulnerable group might be making its members vulnerable. A frequent finding in epidemiological studies of mental disorders is that women are more prone to unipolar affective disorders than are men (Boyd & Weissman, 1981; Weissman & Klerman, 1977). A number of different explanations have been proposed to account for women's greater vulnerability to depression. Previous reviews of these explanations (e.g., Weissman & Klerman, 1977) have been quite brief and uncritical. In this article, the evidence for sex differences in unipolar depression first is summarized, then the most prominent explanations proposed for these sex differences are discussed in detail. These explanations include those attributing the differences to the response biases of subjects, as well as biological, psychoanalytic, sex role, and learned helplessness explanations. Although most of the proposed explanations for sex differences in depression have received some empirical support, not one of them has been definitively supported and not one as yet accounts for the magnitude of sex differences in depression. In the final section of this article it is suggested that differences in the ways that men and women respond to their own depressive episodes, whatever the origin of these episodes, may be an important source of the sex differences observed in depression.",

      "abstract": "Gynecological experiences are closely linked with a woman's mood1. Disturbances of her reproductive function can upset her sense of well-being, her feelings about her sexuality, her femininity, and her self-esteem. Symptoms may affect her intimate relationships and bring greater distress than symptoms in other systems. Women presenting with gynecological problems often appear tense and anxious just because of the nature of the intimate questions and examination which they anticipate with some apprehension. Some come distressed and tearful. They may feel shame and disgust about their symptoms or because of the reaction of others. Many find the whole consultation an ordeal. The examination can remind a woman of previous threatening situations such as rape or childhood sexual abuse, or past experience of painful or demeaning examinations by previous clinicians.",

      "abstract": "Abstract King Lear makes his daughters compete for inheritances by declaring “which of you . . . doth love us most.” His youngest refuses to let her dowry depend on displaying filial piety, instead declaring her fealty in the old, less emotional language of lineage: “I love your Majesty / According to my bond; no more nor less.” Brontë’s Heathcliff expresses the dialectic of lineage and affect in terms of affective will and testamentary wills. By asserting the former, he succeeds in revising the latter – forcing his dying son to name him his heir. Faulkner’s protagonists identify with grandparents in order to reassert older, extended lineage ties over unacceptable affective ties to parents or siblings. Or else they do just the opposite: repudiating lineages to miscegenetic or incestuous grandparents in order to form more responsible emotional bonds. Whichever generation they consciously identify with, they often end up unconsciously perpetuating the example of the generation they rejected. In family systems, role reversal often keeps things essentially the same. A homeostatic tendency resists the inevitabilities of children growing up and becoming parents, of parents growing old and reliving some of their former feelings of dependency as children, only now vis-à-vis their own children.",

      "abstract": "People occupy multiple social categories simultaneously (e.g., a White female), and this complex intersectionality affects fundamental aspects of social perception. Here, we examined the possibility that infant face processing may be susceptible to effects of intersectionality of sex and race. Three- and 10-month-old infants were shown a series of computer-generated face pairs (5 s each) that differed according to sex (Female or Male) or race (Asian, Black, or White). All possible combinations of face pairs were tested, and preferences were recorded with an eye tracker. Infants showed preferences for more feminine faces only when they were White, but we found no evidence that White or Asian faces were preferred even though they are relatively more feminized. These findings challenge the notions that infants' social categories are processed independently of one another and that infants' preferences for sex or race can be explained from mere exposure.",

We sought to understand factors associated with having greater self-worth about being Asian and Pacific Islander (API), being gay/bisexual, and being both gay/bisexual and API (dual identity). We conducted serial, cross-sectional surveys of 763 API men who have sex with men (MSM) annually from 1999 to 2002 in San Diego, California and Seattle, Washington. We found (a) sexual and ethnic identity were intertwined and mutually influential; (b) a positive attitude toward sexual identity was associated with higher socioeconomic status, greater social support, and self-identified homosexual orientation (as opposed to \"straight/undecided\"); (c) a positive dual identity was associated with higher socioeconomic status, greater social support, and levels of acculturation (being United States born and speaking English and another language equally); and (d) a positive sexual identity and dual identity were associated with HIV testing. The findings suggest that targeted programs should address cultural issues at the intersection of sexual and ethnic identity, promote social support and self-acceptance around homosexual identity, and help MSM build a positive sense of self to foster their self-esteem and HIV prevention self-efficacy.",

Self-ascribed masculinity-femininity (Self-M-F) and gender-related interests showed the largest heterosexual-homosexual differences (respective ds = .60 and 1.28 for men, and -1.28 and -1.46 for women) and the largest sex differences (respective ds = 2.83 and 2.65). Instrumentality and expressiveness showed much smaller heterosexual-homosexual and sex differences. Big Five traits showed a number of small-to-moderate heterosexual-homosexual and sex differences. Bisexual men were much more like gay men than like heterosexual men in their Self-M-F and gender-related interests, whereas bisexual women were intermediate between lesbian and heterosexual women. Homosexual participants were more variable on some gender-related traits than same-sex heterosexuals were. The gender inversion hypothesis-that gay men's traits tend to be somewhat feminized and that lesbians' traits tend to be somewhat masculinized-received considerable support. Results are discussed in terms of biological and psychosocial theories of gender and sexual orientation.",

First, both sexes would be more interested in watching men than women competing, and, second, there would be an interaction between the spectators’ sex and the athletes’ sex. Evidence from a study of 19 different sports finds support for both hypotheses, with the interaction showing that men are more interested than women in watching male sports.

      "title": "Boys and Girls on the Playground: Sex Differences in Social Development Are Not Stable across Early Childhood",
      "abstract": "Sex differences in human social behaviors and abilities have long been a question of public and scientific interest. Females are usually assumed to be more socially oriented and skilful than males. However, despite an extensive literature, the very existence of sex differences remains a matter of discussion while some studies found no sex differences whereas others reported differences that were either congruent or not with gender stereotypes. Moreover, the magnitude, consistency and stability across time of the differences remain an open question, especially during childhood. As play provides an excellent window into children's social development, we investigated whether and how sex differences change in social play across early childhood. Following a cross-sectional design, 164 children aged from 2 to 6 years old, divided into four age groups, were observed during outdoor free play at nursery school. We showed that sex differences are not stable over time evidencing a developmental gap between girls and boys. Social and structured forms of play emerge systematically earlier in girls than in boys leading to subsequent sex differences in favor of girls at some ages, successively in associative play at 3–4 years, cooperative play at 4–5 years, and social interactions with peers at 5–6 years. Preschool boys also display more solitary play than preschool girls, especially when young. Nevertheless, while boys catch up and girls move on towards more complex play, sex differences in social play patterns are reversed in favor of boys at the following ages, such as in associative play at 4–5 years and cooperative play at 5–6 years. This developmental perspective contributes to resolve apparent discrepancies between single-snapshot studies. A better understanding of the dynamics of sex differences in typical social development should also provide insights into atypical social developments which exhibit sex differences in prevalence, such as autism.",

      "title": "Gender and Family Status Across the Life Course: Constraints on Five Types of Leisure",
      "abstract": "Abstract The family context is considered as it impacts involvement in culturally defined categories of leisure: active, passive, entertainment, social leisure and TV-viewing as well as total leisure are considered. How does family context, which varies across the life course, constrain leisure? Does family context have the same impact for men and women and for married and unmarried? These issues are examined for a subset of a national sample of adults (N=782) who provided behavioral data through multi-day time budget diaries. Using comparable samples of time from each individual, analysis of variance is used to test for differences in means. Family structure is examined as it constrains and facilitates various types of leisure. Women, and in particular, single mothers, are expected to be disadvantaged in terms of leisure time and involvement. Results indicate a more complex interplay of family context, gender-and-marital status and types of leisure. Women in general are not disadvantaged in terms of leisure time, although involvement in types of leisure vary for men and women. Family context often leads to higher or lower amounts of leisure. Post hoc explanations are often necessary, since predictions of differences between those not currently parents and parents were too simple. Models that take family development context and gender into account seem necessary to understand the constraints and opportunities for leisure participation. Résumé Comment le contexte familial, qui varie avec les années, influe-t-il sur la participation aux catégories de loisir définies culturellement comme suit: loisir actif, loisir passif, spectacles, loisir social et écoute de la télévision, et loisir total? Quelles contraintes impose-t-il au loisir? A-t-il le même impact sur les femmes et les hommes, ou sur les personnes mariées et célibataires? La présente étude analyse ces questions à partir du sous-ensemble d'un échantillon national d'adultes (N=782) dont les données comportementales proviennent de compte rendus d'emploi du temps effectués quotidiennement à plusieurs reprises. L'analyse porte sur la structure familiale compte tenu de ses nombreux éléments contraignant ou facilitant la pratique de divers types de loisir. Les auteures font l'hypothèse que les femmes, et plus particulièrement les mères de familles monoparentales, sont désavantagées quant à la participation aux activités de loisir et au temps de pratique de ces activités. Les résultats font ressortir un lien plus complexe que prévu entre le contexte familial, le statut sexuel et conjugal et les types de loisir. Les femmes en général ne sont pas désavantagées relativement au temps de loisir, bien que la participation à diverses activités de loisir varie en fonction du sexe. Le contexte familial modifie souvent à la hausse ou à la baisse la quantité de loisir. Les auteures ont souvent dû recourir à des explications postérieures à l'analyse, puisque les prédictions relatives aux différences entre les parents et ceux qui ne le sont pas étaient trop élémentaires. Des modèles permettant de tenir compte du contexte de développement familial et du sexe s'avèrent nécessaires à la compréhension des éléments contraires ou favorables à la participation au loisir. Resumen ¿ Cómo el contexto familiar, que varía según los años, influencia la participación en las categorias de tiempo libre definidas culturalmente como sigue: tiempo libre activo, liempo libre pasivo, espectáculos, tiempo libre social y escucha de la televisión como distracción total? ¿ Qué dificultades impone al tiempo libre? ¿ Tiene el mismo impacto en las mujeres que en los hombres, o en las personas casadas como en las solteras? El presente estudio analiza estas preguntas desde el punto de vista de conjunto de una muestra nacional en los adultos (N=782) en la que los resultados de comportamiento provienen del tiempo dedicado diariamente en varias ocasiones. El análisis porta sobre la estructura familiar teniendo cuenta de los numerosos elementos que dificultan o facilitan la práctica de diversos tipos de tiempo libre. Las autoras defienden la hipótesis que las mujeres, y particularmente las madres de familias monoparentales, están desaventajadas cuanto a la participación en las actividades de tiempo libre y al tiempo de práctica de estas actividades. Los resultados resaltan un lazo más complejo que previsto entre el contexto familiar, el estatuto sexual y matrimonial y los tipos de tiempo libre. Las mujeres en general no están desaventajadas en relación al tiempo libre, apesar de que la participación a diversas actividades de tiempo libre variá en función del sexo. El contexto familiar modifica con frecuencia a más o a menos la cantidad de tiempo libre. Las autoras han debido recurrir con frecuencia a explicaciones subsecuentes al análisis, puesto que las predicciones relativas a las diferencias entre los que son padres y los que no lo son eran demasiado elementales. Los modelos que permiten tener cuenta del contexto de desarrollo familiar y del sexo son necesarios para la comprensión de los elementos contrarios o favorables a la participación del tiempo libre.",

      "abstract": "The goal of this research is to examine the specificity of social representations of infidelity among married and unmarried men and women. The hypothesis was advanced that married and unmarried men and women differ in their perception of infidelity. The differences depend on the gender and marital status, and pertain to definition of this concept and the underlying causes. The article employs the methods of questionnaire, content analysis, and the developed by the authors projective technique &amp;ldquo;draw infidelity&amp;rdquo;. It was established that the respondents view infidelity from two perspectives: those who commit adultery (more typical to men), and those against whom adultery was committed (more typical to women). Married individuals more often describe their own infidelity, while unmarried persons describe the infidelity of another partner. The main cause infidelity for men are new sensations (new sexual experience, etc.), while women it is love for another person (strong emotional experiences). Married respondents describe infidelity as a rare, tough, and long-term phenomenon. Unmarried respondents consider infidelity a rather frequent phenomenon that gives new experience in relationships. Women view infidelity as an emotional, passionate, and unique phenomenon. Men tend to assess infidelity as an indifferent, typical, and rational event. The acquired data can be used in family counseling on the problems of infidelity, as well as in psychological counseling overall. The results can also be used in psychoprophylactic work with youth on the question of family and marriage.",

We tested preschoolers’ predictions about the prosocial or antisocial manner in which people would behave toward each other. Four stories were presented to 3- and 4-year-old children. In each story, the protagonists could either cooperate, act in terms of their own interests, or adopt a behavior unrelated to the ongoing scenario. Children as young as 3 years of age expected the protagonists to behave prosocially – and even more so if the protagonists were female. The results suggest that, even at an early age, children are inclined to adopt a “Rousseau-like” stance rather than a “suspicious” or “pessimistic” Hobbesian stance.",

      "abstract": "Male androphilia (i.e., male sexual attraction to adult males) is considered an evolutionary paradox because it is partially influenced by genes and associated with decreased reproduction. Traits associated with attachment to genetic relatives (i.e., kin) could prompt increased kin-directed altruism, thereby offsetting decreased reproduction by helping kin reproduce. These traits include childhood separation anxiety and adulthood neuroticism, which have been associated with feminine gender expression. In prior research, gay men with a receptive (Bottom or Versatile) anal sex role (ASR) reported greater childhood gender nonconformity (GNC) than those with an insertive (Top) ASR. We examined whether ASR groups also differed on recalled childhood separation anxiety and adulthood neuroticism. The Separation Anxiety Scale-Revised and Big-Five Personality Inventory - short form were completed by 350 gay and 146 heterosexual men. For neuroticism, ASR preference groups differed from heterosexual men but not from one another. Gay men who preferred a Bottom or Versatile ASR reported higher recalled childhood separation anxiety than Tops and heterosexual men. Recalled childhood GNC mediated ASR group differences with heterosexual men on childhood separation anxiety. These results indicate that subgroups of gay men delineated by ASR differ on an evolutionarily relevant developmental trait, childhood separation anxiety.",

It was found that both health status and perceived partner's responsiveness are prominent moderators of the age effect.In the absence of social isolation and health issues, many older men show persistently active sexual lifestyles as evidenced in their interest and participation in sexual activities.

Individuals have to progress from the dependence of childhood to the independence and maturity of the adult state whilst they are still regarded by many adults as predominantly children. Adolescents have to cope with the central problem of identity and of motivation and ambitions. They have to come to terms with the perceptions and judgements of other people on them and often experience stress in situations where they feel they are unable to reach the ideals of themselves or of others. Relationships with the opposite sex and acceptance by friends become crucial since they are the only means of judging one's self-value until the individual has achieved a reasonable degree of confidence and self-integration. This dependence on the opinions of others or on perhaps inappropriate ideals can lead to strong feelings of insecurity or inadequacy in adolescents. Adults obviously face similar problems but the myriad of physical and physiological changes which adolescents experience serve to heighten their emotional sensitivity. As a consequence of these adjustment problems, adolescence is often a period of unrest, of questioning and sometimes of outright rebellion and hostility.",

      "title": "ROLE-WISHES AND GENERAL WISHES OF CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS",
      "abstract": "Wishing is a favorite pastime in our culture and is allowed considerable latitude. Children are permitted, even encouraged, to make and express wishes beyond the limits of allowable actions and demands, and beyond the limits of probable attainment. Wishes are goal-directed and express values. They indicate areas of dissatisfaction and levels of aspiration in the life-space of the wisher. They constitute an as yet insufficiently exploited resource for knowledge of child and adolescent development. Most studies of children's wishes been based on an essentially unstructured form of request in obtaining responses. The child is asked, in somewhat varying ways, to state what he would wish if his wishes could come true. In general, the analysis of responses has shown a high frequency of wishes for material objects and possessions, decreasing with age and being replaced by wishes for more general and inclusive benefits for self and others; a tendency for wishes to be predominantly extrovert rather than introvert, with a low incidence of wishes relating to personal shortcomings (4, 5); and a tendency for wishes to be concrete and realistic rather than abstract and irrealistic, but becoming more general with increasing age (4, 5, 9, 10, Ii). Sex differences been found indicating a higher interest among boys in personal achievement and possessions, and among girls in social and family relationships (4, Ii). It may be suspected, however, that wish responses are influenced by the form of request and by conditions under which responses are obtained. Boynton (i) and Gray (2), for example, asked the children what they would ask for if they could have anything they wanted. The responses were overwhelmingly in terms of material objects and possessions. Children's birthday wishes for their friends were collected by Wilson (6, 7), who interpreted these as projected wishes for self. His findings yielded significantly higher frequencies of wishes relating to vocations, activities and general benefits for self and fewer wishes for specific objects and possessions than were obtained from comparable groups in other studies (e.g., see Jersild, 4). Furthermore, the low frequency of some responses (e.g., relief from personal shortcomings, to be smarter, better looking, etc.) may not be indicative of the strength of these interests, but a function of the form of the request. This might hold in general with respect to the intro-",

      "abstract": "We analyze a repeated prisoners’ dilemma game played in a community setting with heterogeneous types. The setting is such that individuals choose whether to continue interacting with their present partner, or separate and seek a new partner. Players’ types are not directly observed, but may be imperfectly inferred from observed behavior. We focus on a class of equilibria that satisfy zero tolerance and fresh start. We find that the punishment for defecting and the reward for cooperating are driven by the formation and the dissolution of long-term, high-paying relationships: an individual who defects, aborts a long-term relationship that he is in, or that he might have entered into, is thrown into short-term interactions with individuals who are likely to defect and, consequently, receives low payoffs. On the flip side, an individual who cooperates, enters into or prolongs a long-term interaction with a partner who cooperates and, consequently, receives high payoffs.",

      "title": "The specific form of violence for constituting each relational model",
      "abstract": "People violently constitute relationships though circumcision and excision, brutal initiations, killing rivals to the throne, proving loyalty to a superior by killing someone who threatens him, and human sacrifice. People enhance their own relationships with their deities by extreme asceticism, flagellation, or amputating a digit as an offering; others facilitate a vision of their personal companion spirit by hanging themselves by hooks through their chest muscles. The conduct or performance of many relationships consists of organized, socially instituted violence such as boxing and mixed martial arts, ice-hockey checking and football tackling, or combat among warriors who fight for glory. Redressive and terminative violence in response to transgressions of social relationships includes all sorts of corporal and capital punishment: burning witches, killing adulterers, eye-for-an-eye vengeance and feuding, killing men who insult one’s honor, and honor suicide by those who have failed to do their duty. Redressive violence is ubiquitous, ranging from dueling to resolve a dishonor, judicial combat to determine guilt, lynching those perceived as disrespectful, beating wives perceived as having failed to be sufficiently dutiful, attacking husbands who are disrespectful jerks, terrorist bombing, and targeted killing by drones. Sometimes violence is intended to enforce a relationship by forestalling transgression – for example, by terrorizing subjects or slaves into submission. Torturing heretics and enemies falls somewhere in between redress and enforcement, as do violent self-defense and killing intruders. In honor cultures, killing a dishonored sister, daughter, or cousin terminates an intolerable relationship, cleansing the stain and thereby restoring the family honor. Innumerable cultures conduct, or used to conduct, trial by ordeal – for example, adjudicating witchcraft guilt by submerging the accused to see if she drowns, making her hold a hot iron to see if it burns her, or giving her poison to see if she dies. The atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki was morally motivated violence on a mass scale, motivated by MP proportionality cost and benefit computations aimed to reduce American casualties in the most efficient way. The most massive moral violence practices in history were twentieth-century ethnic cleansings, acts of “purifying the race” or the nation, where the removal or killing of persons construed to “pollute” the shared essence of a “people” was motivated by the feeling that “mixture” or “mongrelization” is evil, unnatural, disgusting, dishonorable, and dangerous.",

      "abstract": "Background: Men have rarely been involved in either receiving or providing information on sexuality, reproductive health or birth spacing. They have also been ignored or excluded in one way or the other from participating in many family planning programmes as family planning is viewed as a woman's affair. Aim: To describe the perceptions of family planning among low‐income men in Western Kenya. Methods: A qualitative study using focus group interviews and content analysis was conducted, with 64 men aged 15–54 years participating actively. Findings: Perceptions of family planning were manifold. For example, some perceived it as meaning having the number of children one is able to provide for. Most men knew about traditional and modern methods of birth control, although their knowledge was poor and misconceived. Modern methods were thought to give side effects, discouraging family planning. Low instances of family planning were also because of the fact that culturally, children are considered wealth. A law advocating family size limitation was regarded as necessary for the future. Conclusion: Men's perceptions of family planning are manifold. Their knowledge about contraception is poor and sometimes misconceived. Preferences regarding a child's gender are strong, thus attitudes and cultural beliefs that might hinder family planning have to be considered. A policy on male contraception and contraceptive services is seen as necessary.",

      "abstract": "This article contends that youth who engage in persistent coarse sexual improprieties and/or, sexually abusive behaviors are too often viewed primarily through a criminological lens, regardless of their age, gender, judicial status, and/or experiences of past trauma/victimization. Such a posture likely falsifies the clinical perception of the individual referred for \"treatment.\" Assessment and interventions for these youth must be holistic and idiosyncratic, considering numerous multiplex developmental variables (i.e., overall human sexual development, gender identity, sexual identity, sexual orientation, erotic development, intimacy deficits, adverse childhood experiences/trauma), as well as sociological and anthropological fundamentals. The lens for assessing and intervening with youth must also include in its focus the constantly changing Zeitgeist, that is, the spirit or the mood of the times. The proposed lens is applicable to all youth, adjudicated and non-adjudicated. Specific considerations are discussed related to those youth with a history of significant child maltreatment who later engage in persistent coarse sexual improprieties and/or sexually abusive behaviors.",

Peer cluster analysis and reciprocal \"best friend\" selections indicated that aggressive subjects tended to affiliate with aggressive peers. Even though highly aggressive children and adolescents were less popular than control subjects in the social network at large, they were equally often identified as being nuclear members of social clusters.

      "title": "A cooperative function for multisensory stimuli in the induction of approach behavior of a potential mate",
      "abstract": "Intrasexual competition is an important element of natural selection in which the most attractive conspecific has a considerable reproductive advantage over the others. The conspecifics that are approached first often become the preferred mate partners, and could thus from a biological perspective have a reproductive advantage. This underlines the importance of the initial approach and raises the question of what induces this approach, or what makes a conspecific attractive. Identification of the sensory modalities crucial for the activation of approach is necessary for elucidating the central nervous processes involved in the activation of sexual motivation and eventually copulatory behavior. The initial approach to a potential mate depends on distant stimuli in the modalities of audition, olfaction, vision, and other undefined characteristics. This study investigated the role of the different modalities and the combination of these modalities in the sexual incentive value of a female rat. This study provides evidence that the presence of a single-sensory stimulus with one modality (olfaction, vision, or ‘others’, but not audition) is sufficient to attenuate the preference for a social contact with a male rat. However, a multisensory stimulus of multiple modalities is necessary to induce preference for the stimulus over social contact to a level of an intact receptive female. The initial approach behavior, therefore, seems to be induced by the combination of at least two modalities among which olfaction is crucial. This suggests that there is a cooperative function for the different modalities in the induction of approach behavior of a potential mate.",

      "abstract": "La homosexualidad y otras expresiones de la sexualidad no reproductivas o sexualidades periféricas, han sido motivo de múltiples especulaciones y controversias. A lo largo de la historia, la homosexualidad ha sido vista desde distintas ópticas, dependiendo del momento histórico, respondiendo de formas muy diversas al contexto y sentir de la época. Para algunos, es una desviación, un desorden de la personalidad, una psicopatología, un estilo de vida, una transgresón a la imposición del modelo heteronormativo, una cuestión de moda, una búsqueda de nuevas experiencias, entre otros conceptos. La homosexualidad es la mayor atracción para relacionarse afectiva y eróticamente hacia personas del mismo género. El elemento que define la preferencia es la atracción, que no se refiere exclusivamente a la atracción sexual y erótica, sino también al simple y cotidiano hecho de que los seres humanos, al enfrentarse con un grupo mixto de personas, enfocarán su atención en individuos de un solo género en particular, con fundamento en el elemento esencial de la atracción. Así, es más adecuado y descriptivo hablar de preferencia de género en sustitución de la denominación de preferencia sexual u orientación sexual. Frente a la práctica generalizada de incluir toda conducta sexual no hetero sexual dentro de la perspectiva homosexual, habría que resaltar que la realidad homosexual, como la heterosexual, es muy compleja. Por ello no debe hablarse de homosexualidad sino de personas homosexuales, con historias, contextos y experiencias de vida distintas.",

This sentiment-- coupled with concern about too-early pregnancy and parenthood and the risk of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs)--has led to strong interest in identifying that are effective in postponing sexual initiation among youth (that is delaying sexual intercourse). Indeed over the past several years a growing body of scientific evidence has included examples of that have to varying degrees postponed sex. While some of these initiatives are actually called education programs others fall under the categories of youth development service learning sex education and HIV/AIDS education programs. These have used a variety of settings approaches curricula and even messages. Some emphasize abstinence until marriage while others promote abstinence as the only 100 percent effective way to avoid pregnancy. They serve boys and girls of various racial/ethnic groups ages and with a range of sexual experience. Such personal characteristics are relevant because they can affect the dynamics within the program and help explain the extent to which messages about abstinence and/or contraception resonate with the youth who receive them.

More women than men were distressed by imagining a partner forming a deep emotional attachment to another person and more men than women were distressed by imagining a partner enjoying passionate sexual intercourse with another person. In addition, more men than women were distressed by male-linked violations, such as a partner no longer trying to look attractive, and more women than men were distressed by female-linked violations, such as a partner no longer wanting to work. The results contribute to a growing body of cross-cultural research reporting gender differences in distress to emotional and sexual infidelity.

Instead of striving for fair-play and sport excellence which not exclude justness, solidarity and moral integrity, contemporary sport frequently follows the Lombardian ethic, where \"winning isn't everything, it's the only thing\". Moral pause or bracketed morality, as described in sport, refers to the phenomenon of tolerance and acceptance of aggressive behavior or cheating, that will be morally condemned outside sports arenas. Accordingly, lower levels of moral reasoning and behavior have been identified in athletes and non-athletes in the sports-related situation in comparison to other life situations; in athletes when compared to non-athletes, in more experienced athletes, high-level athletes, team-sport athletes, and male athletes. Moral reasoning and behavior of athletes are influenced by contextual and personal factors, with coaches having a particularly important role to play. The positive influence of sport on the moral development of athletes might be related to pre-service and in-service education of coaches how to develop adequate moral atmosphere, and how to plan for moral decision-making as an integral part of everyday practice.",

      "abstract": "The research evidence on sexual codes seems somewhat at odds with the popular view that teen-agers have a type of youth culture which, in its irresponsibility, extremism, and defiance, is in sharp conflict with the adult culture. The venereal disease rates, unwed motherhood rates, and studies of teen-age attitudes give evidence of a more conservative behavior pattern than exists for older couples. The most popular teen-age sexual codes are the double standard for boys and a petting-with-affection code for girls. Another code, which is minor and is strongest among older teen-agers, is permissiveness-with-affection, which allows coitus if there is a stable affectionate relation present. The custom of going steady is closely related to these codes, because our culture looks much more favorably upon sexual behavior when it occurs in such a stable, affectionate context as going steady affords. Finally, it should be noted that there are sharp class differences in sexual codes, and other factors such as education, religion, and ethnic group membership also affect teen-age sexual attitudes.",

All ages viewed excluders more negatively than includers, but only five‐ and six‐year‐olds preferred includers as play partners. Despite easily detecting and remembering exclusion events, younger children expressed no play partner preference. Children's verbal justifications revealed that older children choose partners more carefully and draw on a richer understanding of exclusion. More generally, the initial dissociation between social evaluation and preference formation underscores that these are distinct processes with different developmental trajectories.",

      "title": "Some effects of sexist videogames on women's negative perception",
      "abstract": "In our society, women are sexually objectified and are the target of sexist behaviors. Media and video games are a main channel of sexism and objectification of women. Several studies show that video game can impact players’ behavior. However the influence of sexist video games on negative perception of women is rather indefinite. In this thesis, we study the possible relationship between video games and the negative perception of women, to focus on its psychological mechanism. We argue that video games can work as a prime, activating in players’ memory some association between women and object, or some association between self-concept and masculinity, which in turn can increase negative perception of women. We also hypothesize that men, or players who highly identified with sexist game characters, are most impacted by sexist content of video games.In three studies we showed that there is an association between playing sexist video games and sexist attitudes, or women objectification. However we do not find that men are most impacted than women. Thus in other studies we test the moderating role of identification with sexist game character. In one study we show that players who highly identified with sexist game character associated more their self-concept with masculinity and gave more importance to women appearance rather than to her competence. In two other studies, we show that playing with sexist video game increases implicit associations of women with objects (especially for participants who highly identified with sexist game characters); however in the last study we do not replicate this result. Taken together, these studies show that regular video game playing is related to negative perception of women. Our results also suggest that identification plays a role in the impact of sexist video games and they encourage us to consider sexist content of video games as a prime that can make accessible some mental representations about one self or about women.",

Results showed that people who experienced serious negative life events in the past often had less active, less supportive and more strained sibling ties. The group that experienced a physical illness formed an exception, showing more supportive and active sibling ties, but also higher levels of conflict.

Sin embargo, no existe un fuerte consenso sobre los indicadores que determinan el poseer una buena o una mala salud sexual, y más cuando hablamos de una población de especial vulnerabilidad dados los múltiples cambios físicos, psicológicos y sociales a los que se enfrentan en poco tiempo. En el presente estudio exponemos el proceso de construcción de una batería de instrumentos para la evaluación de la salud sexual de los niños, niñas y adolescentes. Tras la realización de un completo proceso de valoración, guiado por múltiples expertos en el área, se ha concluido que tanto los conocimientos como las actitudes (p.ej. sexismo) y habilidades sexuales (p.ej. asertividad sexual) son un indicador principal. Asimismo, los comportamientos sexuales de riesgo (p. ej. búsqueda de sensaciones sexuales, adicción al sexo, al cibersexo o conductas de sexting), también se consideran variables importantes. Disponer de una batería de instrumentos validados en este grupo poblacional que recoja todos los aspectos relevantes para la valoración de su salud sexual va a permitir, no solo conocer más sobre la misma, sino también probar si la educación afectivo-sexual que reciben es adecuada y suficiente para asegurar un desarrollo sexual saludable.",

Compared to older cohorts, younger cohorts (18–24 year olds) of both men and women reported significantly earlier ages for sexual debut with same‐gendered partners, and earlier ages for coming out to themselves and to others. Also, women began the process at later ages than men, as they reported coming out to themselves and sexual debut with a same‐gender partner approximately two years later than men. There were no racial or ethnic differences in age out to self or others; however, people of color were less likely to be out to their parents. Service providers, sexuality educators, and researchers should attend to the diversity in experience of coming out among GLB populations as they relate to the individuals' gender, age, and racial and ethnic backgrounds.",

      "abstract": "HIV/AIDS prevention work has been mainly designed by professionals and has reached mainly educationally and economically advantaged groups. This study involved men who have sex with men in working-class milieux, using life- history and action-research methods in two cities. Material drawn from twenty-one case studies is presented. The economic, domestic and educational relationships of working-class life shape sexual identity and practice. A muted and undifferentiated erotic milieu in childhood is the common starting point for very different trajectories into adult homosexual relationships, though 'beats' are generally important in making connections. A stronger network and sense of community appears in the provincial city than in the metropolis. Economic vulnerability and cultural constraint shape homosexual experience. Sex in long-term relationships is the most valued (though not the most common) and is more likely to involve anal intercourse; significant risks arise here. A complex political and cultural process shapes sexual practice as reciprocal or one-way and as more or less skilled. 'Gay identity' is not sought by most of these men, whose personal style more often draws on conventional working-class masculinities. But contradictions about desire and femininity are simultaneously present and sometimes destabilise masculinity. Responses to the HIV epidemic first involved withdrawal from sexual activity, then growth of activism. A 'barefoot educator' community activism has already emerged and should be a focus of HIV/AIDS prevention strategy",

      "title": "Some Considerations About Sexual Abuse and Children with Sexual Behavior Problems",
      "abstract": "SUMMARY In the mid 1980s treatment programs for children twelve years and younger who molested other children began to appear. There was little known about these children and there were numerous misconceptions about this population. It was believed that the primary etiological factor in the development of this behavior was previous hands-on sexual abuse to the child. It was also believed that a majority of sexually abused children would engage in problematic sexual behaviors and that it was quite likely that they would go on to molest others. In the intervening years a great deal has been learned about children who molest. The diversity of reasons for the development of problematic sexual behavior has been researched. Another important finding is that there is a range of disturbed sexual behaviors in children. This is important as there has been an overidentification of children who engage in problematic sexual behaviors as children who are molesting. A continuum of sexual behaviors in children is described which delineates three groups of children who engage in problematic sexual behavior, only one of which is molesting other children. With this understanding professionals can distinguish between children who engage in natural and healthy sexual behaviors, sexually-reactive behaviors, extensive but mutual sexual behaviors, and children who molest. This assists in more accurate assessment and treatment planning in an era in which children can be placed on sex offender registries and potentially be subject to community notification.",

Some have endured gross insensitivity, disrespect, indifference, imbalance in give-and-take, or ingratitude. Substance abuse or destructive family patterns may have compromised or even ruined what could have been so much better. Sometimes we become unusually dependent on those who have died-to the point at which some of us have merged our identities with theirs, deferred to them on almost all decisions, or allowed them to manage nearly all details of our lives. Some of us have struggled with another’s attempts to control, manipulate, dominate, or even possess us. Some of us have been abused and actually harmed physically, sexually, or psychologically.

Multiracial (but not monoracial) participants reported heightened interest in interacting with an accurate partner.

      "abstract": "Previous research has documented a strong preference for attractiveness from infancy to adulthood, across many social contexts. However, direct evidence about someone’s personality, specifically evidence about prosociality and altruistic behavior, should also have an effect on decisions about friendship initiation. Little research has explored the relative weight of physical attractiveness and prosocial behavior in friendship decisions. If these two salient cues were pitted against each other, which would be more important for fostering friendships, especially in early development? The current study tested whether children would prefer a nice-unattractive or a mean-attractive peer, by pairing photos of children varying in rated attractiveness with stories of good and bad behavior. Three-year-olds of both sexes chose based on attractiveness. Four-year-old boys also preferred attractiveness, but four-year-old girls strongly preferred niceness. These results reveal the developmental origins of an important sex difference in friendship decisions. These early preferences may reflect children’s internalization of gender schemas and socialization away from an innate tendency towards preferring physical attractiveness.",

In specific, we distinguish the situations in which such an opportunity can be planned versus when it comes as a surprise. We utilize data from an existing published research and show that when the opportunity to tell a lie comes as a surprise, then on the first occasion, males lie more than females. However, when telling lies can be planned, then there is no gender difference in telling a lie. When planning is possible, females tell more lies in the first occasion compared to when it is not possible to plan; males do not show such behavior. On the second and final occasion, males tell more lies than females when they either could not plan but had the opportunity to a lie before, or could plan but did not have to tell a lie before. These observations can be interpreted in terms of the gender differences in consistent versus compensatory moral behavior.",

      "title": "Sex, status, and criminality: A theoretical nexus*",
      "abstract": "Abstract Abstract This article offers a theoretical explanation for relationships between social status and involvement in serious and persistent criminal behavior from an evolutionary perspective. The theory's central premise is that natural selection has produced females who bias their mating choices toward males who strive for status. This bias has resulted in males devoting greater time and energy to status striving (relative to females). To account for why nearly all \"victimizing\" forms of criminality are more common among males than among females, the theory asserts that status striving exists along a continuum of competitive/victimizing behavior. One end of this continuum is epitomized by crude (criminal) forms of the behavior that societies generally discourage and even punish. The other end consists of sophisticated (commercial) forms that societies tolerate and even encourage. According to the theory, most males begin to exhibit non‐playful forms of competitive/victimizing behavior around the onset of puberty as they start their reproductive careers. Adolescent males with the greatest abilities to learn will transition quickly from crude forms of competitive/victimizing behavior to more sophisticated forms, while males who have the greatest difficulties learning will transition more slowly. A major deduction from the theory is that genes on the Y‐chromosome must be affecting the brain in ways that promote status‐striving behavior. This deduction needs empirical scrutiny, although it is consistent with evidence (a) that the Y‐chromosome transforms would‐be ovaries into testes, the latter being specialized organs for the production of testosterone, and (b) that testosterone alters brain functioning in ways that contribute to both status striving and criminality.",

      "abstract": "Although adults generally prefer helpful behaviors and those who perform them, there are situations (in particular, when the target of an action is disliked) in which overt antisocial acts are seen as appropriate, and those who perform them are viewed positively. The current studies explore the developmental origins of this capacity for selective social evaluation. We find that although 5-mo-old infants uniformly prefer individuals who act positively toward others regardless of the status of the target, 8-mo-old infants selectively prefer characters who act positively toward prosocial individuals and characters who act negatively toward antisocial individuals. Additionally, young toddlers direct positive behaviors toward prosocial others and negative behaviors toward antisocial others. These findings constitute evidence that the nuanced social judgments and actions readily observable in human adults have their foundations in early developing cognitive mechanisms.",

      "abstract": "A theory of pseudomaturity or precocious development has been suggested to explain how mis-timing of adult transition events (occurring too early) can generate difficulties later in life. In a community sample, the age at which 30 adult activities (including various types of drug involvement) were begun were examined for an underlying factor structure, sex differences, and general and specific correlates with various aspects of adult functioning. Five factors were identified, confirmed, and moderately correlated including age of; drug initiation, financial autonomy, independent living, intimacy involvement, and deviant activities. Age at puberty did not load on any factor and was only significantly related to age of intimacy Involvement. Men were involved in drug use, financial autonomy, and deviant activities earlier than women, whereas women began puberty and intimacy at younger ages than the men. Pseudomaturity as reflected in a general construct and specific scales was significantly associated with numerous aspects of later adult role functioning, including drug abuse, socioeconomic status, intimacy involvement, emotional distress, divorces, criminal activities, and job instability. Although certain pseudomature behaviors consistently had adverse later consequences (early drug initiation to later drug abuse), others had differential impact on adult role functioning based on whether the transition event occurred in isolation (financial autonomy alone had beneficial long-term effects) or whether it was associated with a general lifestyle of pseudomaturity (with overall negative consequences).",

Piaget was one of the first psychologists to describe this in detail, and since then several other investigators have described the changes which occur up to 21/2 or 3 years of age. Older children engage in more role play than object-fantasy play, and in more socially interactive pretend play. However, after the age of 6 or 7 years, symbolic play generally becomes less frequent as children engage more in rule-governed games such as hop-scotch, tag and football. Several psychologists have attempted to draw closer parallels between the development of pretend play and the development of language. Whatever the link between symbolic play and language production or comprehension, there is another parallel with written, narrative language. Fantasy and socio dramatic play episodes are themselves acted-out narratives or stories.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Despite increasing racial diversity in the United States, and the particular growth of multiracial populations, questions about how children perceive others’ (bi)racial identities remain poorly understood. In two preregistered studies, we asked White and racially minoritized American children ( N = 157; 4–11‐years old) and White and multiracial adults ( N = 226) how acceptable it was for monoracial people (Black or White; Study 1) and/or biracial people (Black–White; Studies 1 and 2) to claim either a monoracial or biracial identity. Consistent with past research with adults, children said that monoracial people should claim (only) the monoracial identity which matched their ancestry. Judgements about biracial identity were more variable. White and multiracial adults (Study 2) reported that biracial targets could claim a racial identity that matched either or both of their parents, with biracial claims being evaluated most positively. Exploratory analyses on children's judgements about biracial people's identity claims (Study 1) revealed different patterns of development for White children and children from minoritized backgrounds. Whereas White children became more likely with age to report that all identity claims were acceptable, children from racially minoritized groups became more likely with age to endorse biracial targets who claimed a biracial identity. These findings suggest that children's own racial background and age may have a larger impact on their perceptions of biracial people's identities, compared to their perceptions of monoracial people's identities.",

Adolescents also commonly defend against awareness of these conflicts by denying their significance and conceptualizing them as mere stimulants or concomitants of physiologic arousal. Internet pornography provides a particularly powerful means by which some adolescents can disguise or obliterate the meaning of personal masturbation fantasies and so be spared the anxiety associated with the fantasies and their conflicted meaning.",

      "title": "Nonconsensual Insemination: Seminally Transmitted Diseases as Intimate Partner Violence",
      "abstract": "Some men use sex to damage women. These men willfully, i.e., intentionally, knowingly, recklessly, or wantonly, transmit sexually transmitted diseases (STD’s) to their partners as an act of intimate partner violence (IPV). IPV is heavily correlated with patriarchal attitudes that govern both partners, and especially men. Women or gay partners who subscribe to feminine sex/gender roles may be victimized by patriarchal. (This group of women and men will be denoted as “WM” in this article). Society and the justice system are influenced by two false patriarchal beliefs. The first is that condom use correlates with consensual sex and feminine sexual agency. The second is that unprotected sex indicates that insemination is consensual. Even though some states have criminalized the knowing transmission of specific STD’s and some states have only criminalized the transmission of HIV, the law has failed to deter what psychologists and criminologists have observed for decades, which is that often, men willfully contaminate an intimate partner with a sexually transmitted disease (STD) as an act of intimate partner violence (IPV). Irrespective of whether WM consent to unprotected sex, men who knowingly transmit STD’s to WM through ejaculation (“seminal transmission”) should be held criminally liable unless, 1) their partners specifically consented to being inseminated, and, in addition, 2) the partners assumed the risk of transmission. It is the first prong of this test that is novel with respect to current jurisprudence and social attitudes about condom use, consent, coercion, and the cycles of intimate partner violence. Using Dr. Lenore Walker’s retelling of the Cassandra myth as an analogy, first, this paper will analyze the systemic context of coercion in which WM become inseminated. In the first section, this paper presents psychological and criminological data to explain how patriarchal perspectives influence and infect society and justice. Next, this paper analyzes current seminal transmission laws, current perspectives on those laws, and how those laws fail to punish patriarchal IPV. Finally, this paper will propose a new law that recognizes nonconsensual insemination and seminal transmission as possible acts of IPV and domestic violence (DV). The proposed law suggests a penalty that empowers the victim.",

      "abstract": "With a phenomenological approach, we explored transgender and non-binary people’s strategies to experience sexual well-being. Ten self-reports (seven interviews and three written texts) were analyzed, and the analysis resulted in six themes. The first three (Affirming oneself, Having access to care, and Being respected as one’s gender) were strategies for sexual well-being realized through affirming one’s identity, receiving the gender-confirming care wanted, and having one’s gender identity respected by others. The other three themes (Masturbating and fantasizing, Communicating and being open, and Being sexually free in queer spaces) were strategies for one aspect of sexual well-being—pleasure. The results describe strategies that all can learn from: the need to accept and appreciate oneself, not just adapt to gender norms of bodies and behaviors, and to communicate. In addition, it illuminates that being norm-breaking, or stepping out of the gendered paths presented to you, appears to provide new opportunities for people to learn what they enjoy, and this could lead to a broader repertoire of pleasurable sexual practices—practices that take bodily prerequisites into account.",

This effect stems partly from men’s motivation to conform to the antifemininity norm of masculinity. This study investigated whether perceived changes in men’s gender roles moderates this effect. Straight male participants (N 166) read information that (a) gay men’s gender expression is either feminine or masculine, and that (b) men’s gender role in society is either remaining masculine or becoming more feminine. They then reported their attitudes toward gay people. Results showed that the GGEE appears in the condition where men remain masculine, but fades away in the condition where men are becoming feminine. Specifically, we observed negative attitudes toward gay people regardless of their gender expression when gay men are portrayed as masculine and men’s gender role in society is evolving (becoming more feminine). This effect was observed among participants who most strongly endorse the traditional antifemininity norm of masculinity. Implications of changes in gender norms are discussed.",

      "title": "Discrimination",
      "abstract": "Discrimination refers to an act, policy, practice, or social structure that creates, maintains, or reinforces an advantage for some groups and their members over other groups and their members. Discrimination, which can occur at the individual, institutional, and cultural levels, represents unfair treatment and can be distinguished from two other forms of bias: (i) prejudice, which is an attitude reflecting an overall evaluation of a group, and (ii) stereotypes, which are associations and attributions of specific characteristics to a group. Although prejudice, stereotypes, and discrimination at the individual level are generally positively associated empirically, prejudice and stereotypes do not necessarily lead to discrimination, and discrimination can occur in the absence of conscious prejudice and stereotypes. Classic contributions on this topic characterized discrimination mainly in terms of negative actions by individuals—ranging from verbal comments to physical injury—directed to harm of another group and its members. However, in addition to blatant and direct forms of discrimination, discrimination may be displayed as unjustified positive treatment of members of one’s own group relative to members of another group, or it may represent actions toward members of another group that initially appear favorable but ultimately disadvantage the other group in the longer term (e.g., patronizing behavior, such as chivalry). Discrimination is often represented in terms of the behavior of individuals directed toward members, but these acts are not necessarily consciously motivated. Moreover, individual bias expressed by individuals is not necessary for discrimination to be experienced by members of some groups. Instead, discrimination may be enacted broadly through institutional structures and policies or embedded in cultural beliefs and representations that value various groups differently. Thus, individual-, institutional-, and cultural-level processes may operate in concert to provide some groups systematic advantages and/or to impose disadvantages on other groups. Often these influences are cloaked in justifications or ideologies that obscure the unfairness of the influences and thus allow the discriminatory nature of the treatment to go undetected and unaddressed. The remainder of this examination of discrimination considers (i) personality and individual differences related to behaving in a discriminatory way, (ii) social psychological influences that promote discrimination, (iii) subtle manifestations of discrimination, (iv) institutional and cultural forms of bias; (v) the impact of discrimination psychologically and physically, and (vi) ways of combating discrimination.",

Men and women college students who had entered casual sexual liaisons were asked to describe the reasons or motives that prompted their behavior in a free response, essay format. As expected, men and women generated similar reasons. Specifically, both genders emphasized intraindividual factors (e.g., sexual desire, sexual experimentation, physical pleasure, alcohol use) and factors associated with the casual sex partner (e.g., attractiveness) as reasons for their short-term sexual encounter(s). In addition, however, a number of gender differences were found. Men more than women emphasized social environmental reasons (e.g., status enhancement, normative peer group behavior), whereas women more than men cited interpersonal reasons (e.g., increase probability of long-term commitment from sex partner) for casual sex. These results are in accord with predictions generated by social context and evolutionary models of human mating.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Previous research on semifree‐ranging mandrills has shown that the degree of secondary sexual development differs among adult males. While some males are social, brightly colored, and have large testes and high levels of plasma testosterone, other males are peripheral or solitary, and lack fully developed secondary sexual features. In order to determine how these differences among males arise, and to investigate the influence of social factors, we examined the adolescent development of 13 semifree‐ranging male mandrills of known age. Testicular volume began to increase markedly at 5.5 yr, and males began to develop secondary sexual adornments at the age of 6 yr. Males attained adult size and secondary sexual development at an average age of 9 yr. As males developed, they peripheralized, decreasing from 100% group‐associated at 5 yr to 20% at 8 yr. At 9 yr some males reentered the social group and attained alpha rank, while others remained peripheral or solitary. Within this average development, there was marked variation among males in the timing of development. Adolescent males that were dominant for their age had higher testosterone levels, larger testes, and more advanced secondary sexual development than subordinate males. The implications of these findings are discussed in the light of differences that occur among adult males, male–male competition, and the evolution of secondary sexual adornments in this species. Am.

Research has to some extent supported traditional stereotypes of males as more assertive or independent (agency) and females as more relational or affiliative (communion). Males are on average more aggressive than females even after relational aggression is taken into account. In the expression of empathy and prosocial behavior, situational context plays a larger role for males than females. Males’ gender tendencies have been characterized as instrumental (“report talk,” object oriented, etc.) and females’ as socially and emotionally expressive (“rapport talk,” people oriented, etc.). In social relationships, adolescent girls generally engage in more intimate self-disclosure and active listening, provide more emotional support to one another, and emphasize affiliation and collaboration. Both biological and social experiential or cultural factors are involved in the formation of these morally relevant gender differences. Although average gender-linked differences in emphasis remain evident, a blend of instrumental and expressive characteristics may contribute to optimal morality for both genders. Sandra Bem termed the mixture of expressive (traditionally feminine) and instrumental (traditionally masculine) attributes in gender style “androgyny.” Highly androgynous adolescents and adults of both genders evidence more mature moral judgment and more adequate mental health.",

      "title": "Strategies adopted by sexual offenders to involve children in sexual activity",
      "abstract": "The findings suggest prevention tactics that recognize the importance of structuring children's interaction with adults outside the family, rather than fostering informal or private contacts. The study found that offenders who used persuasion to involve their child victims in sexual activity were more likely to have a prior history of such offending, which suggests that this tactic has worked for them in the past and reduced the risk that their offense would be detected. In many cases, the same victim had been abused repeatedly. In some cases, keeping the victims silent about the abuse involved subtle, manipulative threats such as the withdrawal of love and abandonment. The study also found that offenders who abused older children were more likely to use persuasive rather than forceful tactics. This may mean that older victims, although initially resistant to sexual activity with the offender, may be more responsive to being treated as a sexual partner than are younger children. A third finding was that offenders who acted under the strong influence of deviant sexual fantasies were more likely to use persuasive tactics with their victims. Such offenders tended to have avoidant and dependent personalities, which not only explained their attraction to non-threatening children, but also explained their reluctance to behave aggressively. The study sample consisted of 226 adult males who had been convicted of a sexual offense against a child 13 years old or younger. Data were obtained from a 6-week assessment of risk level and treatment needs when admitted for incarceration in Canada between 1995 and 2000.",

      "abstract": "During the recent Olympic games, there was a cloud of controversy especially in the contact sport of boxing where an athlete (identifies as a woman but was previously detected to be chromosomally a man) defeated a woman athlete in under a minute by tap-out. Such instances are becoming common especially when different federations have different regulatory requirements for gender classification. This raises the concern of athlete safety, potential insurance coverage issues and potential abuse for future events. Doping and hormonal manipulation aside, are the women athletes competing with the transgender group (men who identify as women) at an equal competing level? Perhaps the way forward is by either maintaining sporting events for same-sex and transgender athletes (men who identify as women), having separate categories for transgender athletes or to even consider having events without gender categories (to promote inclusivity and equality). After all, we already have literature showing that suppressed testosterone levels (in a man who identifies as a woman) still provides an athlete with an unfair advantage over a woman. A consensus must be reached before such instances occur in team-based events for competition.",

      "abstract": "Introduction.So far we have spoken about social norms and standards of sexual behaviour.However, how these standards are reflected in our minds, and what lies in the basis of the sexual motivation of the individual remain open questions.Criticism of the instinctivist model of libido does not mean denying the biological determinants of sexuality.In the mid-1960s, R. Whalen proposed to replace the abstract concept of \"power of desire\" with a more specific concept of sexual excitability, i.e., readiness to respond to a sexual situation sexually and erotically.Sexual excitability has great individual variations determined by the physiological state of the body (hormonal balance and such) as well as the life (sexual, emotional, and communicative) experience of the subject and their non-sexual motives.According to R. Whalen, sexual arousal, i.e., current, temporary psychophysiological state, is a function of stable excitability of the subject, and particular given external and internal situation.Modern psychological literature describes sexual motivation in terms of the theory of needs, the theory of emotion, and cognitive psychology alike.However, the most productive theory in terms of opportunities for integrating psychological and sociological data is the theory of \"sexual script\" suggested by William E. Simon and John Gagnon.Presenting main material.As the special studies show, erotic dreams, night dreams, and fantasies are an essential aspect of our sexuality.They do not only substitute actual sex life or fill in its deficit, as S. Freud believed, but also constantly accompany it.More sexually active people also have more intense erotic imagination that supports, encourages and diversifies their real experience.For those brought up in Victorian spirit, the words \"erotic\" and \"eroticism\" sound as offensive phrases denoting something \"animal\" and low.In fact, animals do not know what eroticism is.The ability to not only respond to erotic signs and images, but also create them implementing your imagination is an exclusively human property, inherent to us, as the history of art says, from ancient times.Erotic images perform four main functions.First, they are all tools of cognition, displaying and capturing sexually significant properties and experiences.Second, they serve as a kind of psychological stimulants of sexual arousal.Third, they expand the",

The present study (1) demonstrated that the preferential rape pattern co‐occurs with the above reasonably well established expressions of courtship disorder to a higher degree than other main paraphilic activity patterns do and (2) supported the conjecture that in addition to an erotic preference for unfamiliarity of target person‐or‐object (noted by earlier authors), three other paraphilic target‐person or object preferences may be connected with courtship disorder, though they are not at all virtually obligatory as is erotic unfamiliarity. These are choosing children and adults alike as target persons of the paraphilic activities, non‐gender dysphoric transvestism, and fetishism.",

Although adult gamers are also known to be vulnerable to addictive playing behaviours, this aspect of highly engaged gaming among adults has rarely been investigated. To address this issue, biographical interviews were conducted with 35 adult gamers to explore their interaction with the game, integration of gaming into everyday life, and social interaction in real and virtual life. Participants were also asked about their reasons for becoming involved in highly engaged gaming, and for ending that involvement. The findings indicate that highly engaged adult gamers are a heterogeneous group. Three general types of gamer emerged from the interviews. One of these types showed no signs of problematic behaviour; however, the other two types tended to neglect aspects of everyday life and the real-life social environment in their playing behaviours.",

      "title": "Faculty Opinions recommendation of Escalation, retreat, and female indifference as alternative outcomes of sexually antagonistic coevolution.",
      "abstract": "Verbal and quantitative genetic models of sexually antagonistic coevolution suggest that coevolutionary arms races should be common. Sexual selection favors exaggeration of male persistence traits that are costly to females, and females, in turn, are selected to resist these traits. The heightened resistance by females is thought to then favor further exaggeration in the male trait, leading to an escalating coevolutionary arms race between persistence and resistance traits. Much of this theory, however, is based on an (implicit) assumption that there are tight constraints on how female resistance can evolve. We develop a theory that identifies and relaxes these constraints, allowing female resistance to evolve in a fashion that better reflects known empirical patterns in the evolution of female preference functions (the resistance trait). Our results suggest that evolutionary arms races that lead to the exaggeration of persistence and resistance will be much less common than formerly predicted. Females sometimes evolve indifference to male traits rather than resistance and can even evolve to discriminate against these traits. These alternative outcomes depend on the existence of genetic variance in the components of the female sensory system underlying female resistance and on the strength of natural selection acting on these components. Female indifference tends to evolve when natural selection on the sensory system is weak, and under these conditions, sexually antagonistic coevolution tends not to reduce female fitness significantly at equilibrium. When natural selection on the female sensory system is strong, however, then arms races are more likely, and female fitness is then sometimes significantly depressed at equilibrium. Sexually antagonistic coevolution is thus likely to have strong deleterious effects on population fitness only when female sensory traits are under strong natural selection to perform functions in addition to those involved with mating. Together, these results suggest that identifying the nature of genetic variation in and the strength of natural selection on female resistance should be a central goal of future studies of sexual conflict.

An online survey of 477 gay and bisexual men showed that, despite the prevailing muscular and lean gay body ideal, many men with less ideal bodies also preferred to watch pornographic actors with body types similar to their own. Self-perceived attractiveness, having an ideal body type, and viewing Internet pornography in longer sessions each made a unique contribution to higher self-esteem as a sexual partner. Preferring to watch pornographic actors with ideal bodies was not related to sexual self-esteem. The findings underscore the importance for gay or bisexual men of both self-perceived attractiveness and being athletic or young and fit, for a positive self-evaluation of sexual performance and competence.",

However, infanticide by males as an evolutionary mechanism is unlikely to occur in primates, and is equally unlikely in lions. To investigate the sexual selection hypothesis of infanticide for lions, four questions should be considered: (1) because they all mate freely with lionesses, are male pride lions closely related? (often they are not), (2) do males kill the young cubs when they join a pride? (few such cases have been observed), (3) do the females then mate with the new males to produce offspring? (yes), and (4) do the males remain with the pride for over two years to protect this new generation? (often not). Field data indicate that in NO instance do we know that male lions killed cubs in a new pride, mated with their mother, and then remained with the pride to protect their own young. Rather, female lions may kill more cubs than males and certainly cause many more cub deaths by allowing them to starve, [ infanticide by male lions, infanticide hypothesis, faulty science]",

Children, across groups, demonstrated more positive attitudes towards their gender ingroup. Children who showed more pro‐ingroup attitudes also showed more pro‐ingroup behavioural discrimination. Girls showed stronger ingroup favouritism than boys, but ethnic and regional groups generally did not vary in levels of bias.

The results show, first: phornograph is limited by ‘subjective reason’ such as if the phornography is aimed for personal interest, then the action is not phornography. The other is ‘action-room limitation’ in which an action can be formulated as phornography if the standard and characteristic in the room where the action is done consideres that the action is obscene or aims to sexual exploitation. The room refers to specific place such as beach, roadside, hotel, or other specific places, not wide social room.

Factors influencing individual differences in these aspects of affective behavior include temperament, context of situation, and parents, to name a few. Gender differences in the expression of affective behaviors have also been implicated in past research. However, differences are not always found, especially before preschool ages. This study examined the presence of gender differences and moderating influences of gender on the expression of distress and mother‐oriented behaviors (e.g., comfort seeking and proximity to mother) in 24‐month‐old toddlers during a series of situations designed to elicit either fear or frustration. Girls were more likely to seek contact from mother and stay in closer proximity to her compared to boys even after controlling for distress. However, the association between distress and contact seeking or proximity was significant for boys but not for girls. The discussion focuses on implications for biological and socialization effects of sex‐typed behavior and consequences for adjustment.",

The current study examines this phenomenon among a sample of young nonheterosexual women who underwent 3 interviews over a 5-year period. Over a quarter of these women relinquished their lesbian/bisexual identities during this period: half reclaimed heterosexual identities and half gave up all identity labels. These women did not differ from those who maintained lesbian/bisexual identities regarding the age at which they underwent sexual identity milestones, the factors that precipitated their sexual questioning, or their recollection of childhood \"indicators\" of same-sex sexuality. Women who relinquished their identities for heterosexual identities had smaller ratios of same-sex to other-sex attractions across the 5-year assessment period, but their attractions did not significantly change. Only 1 woman described her previous same-sex identification as a phase; the rest emphasized changes in how they interpreted or acted on their attractions.",

      "abstract": "New options for HIV and AIDS education assume that people make decisions based on their assessment of level of risk and that their actions are dependent on their ability to change the situation and their feelings, values, and needs. Safe sex practices, including the use of condoms, provide more choices for people than sexual abstinence, staying with one sexual partner, or having sex with fewer partners. Condom use also helps prevent unwanted pregnancy. Some options for practicing safer sex include nonpenetrative sex or penetrative sex with a condom. Oral sex is less risky than unprotected penetrative vaginal or anal sex, but this should be avoided if there are sores on the genitals, mouth, or lips. When a condom is used with oral sex, or a piece of latex is placed over a woman's genitals, risk is further reduced. Safer sex is an activity that prevents semen, vaginal fluids, and blood from entering another person's body or coming into contact with broken skin. Safe sex options should be presented in a positive manner which encourages people to explore what methods would be comfortable to use with their partners. The topic of why people do not use condoms can be introduced at an appropriate time in a general discussion of the benefits of safer sex. Some benefits include protection against HIV, sexually transmitted diseases, and pregnancy and a reduction in the risk of pelvic inflammatory disease and cervical cancer among women. Safer sex has no side effects, and the tight fit of a condom for some men helps maintain an erection. The important consideration in condoms is proper use. Practice reduces the chances of breakage. Groups can practice on a model penis made of wood, rubber, or clay. Proper storage of condoms is required for effectiveness. A cool, dark, dry place is needed. Condoms should not be used when brittle or sticky, or after an expiration date. A woman's arousal and release of lubricants assures ease of penetration and reduction in the chances of condom breakage. Use of vaseline or butter damages condoms. Condom use instructions are provided.",

      "abstract": "It is difficult to develop good arguments when the central terms of the discussion are unclear – as with the current confused state of sex and gender terminology. Sports organisations and sports researchers often talk in gender terms when they mean sex; or use the sex and gender vocabularies interchangeably. We propose the use of terminology that distinguishes sex from gender. Historically, sport has been based on sex, as seen in various sex verification procedures specifying female eligibility, based on the determination of sex by biological criteria. We think that this should be reflected in the vocabulary used for the two sport categories (‘male’ and ‘female’, not ‘women’ and ‘men’); and for referring to the binary as the sex binary (not the gender binary); and for calling the procedures sex verification (not gender verification).",

Many individual or personal factors are associated with desire, including demographic attributes (e.g., chronological age, gender), mental and physical health variables (e.g., chronic illness, mood disorders), and hormonal processes (e.g., testosterone levels). Interpersonal factors are also associated with sexual desire; both passionate love and overall relationship health (e.g., satisfaction, commitment, adjustment) are strongly linked with the amount of sexual desire that individuals feel for their partners. Reductions in sexual desire are common in most romantic relationships; however, sudden or sharp decreases may signal the development of an underlying interpersonal issue. Although less examined than other variables, sociocultural factors, including norms, stereotypes, laws, and religious doctrine, may also inhibit or facilitate the experience and expression of sexual desire.",

College Students; Higher Education; Racial Factors; *Role; *Role Perception; Role Theory; Sex Stereotypes; Social Cognition; *Stereotypes The purpose of this study was to test hypotheses drawn from the social role model about the process that people use in deciding what other people are like, focusing on the difference that other people's age, race, and sex make. A sample of non-Latino White students (671) ranging in age from 18 to 81 years used the Bem Sex-Role Inventory (BSRI) to rate a person in one of 12 target groups (a race-unspecified or African-American woman or man in their late 20s, late 40s or late 60s). Race-unspecified targets were almost always seen as non-Latiro Whites. Old persons and women were seen as significantly more communal and less agentic in personality than younger adults and men, respectively. When students' estimates of the likelihood that the target they were rating was retired was controlled, the main effect for age of target in communal traits disappeared. This finding supports the interpretation that age stereotypes partly stem from perceivers' observations of people's social roles.

      "abstract": "Sex differences in responsiveness to infants were investigated by comparing physiological responses to infants with overt behavioral reactions. The former were assumed to be more biologically determined than the latter whereas overt behavioral responsiveness was presumed to be more affected by societal norms than were psychophysiological indices. The subjects were boys and girls in middle childhood and early adolescence. Psychophysiological indices showed that children, like parents, responded differentially to infant smiles and cries. As predicted, there were no sex differences on psychophysiological measures of responsiveness to babies. When permitted to interact with a baby, however, girls interacted more and ignored less than boys did. The results suggest that sex differences in overt responsiveness to babies are attributable to societal pressures rather than innate factors. Sex differences appear to wax and wane depending on the salience of sex stereotypy in differing developmental phases.",

The subjects were 209 ninth‐grade adolescents. Although an adolescent’s aggression in general was related to being rejected by peers, a different picture emerged when the shared variance between types of aggression was controlled: The partial correlations showed that when the level of direct (physical and verbal) aggression was kept constant, increases in indirect aggression did not explain variance in peer rejection scores. On the contrary, the use of indirect aggression contributed (especially among boys) to social acceptance by peers. The direct (physical and verbal) forms of aggression were unrelated to adolescents’ social acceptance scores. No clear differences were detected between girls’ and boys’ acceptance or rejection of their aggressive peers, despite the finding that boys seemed to tolerate indirect aggression better than girls did.",

      "title": "The Life Mission Theory IV. Theory on Child Development",
      "abstract": "We can identify five important needs that children have: the need for acknowledgment, acceptance, awareness or attention, respect, and care. If these needs are not met, children will modify themselves by denying central parts of their nature in order to adjust to their parents and the situation at large. When a child denies his or her talents, powers, and gender or aspects thereof, he or she loses quality of life, the ability to function, and physical or mental health. The loss of ability takes the form of diminished social ability, psychosexual potency, joy, energy, and fantasy while playing, as well as diminished ability to concentrate, focus, and learn. Many modifications result in a child with severely damaged self-confidence, self-worth, and poor performance. A child more or less deprived of self-worth cannot enjoy, give, or receive. A child deprived of emotions turns cold, rational, asocial, socially stiff, uncomfortable, and in the extreme case ... intentionally “evil”. When a child denies his or her own sex, it becomes invisible, uninteresting, and vague or becomes like the opposite sex in behavior and appearance. The general holistic solution to the vast diversity of symptoms in children with low quality of life is to improve the situation for the child and give the child the holding and support he or she needs. It is very important to realize that a negative belief often has survival value to the child as it helps the child to avoid taking responsibility for problems, which really belong to the parents or other adults. Children have a fine capability for spontaneous healing, and seem to enter this process more easily than adults, given sufficient holding. The symptoms of children with poor thriving ability are often difficult to understand, as they are caused by a complex combination of self-modification in five existential dimensions. This often leads to complex medical diagnosis, giving the idea that the child is sick and without therapeutic reach, while sufficient holding could solve the problem. If holding and support of the child is not enough, the situation must be carefully analyzed to find other possible causes of poor quality of life, health, and functional ability. Education of the parent in holding is often mandatory. Most children with bad thriving ability can thus be helped by simple means.",

Games and stories have had a long and troubled history in this regard, with neither emerging unscathed by the requirements and expectations of the other. This chapter offers an alternative solution to the dilemma of how to make games and stories compatible: quit trying. If an ideal marriage were possible, if effort and desire alone could accomplish this, it might have been accomplished long ago. Yet neither technological advances nor programming prowess has proven capable of satisfactorily tying this knot. The most likely conclusion to draw from this persistent failure is that game playing and storytelling originate in two distinct human aesthetic sensibilities. Though neither is made lesser through its incompatibility with the other, neither is made greater or more enjoyable as a reluctant partner in their interminably dissonant pairing.",

      "abstract": "Abstract There is growing evidence that heterosexual relationships in which traditional gender roles are reversed because women have attained higher societal status than their male partner are more precarious. We argue that this is the case because both partners in role-reversed relationships are evaluated more negatively than partners in more egalitarian or traditional gender role relationships. In two experimental studies conducted in the United States ( N = 223) and the Netherlands ( N = 269), we found that when encountering role-reversed relationships, participants perceive the woman as the more dominant and agentic one and the man as the weaker one in the relationship. They also perceive women in role-reversed relationships as less likeable, have less respect for men in role-reversed relationships, and expect that such relationships are less satisfying. In addition, in a third partner study ( N = 94 heterosexual couples), we found that both male and female partners in role-reversed relationships considered the man to be the weaker one and the woman to be the more dominant one. Moreover, perceiving the man as the weaker one predicted lower relationship satisfaction in role-reversed couples. Overall, this research indicates that gender stereotypes about heterosexual relationships should be considered in efforts to achieve gender equity.",

Kin recognition mechanisms include familiarity (learning the characteristics of close associates during immaturity so that animals avoid breeding with those with whom they are reared) and phenotype matching (where phenotypic cues such as odors associated with genes of the “major histocompatibility complex” that reliably vary with kinship are matched to cues learned from the self or close relatives).

The girl's inversion, however, received its final reinforcement when she found in her 'Lady' an object which promised to satisfy not only her homosexual tendency, but also that part of her heterosexual libido still attached to her brother. Homosexual enthusiasms, unduly strong friendships tinged with sensuality, are common enough in both sexes during the first years after puberty. The cases of male homosexuality in which Steinach has been successful fulfilled the condition, which is not always present, of a very patent physical 'hermaphroditism'.",

      "abstract": "Abstract In outcrossing hermaphrodites with unilateral mating, where for each mating interaction one individual assumes the female role and the other the male role, each individual must take a sexual role opposite to that of its partner. In the polychaete worm Ophryotrocha diadema , the decision on sexual role is likely at stake during the day-long courtship. Here we describe, for the first time, courtship and pseudocopulation in this species, quantify their pre-copulatory behavior, and search for behavioral traits predicting the prospective sexual role (i.e., behavioral sexual dimorphism), by analyzing the courtship behavior of pairs of worms during the day preceding a mating event. We did not find any behavioral cue predicting the sexual role worms were to play; partners’ pre-copulatory behaviors were qualitatively and quantitatively symmetrical. We interpret this as the outcome of a war of attrition where partners share the preference for the same sexual role, and both hide their ‘willingness’ to play the less preferred one, until one individual reaches its cost threshold and accepts the less preferred sexual role.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The juvenile period is a challenging life-history stage, especially in species with a high degree of fission–fusion dynamics, such as bottlenose dolphins, where maternal protection is virtually absent. Here, we examined how juvenile male and female bottlenose dolphins navigate this vulnerable period. Specifically, we examined their grouping patterns, activity budget, network dynamics, and social associations in the absence of adults. We found that juveniles live in highly dynamic groups, with group composition changing every 10 min on average. Groups were generally segregated by sex, and segregation was driven by same-sex preference rather than opposite-sex avoidance. Juveniles formed strong associations with select individuals, especially kin and same-sex partners, and both sexes formed cliques with their preferred partners. Sex-specific strategies in the juvenile period reflected adult reproductive strategies, in which the exploration of potential social partners may be more important for males (which form long-term alliances in adulthood) than females (which preferentially associate with kin in adulthood). Females spent more time alone and were more focused on foraging than males, but still formed close same-sex associations, especially with kin. Males cast a wider social net than females, with strong same-sex associations and many male associates. Males engaged in more affiliative behavior than females. These results are consistent with the social bonds and skills hypothesis and suggest that delayed sexual maturity in species with relational social complexity may allow individuals to assess potential associates and explore a complex social landscape without the risks associated with sexual maturity (e.g., adult reproductive competition; inbreeding).",

However, this type of contra-hedonic emotional alignment has not been extensively studied with older adults.

In two studies, participants selected the emotion they preferred in hypothetical problems that varied on the arousal and valence best suited for goal achievement. Young and older adults were equally likely to endorse affective strategies that matched both pro and contra-hedonic scenarios.

      "title": "Emotional barriers to contraception.",
      "abstract": "In addition to ignorance and anticontraception beliefs it is proposed that adolescents emotional responses to sexuality may affect their use of contraception. A teenager who is somewhat anxious and ambivalent about sex will be uneasy about acquiring and using contraception while an adolescent who is emotionally more at ease about sex should also be more relaxed about obtaining and using birth control. Several hypotheses are proposed concerning the link between sex-related emotions and contraceptive behavior describing research that is pertinent to each of these assumptions and discussing possible applications of what has been learned about adolescent contraception. Data suggest that those individuals with a negative emotional response to sex may have difficulty in learning what they need to know about conception and contraception. The findings also indicate that erotophobic young adults may not accurately anticipate future intercourse and this may prevent them from taking contraceptive precautions in advance. Erotophobic individuals appear to find discussion of sexual topics aversive and hold relatively negative attitudes about birth control; they are inconsistent contraceptive users. Across a series of studies erotophobic persons seem to be less likely to engage in each behavior that is required for effective contraception. Evidence exists that erotophobia/erotophilia may have quite general effects on approach or avoidance of sexuality. The negative emotions which seem to inhibit contraceptive use also seem to inhibit performance of sex related health care practices. 3 strategies that might be pursued to improve adolescent contraception are considered: educating for change in erotophobia/erotophilia; changing the emotional tone of contraceptive learning acquisition and use; and changing beliefs and expectancies. Educating for change in erotophobia/erotophilia involves desensitizing persons to alleviate their negative emotional responses to sex and the systematic association of sexual cues with positive emotions in order to foster the development of an erotophilic disposition. It is also necessary to change the feelings about the specific behaviors that are required for effective contraception. Also necessary are interventions that focus on changing relevant beliefs and expectancies in addition to emotional changes.",

      "abstract": "Aims and objectives To explore the variations of sexual orientation and gender identity as well as the intersections of those identities in a sample of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and questioning youth. Background Identity development is a key task of adolescence. Among the multiple identities that young people navigate are sexual orientation and gender identity. Challenges with solidifying and integrating aspects of one's identity can contribute to poor physical and mental health outcomes. Design Cross‐sectional descriptive survey. Methods A convenience sample was recruited via collaborations with community organisations and Internet groups who provide information and services for LGBTQ youth under the age of 25. Results Of the 175 respondents, one‐third of the sample reported a gender identity that was not congruent with their sex assigned at birth. Those assigned female sex at birth reported noncongruent gender identities as well as fluid and nonbinary identities such as genderqueer and agender more frequently that respondents assigned male at birth. Individuals with noncongruent gender identities were more likely to identify with a sexual orientation other than lesbian, gay or bisexual than individuals with gender identities congruent with their sex assigned at birth. Conclusions Adolescent sexual orientation and gender identity are complex and nuanced. Nurse scientists and clinical nurses can contribute to understanding of these identities, their meaning to the young person and the unique health implications by regularly inquiring about sexual orientation and gender identity in their practice. Relevance to clinical practice Nurses in clinical practice need to be aware of the sometimes complicated nature of adolescent identity and its related terminology so that they can ask relevant questions and provide culturally safe care.",

      "abstract": "Invertebrates display a great variety of different sex-determining mechanisms. While sex determination may be quite conserved in some taxa, in others it differs between closely related species or even between different populations of the same species. Sex determination and sex allocation tend to evolve interactively through the common medium of sex ratio selection. However, sex ratio conflicts can occur due to differential selection upon genes acting in different individuals (e.g. parent versus offspring) or with different transmission patterns (e.g. nuclear versus cytoplasmic). Sex ratio selection, especially when there is conflict, is probably of key importance in generating the turnover of sex-determination systems to produce the great diversity observed. Most sex-determining mechanisms can be classified as primarily genetic (GSD) or environmental (ESD) but in some cases both influences are important. In addition, cytoplasmic sex factors may be present (Chapter 9). Selection for adaptive sex ratio patterns may sometimes achieve similar endpoints using different raw material. For example, patterns of association between offspring gender and patch quality may be achieved through zygotic ESD or via genes influencing maternal behaviour in certain GSD cases. At a different level, common GSD systems, such as male heterogamety, are known to be underpinned by different molecular mechanisms.",

      "abstract": "This study examined parent-child similarities in homophobic attitudes and observed parental discomfort with coming-out vignettes in interactions with their adolescent children (14-18 years old). Based on gender schema theory and the family process model we expected parent-child similarities in homophobic attitudes to be stronger in same-gender dyads. Further, we expected that observed parental discomfort with coming-out vignettes would occur and is stronger when the gender of the parent, child, and character in the vignette match. We used questionnaires and observation data from 199 White Dutch families in the Netherlands. Our results showed that parents' homophobic attitudes were associated with their children's homophobic attitudes. For same-sex kissing and (imagining) having a gay son, these associations were stronger between parents and children of the same gender. Further, parental discomfort with coming-out vignettes occurred and was stronger when parents and children had the same gender, regardless of the gender of the vignette character. In conclusion, policies aiming at gay and lesbian inclusion should not be limited to accepting gay/lesbian identities, but also pay attention to the acceptance of same-sex intimacy expressions, having gay or lesbian family members, and normalizing discussions about gay/lesbian lives.",

First, it is part of a child’s biological endowment to be attuned to the beliefs and practices of the surrounding culture. This implies, contrary to the standard portrait of the child as steadily moving toward rationality and enlightenment, that children may end up with various assumptions and beliefs that have little connection with objective reality or secular reward. Second, children display a disconcerting mix of autonomy (in both the cognitive and the moral domains) whilst often deferring to the views of those around them. This disconcerting mix is illustrated by children’s attitudes toward gender. Many children go along with the expectations that come with the gender they are assigned at birth, but some transgender children do not. Third, children like adults often display inconsistency in their responses; for example, they may not overtly express prejudice toward outgroups, but, when appropriately tested, they reveal implicit biases against such groups. Finally, children display a mix of naturalistic and supernatural thinking.",

Because expressive beliefs correspond to excuses and instrumental beliefs to justifications , it may be a sex difference in moral acceptability of aggression that informs social representation. Participants completed the Expagg questionnaire with reference to an episode of same‐sex or cross‐sex physical aggression and rated the moral acceptability of their behaviour. Women scored higher on Expagg (specifically lower than men on the instrumental scale) but there was no effect of target sex or participant‐by‐target interaction. Contrary to expectation, women rated their own aggression as more acceptable than did men and hence this could not explain their lower levels of instrumentality relative to men. Aggr.

      "abstract": "Sex differences in jealousy have been reported widely in the social psychological, clinical psychological, psychiatric, and anthropological literature. Many of the studies conducted on jealousy have focused on the sex differences in the level of reported jealousy. Most research has reported that there is no difference between men and women regarding the level of reported jealousy, but there are some sex differences between sexual and emotional jealousy. Evolutionary psychologists divide jealousy into 2 dimensions based on their observations and empirical research findings: Sexual jealousy and emotional jealousy. Sexual jealousy is knowing or suspecting that one's partners has had sexual relationship with a third person, whereas emotional jealousy is triggered by partner's emotional involvement with and/or love for another person. The parental investment model, which extended Darwin's explanations of sexual selection, provides a useful theoretical framework for studying sexual and emotional jealousy. According to this model sexual selection is driven by differential parental investment by men and women; men should experience more sexual jealousy than women and women should experience more emotional jealousy than men. Considerable research has focused on testing this hypothesis and, with a few exceptions, the results are generally consistent with the evolutionary account. In this study, firstly, a brief definition of the sexual and emotional jealousy will be given. Then, sex differences in sexual and emotional jealousy will be explained according to the evolutionary theory. Finally, the results of empirical studies and critiques of the evolutionary model will be given.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Historical events change the socio‐cultural and political contexts that Latinx gay men live in, shaping generational differences in external support, comfort being out, experiences of stigma, and the impacts of and response to minority stress over time. The stigma Latinx gay fathers face is informed by racial and xenophobic prejudice they encounter as Latinx individuals and negative attitudes towards their parenting abilities as gay men. To better understand the lives of Latinx gay fathers, we employed a life course perspective to explore their pathways to parenthood, experiences and avoidance of stigma, helpfulness of social relationships, and their comfort being out. Eighty‐six Latinx gay fathers ( M age = 46.03 years, SD = 10.50, range = 21–74) from 47 US states participated. Most identified as white, Hispanic (88.4%), while others identified as Black/African American and Hispanic (8.1%), Multiracial (2.3%), or Hispanic, non‐white (1.2%). The average income level was approximately US $75,000–$80,000. Over half of participants' first and second children were genetically related to them. Participants reported low frequencies of sexuality‐based stigma and even lower levels of stigma avoidance, as well as relatively high levels of comfort being publicly out and helpfulness of social relationships. Generational differences between Latinx gay fathers in the AIDS‐1 (born 1950–1969) and AIDS‐2 generations (born 1970–1980s) were salient, signifying the importance of historical context in understanding this population.",

      "title": "[Impact of aging on sexuality].",
      "abstract": "Numerous authors on sexual behaviors have studied the link between the persistence of a sexually active life and progressive aging. The knowledge of sexual health in the elderly has shown that biological sexual aging is extremely diverse and heterogeneous in men as well as in women, and contradicts the stereotype of age that would inevitably alter the sexual biological response in each human. Sexual diseases (lubrication, dyspareunia, erectile dysfunction, inability to achieve orgasm) and diseases of aging that impact sexual function have a growing incidence but don't never touch 100% of individuals. There is a decline in sexual interest correlated with the life-span, but the negative effects of age on desire are related to health problems. Moreover, sexual desire is more correlated with personal attitudes toward sexuality than with biological factors and diseases. Several predictors account for the pursuit of an active sexuality (including the presence of a partner, good health, having good sexual self-esteem, enjoyable past experience, an attitude that values the importance of sex in couple relationship), but the most decisive factor to successfully face the specific markers of aging is the ability to adapt to a more sensory sexuality, less focused on performance and coitus.",

      "title": "Promoting Young People's Sexual and Reproductive Health: Stigma, Discrimination and Human Rights.",
      "abstract": "All over the world young people are stigmatised and discriminated against in relation to their sexual and reproductive health. Stigma discrimination and the violation of human rights are intimately connected reinforcing and legitimising each other. Their manifestations are varied occurring in families and communities in health services at places of work and in schools. Across a range of settings young people may be stigmatised and discriminated against for being sexually active before marriage or for engaging in forms of sexuality which are considered by their communities and wider society to be non-normative such as homosexual or transgendered practices. In addition in settings where premarital sexual activity among young people is stigmatised the signs of unprotected sexual activity such as unplanned pregnancy having a sexually transmitted infection (STI) or being HIV-positive may themselves be highly stigmatised. This may seriously limit access to good quality sexual and reproductive health services. This stigmatisation of young people’s sexuality and sexual behaviour has serious consequences. In particular it can lead to young people feeling that they have to conceal their sexual activity from significant adults in their lives including parents teachers and health workers. The secrecy and shame that stigma often brings can deny young people access to the resources they need in order to make and implement informed decisions about their sexuality and sexual health. Where resources are available - or inappropriately framed - they may be inadequate to address young people’s needs. (excerpt)",

      "title": "The Evolutionary Basis for Human Tolerance – Physiological Responses",
      "abstract": "For most animals, unfamiliar members of other groups present more of a threat than an opportunity, and are best avoided or even attacked. In contrast, our attitudes are markedly different. There is no denying that we are capable of being hostile to people we do not know, particularly if we feel anxious or threatened. However, compared to other animals, we are unusually open to new relationships, and form strong bonds with individuals outside our family group. Although we tend to focus on the ‘thinking’ part of our minds, or our cognitive appraisal of social situations, our physiological responses and emotional reactions play a central role in how we build and maintain relationships. Subtle changes in ‘gut feelings’ can have an important influence on our attitudes to people around us, particularly to unfamiliar outsiders or people we have not seen for some time. An understanding of how different hormones affect social behaviour in other species, as well as in humans, provides insights into the type of changes that led to increasing human ‘friendliness’. Genetic and anatomical evidence documents subtle changes in neuroendocrine function in recent human evolution after 300,000 years ago that appear to have played an important role in increasing tolerance of unfamiliarity, and abilities to forge new external bonds. Being able to make external connections, and form new relationships based on give and take despite lengthy periods apart, seems to have been important to our success as a species. Friends in distant communities may often have been important to survival by providing resources or help that could buffer the effects of crises and resource shortfalls. We find that it is genuine emotional commitments to distant friends, rather than strategic alliances, that allow modern hunter-gatherers to survive in times of crisis. Changes in emotional dispositions towards being less aggressive and more tolerant of unfamiliar individuals might seem to be progress, but we should be cautious in thinking in these terms. Increased ‘friendliness’ is not without its disadvantages. It also brings downsides in terms of social sensitivities and emotional vulnerabilities that influence much of human behaviour.",

      "abstract": "A large number of couples who end up their reproductive career with only one child presents a serious problem for demographic trends of a region in which they reside. A question rarely posed is what kind of consequences that phenomenon has for a family climate and family dynamics of those families. An even more important question is what kind of consequences the same phenomenon has for personality development of a child who grows up as a single child. What kind of characteristics and what personality traits are more likely to develop in a child that grows without his/her siblings? The results of our research show that single children get better results on the tasks that require recognition of one?s own emotional states and motives of one?s own behavior than first born and second born children. However, single children score less favorably than first or second born on the tasks that require forecasting other people?s behavior. The explanation for this may be that single children are self-centered due to the lack of interaction with siblings. Other possible explanation may be a specific parenting style that a single child receives from his/her parents. This parenting style is uniquely different from parenting style that a second or third born child receives due to the unique situation created by the fact that he/she is a single child.",

For instance, sour dairy products and products with rounded edges tend to be perceived as relatively feminine, whereas meat and products with sharp edges tend to be perceived as relatively masculine. In a series of studies, we find that men are more likely to choose gender-congruent options (masculine foods and angular-shaped items) when they have unconstrained time and attentional resources than when these resources are constrained. In contrast, women’s choices tend to not be affected by time or attentional resource availability. Our findings suggest that men experience a conflict between their relatively intrinsic preferences and gender norms and that they tend to forgo their intrinsic preferences to conform to a masculine gender identity (when they have sufficient resources to incorporate gender norm information in their choices). Women, on the other hand, appear to be less concerned with making gender-congruent choices.",

      "title": "Coevolution of paternal investment and cuckoldry in humans",
      "abstract": "The social dynamics of reproduction emerge as individuals compete for control of the reproductive potential and reproductive investment of members of the opposite sex. Reproductive potential is the individual's ability to invest in the growth, development, and later social and reproductive competencies of offspring and the potential genetic benefits that might be passed to offspring (Alexander, 1987; Geary, 2002). Reproductive investment is the expenditure of the behavioral components (e.g. provisioning) of this potential to enhance to the survival and later reproductive prospects of one offspring at the expense of other offspring or the parent (Trivers, 1972). As identified by Darwin (1871), the dynamics of reproduction – termed sexual selection – take the form of intrasexual competition for access to mates or for control of the resources that potential mates need to reproduce, and intersexual choice of mating partners (see also Andersson, 1994). For most species of mammal, intrasexual competition takes the form of physical contests, whereby males attempt to exclude other males from access to females or access to the resources that females need to reproduce. Intersexual choice often involves female choice of mates, based on the results of male–male competition or on indicators of male genetic fitness or the males' ability and willingness to invest reproductive potential in her offspring.",

In the no group discrimination condition, but not in the group discrimination condition, participants' perceptions of being personally discriminated against depended on individual differences in BJW: Women with a strong BJW perceived less personal discrimination than those with a weak BJW.

Sur ces quatre affirmations repose le discours sur l’hypersexualisation. Elles sont examinées ici à la lumière des données disponibles sur le sujet. En fait, les données publiées sur les conduites sexuelles des jeunes Québécois et Canadiens ne permettent pas de conclure à une diminution de l’âge du premier rapport sexuel dans la dernière décennie (que ce soit pour le sexe oral, vaginal ou anal), ni à une exacerbation des activités sexuelles, ni à un déclin de la morale et des valeurs sexuelles. Par ailleurs, les données disponibles appuient partiellement l’hypothèse voulant que les adolescents soient exposés de façon grandissante à des contenus plus explicitement sexuels dans les médias traditionnels (télévision, magazines), et l’accès plus facile et plus fréquent à de tels contenus se confirme sur Internet.",

However, participants also perceived them as being less likely to engage in socially deviant behaviors or to be sexually manipulative and more likely to be extraverted, conscientious, and open to new experiences than the average woman. Participants perceived men who are romantically involved with hypermuscular women as having stronger masculine traits, interests, and identities than the average man.

      "abstract": "In der fruchtbaren Phase des Menstruationszyklus finden Frauen ausgeprägt maskuline Gesichtszüge, Körpermerkmale und Verhaltens­weisen besonders sexy und fühlen sich mehr als sonst von anderen Sexualpartnern als dem festen Partner angezogen. Zugleich verhalten sich feste Partner besonders aufmerksam und eifersüchtig. Die zyklusabhängige ­Bevorzugung maskuliner Merkmale ist besonders ausgeprägt, wenn der ­feste Partner solche Merkmale wenig besitzt. Dieses Muster kann durch ­eine evolutionspsychologische Theorie erklärt werden, die als \"ovulatio­nary shift\" oder weibliche Doppelstrategie bezeichnet wird. Nach dieser Theorie konnten in der Evolu­tionsgeschichte Frauen ihren Reproduktionserfolg erhöhen, indem sie erstens einen guten Versorger fanden und zweitens einen Träger guter Gene als Vater ihrer Nachkommen. Ungebundene Partner, die beide Ideale erfüllten, waren nur für wenige Frauen erreichbar. Deshalb entstanden subtile Anpassungen, die in der Phase höchster Fruchtbarkeit die Wahl auf ­einen genetisch attraktiven Partner lenkten, der nicht unbedingt der feste Partner sein musste. Die Konzentration auf die fruchtbare Phase verringerte das Risiko, entdeckt zu werden und in einen Konflikt mit dem festen Partner zu geraten. Zahlreiche Befunde sprechen dafür, dass eine solche evolutionär entstandene Anpassung tatsächlich existiert, besonders Befunde, die eine indirekte Messung genetischer Qualität benutzen: die Abweichungen symmetrisch angelegter Körperteile von perfekter Symmetrie. Es bleiben ­allerdings Fragen, z. B. warum genetische Kompatibilität und Intelligenz anscheinend nicht zu den bevorzugten Merkmalen gehören und ob der Grund für die Bevorzugung maskuliner Merkmale ausschließlich in ihrer Hinweisfunktion auf gute Gene liegt.",

Playgroup workers, parents and social work staff were questioned on their beliefs about children's choices in play. Amongst the playgroup workers and social work staff there appeared to be a belief that children should be free to choose their play activities and that these choices were often influenced by gender, as biological factors make boys and girls want to play in different ways. Parents, they believed, would object to any coercion or positive discrimination in favour of girls to allow them equal access to play material. Parents, on the other hand, were anxious for playgroups to remove gender stereotyping and assumed that positive action was being taken. There appears to be a serious lack of communication between these groups.",

In some species, females choose male traits that indicate genetic quality or confer benefits. Thus, male traits and female preferences are assumed to originate at the same time and to coevolve. In contrast, sensory exploitation occurs when males take advantage of females’ preexisting sensory biases. We show in Drosophila sensory exploitation of males by other males through the use of a pheromone to gain sexual advantage. Notably, sensory exploitation leads to male sensory adaptation. These findings provide a mechanism for the evolutionary origins of a pheromone and are a previously unidentified example of sensory exploitation between males.",

This study utilised qualitative content analysis to examine the reported CSA-related psychological and behavioural challenges of 150 US men, with equal numbers of Blacks, Latinos and non-Latino Whites. Interview data revealed some ethnic differences: Black men more frequently denied having present day adverse effects than other groups. However, Black men who did report negative consequences of CSA discussed difficulties with substance use and hyper-sexualised behaviour more often than other ethnicities. Latino men reported anger, anxiety, hyper-vigilance, flashbacks and communication problems more often than the other two groups. Black and Latino men also discussed guilt/shame issues and sexual identity concerns more often than Whites did. In contrast, White men more frequently discussed issues related to low self-esteem, loneliness and isolation. These findings suggest that ethnically diverse men may respond differently to CSA experiences and that considerations need to be taken into account when providing healthcare to men with CSA histories.",

Scores on the Bern Sex-Role Inventory were compared for a patient group and a control group. The data revealed a higher percentage of androgynous subjects in the control group than in the patient group. Even when only one spouse was androgynous, the chances of sexual competence within the couple increased. In addition, there was more sex typing among the longer married patient couples and more stereotyped femininity in both men and women in the patient group. The results were taken to support the view that the androgynous person's flexibility and adaptability is conducive to a satisfactory sexual relationship. Some cultural differences between Israeli and American samples were noted. Findings contradicted the cultural stereotypes of the macho Israeli male and the nonfeminine Israeli woman.",

      "abstract": "Gender stereotypes are widely shared “collective representations” that link gender groups (e.g., male/female) with roles or attributes (e.g., career/family, science/arts). Such collective stereotypes, especially implicit stereotypes, are assumed to be so deeply embedded in society that they are resistant to change. Yet over the past several decades, shifts in real-world gender roles suggest the possibility that gender stereotypes may also have changed alongside such shifts. The current project tests the patterns of recent gender stereotype change using a decade (2007–2018) of continuously collected data from 1.4 million implicit and explicit tests of gender stereotypes (male-science/female-arts, male-career/female-family). Time series analyses revealed that, over just 10 years, both implicit and explicit male-science/female-arts and male-career/female-family stereotypes have shifted toward neutrality, weakening by 13%–19%. Furthermore, these trends were observed across nearly all demographic groups and in all geographic regions of the United States and several other countries, indicating worldwide shifts in collective implicit and explicit gender stereotypes.",

      "abstract": "Fighting ability is generally assumed to predict male reproductive success; yet the mechanisms responsible for this relationship are seldom known. Competitively superior males may monopolize access to females, be preferred by females, invest more into courtship, or employ more coercive mating tactics. Differentiating these alternatives is essential to understand the interaction between male–male competition and female mate choice, and their influence on the evolution of male traits such as aggression. We tested whether male fighting ability, body size, courtship, or coercive behavior in intersexual interactions predict copulation success in the Australian Lake Eyre dragon lizard, Ctenophorus maculosus. Males with superior fighting ability had higher mating success; however, male harassment (biting and chasing) was a much stronger predictor of copulation, likely because aggressive males are able to overcome female resistance. Better fighters also copulated for longer, which may increase sperm transfer and/or fertilization success. Conversely, courtship effort (head-bobs) decreased copulation success, but only for small males. Females were no less likely to reject males with higher fighting ability, suggesting that females do not prefer these males. Furthermore, males with superior fighting ability were no more or less likely to court or harass females. Instead, both fighting ability and aggression towards females independently increased mating success, potentially generating mutually reinforcing selection on male aggression.",

From the total NKPS sample, 12.1% did not feel (entirely) accepted by their family. The authors hypothesized that people may not feel accepted by their family when they are “difficult,” for example, by exhibiting personal problems; another reason might be that they are “different,” for instance, because they have made nontraditional life course transitions or differ from their parents in educational level or religious preference. Both quantitative and qualitative results confirm the first hypothesis rather than the second. Qualitative results revealed a gender difference in the mechanisms associated with a lack of acceptance by one’s family as well as differences in the resilience of those who had had a difficult family background.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The long-held view that bird song is exclusively a male trait has been challenged recently by a number of studies and reviews highlighting the prevalence of female song. In spite of that, there remains a lack of knowledge on the function of female song, with most evidence thus far focusing on females performing duets with males in courtship displays, typically for joint territory defence or mate guarding purposes. Here we show in a tracheophone suboscine passerine Formicarius moniliger , a sexually monomorphic species in which both sexes sing, that females may participate in both intrasexual and intersexual territory defence. Females sing more in response to females than to males, suggesting they consider females more of a threat to their territory. Yet, females also demonstrate an unexpected pattern of singing back to playback of males singing higher frequency song than themselves. Unlike males, who respond indiscriminately to playback of any song performed by either sex, females appear to discern not only the sex, but perhaps also the size of the presumed intruder. There is a strong negative relationship between body mass and frequency, and females responding only to higher frequency male song suggests they will only engage in territory defence with males when they expect those males to be weaker than they are. While our results are consistent with expectations of a shared ancestral function of song in territory defence, they also suggest females may suffer greater costs in engaging in territorial disputes and thus limit their vocal contribution according to the perceived threat.",

This seems grossly unfair if other criteria of sex conform with the person's social sex.

      "abstract": "In approximately 15% of homosexual men, their phenotype is associated to the fraternal birth order. Older biological brothers induce in their mothers anti-male factors (antibodies) that interfere the brain maleness development of younger fetuses. This effect is seldom seen in non-right-handed men and is not seen in women. The influence of older siblings is seen in their sex ratio (SR). In contradiction with previous hypothesis, significant heterogeneities of SR have been found among older siblings of males or females, right or non-right-handed and homo or heterosexual individuals. This can only be understood as if the findings among homosexuals were part of a general mechanism of fetus-maternal tolerance-rejection processes of placental mammals. We found, in relation to ABO and Rh systems and sex, that embryos with genes different from those of their mothers, induced better pregnancies and maternal tolerance than embryos similar to their mothers. Assuming that homo or heterosexuality and right or non-right-handedness behave similar to ABO or Rh alleles, the author provides a speculative interpretation of these results. Homosexual women and especially if they are non-right-handed, are preceded by siblings with a high SR (maternal environment with anti-female or pro-male factors); then lesbianism or non-right-handedness may induce tolerance to be a woman in such anti-female environment. Non-right-handedness could induce tolerance for anti-male factors of mothers, thus preventing the production of gays in a pro-male maternal environment, but leading to the production of non-right-handed gays in anti-male maternal environments. Several new hypotheses and interpretations merge from this new proposition. Also, complete sexual orientation could be acquired after birth.",

      "title": "Succesfully Involving Teenagers in Health Campaigns through Social Media.",
      "abstract": "Dutch youth have extensive knowledge on and a very positive attitude towards safe sex. Over 75% has the intention to maintain condom use with a new partner until both have been tested for an sti.This is an especially high percentage considering the high usage of birthcontrol pills by young women. Therefor the biggest challenge in the Netherlands is not knowledge or attitude but actual behaviour. \r\nDutch male youths have a rational intention towards condom use and carry one with them. However, when they get sexually aroused they often have a preference for not practising safe sex (use a condom). They do not mention the fact that they have a condom at hand. Dutch female youths are more determined on using a condom but are reluctant to carry one with them out of fear of suspicion of having a loose moral. Not having a condom themselves when one is needed makes it extra difficult for them to bring up the subject of condom use. So, even when a condom is present and both partners are prepared to use one, young men prefer sex with a condom if his partner insists on it over not having sex, it often goes wrong in the implementation of the positive intention.\r\n\r\nIn the latest Safe Sex Campaign our goal was to influence behaviour directly. First we provided emotional arguments; talking about desires and boundaries with your sexual partner is seen as part of being a good lover. Our message was that talking about safe sex is also a part of that conversation. Research by van der Putte (Uva, 2011) showed a relationship between discussing safe sex (or even: discussing a safe sex campaign) and actual condom use. We used the first two phases of this campaign to communicatie this, already present, social norm among our target audience. \r\n\r\nIn interviews with young couples we discovered that the best moment to bring up the subject of condoms is right before you take of your pants. So we communicated a cue; at this moment you should act this was to adher to the social norm, making use of R. Cialdini's theory of heuristics. For this strategy to work,we needed to be as lively as possible so our target audience could project themselves into the situation we showed them. To make this possible we decided to ask the audience to describe these situations. Where would the sex have place? With whom? how would the subject of condooms be brought up? And where would the condom be kept. We made use of a social media strategy to ask as many youths as we could. We co-operated with several smaller community sites and the vlogging community. We were completely open and honoust about our intentions and promised no rewards for participation. The only promises we made were that we would take them seriously and that we would use their input in the commercials that would air in the third and final phase of the campaign. Our advertorials reached an audience of over 3 million readers, our videos were watched over 2 million times. We received over 21000 handwritten responses and over 60.000 votes on our polls. We also found that during our campaign the interactivity with and and between our target audience rose instead of declined.\r\n\r\nThis co-creation led to three tv commercials showing 6 possible scenarios and three radio commercials consisting of quotes from the input of the target audience.These commercials reached over 91% of our target audience.\r\n\r\nNot only was the campaign very well received (the becnhmark for government campaigns is 6,8 and this campaign was graded 7,3) it was also very effective. The message of the resulting commercials was very clear, reaching a message transfer of 98%. The number of youths who reported bringing up the subject of condoms before they took of their pants rose from 56% before the start of the campaign to 74% after the campaign ended, three months later.\r\n\r\nDuring this latest safe sex campaign we learned a lot of techniques and validatedmany theories about being succesful in social media and using it for co-creation purposes. These learnings can be used for safe sex promotion, but for other health prevention programmes as well. []",

This paper examines the dark side of these solidarity symbols by reporting the incidence and patterns found in the naming of collegiate men’s and women’s athletic teams. The data from 1,185 four-year schools reveal that more than half of American colleges and universities employ names, mascots, and/or logos that demean and derogate women’s teams. There are no significant differences in naming patterns by type of school (public, independent, or religious), but region is significant, with Southern schools more likely to use sexist names than schools elsewhere. The various sexist naming practices contribute to the maintenance of male dominance within college athletics by defining women athletes and women’s athletic programs as second class and trivial.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION Child sexual abuse (CSA) is the involvement of children and adolescents in sexual activities (usually for adult sexual stimulation or gratification) that they cannot fully comprehend and to which they cannot consent as a fully equal, self-determining participant, because of their early stage of development [Box 1].Box 1: Defining child sexual abuseIt is important to understand the nature and type of CSA as the severity of the impact of the abuse depends on not only on the type of abuse but also on the duration of the abuse and very importantly, whether the abuser is a known/trusted person or a stranger [Table 1].Table 1: Nature or type of child sexual abuseThus, CSA is a complex issue, wherein impact and recovery depend on all of the above variables and how they combine to influence the child's experience of abuse. Even where there are two children, who have been impacted by identical forms and processes of abuse (similar variables), they may still be different in terms of their responses. This difference is accounted for personality and temperament of each child, and social context and circumstances of each child, due to which each child perceives and internalizes the abuse differently, thus resulting in different emotional and behavioral states to the abuse, and necessitating different psychosocial and mental health responses. CSA is not a clinical condition or diagnosis. Clinical practice guidelines for standard child psychiatric conditions can be developed based on existing knowledge and practices. However, to develop clinical practice guidelines for an experience that is both nuanced and complicated by psychological and social processes is a particular challenge. Clinical practice guidelines for CSA, therefore, necessitate mental health professionals to work with many processes and systems to effectively assist the child. CONTEXT OF CONSULTATION There are broadly three contexts in which children present for consultation on sexual abuse issues. The first is when CSA is already established by agencies and individuals, and they refer the child to the mental health system. Such referrals may be received from: (i) District Child Protection Units; (ii) Childline and child care agencies/service providers; (ii) Police; and (iii) Courts and judicial personnel. Children are brought by such agencies and bodies either for interventions in the wake of trauma and emotional problems and/or for inquiry and evidence gathering for use in court cases. Thus, in this context, the mental health system is not required to establish whether or not CSA has occurred, as it is already known – usually, children would have reported abuse or in case of children in sex trafficking, they have been rescued through a raid on sex work institutions, and so the abuse has come to light. The second context is one in which the child has reported to his/her parents but they, in turn, have not reported the abuse to police or legal systems. However, they seek consultation to provide the child with mental health interventions. The third context is when it is not (yet) known that he/she has been sexually abused; the child comes to the mental health system for some psychological or psychiatric manifestation, but on enquiry and examination, CSA issues emerge in one of the following ways: The child discloses or reports abuse An adolescent girl is found to be pregnant (Frequent) urinary tract infections in the child are reported by the child/caregivers and/or genital injuries in the child are reported/observed Emotional and behavioral issues that are associated with anxiety, anger, and depression. There is what is called an index of suspicion in CSA, i.e., when to suspect CSA and how true one's suspicions likely to be. Figure 1 represents the index of suspicion in CSA. At the peak of the triangle, the index of suspicion is the highest, i.e., there is no doubt when a child reports or discloses that abuse has taken place, especially when a child spontaneously reports without particular inquiry by an adult.Figure 1: Index of suspicion in child sexualEqually high on the index is pregnancy (in adolescent girls) – a sure sign that sexual abuse has occurred. Genital injuries and frequent urinary tract infections must lead to suspicion that there is digital handling and sexual abuse is very likely to have taken place. Emotional and behavioral changes observed in the child are important indicators of CSA; however, they come lower on the index of suspicion because these psychological changes may occur due to some reasons (unlike pregnancy or genital injuries which do not have a range of reasons for their occurrence!). Emotional and behavioral issues relating to anxiety and depression may occur due to sexual abuse but may also be due to other difficult and traumatic experiences such as parental marital conflict, bullying, learning difficulties and academic pressures, loss, and grief (death-related) experiences… so, while emotional and behavioral changes may lead to CSA suspicion, further examination and inquiry needs to be made (by a psychosocial or mental health professional) to understand exactly what difficult event(s) or experiences they are attributable to in a given child. During the inquiry, if sexual abuse is ruled out, then the signs and symptoms may be attributable to other difficult experiences. Below are indices of CSA [Table 2].Table 2: Emotional and behavioral indices of child sexual abusePROCEDURE FOR ESTABLISHING AND CONFIRMING CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE The procedure for establishing and/or confirming CSA has three components, namely, (i) Psychosocial and Mental Health Assessment; (ii) Developmental Assessment; (iii) Abuse Inquiry or Forensic Interviewing for CSA. The third component particularly, is predicated on the first two components, which makes it necessary for the three assessments to be done in the order in which they are listed and described. Psychosocial and mental health assessment It is important to obtain a detailed history and assessment of the child, including information on family and school context, developmental level and functionality, emotional and behavioral issues (pre- and post-sexual abuse), circumstances of the alleged abuse, the child's experience and understanding of the abuse and other related problems. Treatment and interventions for abuse must be developed based on the complete assessment of the child's context and issues; this is because every child is unique and has his/her own unique ways, based on age, developmental stage, personality and temperament, family and social circumstances, and the nature of abuse, of processing the abuse experience. Information requires to be obtained through the assessment of the child and family/caregivers. The immediate aftermath of the abuse, i.e., within the first few days is not the time for asking the child to provide the abuse narrative in great detail as this is likely to distress and traumatize the child further. The objective of the Psychosocial and Mental Health Assessment [Box 2] is to establish that abuse has occurred and to know the nature of abuse, i.e., contact versus non-contact, penetrative versus nonpenetrative abuse with a view to making decisions regarding medical interventions, as well as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) interventions, as necessary.Box 2: Psychosocial and mental health assessmentIt is important to understand any emotional and behavioral issues the child had before the abuse and compare these to those that may have occurred post-abuse. This is because (i) we need to understand exactly which emotional and behavioral problems that are attributable to abuse; (ii) we need to understand how pre-abuse emotional and behavioral issues may have determined the ways in which the child has processed the abuse experience and been impacted by it. In either case, the child would need to receive treatment and assistance for all emotional and behavioral issues, both pre-existing ones as well as those that developed as a result of the abuse. Developmental assessment The developmental assessment requires to be completed before any forensic interviewing processes and/or interventions are entered into with children for eliciting abuse narratives. The purposes of conducting a developmental assessment in the context of CSA are two-fold: To make decisions about the feasibility and use of methods to elicit the abusive narrative in accordance with the developmental abilities of the child, for treatment and intervention purposes and/or as part of evidence gathering for court cases/legal processes To be able to design and/or deliver age-appropriate interventions; this includes the use of communication and methodologies that are comprehensible to a child in the course of treatment, including to provide personal safety education and awareness (which forms a part of the treatment interventions). There are five specific domains of development that children require to be assessed in: physical or locomotor, speech and language, cognitive, social and emotional development. If the abilities and skills in these domains are not age-appropriate, then there are implications for forensic interviewing and evidence gathering for court cases and legal processes [Box 3].Box 3: Applying child development assessment to CSA inquiry and interventionInquiry with the child: Forensic interviewing for child sexual abuse This includes interviewing the child to obtain information on the sequence of abuse events and how they occurred according to the child, and how the child perceived and understood the abuse. The interview may have to be carried out in well-planned sessions, over a period of time, especially in the case of younger children or children with posttraumatic disorder. Creative play methods, such as stories, art and toys/dolls may have to be used to elicit children's narratives. Such indirect methods are gentle and nonthreatening and also allow younger children with less developed verbal abilities to communicate their experiences of abuse. During these sessions, while eliciting children's abuse narratives, open-ended questions that encourage children to express themselves freely should be used. A detailed verbatim recording of the interview should be done through written documentation as well as video recordings in case of play sessions with young children so that these can also be used for legal proceedings. Introduction and rapport building Greet the child and tell him/her your name and then, ask the child his/her name Sit at the same physical level as child (if the child is on the floor, sit on the floor… if the child is sitting on a chair, sit on the chair next to her) Use toys and play activities (dolls, puzzles, picture books, and coloring books…) to engage young children and give it to the child as soon as (s)he comes to the court (while waiting for you) Enter into play with the child and spend 5–10 min engaging child in play activity… \"what are you doing? What is the doll doing? May I see what you are coloring?\" Engage in neutral conversation with the child for a few minutes (this also helps to assess the child's developmental abilities and skills as well as mental state)--What did you eat for breakfast today? How did you come here today? Who are these people who have come with you?.... \" For older children and adolescents, you may say \"I really want to know you better. Tell me about the things you like to do\" Introduce the space and the purpose of the child being there, including your role: \"My name is… my job here is to make sure that children are safe and no one hurts them. If we hear that someone is hurting or troubling children, then we do things to stop that from happening\" \"You may be wondering about this busy place and many rooms…many people come here, just like you to talk about people who have hurt or troubled them…that's why we need a big space like this and many people to help\" \"Although this place may seem a little scary and confusing, you are safe here…and after we have spent a little time talking, you can go back home with your parents or caregiver.\" Explain the need for video camera/microphone (in case you are using such equipment) – \"As you can see, we have a video-camera and microphones here. They will record our conversation so I can remember everything you tell me. Sometimes, I forget things and the recorder allows me to listen to you without having to write everything down.\" (In case you are taking notes, you may provide a similar explanation to the child). Ensuring accurate reporting This is to ensure that the child has the competency to differentiate between truth and lies and to ensure that children tell the truth. Establish the need for telling the truth, and child's capacity to differentiate between what's true or not and to say \"I don't understand\" or to tell examiner when he makes a wrong statement: Part of my job is to talk to children (teenagers) about things that have happened to them. I meet with lots of children (teenagers) so that they can tell me the truth about things that have happened to them. Hence, before we begin, I want to make sure that you understand how important it is to tell the truth For younger children, explain: (\"What is true and what is not true\"). \"If I say that my shoes are red (or green) is that true or not true?\" (Wait for an answer, then say:) \"That would not be true, because my shoes are really (black/blue/etc.). And if I say that I am sitting down now, would that be true or not true (right or not right)?\" (Wait for an answer.) It would be (true/right) because you can see I am really sitting down.' \"I see that you understand what telling the truth means. It is very important that you only tell me the truth today. You should only tell me about things that really happened to you.\" (Pause) \"If I ask a question that you don't understand, just say, \"I don't understand.\" Okay?\" (Pause) \"If I don't understand what you say, I'll ask you to explain. \"What would you say if I made a mistake and called you a 2-year-old girl (when interviewing a 5-year-old boy, etc.)?\" (Wait for an answer.) \"That's right. Now you know you should tell me if I make a mistake or say something that is not right. You may record your observations as follows: Capacity to differentiated \"truth\" established Yes No Capacity to say \"I don't understand\" established Yes No Capacity to tell interviewer that she/he \"is not right\" established Yes No. Training in episodic memory Episodic memory represents our memory of experiences and specific events in time in a serial form, from which we can reconstruct the actual events that took place at any given point in our lives. It is the memory of autobiographical events (times, places, associated emotions, and other contextual knowledge) that can be explicitly stated. Individuals tend to see themselves as actors in these events, and the emotional charge and the entire context surrounding an event is usually part of the memory, not just the bare facts of the event itself (http://www.human-memory.net/types_episodic.html). It is essential to encourage children to provide detailed responses early in the interview as this enhances their descriptive responses to open-ended prompts in other parts of the interview, particularly those related to the abuse incident. Hence, at this stage of the interview, training in episodic memory or narrative practice should be done as follows: \" It is very important that you tell me everything you remember about things that have happened to you. You can tell me both good things and bad things\" Identify a recent event the child experienced- the first day of school, birthday party, holiday) and build up on that using qualifiers like tell me, what happened next, \"Think hard about (activity or event) and tell me what happened on that day from the time you got up that morning until (some portion of the event mentioned by the child in response to the previous question). \"Tell me more about (activity mentioned by the child).\" (Wait for an answer.) Use this prompt as often as needed throughout this section] \"Earlier you mentioned [activity mentioned by the child]. Tell me everything about that.\" Note: Focus on real-life events; avoid focusing on accounts relating to television, videos, and fantasy. Abuse enquiry Now transition to substantive issues to enable the child to provide you with the narrative by using open questions such as: \"Now that I know a little about you, I want to talk about why (you are here) today\" \"I heard you talked to \"X\" about something that happened – tell me what happened\" \"I see you have (a bruise, a broken arm, etc.,) – tell me what happened\" \"I heard you saw (the doctor, a policeman, etc.) last week – tell me how come/what you talked about\" \"Is (your mom, another person) worried about something that happened to you? Tell me what she is worried about\" \"I understand someone might have troubled you – tell me what happened\" \"I understand someone may have done something that wasn't right – tell me what happened\" \"I understand something may have happened at (location) – tell me what happened\" Young children, who either do not have the language to name private parts and genitals or are unwilling to name these parts due to fear and embarrassment, use pictures or dolls to assist the child--\"I will show you a picture (here is a doll)… can you show me/point to where this person touched or hurt you…\" Probe for disclosure Use gentle probes, including some close-ended questions to confirm some details. If child has mentioned telling someone about the incident(s), ask details, if not then probe about possible immediate disclosure by saying: \"Does anybody else know what happened?\" How did they come to know? [Box 4]Box 4: Techniques of Inquiry: Leading questionsClosing the interview The closure phase helps to provide an end to a conversation that may have been emotionally difficult for the child. \"You have told me lots of things today, and I want to thank you for helping me.\" \"I want to especially tell you how brave you are for telling me all that happened… things like this happen to many children, but they don't always want to tell others about it… because they are afraid. You may also have been scared, but you were brave to tell people about it – I am sure your parents are proud of you… I am too\" \"Is there anything else you think I should know?\" \"Is there anything you want to tell me?\" \"Are there any questions you want to ask me?\" \"If you want to talk to me again, you can call me at this phone number and come and see me again.\" (Give the child or caregiver your name and phone number). IMPACT OF CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE AND IMPLICATIONS FOR INTERVENTION After eliciting the abuse narrative, it is critical to understand the methods and processes used by the perpetrator to sexually abuse the child. CSA is a process that consists of a series of actions entailing lure, seduction, manipulation and/or coercion and threat. Different methods and processes of abuse have different psychological impacts on children and adolescents. Not all CSA results in trauma; in fact, where CSA methods use lure, seduction, and manipulation to \"manufacture\" the consent of the child (versus methods of threat, violent coercion, and aggression), there may be the less overt or visible traumatic reaction in the child [Table 3].Table 3: Understanding trauma dynamics: The impact of child sexual abuseAbuse in the context of \"manufactured consent\" When abuse has taken place through grooming processes (i.e., lure, inducement, and manipulation) and violence, threat and coercion methods have played little or no role in the abuse process, children/adolescents are less likely to be aware of and acknowledge the abuse [Box 5].Box 5: When and why children do not acknowledge abuse experiencesImplications for intervention Focus on helping children recognize various types of child (sexual) abuse, including understanding why and how certain actions constitute abuse Reassurances to child on safety and protection (from the perpetrator) Arrangements with parents/caregiver to ensure the child's safety and protection. Abuse of young children In younger children, the methods of abuse entail (i) inducement and lure and/or (ii) coercion and threat. Inducement and lure entail the use of sweets and toys to get children to perform or cooperate in sexual acts for adult stimulation. Perpetrators also use attention and affection in exchange for sexual favors, i.e., provision of attention and affection when the child complies with the adult on sexual acts and withdrawal of attention and affection when the child does not. These methods are followed by the perpetrator creating excitement and secrecy around the sexual act, often presenting it to the child as a \"special new game,\" a \"secret game\" that no one else plays and no one else knows about; and young children, who have no understanding of sexuality are vulnerable to such ruses. Implications for intervention Medical assistance in case of violent abuse and physical injury Teaching children about safety issues related to strangers as well as known persons Enabling children to learn how to protect their bodies, i.e., which body parts should not be touched by anyone except for select family members such as mothers/caregivers during personal hygiene activities Helping children discern between \"safe\" and \"unsafe\" secrets Validation of emotions and provision of reassurance for children who may be traumatized by the CSA. Abuse of adolescents In older children and adolescents, the processes of abuse are similar, but the use of lure and inducement are slightly different and these processes are also known as 'grooming' [Box 6]. Given that adolescents are at a life stage wherein they are interested in issues of love, attraction and sexuality and are also keen to experiment with these experiences, perpetrators tend to use lure and inducements that are more emotional in nature (rather than the more material ones used with younger children). This means that they smooth talk adolescents about their physical appeal and qualities, making promises of long-term emotional, and romantic relationships with them—and adolescents interpret these actions as being loving and romantic.Box 6: The grooming processAgain, given the life stage adolescents are at, often also under peer pressure to experiment with sexuality, offenders have the perfect opportunity to manipulate them into sexual engagement by transmitting all sorts of misconceptions about sexual behaviors and norms. For instance, appealing to adolescents' need to \"fit in\" with their peers, perpetrators tell adolescents that it is necessary to gain sexual experience, that it would be \"uncool\" if they are ignorant about sexual acts. As a result, adolescents, who are still acquiring life skills such as (sexual) decision-making, are negatively influenced, believing in the misconceptions transmitted to them, confused by how they should respond. Following such manipulation and abuse, adolescents experience feelings of tremendous confusion, especially as they have shared \"deep\" sexual and romantic relationships with the offender. They find it exceedingly difficult to discern this as an abused process and defend the offender, often refusing to accept that this is abuse. Implications for intervention Medical assistance in case of violent abuse and physical injury In case of pregnancy, decisions around medical termination of pregnancy, depending on the medical issues as well as the adolescent's desire to have/keep the child, i.e., from a child rights' perspective, facilitating discussions with the adolescent to help her make decisions about her pregnancy Helping adolescents explore notions of love, romance, and relationships Enabling adolescents to understand various forms of coercion, ranging from material lure to persuasion and threat; focussing on an understanding of consent in sexual relationships [Box 7] Personal safety awareness and education focussing on equipping adolescents with sexual decision-making skills (a life skills approach) Validation of emotions and working with notions of self-identity, including feelings of guilt and shame, in children and adolescents who may be traumatized by the CSA. Box 7: The issue of consentINTERVENTIONS As also shown in Figure 2, CSA interventions can be broadly categorized into three types of responses:Figure 2: Child sexual abuse interventions Medical assistance Psychosocial interventions First level responses for children Depth therapeutic interventions for children Interventions for parents and caregivers. Legal assistance. Medical assistance In case a child is referred immediately after abuse, i.e., within a few hours or days), it is necessary to first proceed with a medical evaluation and requisite medical interventions as a priority. Treatment history and response to treatment (in case the child has already undergone or is undergoing treatment) should be recorded. Ideally, it must be ensured that the child is provided with emergency medical services within 24 h of filing the first information report (FIR) in case a police report has been filed or even otherwise. Physical examination Physical examination of the child to be conducted including 2 ID marks The child's family or caregiver should be present in the room during the examination Permission of the child and consent of the parent to be taken before the examination What physical symptoms does the child have at present/(e.g., burning sensation during micturition, White Discharge per Vagina, itching in the perineal area, bleeding, any injury, pain in any area, etc.) Post-exposure prophylaxis If a child is within the 36 h window period (especially in case of penetrative abuse): Has the child received Postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) (within 36 h) in case of penetrative abuse? If not, refer to Paediatric ART Centre for PEP Even if the child is not in the window period and the penetrative abuse has occurred within a month, refer to the Paediatric ART Centre so that a decision can be taken regarding initiation of PEP Ensure that the child/adolescent has received oral contraceptive pills to prevent pregnancy Ensure that the child has been medically evaluated by a Registered Medical Practitioner, namely a pediatrician or gynecologist from a government hospital, for sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), urinary tract infection and/or injuries. The STD investigation must be repeated at the end of 4 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months. Forensic examination Check whether an additional specific forensic evaluation has been done (examination requested by police documenting abuse, if swabs have been taken in case of penetrative abuse), and if so, whether the report is available. Obtain the report from the relevant source. Pregnancy tests Ensure that a urine pregnancy test has been done In case the results are a false negative, it would be best to obtain an additional gynecological opinion In case the child/adolescent is under 20 weeks pregnant, discussions about abortion may need to be done with the child/adolescent and her caregivers. It is also advisable to liaise with an obstetrician at this time. Psychosocial and mental health interventions for children and families Following medical assistance, or simultaneously, psychosocial and mental health interventions should be initiated for the child and family, based on the Psychosocial and Mental Health Assessment completed. Developmental assessments and forensic interviewing may follow subsequently, and be embedded in the counseling and therapy processes. Pharmacotherapy Pharmacotherapy is not specifically indicated for CSA unless it results in severe anxiety and depressive states. Children who have undergone CSA and present with severe PTSD will require medication in addition to other psychosocial interventions: These medications include specific serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and/or benzodiazepines, in dosages recommended as per body weight. SSRIs are also indicated in situations where CSA results in severe depression associated with self-harm behaviors, dissociation, and agitation. States of agitation may call for SOS medication with low dosage benzodiazepines There are a group of children with pre-existing vulnerabilities or those in whom the trauma is so destabilizing that it results in mood dysregulation. This group of children may require mood stabilizers. Older children and adolescents, particularly, must not be coerced to take medication in case they are unwilling i.e. they require to be counselled, including on issues of need and adherence [Box 8].Box 8: Preparing the children and adolescents for medical tests and treatmentFirst level psychosocial responses for children Asking questions, and attempting to establish depth interventions when the child is facing a crisis, i.e., in the immediate aftermath of abuse, is not a useful beginning. This is not the time to for detailed enquiry. If there are serious and disruptive manifestations such as self-harm behaviors, incapacitating anxiety, PTSD symptoms with severe panic, appropriate psychiatric referral at this stage is important (as psychiatric medication may be required for anxiety symptoms to reduce before any counseling work is initiated). However, certain initial responses or what are know as first level responses [Box 9] of a supportive nature require to be provided to the child.Box 9: Objectives of first level responses to child sexual abuseEnsuring child's safety Depending on where the abuse occurred and who the perpetrator is, it is essential to immediately take measures to protect the child from further abuse. This is especially applicable when the perpetrator is a family member or a person known to the child, and where the abuse has occurred at home or in places the child frequents on a daily or regular basis (such as school/tutorials, etc).

They feel as if the sexual body has the power to make them helpless by forcing them to submit passively to its demands.

      "abstract": "The steroid-hormone dependent sexual development presupposes the already sex-specific differentiated gonads. The H-Y antigen is held responsible for the primary differentiation of the indifferent gonadal anlage towards testicular organization. Studies on the function of H-Y antigen, using gonadal cells in vitro, have shown that in the presence of H-Y antigen the gonad differentiates into testicular, in its absence into ovarian structures, independent of whether the sex chromosomes are XX or XY. The gonads of both sexes are endowed with a specific H-Y receptor, other tissues are not. The bipotency of the gonadal anlage arises from this character. Some disorders of sexual development presumably go back to mutations affecting the genetic control of the H-Y gene and the function of H-Y antigen, respectively. It is discussed that the Y chromosome may have a mere regulatory function and not include the H-Y gene. Thus, the primary differentiation of the gonad should be dependent exclusively on whether or not the H-Y gene is active.",

      "title": "Idiopathic Sexual Precocity in the Female",
      "abstract": "Summary From among 11 female cases of idiopathic sexual precocity, 3 have been chosen to exemplify advancement, delay, and normality, respectively, of psychological maturity in relation to chronological age. Like the other cases, they also exemplify coincidence between degree of maturity and variety of life experiences encountered and transacted. Sexually, their psychological development was not predetermined as some sort of automatic or instinctive adjunct to maturation of somatic sexuality. The first report was of a girl aged 8 yr., 6 mo., who was postpubertal in physical development and had begun regular menstruation at 7 yr., 6 mo. Her apparent psychological precocity was a mixture of three ingredients: superior intelligence, extraordinary fluency in speaking, and unusual breadth of interest and knowledge. Romantic fantasies were frequent and elaborate, but did not include imagery of physical eroticism. Overt erotic behavior was not manifested but, even had it been, the girl would not have been appraised as adult, psychologically. The gulf between infancy and adulthood, with regard to learning and accomplishment, is too great for somatic sexual precocity to have allowed of a dramatic short-cut, even though this girl's speed of psychological development was considerable. The girl was appraised as psychologically well adjusted. The second report was of a girl who, at 6 yr., 4 mo., was well advanced into puberty, but not yet menstruating. Among the sixteen children studied, male and female, she had encountered and tried to negotiate the most overtly baffling and difficult life experiences. Difficulties were engendered chiefly by her father, who was psychosexually disturbed and pathologically suspicious to a degree that many would evaluate as psychotic. The girl was retarded in all-round social, educational, and psychological development. She had trance-like spells of inattention. She made monotonous rocking movements in public. In private, she spent long periods during the day, and in bed each night, twisting and writhing her thighs and legs in automatic fashion. She was appraised as severely disturbed psychologically. The third report was of a girl aged 9 yr., 3 mo., who was postpubertal in physical development and had begun regular menstruation at the age of 7 yr., 4 mo. Her physical precocity made her seem like a lumbering, overgrown schoolgirl and not like a young lady before her time. She was not in the least disconcerted by the disparity in physical appearance between herself and other schoolgirls of her age. Her achievements, interests, and activities were average and typical for girls of her age with whom she mixed. She was prosaic and literal minded. What few romantic fantasies she had were rather pallid. She manifested no overt erotic behavior. She was appraised as psychologically well adjusted. Recommendations for the rearing and psychological management of girls with idiopathic sexual precocity are substantially the same as those presented with the study of precocity in a boy.",

      "abstract": "Life history theory provides a framework for understanding why non-monogamy may be the target of significant moral condemnation: individuals who habitually form multiple romantic or sexual partnerships may pursue riskier, more competitive interpersonal strategies that strain social cooperation. We compared several indices of life history (i.e., the Mini-K, the High-K Strategy Scale, pubertal timing, sociosexuality, disease avoidance, and risk-taking) between individuals practicing monogamous and consensually non-monogamous (CNM) romantic relationships. Across several measures, CNM individuals reported a faster life history strategy than monogamous individuals, and women in CNM relationships reported earlier pubertal development. CNM individuals also reported more social and ethical risk-taking, less aversion to germs, and greater interest in short-term mating (and less interest in long-term mating) than monogamous individuals. From these data, we present a model to explain how moral stigma toward non-monogamy evolved and how these attitudes may be mismatched to the modern environment. Specifically, we argue that the culture of sexual ethics that pervades contemporary CNM communities (e.g., polyamory, swinging) may attenuate risky interpersonal behaviors (e.g., violent intrasexual competition, retributive jealousy, partner/child abandonment, disease transmission) that are relatively more common among those who pursue multi-partner mating.",

      "abstract": "Les pratiques sportives a risque cultivent les paradoxes. D’abord parce qu’elles semblent etre en totale contradiction avec la preoccupation securitaire des societes occidentales contemporaines. Ensuite parce qu’elles donnent a voir un desequilibre entre ce qu’il y a a perdre et ce qu’il y a a gagner. Car dans ces sports, la vie est engagee. La « raison » peine donc a rendre intelligibles ces pratiques. L’engagement dans les sports a risque plus etonnant encore lorsqu’il est celui d’une femme. Beaucoup moins que les hommes, elles investissent ces terrains qui s’apparentent a de veritables « fiefs de la virilite » (Elias et Dunning, 1994). Et meme lorsqu’hommes et femmes choisissent des disciplines communes, leurs trajectoires ne se confondent pas. Les modes de production de l’engagement des femmes dans les sports a risque ressemblent peu a ceux que connaissent les hommes. Pas plus d’ailleurs leurs modes de pratiques ne se superposent. En particulier, les prises de risque differencient nettement les facons de faire. Et non seulement le risque produit de la separation mais il fonctionne egalement comme un principe classant qui hierarchise. En ce sens, il faconne largement la production des rapports sociaux de sexe. Attache a la virilite, le risque participe egalement a la production des hommes et du masculin ainsi qu’il contribue a asseoir et a legitimer ce qui se donne a voir comme la domination d’un sexe sur l’autre, la domination masculine. Mais cette domination n’est ni totale, ni naturelle, ni immuable. C’est une construction sociale, produite par la rencontre de deux groupes antagonistes. Des lors les resistances existent et participent a la definition du genre.",

Respondents evaluated five different situations in which sexual intercourse might occur and ranked each according to how certain the respondent would be to refuse to have sexual intercourse in that context. Regression analysis of the survey data showed that knowing the other person well, being with one's boyfriend or girlfriend, having condoms available, wanting to have sex, and both persons' wanting to have sex reduced the probability of refusal. On the other hand, having no condoms and the presence of drugs in the situation increased the probability the individual would refuse to have sex. In addition, men, individuals with previous sexual experience, and drinkers displayed diminished ability to refuse sex. However, the lack of condoms, when combined with these three respondent characteristics, acted to increase the ability to refuse sex.",

According to concern to the children in the heteronormative society, I explore the role of lesbian mothers raising an adolescent child which goes to Primary School. Dealing with the case of study, I collect data on descriptive level. The findings demonstrate that lesbian relationship is not lasting short and due to that threatening for a child. Jealousy among partners makes relationship uncertain. Lesbian mothers are not raising a gay, child has no emotional difficulties, is enough self-esteem, no too gentle and too sensitive. A student is an ordinary teenage, self-initiative included in diversity of activities. At the sociometry pupil reaches medium sociometric status, his social preference is average and social influence high. A child is controversial and assertive. Furthermore, division of labour by gender is not known in this family. That is also reason for boy choosing typical female profession. Strategy of positionism is not means for mother's operating in school; teachers also consider it as unwanted. Experience with queer family in school sphere is important for non-structural and non-institutional violence. Homophobia is also not present. Teachers are not qualified for teaching about homosexuality, but they feel autonomous about it. Clearly written aim in the curriculum and a person who will protect teachers from hetenormative reaction of parents are not needed.",

Los resultados del estudio concluyen que, tanto los chicos como las chicas que participan en el vestuario unisex, mejoran su imagen corporal, mejoran su autoestima corporal, sufren un descenso en el pudor corporal, disminuyen en ellos/as las mentalidades sexistas, y tienden a perder fuerza los comportamientos restrictivos alimentarios por motivos de estética.

Rating themselves in 11 different roles, girls perceived themselves as more affiliative and less negatively affiliative in many roles than boys did, but gender differences in assertion were not reliable and girls' assertiveness did not decline over time. These results contrast with popular claims regarding girls' “loss of voice” in adolescence. Gender differences were context-specific, and were most pronounced in ratings of “myself as a boy/girl” and “myself with a close same-sex peer.”",

      "abstract": "The majority of – usually moral – problems inherent in elite sport, such as whether athletes should be able to take particular drugs, wear particular clothing, or utilise particular tools, arguably stem from a conceptual one based on faulty logic and competing values. Sport is a human enterprise that represents a multitude of human compulsions, desires and needs; the urge to be competitive, to co-operate, to excel, to develop, to play, to love and be loved, and to find meaning in one's existence. From the perspective of an amateur athlete, this pluralism is possible. When one is involved in athletics at the lower echelons, the values that one holds in relation to sport are fluid and flexible; they are prioritised according to a myriad of other influences that are contingent to a particular situation. As such, the reasons that the general population participate in athletic activities and the values they consequently ascribe to it are complex and wide-ranging and thus fall into the sociological realm. The philosophical problem with value in sport is found at the highest level, the professional platform, where discordant values are espoused, particularly the value of ever increasing quantifiable performance. The athletic events at the Olympic Games are the archetypal manifestation of this Citius , Altius , Fortius (faster, higher, stronger) aphorism and yet when taken to its logical conclusion becomes evidently absurd.",

For mental traits like personality, greater male variability has been partly attributed to biology, underpinned by claims that there is generally greater variation among males than females in non-human animals due to stronger sexual selection on males. However, evidence for greater male variability is limited to morphological traits, and there is little information regarding sex differences in personality-like behaviours for non-human animals. Here, we meta-analysed sex differences in means and variances for over 2100 effects (204 studies) from 220 species (covering five broad taxonomic groups) across five personality traits: boldness, aggression, activity, sociality and exploration. We also tested if sexual size dimorphism, a proxy for sex-specific sexual selection, explains variation in the magnitude of sex differences in personality. We found no significant differences in personality between the sexes. In addition, sexual size dimorphism did not explain variation in the magnitude of the observed sex differences in the mean or variance in personality for any taxonomic group. In sum, we find no evidence for widespread sex differences in variability in non-human animal personality.",

      "abstract": "Dating violence is characterized by any form of violence or threat from one partner to the other within a romantic relationship. This type of violence can be identified in any dating relationship regardless of race, gender, sexual orientation, or religion. Females are more often the targets of dating violence than males, especially in regard to severe physical and sexual violence. Dating violence includes physical, psychological, and sexual abuse. Young females may be more vulnerable to sexual violence for a number of reasons. They may avoid talking to family members in the belief that their family will not listen to their issues, or may prefer to talk to their peers, who often show sympathy but have little life experience. The situation of victims from minority cultural groups may be even worse because violence in a dating relationship may be combined with racism, sexism, and discrimination. Family members, friends, teachers, school counselors, police officers, and religious leaders can play a key role in preventing this type of violence before it occurs or in helping survivors of dating violence. Feminist scholars have played a significant role in making the academic community and the public aware of violence in romantic relationships as a result of the hierarchical form of male power and control over the lives of women. In the United States, many policy programs and projects have been successfully developed and implemented in order to prevent dating violence and support its survivors.",

As a consequence, the entrance of the said group into adulthood is impeded and delayed. It is not for the lack of will on the part of the subject or as a consequence of intellectual disability, but rather as a result of the existing social situations which create barriers hindering the fulfilment of needs. A person with ID has a right to have needs and fulfil them. Among them there are specific needs – shaped by individual human characteristics, experiences, and development changes – which are related to the particular stage of the individual’s development. The aim of this research was to diagnose the specific needs of adults with intellectual disabilities at a moderate and severe level, while the main research problem consists of the following questions: what are the specific needs of adults with intellectual disabilities at a significant level (moderate and severe) between the ages of 18 and 35? Which of the indicated needs are being met by the research participants? The research was conducted by employing a quantitative strategy, using the author´s self-designed survey questionnaire. 96 people with intellectual disabilities were surveyed – the participants of the occupational therapy workshop (OTW). An analysis was conducted on the needs which, according to Erikson, most commonly manifest in adulthood (between the ages of 18 and 35).

Neither gonads nor chromosomal sex decide the direction of overt sexual behavior. Libido, in great measure, is a chemical test‐tube equation. Testosterone is the hormone that intensifies sexual drive in both man and woman; it is particularly useful in restoring sexual drive in the woman who once knew, but has lost her libido. Testosterone in the adult female does not alter the direction of sexual behavior or amatory responsiveness. Age need not alter performance nor eliminate the satisfaction and pleasure that attend sexual gratification. Several illustrative cases are presented.",

      "abstract": "American mountain sheep are neotenic or paedogenic, depending on their sex. The rams have a juvenile (neotenic) period lasting 5 to 6 years after sexual maturation, during which they develop physically and mature behaviorally. Rams almost double in body weight after sexual maturation, increase their horn mass, grow darker in color, and lose the white fur on belly and legs, grow less gregarious, become more polished in the social behavior by increasing display patterns and reducing aggressive and sexual patterns, and act more \"brave\" with age. They reach ultimate development and maturation between 7 and 9 years of age. Females are paedogenic since they remain frozen in development at the level of sexually mature yearling rams. Females possess two behavioral states: in estrus they act like young males, but in anestrus they act like sexually immature sheep. Sheep attain strong sexual dimorphism as a consequence of the postpuberal growth of males. The slow behavioral maturation of rams, which is paralleled by physical development, suggests that the quantitative expression of social behavior is a factor of the rams' physical development; the quantitative similarities in behavior between young rams and estrous females suggest that this view is valid.",

Other results revealed that Greek-Australian subjects advocated a less egalitarian pattern of decision-making within marriage, and that they placed more importance than Anglo-Australians on the practical and familial aspects of married life. Thus, Greek values and attitudes to marriage and sex roles appear to maintain some influence on these second generation Greek-Australians.",

      "title": "Impact of Recreational Sex on Sexual Satisfaction and Leisure Satisfaction",
      "abstract": "Introduction Premarital sexual intercourse among college-age adults continues to be a public health concern, as risks for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and unintended pregnancies are not uniformly spread among the population. College is the time period when a great number of young adults define and develop their sexual self. To understand sexuality, it is important to explore relevant motives, personality dimensions, and behaviors. Specifically, the literature reveals a great deal about (1) love and intimacy and (2) the desire for procreation, but not much about (3) sex. Analyzing heterosexual sexual as recreation is of value as there may be multiple meanings in sexual interaction related to the nature of the relationship and other external factors. An area of study previously neglected in the research literature is the impact of as recreation on sexual satisfaction and leisure satisfaction. Understanding behaviors, such as sex, may be of value in developing effective intervention programming aimed at reducing sexual risk-taking and promoting consistent use of condoms on college campuses. Recreational Sex Human sexuality is loaded with multiple meanings, such as love, lust, pleasure, reproduction, the need for protection and support, and a desire to maintain and fortify the bond between persons. When researchers Benagiano and Mori (2009) addressed the question what is at the origin of human sexuality: procreation or recreation?- their response was both and much more. Abramson and Pinkerton (2002) reviewed evidence from physiology, psychology, and cultural values, and concluded that perhaps reproduction today is simply a by-product of sexual pleasure. The authors noted that sexual pleasure facilitates interpersonal bonding, promoting interpersonal relationships, and reducing social tensions. As a dimension of a stable or growing relationship, sexual expression has been termed relational. Relational sexual expression has been described as a manifestation of a multifaceted relationship of sharing and communicating. Intimacy is more than physical; it has meaning intrinsic to the experience and is a full sharing of oneself with another (Kelly & Freysinger, 2000). A traditional theme in Western culture has been that sexual is serious, or for greater ends such as reproduction or bonding in marriage. However, as the connection between sexual and childbearing has diminished, recreational sex (sex purely for enjoyment) seems to have greatly increased in acceptance. Contraceptives, that are highly effective and readily available, have largely disconnected heterosexual intercourse from reproduction, and sexual has become less serious in its meaning and consequences. Sex as leisure or recreation suggests that is primarily for the experience itself, and not necessarily connected with some deeper meaning. Sexual activity, with its intense and varied potential for physical pleasure, is defined as recreation, a self-contained kind of activity (Kelly & Freysinger, 2000, p.167). For a number of individuals, sexual is viewed as play and considered an intense form of social leisure. From this perspective, participation in sexual may take place without reference to its place in building relationships, creating a family, or cementing committed relationships. The foremost meaning of a sexual act is in the experience, rather than the consequences of the sexual act. Thus, may take place within the context of a mutually monogamous committed relationship, but often occurs in casual relationships. Many young people may have adopted an ethic of caution relative to sexual behaviors, but the literature indicates relatively few have abstained (Kelly & Freysinger, 2000). Even high rates of STIs and unintended pregnancies have not seemed to deter participation in within casual relationships. …",

It is less acknowledged and infrequently discussed that we might have moral or religious duties to engage in sexual activity – and that engaging in sexual activity in certain circumstances (viz., in relation to the sexually poor, i.e., the deprived, malnourished, or physically disabled) may be morally or religiously required as a duty commanded by a secular principle or benevolence or by Love Thy Neighbor. Further, some sexual activities may be morally or religiously supererogatory and praiseworthy, to the extent that they are modeled on the behavior of Luke's Good Samaritan.

      "title": "The decline and fall of sex",
      "abstract": "Who would ever have thought that the result of the last ten years of sexual freedom and liberation, absence of obscenity laws, all sorts of scientific sexual research, the woman's liberation movement, X-rated movies and increased sexual education would be in some strange way a diminution of sexuality. I am not gainsaying the gains. They have been necessary and they have been tremendous. But it is also time to assess the losses and to see if anything can be done to minimize them. The losses seem to me to come out of a changing focus about sex from a spiritual-psychological one to a technical-anatomical one. People have somehow forgotten that sex-the essence of sexuality-always has been and still is in the mind. Passion is still not anatomical. Learning 37 different positions is not necessarily going to make sex more exciting. Men and women have very powerful and exciting orgasms in their dreams. There is no technique or anatomical stimulation there. Lightly touching the hand of a person you are romantically in love with or a person who is taboo may be more exciting than participating in an orgy. Somehow we all should know these basic facts about sex, but the emphasis of the past ten years has made us forget them. And in the forgetting we have lost a great deal of the excitement about sex. The first porno film can be a tremendous turn-on. But the fiftieth hardly is. Similarly we all were very turned on by the past ten years giving us license and removing restrictions and inhibitions. But now that that thrill-and it certainly was a thrill-is over, where are we? That thrill-like the first porno film-is gone. Other thrills we used to have are also gone-or at least diminished. Some people who have not lost the thrill are the ones who have a special perversion. I do not like to use this word because it has so many pejorative connotations. Yet it is a technically correct word and I know of no other one that specifically defines the drive of a person who has combined some very unconscious emotional gratification with his sexuality in an unusual form of sexual expression and who experiences a great deal of emotional satisfaction through it. I remember hearing a hetero-",

There are few significant gender differences in experiences, but many in fantasies. Males fantasized about sex more and exhibited greater interest in partner variation and in the spectrum from domination to sadism. While male sexuality is often described as aggressive/sadistic and female sexuality as passive/masochistic, most men and women in our population do not report fantasies supporting such stereotypes.",

The principle, which we all share, is that all persons are equal and none are less equal than others. No disability, however slight, nor however severe, implies lesser moral, political or ethical status, worth or value. This is a version of the principle of equality. The three fallacies exhibited by some or all of my critics are the following: (1) Choosing to repair damage or dysfunction or to enhance function, implies either that the previous state is intolerable or that the person in that state is of lesser value or indicates that the individual in that state has a life that is not worthwhile or not thoroughly worth living. None of these implications hold. (2) Exercising choice in reproduction with the aim of producing children who will be either less damaged or diseased, or more healthy, or who will have enhanced capacities, violates the principle or equality. It does not. (3) Disability or impairment must be defined relative either to normalcy, \"normal species functioning\", or \"species typical functioning\". It is not necessarily so defined.",

      "title": "Avoidance of Sperm Competition in Males",
      "abstract": "Although courtship displays differ between species, virgin females of any species seem to accept copulation easily whenever certain aspects of male performance are adequate. On the other hand, mated females frequently show the open-winged posture and raised abdomen stance to prevent access to courting males (Fig. 6.1). Many studies have clarified the significance of mate choice of mated females during mate-locating behaviour, with detection of male qualities such as age and size. After acceptance by the mated females, the males succeed in copulating but eventually encounter the severe problem that their mates have already stored enough sperm from previous males for fertilisation. Transferred sperm have to compete with the sperm of previous males inside the female reproductive organs. Because the sex ratio is around unity with female polyandry, the probability of encounter with already mated females must be high. Therefore, males might have to develop not a morphological but a behavioural or physiological device to avoid or to win the sperm competition. Sperm migration inside the female reproductive organs after copulation suggests that apyrene sperm may intercept the movement of the eupyrene sperm of the previous mated males. On the other hand, sperm always have a certain risk for competition with future males that will be accepted by the females. To inhibit insemination by the sperm of future males, a spermatophore mass is the only male tactic to delay copulation of the mated females. Consequently, strategic ejaculation by males might be evolved for rival and future males.",

Results indicated that women exhibited in-group rejection, whereas men showed bias toward women only in the 1-joke (vs. 5- and 10-joke) condition. Men and women with low gender identification rated jokes about their gender funnier and more gender typical than those about the opposite gender, and highly identified women also rated jokes about women as gender typical. The findings did not support the basic assumptions of social identity theory; however, the theory remained useful in interpreting the results, which undoubtedly reflect the intergroup dynamics inherent in gender relations.",

Latino young adults in college ( N = 218) rated the prevalence of four types of messages they heard from parents and friends: Sex is only for marriage (procreational), sex is only appropriate in a loving relationship (relational), sex is for pleasure (recreational), and the sexual double standard. Relational sex was most prominent in parental messages; recreational sex was most prominent in friend messages. Women reported more relational sex messages and men reported more recreational sex messages from parents and friends. Fewer procreational sex messages from parents and more recreational sex messages from friends were associated with higher reported levels of sexual exploration and assertiveness. We propose that sexual exploration and assertiveness are behavioral manifestations of individualistic values embedded in sexual discourses among friends and family.",

      "abstract": "Verbal and quantitative genetic models of sexually antagonistic coevolution suggest that coevolutionary arms races should be common. Sexual selection favors exaggeration of male persistence traits that are costly to females, and females, in turn, are selected to resist these traits. The heightened resistance by females is thought to then favor further exaggeration in the male trait, leading to an escalating coevolutionary arms race between persistence and resistance traits. Much of this theory, however, is based on an (implicit) assumption that there are tight constraints on how female resistance can evolve. We develop a theory that identifies and relaxes these constraints, allowing female resistance to evolve in a fashion that better reflects known empirical patterns in the evolution of female preference functions (the resistance trait). Our results suggest that evolutionary arms races that lead to the exaggeration of persistence and resistance will be much less common than formerly predicted. Females sometimes evolve indifference to male traits rather than resistance and can even evolve to discriminate against these traits. These alternative outcomes depend on the existence of genetic variance in the components of the female sensory system underlying female resistance and on the strength of natural selection acting on these components. Female indifference tends to evolve when natural selection on the sensory system is weak, and under these conditions, sexually antagonistic coevolution tends not to reduce female fitness significantly at equilibrium. When natural selection on the female sensory system is strong, however, then arms races are more likely, and female fitness is then sometimes significantly depressed at equilibrium. Sexually antagonistic coevolution is thus likely to have strong deleterious effects on population fitness only when female sensory traits are under strong natural selection to perform functions in addition to those involved with mating. Together, these results suggest that identifying the nature of genetic variation in and the strength of natural selection on female resistance should be a central goal of future studies of sexual conflict.",

      "title": "Digest: Sexual selection and conflict in a novel environment*",
      "abstract": "Understanding the role sexual selection plays in evolution is an intriguing challenge at any time, and especially in the face of rapid contemporary environmental change. Generally, sexual selection is thought to be stronger in males than in females (Kokko et al. ). This has led researchers to hypothesize that sexual selection could elevate population fitness, because deleterious mutations (that also affect females) are eliminated if low‐quality males are purged (Whitlock and Agrawal ). Opposing this idea, however, is the fact that sexual selection can cause the interests of males and females to differ, creating conflict between the sexes. There are two types of sexual conflict (Arnqvist and Rowe ). In interlocus conflict, antagonistic interactions can select for different traits in each sex, such as persistent male courtship and female mating resistance, that lower the fitness of the other sex. In intralocus conflict, selection on the same trait can differ between the sexes, such as when sexual selection favors greater trait expression in males than females (e.g., elongated tail feathers). Sexual conflict is inevitable whenever individuals compete for mates and fertilization opportunities (i.e., whenever there is sexual selection). The potentially opposing benefits of sexual selection and costs of sexual conflict for female reproductive output have implications for how populations evolve in a changed environment.",

      "title": "Men’s Provisioning of Oral Sex",
      "abstract": "Men sometimes engage in noncopulatory sexual behaviors, such as cunnilingus and other kinds of sexual foreplay. Men involved in long-term romantic relationships, in particular, tend to provision their partners with oral sex. Potential adaptive functions of cunnilingus in humans are discussed with a focus on the hypothesis that men use oral sex provisioning as part of a general benefit-provisioning, long-term mating strategy. Other potential adaptive functions are also considered, including the infidelity detection hypothesis and several hypotheses concerning sperm competition adaptations. Some research has proposed the possibility that men may use oral sex as a form of infidelity detection, wherein they might be able to smell or taste the semen of rival males in their partner’s vagina. Other research has posited that men might perform cunnilingus in order to induce orgasm in their partners, thereby increasing the amount of sperm retained in her reproductive tract after ejaculation. Still others have suggested that men might perform cunnilingus to increase their own arousal, thus increasing their subsequent ejaculate volume. These adaptive perspectives are couched within the wider literature on oral sex, which includes data regarding the frequency of oral sex in adolescent, preindustrial and non-Western samples, as well as women’s desire for receiving oral sex. Regarding the relative infrequency of cunnilingus in preindustrial and non-Western samples, in particular, men’s provisioning of oral sex is considered as potentially being a part of an evolved cognition for benefit-provisioning mate retention in general, rather than oral sex itself serving a specific adaptive function. Specifically, oral sex may be one type of sexual favor that men, especially those in Western cultures, sometimes provide to their long-term partners. Additional data regarding the increased sexual and relationship satisfaction in women who engage in a wider variety of sexual practices and who more frequently experience orgasm further supports the mate retention hypothesis of men’s provisioning of oral sex. Nevertheless, the available literature investigating these potential adaptive functions is currently insufficient to draw any decisive conclusions. Finally, gaps in the current literature and suggestions for future research that may help determine the evolved nature of men’s oral sex provisioning are discussed.",

      "title": "Equal Worth and the Duty to Adopt",
      "abstract": "Is one child more worthy of love, the opportunity to learn to read, a polio vaccination, or enough to eat than another child? Those who answer “no,” should consider that when one makes the decision to conceive a child instead of adopting an already existing child, one is saying that simply by virtue of its blood relation, a yet-to-exist child who has no needs is more worthy of one’s time, love, energy and money than an existing orphan who has great need.1 But if all children are equally worthy of love and resources, one must give these things based on who needs them the most as opposed to any morally irrelevant characteristic such as race, sex, birthplace, or potential biological relation to oneself, and already existing orphans desperately need these things while yet-to-exist children do not need them at all.2 If one truly believes that all children are equally worthy of love, education and material necessities, then one must act on the duty to adopt instead of conceiving biological children.3 One might object that biological relation to oneself is somehow in a different category from traits like race, sex, or birthplace. Yet blood relation is an ascriptive aspect of identity in the same way that race, sex, and birthplace are. Furthermore, these traits are all morally irrelevant, as they are traits for which one bears no responsibility. As Martha Nussbaum, of the University of Chicago, writes, “the accident of being born a Sri Lankan, or a Jew, or a female, or an African-American, or a poor person, is just that-an accident of birth” and thus should “not be taken to be a determinant of moral worth”.4 Aspects of identity that have no bearing on the worth of a child cannot be used to justify bringing that child into the world.5 6 Res Publica 87",

      "abstract": "The phenomenon of domesticated dogs looking to humans for information is ubiquitous, yet infrequently observed among other interspecies interactions. Dogs’ inclination to solicit information from humans is in large part a result of the two species’ shared social evolution and niche. Perhaps a more compelling aspect of this relationship is how dogs respond in the face of unexpected, uncertain, and/or novel cues from humans, from whom they frequently solicit information. The influence of human presence on canines’ curiosity about and engagement with their immediate environment is understudied, in part due to challenges in study design. SomeS of these challenges are common to working with and learning from babies of our own species. And, as dogs have developed many mental processes and behaviors similar to preverbal human infants, illuminating strategies for understanding curiosity in babies may prove useful in learning more about how dogs experience the world, with and without people.",

The combination of the frequent association between differential items, activities, and behaviors for each gender reproduces stereotypes. Gender distinctions are so self‐evident in our everyday lives that beliefs in differences in men's and women's traits, interests, and behaviors will persist until these connections are disrupted.",

The unconscious desire for a child, vis-a-vis the conscious knowledge of the problems such a child may create, plays a fundamental role in the emotional life of a woman. Men can complicate the problem; they often identify sexual potency with reproductive power, and refuse contraception for their female partners. The role of a physician in such situations is very important, very difficult and delicate. He is the one who knows, who advises, who prescribes, and who must, above all, understand. Information on contraception should be more widespread and more accurate, and every young couple should be convinced that contraception will help resolve many demographic problems, create a more responsible sexuality, improve the affective and economic situation of a family, and diminish maternal and perinatal morbidity.",

A basic component of individual concept is sex role identity which constitutes conceptualism of masculinity and feminism: how the person can adapt with beliefs which are approved by public deal with characteristics appropriate for man and women (Burns, 1993). Transsexual is person with the physic as man but he has desire to be woman so in his interaction with the environment, transsexual shows attitude and behavior which are not appropriate with his genital physic.\r\n\r\nThis recourse has goal to know the self-concept of transsexual and to know the factors with influence the self-concept of transsexual. The subjects here are three man who have characteristics as follows: a). who consider himself as a woman b) who is often or ever contact with transsexual c.) who is in early-middle-age (18-40 years), physic and psychology changes which accompany lack of reproductive ability (Hurlock, 1980) d.) show another sex identity continuously at least 2 years.\r\n\r\nThe data collective methods are used interview and observation. From the result of the data analysis can be concluded that personal concept of transsexual divided into four categories:\r\n \r\n1.

Self-judgment socially, judge a man can be sexual relation otherwise a woman just can be a friend, he tends to feel uncomforted interaction in environment, he likes if the environment treat him as woman.\r\n \r\nThere are factors which is influence transsexual to build their personal concept:\r\n1.

However, little research investigates how parents who were adolescents when they had children (early parents) talk with their teens about sex. In-depth interviews were conducted with a racially/ethnically diverse sample of 29 parents of seventh graders. Salient themes of conversations with adolescents were risks of early parenthood, sexually transmitted infections, delaying sex, and using protection. Compared with parents who were older when they had children (later parents), early parents were more likely to report having had negative sexuality communications with their families of origin and to express a wish to communicate differently with their own children. Early parents were more likely than later parents to discuss risks of early parenthood and to rely on extended family involvement in sexuality communication. Findings suggest that early parents may bring unique perspectives that enable them to approach sexuality communication differently than do later parents.",

      "abstract": "The current ‘holy grail’ for our health and well-being centres around the search for, and establishment of, a work/life balance. For many individuals, this appears to be an ever-elusive goal – forever slipping from our grasp as we juggle the day-to-day battle for our attention and time from an array of sources. When we add the word ‘Women’ to this mix, often the number of sources related to these demands multiplies in alignment with the number of roles we fill. To take this to even another level, consider the addition of the words ‘Sport’ or ‘Elite Athlete’ to ‘Women’ and ‘Work/Life Balance’, and the search for the ‘holy grail’ becomes more literal! Many sportswomen at the elite level face significant challenges in balancing working to support themselves and/or their families, studying to lay the foundations of a post-sport career, (often) spending the equivalent of full-time hours training towards their sporting goals, and additionally investing in the things that are important for them outside of these two areas – the ‘Life’ component. Getting the work/life balance ‘balanced’ has been suggested to be a key component of investing in our health and well-being. The same is applicable to sportswomen, with the added suggestion that if the balance between work/sport/life is achieved, this can positively impact upon sporting performance itself. These ideas and observations will be explored via experience within the Australian elite sporting environment from a psychologist’s perspective, with questions and invitations for further discussion.",

Viewed and perceived as new socio-cultural constructions within the basic structure (community matrix), both inter-dependently and dependent on the majority, this minority acquires (or will be assigned!) new directions of evolution/involution, far away from the general pattern, in time stalking or even posturing a new identity and consciousness. Charged or fined by the majority community, sometimes tolerated, sometimes categorically rejected. There are many cases, both old and new, of such segmentations, enclavings or exclusions with an economic, cultural or racial nature, generated by the imagination and/or authoritarianism of the majority: homo sapiens will use slowly but surely and irreversibly the tyranny of the majority and progress on less advanced technological-cognitive relatives, neanderthals and denisovans (plus several other subspecies of hominids, contemporary with homo sapiens); over the time, Christians will anathematize, enclave and/or kill the Jews for improbable deeds or on the basis of arrogant ethical/moral superiorities; the ancient or feudal masters disposed of the lives and possessions of the slaves they had, as they pleased; those who did not conform to official dogmas became instantly heretics and liable to all sorts of punishments (see the actions and justifications of the Inquisition); the prejudices regarding skin color, sexual orientation, ethnic or political affiliation, sometimes aggressively (apartheid in South Africa or racial segregation in the US) have determined certain defensive behaviors of these minorities, marginalized or excluded. Examples can easily be multiplied (talking about minors, the marginalized or excluded ones culturally, economically, racially, medically etc. for almost every country), but this is not the desideratum of the present study. Functionally and adaptively, the norms of a traditional community such as the Romanian one, repeatedly violated and corroborated with the refusal of alterity, led to a cultural-negative perception and to the location outside of the limits set by the community of such socio-cultural categories. Such marginals (called gueux in France, rogue in England, abenteurer in Germany, or picaras in Spain) are often mentioned at the level of fantastic Romanian fairy tale even if the details are meteoric or extremely lapidary. As the fantastic Romanian fairy tale illustrates, it is established and legitimated first of all the ideal of purity, beauty and superiority (social, economic, moral); still there are mentions of the problematical interethnic relations, cultural conflicts, failures of social adaptation to the generally accepted system; finally, as we do not have such a study about these social categories, I find it appropriate to approach this topic. My approach will be a structural-functional one, dialectically speaking, most of the mentions about these social categories being found in the anthologies of fairy tales, juxtaposing, overlapping or complementing the three categories (marginal, minority, excluded) conceptually.",

      "abstract": "In certain threatening social encounters, humans seem to act distrustfully, uncooperatively, even aggressively by default, and must reason themselves towards comity and moderation. Yet, the contemporary scientific literature mostly supports the opposite view, according to which we are “intuitively prosocial”: acting cooperatively by default in positive-sum interactions in games such as the Prisoner’s dilemma. Could a change in the nature of the game elicit a different profile of default behavior? Across four studies we investigate whether intuition might also favor defensive aggression. We develop a “pre-emptive strike game” in which two players make a series of decisions about whether to live-and-let-live, or instead pay a small cost to imposing a large cost on the other player, knocking them out of the game. In this setting we find that default aggression prevails. Moreover, this aggressive tendency can be overridden when playing the game against in-group members, but tends not to be when playing against out-group members. In short, when faced with a social partner who may choose to harm them, people default towards defensive aggression.",

It is worth noting that such phases, while they may be appropriate for considering sexual development, are not the best way of looking at ego and superego development, nor at the development of relationships with others—matters dealt with later in the lectures. Any prohibition given to the child during the time of infantile sexuality can remain as an inhibition or develop into an inhibition, and can hold up adult sexuality; this does not mean that freedom given to infantile sexuality guarantees normality in the adult—far from it. There was no way of understanding from the theory of sex life, as it existed then, where all the many abnormalities of sex life come from. Even in those times, children before the age of adolescence or preadolescence were known to show sexual reactions and to have genital interests.",

      "title": "Defining sexual boundaries between children and adults",
      "abstract": "Child sexual abuse is a widespread problem with potential serious psychological and physical sequelae. The majority of the perpetrators of this abuse are known by the victim, and are often a member of the victim's household. Child sexual abuse most commonly occurs as a gradual progression from behaviors that are difficult to distinguish from normal caretaking or expressions of affection, to behaviors that are more physiologically invasive. This study begins to address intrafamilial abuse by surveying the opinions of professionals-child psychologists, child psychiatrists and pediatricians-regarding when selected behaviors, related to nudity, cosleeping and kissing on the lips become inappropriate. An interaction between child and parent gender was found for all investigated behaviors. The age at which behaviors related to nudity and cosleeping were said to become inappropriate was younger for different-gender parent and child than for same-gender parent and child. The opposite was found for kissing. Examination of respondent characteristics found that those professionals who are younger, do not have a psychodynamic orientation, or are from the western states generally respond that the investigated behaviors become inappropriate at later ages than those who do not have these characteristics. In addition, although psychologists and psychiatrists were not found to significantly differ in their responses, pediatricians generally responded with a significantly older age cut-off than did either of the other two professions.",

      "title": "Positive Attitudes and (Some) Negative Behaviors",
      "abstract": "This chapter explores aspects of peer culture that are thought to conflict with academic achievement: attitudes and beliefs (about racism and discrimination, peer culture attitudes, and perceptions of opportunities) and behavioral scripts with respect to conflict. In terms of attitudes and beliefs, there is little evidence for oppositional peer cultures and no evidence that perceptions of discrimination lead to low aspirations. The few students who express oppositional attitudes cannot account for the overall low achievement rates, where only a minority of students leave qualified to start a university education. In terms of behavior, teens place much importance on defending self-pride and showing toughness when it comes to conflict with peers, which sometimes end in physical fighting. Engaging in peer conflicts serves two purposes: preventing real, physical violence, because in schools, appearing weak led to being bullied; and also, because it brought peer status by demonstrating self-pride and toughness. These conflicts do not signal defiance of school authorities or opposition to school norms, nor do they stem from a lack of interest in academic excellence. Rather, they are described by teens as inevitable and sometimes necessary responses to situations at school. As with consumption, gender is found to matter. For young men, masculinity is tied to toughness, defending self-pride, and being seen as hip. Pressures of masculinity lead boys to place more importance on maintaining self-pride among peers. This connection makes boys even more invested in peer status than their girl counterparts, for whom femininity is less likely to come into conflict with adult school culture.",

We are now a long way from the Victorian, moralistic, judgemental view that masturbation must not take place because it is wrong. Temporary feelings of guilt are a normal reaction to masturbation; it is when this guilt seriously interferes with the person's whole life that we should take it as a 'danger sign'. Most male adolescents are normally more open about this activity and about some of the fears or worries accompanying it. Some female adolescents deal with it in a different way from males, and it is not unusual for girls not to have the conscious wish to masturbate at all. For a girl, this could be quite a normal reaction, whereas in the case of a boy we would see such a reaction as much more related to 'danger signs' either now or at some time in the future.",

      "title": "The Erotic Transference in Women and in Men: Differences and Consequences",
      "abstract": "Although the erotic transference is believed to be universal, it is variable in its expression. Drawing on the distinction between transference resistance and resistance to the awareness of the transference, I have proposed that, in general, the erotic transference utilized as resistance is more common among women, while resistance to the awareness of the erotic transference is more common among male patients. Erotic transference as resistance poses different analytic problems from those posed by resistance to its awareness. With women in treatment with men, the erotic transference is more often overt, consciously experienced, intense, long-lived and directed toward the analyst, and focused more on love than sex; with men in treatment with women, the erotic transference is muted, relatively short-lived, appears indirectly in dreams and triangular preoccupations, is seldom consciously experienced as a dominant affective motif, is frequently transposed to a woman outside the analytic situation, and most often appears as sexual rather than as a longing for love. In women, the strength of the erotic transference may obscure other important dynamics and conflicts. In short, the strength of the erotic transference, while it has significant therapeutic potential, often acts as a strong transference resistance to working out underlying conflicts. In contrast, in male patients in treatment with women, there is a resistance to the experience of the transference and, frequently, one witnesses defenses against the erotic transference rather than the transference itself. Yet, the dangers are substantial when the erotic transference fails to develop or is suppressed. This difference in the manifestation of the erotic transference parallels an extratherapeutic difference. In general, women achieve their self-identity as women by virtue of certain defining relationships, whereas men achieve their self-identity as men through achievement and autonomy. The reasons for these differences have been explored in terms of cultural dictates, but more particularly in terms of an asymmetry in psychological development.",

Preferential avoidance of heights, snakes, darkness, and spiders-environmental hazards in human evolutionary history-are learned more readily than are fears of environmentally novel hazards such as cars or guns. Habitats offering resources and protection simultaneously, to take another example, are preferred over those lacking these attributes (Kaplan, this volume; Orians, 1980, Orians &amp; Heerwagen, this volume). Perhaps nowhere are preferences more apparent than in human mating decisions. Nowhere do individuals prefer to mate with all members of the opposite sex equally (Buss, 1989a; Symons, 1979).",

      "abstract": "Couples experience greater satisfaction and desire when they are motivated to meet each other's sexual needs (sexual communal strength); however, doing so at the expense of one's own sexual needs (unmitigated sexual communion) can detract from satisfaction and desire. Self-determination theory suggests engaging in sex for pleasure and value (autonomous reasons) versus out of pressure and obligation (controlled reasons) may account for these differences. Across two dyadic studies, one cross-sectional (N = 103 couples) and one longitudinal (N = 147 couples), people higher in sexual communal strength had sex for more autonomous and less controlled reasons, and in turn, reported greater satisfaction and desire, overall, in daily life, and over time. In contrast, people higher in unmitigated sexual communion endorsed more controlled reasons for engaging in sex, and in turn reported lower satisfaction. Partners of people higher in sexual communal strength reported less controlled reasons for engaging in sex, and in turn, both partners felt more satisfied, whereas partners of people high in unmitigated sexual communion endorsed more controlled reasons and reported lower satisfaction. This research furthers our understanding of when and why being motivated to be responsive to a partner's sexual needs enhances or detracts from sexual and relationship quality.",

Theories of sexual addiction suggest that these individuals regulate their emotions poorly, as evidenced by coactivation of positive and negative emotions during sexual stimulation. Men and women who either reported problems down-regulating their use of VSS (VSS-P, N = 71) or no problem regulating use of VSS (VSS-C, N = 49) watched a neutral film and a sexual film. They reported their positive and negative feelings after each film. Unexpectedly, the VSS-P group exhibited significantly less coactivation of positive and negative affect to the sexual film than VSS-C. This is inconsistent with emotion dysregulation, supposedly a key feature of “hypersexual disorder.” Affect regulation could be failing at a different stage of sexual stimulus processing not studied.

Statistics do not adequately convey the intricacies of male sexual desire; it is a complex construct, encompassing interest, arousal and motivation for initiating or responding to sexual cues for dyadic or solitary sexual behaviors. A range of etiological factors are implicated in this dysfunction, and relational conflict and stress are high among them. Anger and resentment for one’s partner can result in absent desire for the partner, with sexual desire still intact for other sexual outlets (other partners, masturbation, pornography). Sexual secrets are therefore important to consider as well as shame about the true nature of one’s sexual desires. Systemic sex therapy, with its emphasis on identifying and addressing a wide range of etiological factors while also focusing on behavioral interventions to improve desire, is an effective treatment option for men suffering low desire in the context of an ongoing relationship.",

Declines in sexual interest can result from health deficits that pose barriers to sex; however, for older adults who are healthy and able to have sex, socioemotional factors may influence sexual satisfaction. This study examined the associations between socioemotional variables, sexual interest, and sexual satisfaction among older adults. Data were drawn from the subset of adults ages 60+ in UCSD SAGE study (n=359). A series of linear regression models were fitted to examine sexual interest and sexual satisfaction as separate outcomes while accounting for demographics (age, gender, marital status, race/ethnicity), socioemotional variables (morale, self-compassion, satisfaction with life), and health indicators (physical function, general health). Older adults who were younger ages (B=-.172, p=.001), men compared to women (B=.283, p&amp;lt;.001), married/partnered compared to single (B=.213, p&amp;lt;.001), and had better physical functioning (B=.214, p&amp;lt;.001) reported higher sexual interest. In the model for sexual satisfaction among sexually active older adults (n=148), those with greater morale (B=-.027, p=.03) and better physical function (B=.271, p=.003) reported higher sexual satisfaction. Findings reinforce the importance of physical function for sexual interest and satisfaction among older adults. Socioemotional factors, such as morale, are more strongly associated with sexual satisfaction. However, these relationships may be bidirectional or recursive in nature (i.e., those with higher morale are satisfied with sexual encounters, and that sexual satisfaction may lead to higher morale), requiring additional longitudinal studies.",

Some degree of misery was very common indeed but was more likely to be severe in girls than in boys. About half the girls had, on some occasion in the past year, felt that life was hopeless or not worth living. Since these feelings are related to their social isolation outside school, they might be alleviated by improved opportunities for contract with peers. This seems particularly important in view of the capacity of most teenagers to make reasonable relationships where the opportunity exists, e.g. at school or within the family. Over half those who had left school were either unemployed or very dissatisfied with their job. In addition to worries about work, preoccupations about sexual relatinships, sexual function, and marriage were common. About two-thirds of the teenagers hoped to get married and half of these thought they could have children. Girls were particularly worried about their capacity to conceive and boys had understandable concerns about potency. Very few had consulted anyone about this or had had advice about the genetic aspects of the condition and there is a clear need for adequate counseling to help such teenagers to distinguish between real and imagined fears about the consequences of their condition.",

      "abstract": "Although sexual abuse of children has likely been present for ages, its recognition in the United States and other countries has dramatically increased in the past 5 years. Reported cases, which represent an unknown fraction of actual cases, now account for approximately 25% of all abuse and neglect reports. Local, county, and state agencies are staggering under the load, and many are relying heavily on pediatricians to assist them in their work. DEFINITION Sexual abuse can be defined as the engaging of a child in sexual activites that the child does not understand, to which the child cannot give informed consent, or which violate the social taboos of society. This definition is broad and includes intrafamilial and extrafamilial forms and all types of sexual activities (eg, exhibitionism, fondling, child pornography, oral, anal, and genital sexual contact). The interface between \"normal sexual exploratory behavior\" and \"sexual abuse\" is not clearly defined. Pediatricians should, however, use common sense. If two 4-year-old children are found to be playing without clothes, touching each others' genitals and giggling, there is probably little to worry about. The same is true if two 15-year-old adolescents are discovered together. A probably exists if the 15-year-old child (some states set statutory 2- to 4-year limits within which sexual activities are not to be considered abuse) or if one 4-year-old child is engaging in fellatio or attempting intercourse with another preschool-aged child.",

For many gay, lesbian, and bisexual youths and adults, these realities are linked to moral differentiations that society hasbased on modes of HIV transmission. Those termed “medical victims” (i.e., blood transfusion recipients, men with hemophilia, and infants infected perinatally) are seen as deserving compassion, while those who acquire the disease through sexual transmission are stigmatized and are associated with homosexuality and other “condemned lifestyles” (Manning, 1997; Novick, 1997). For many gay, lesbian, and bisexual youths, these perspectives frequently connect HIV/ AIDS to several disquieting concerns: being a member of the social group blamed for starting the “gay plague,” seeing portraits of gay men and lesbians with physically frightening manifestations, observing death and dying, witnessing increased anti-gay violence, viewing prevention messages that do not affirm “immoral” (i.e., homosexual) behaviors, engaging in same-sex behaviors that are labeled “taboo,” and experiencing homophobic behaviors that underlie social attitudes toward sexuality, including sexual pleasure outside of marriage (Public Media Center, 1995). Gay, lesbian, and bisexual youths have to face these HIV/ AIDS-related stigmatized portrayals while developing their personal, social, and sexual identities. Gay, lesbian, and bisexual youths must also meet the special challenge of avoiding HIV infection.",

Het is voor de uroloog belangrijk kennis te hebben van seksualiteit en de gevolgen daarvan bij urologische ziekten, die op een aantal fronten anders zijn. Dit artikel beschrijft accentverschillen in seksuele beleving van MSM. Het geeft een overzicht van verschillende urologische diagnosen en problemen, waaronder erectie- en ejaculatiestoornissen, prostaatproblemen, hypogonadisme en urologische behandelingen, met hun relatie tot die seksuele beleving. Urogenitale maligniteiten zoals blaas-, prostaat-, penis- en testiscarcinomen komen vaker voor bij hiv. Chemseks (seks onder invloed van drugs) verhoogt het risico op urologische problemen en op soa, door vaker onveilige (ruwere) seks en meerdere sekspartners waarmee chemseks gepaard gaat. Meer kennis en een open gesprek over MSM zal leiden tot meer kennis en acceptatie van de seksuele gevolgen van urologische problemen en behandelingen bij MSM.",

The rapid advances registered during the last decade in our understanding of sex and its aberrations have resulted in confusion in the minds of some, however, concerning the contribution of various factors (genetic, gonadal, hormonal) towards the sexual identity of an individual.<sup>1</sup>As a result, females have been declared ineligible for athletic competition for no other apparent reason than the presence of an extra chromosome, presumably in the sex chromosome complex. This seems grossly unfair if other criteria of sex conform with the person's social sex. In most individuals the nine components of sexual phenotype (external genital appearance, internal reproductive organs, structure of the gonads, endocrinologic sex, genetic sex, nuclear sex, chromosomal sex, psychological sex, social sex) conform",

      "abstract": "Although normal expression of sexual desire is recognized as one of the important aspects of sexual life throughout the life course, older adults experience many barriers to expressing their sexual needs and desires. Thus, this study explored the barriers to the expression of sexual desires in older ages. A qualitative study was adopted with a conventional content analysis approach. Nineteen elderly males and females over 60 years participated in this study. Data were collected by semi-structured individual interviews until data saturation and concurrently analyzed via MAXQDA 10. Four main themes emerged from data analysis as the main barriers of expression of sexual desires in the older ages: existing stereotypes about sexual roles of older adults; declining emotional bonding and intimacy; experiencing a sense of sexual dysfunction; and unpleasant aspects about spouse and life. Older adults are not easy to express his/her sexual desires and believe that having sexual activities in the aging years might be considered inappropriate behavior. As a result, most older adults end up suppressing their sexual desires. Hence, geriatric health-care delivery systems should have a focus on how to provide the necessary consultations and support for older persons.",

En este trabajo se indagaron las representaciones sociales de jóvenes universitarios acerca de los celos, así como las diferencias por sexo. La metodología fue cualitativa, participaron 6 hombres y 4 mujeres. Entre los hallazgos destaca que los jóvenes tienen una representación dicotómica constituida por dos tipos de celos: los aceptados y los no aceptados. Cada tipo de celos va a determinar la experiencia y las conductas que se está dispuesto a vivir con la pareja. En cuanto a las diferencias por sexo, los hombres marcan como celos aceptados los celos que ellos mismos expresan hacia la pareja, es decir, son autorreferenciales. Los celos no aceptados, para los hombres implican algún tipo de violencia, por ejemplo, agresiones físicas. En el caso de las mujeres, su representación social de los celos no aceptados implica no aceptar violencia verbal ni prohibiciones.",

It was hypothesised that Swedish children would be more traditional regarding sex‐role behavior both with respect to their conception and to their self‐attribution than the kibbutz‐raised Israelian children since the strive for equality between the sexes, according to the kibbutz ideology, has been more pronounced in Israel than in Sweden. The results did not confirm the hypothesis.

      "abstract": "Men's altruism may have evolved, via female choice, as a signal of either their genetic quality or their willingness to allocate resources to offspring. The possibility that men display altruism to signal their genetic quality may be tested by examining women's preference for men's altruism across the stages of the menstrual cycle. Because women can maximize reproductive benefits by mating with men who have “good genes” on high-fertility versus low-fertility days, women should show a heightened preference for male altruism on high-fertility days compared to low-fertility days, and this heightened preference should be more apparent when women evaluate men for short-term sexual relationships than for long-term committed relationships. The possibility that men display altruism to signal their willingness to provision, as opposed to their genetic quality, may be tested by examining women's preference for men's altruism toward different recipients. More specifically, altruistic behavior toward family members may reflect a willingness to provide resources for kin and, hence, willingness to provision, whereas altruistic behavior toward strangers may function as an honest signal of genetic quality. In two samples of young women (TVs = 131 and 481), we found no differences between high- and low-fertility participants in preference for men's altruism, and women preferred men's altruism more in long-term than short-term relationships. The findings suggest that men's altruistic behavior functions as a signal of willingness to provide resources rather than genetic quality.",

      "title": "Experiences of solitude in adulthood and old age: The role of autonomy",
      "abstract": "Recent evidence suggests that older adults experience momentary states of spending time alone (i.e., solitude) less negatively than younger adults. The current research explores the role of autonomy as an explanation mechanism of these age differences. Previous research demonstrated that solitude can be experienced positively when it is characterized by autonomy (i.e., the own wish or decision to be alone). As older adults are relatively more autonomous in their daily lives, they might experience solitude less negatively (in terms of subjective well-being, social integration, self-esteem, and valence) than younger adults. We tested this hypothesis in three studies. In two experience-sampling studies (Study 1: N = 129, 59.7% women, age 19-88 years; Study 2: N = 115, 66.4% women, age 18-85 years), older age and higher autonomy were associated with more positive experience of everyday solitude moments. Although autonomy did not differ between younger and older adults, perceived (lack of) autonomy partly played a more important role for the experience of solitude moments in younger adults compared to older adults. Finally, Study 3 (N = 323, 52% women, age 19-79 years) showed that the relationship between recalled solitude moments of high versus low autonomy and solitude experience is fully explained by feelings of autonomy. Overall, our results demonstrate that older people do not experience more autonomy in situations of solitude than younger adults, but that they partly better cope with low-autonomy solitude. However, people of all ages seem to benefit more from high-autonomy moments of solitude.",

Inquiry to address this issue could pertain to gender similarities and differences; moreover, it could provide greater understanding of the behavior itself, in this case, animal maltreatment. Of the various patterns of animal maltreatment in the literature, there are enough studies with gender addressed to allow some observations on two patterns: animal cruelty in childhood and animal hoarding. Animal cruelty among girls may be more common than is widely assumed, but substantial recurrent cruelty appears, as expected, to be more common among males and is consistent with conduct disorder occurring more frequently among boys. Females, especially older females who live alone, predominate among animal hoarders, whose psychology is altogether different from those who engage in antisocial cruelty. The potential significance of these observations is discussed within the contexts of developmental and gender psychology.",

Third, satire can be divided into resistant satire, imitative satire, and popular satire. Resistance satire with anti-social tendencies through their clothing is achieved by expressing their needs. It was affected by sub-culture like Hippie or Punk. Imitative satire is to imitate other culture, customs and race. It is to resolve complaints through the consumption of things in disparities of wealth and materialism in the society.

This diagnosis is intended to include only individuals who experience dissatisfaction with their low levels of sexual desire. Women with this condition will often report that they \"want to want\" more sex, while women with low levels of sexual desire that do not meet HSDD criteria will indicate no bother or concerns with the frequency of their sexual desire. The subjective experience of distress caused by low desire is a critical component of the diagnosis of HSDD because many individuals are not alarmed by low levels of sexual desire. Indeed, an epidemiological study conducted in Australia demonstrated that 32% of women who are 20–70 years old report low sexual desire, but only 16% report distress caused by the low sexual desire [2].",

Initially, Buss and his associates explained these results by suggesting that men are concerned about uncertainty of paternity, that is, the possibility of raising another man's child while believing the child is their own. However, later they explained the results in terms of men's preference for short-term sexual strategies. The purpose of this research was to test the explanation of short-term sexual strategies. Men and women subjects were instructed to imagine themselves in a relationship which was either short-term (primarily sexual) or long-term (involving commitment) and then respond to Buss's jealousy items. It was hypothesized that, when both men and women imagined a short-term relationship, they would be more threatened by a partner's sexual infidelity, and, when they imagined a long-term relationship, they would be more threatened by a partner's emotional infidelity. Support was found for this hypothesis.",

Literature suggests that positive parenting is a buffer against peer influence. In this study, 992 Belgian adolescents (50% girls; 12 to 20 years) reported on own experience and timing of sexual behaviour, perceived parenting and descriptive and injunctive peer norms. Regressions revealed that parental behavioural control predicted later timing of sexual debut. Only descriptive peer norms predicted more sexual experience. The parents-as-buffer hypothesis was not supported. Four parenting by peer interactions, however, showed that positive parenting intensifies peer prediction of sexual development, particularly during late adolescence. Together, this study emphasizes the importance of parenting strategies that enable adolescents to make their own autonomous decisions (regarding sexual and other behaviours) within the context of peer relations, where various types of influence may play a role.",

Shame can have a salutary social effect when it pushes us to be lawful, mannerly, and civil. Or it can become rather morally suspect when it tempts us to disavow our religion, nation, race, or some aspects, not all by any means, of sexual desire. In those cases in which there may be grounds for distrusting the moral quality of the shame felt, we can blame the person as a self-hater, as someone culpably not at ease with himself, culpable because he is cowardly and disloyal to what we say he is. (Funny how we are often so much surer of the identities we impose on others than of the ones we feel we can claim for ourselves.) Or we can blame the unjust order that makes him have to mobilize courage simply to be black, a Jew, gay, or a member of some other group condemned by the dominant order to be pariahs. Or, as is often the case, we blame both – the pariah no less than the unjust order.",

      "abstract": "Young children search for cues about gender—who should or should not do a particular activity, who can play with whom, and why girls and boys are different. From a vast array of gendered cues in their social worlds, children quickly form an impressive constellation of gender cognitions, including gender self-conceptions (gender identity) and gender stereotypes. Cognitive perspectives on gender development (i.e., cognitive developmental theory and gender-schema theory) assume that children actively search for ways to make sense of the social world that surrounds them. Gender identity develops as children realize that they belong to one gender group, and the consequences include increased motivation to be similar to other members of their group, preferences for members of their own group, selective attention to and memory for information relevant to their own sex, and increased interest in activities relevant to their own sex. Cognitive perspectives have been influential in increasing understanding of how children develop and apply gender stereotypes, and in their focus on children's active role in gender socialization.",

Relationship anxiety was most parsimoniously related to unresolved issues with one's family of origin, lack of personal income, having a strong libido, being young, and being female (canonical correlation = .25). Relationship avoidance was also correlated with not having affectionate and available parents, not having a secure and loving family, high parental conflict, low parental education and income, not having grown up with both parents, family violence, and low libido. Relationship anxiety was also correlated with low personal education. Marital status, ethnicity, and religious denomination were unrelated to either construct.",

Women participating in sport and exercise are under these broad cultural pressures, as well as additional pressures to conform to a particular body type relating to their sport or preferred mode of exercise. For instance, in sports with an aesthetic, antigravitational, or weight category component, there is pressure to be lean; in other sports, there may be pressures to conform to a muscular ideal to confer a performance advantage. These subcultural and societal expectations may sometimes clash and can also lead to body dissatisfaction if women perceive a mismatch between their own body and these body ideals. In this chapter, the effects of subcultural and societal pressures on body image among women who exercise are analysed, along with a consideration of what kinds of interventions might promote positive body image among exercising females.",

      "abstract": "Opponents of lesbian and gay parental rights claim that children with lesbigay parents are at higher risk for a variety of negative outcomes. Yet most research in psychology concludes that there are no differences in developmental outcomes between children raised by lesbigay parents and those raised by heterosexual parents. The analysis here challenges this defensive conceptual framework and analyzes how heterosexism has hampered intellectual progress in the field. The authors discuss limitations in the definitions, samples, and analyses of the studies to date. Next they explore findings from 21 studies and demonstrate that researchers frequently downplay findings indicating difference regarding children’s gender and sexual preferences and behavior that could stimulate important theoretical questions. A less defensive, more sociologically informed analytic framework is proposed for investigating these issues. The framework focuses on (1) whether selection effects produced by homophobia account for associations between parental sexual orientations and child outcomes; (2) the role of parental gender vis-a-vis sexual orientation in influencing children’s gender development; and (3) the relationship between parental sexual orientations and children’s sexual preferences and behaviors.",

When there was an atypical preference, participants provided more atypical resources to the children. However, when the setting was public, they provided fewer atypical resources. Overall the results indicate that gender norms are especially strong in public settings but explicit information about preferences can lead children to be flexible about gender norms.",

Subjects were 212 adult male-to-female transsexuals. These were divided into four groups: one homosexual and three nonhomosexual. The three nonhomosexual groups were heterosexual, bisexual, and analloerotic (unattracted to male or female partners, but not necessarily devoid of all erotic behavior). A Core Autogynephilia Scale was developed to assess a subject's propensity to be sexually aroused by the fantasy of being a woman. The four transsexual groups were compared on this measure (and on several others), using Newman-Keuls multiple-range tests at p <. 05. As predicted, all three nonhomosexual groups were more likely than the homosexual group to report sexual stimulation by cross-gender fantasy. This finding supports the hypothesis that the major types of nonhomosexual gender dysphoria constitute variant forms of one underlying disorder, which may be characterized as autogynephilic gender dysphoria.",

Conduct according to rules of a given sport has no moral character. It has only pragmatic character, similarly as conduct in compliance with principles of the administrative code, the civil code or the penal code. Of course, when you act in accordance with rules of sports rivalry you can additionally realize also other aims - like, for example, aesthetic, spectacular or moral ones. However, in each case rules of the game and legal norms have priority, because they are the most important regulative determinant of conduct in various societies, including variously defined human teams. The above mentioned legal and sports regulations are not moral norms. They can, however, influence moral behaviours if they are in conflict with the law or rules of the game. From that viewpoint moral norms are exterritorial in their relation to assumptions and rules of a particular sport. Contestants and people responsible for them - like, for example, coaches or sports officials - as well as their employers are neither required to account for their moral beliefs, nor for their moral behaviours, if only they act in compliance with rules of sports rivalry.",

Fifty men with at least one son completed questionnaires regarding affectionate communication in their relationships with their sons and their fathers.

Using Peggy Orenstein’s Boys and Sex: Young Men on Hookups, Love, Porn, Consent, and Navigating the New Masculinity (2020) as a source text, I draw on the Lacanian concept of “the subject who is supposed to know” to elucidate the homosocial nature of masculinity. A Lacanian reading of Boys and Sex suggests that American high school and college men’s desires are incited by the ostensible enjoyment, or jouissance, they witness other men experiencing when engaging in “masculine” behaviors. Orenstein’s adolescent and young-adult interviewees demonstrate how “what one wants” is inextricably bound with what one sees (or interprets) other men wanting. While Men and Masculinities scholars argue that performances of masculinity are enacted to avoid ostracism and humiliation, a Lacanian account centers on the psychic pursuit of (illusory) wholeness. Lastly, Lacan’s notion of “traversing the fantasy” offers a path toward reclaiming agency despite the sway of cultural ideals and the gaze of Others.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The complexities of women's sexual response preclude useful management strategies which are modelled only on the traditional human sex response cycle beginning with sexual desire rather than other motivations. Both biological and psychological parameters affecting women's sexual motivation and arousability can be depicted in alternative models. These reflect that motivations to begin a sexual experience, although varied, are most often intimacy-based in women. The key role of subjective sexual arousal, which often precedes and then accompanies sexual desire, is clarified. A positive outcome emotionally and physically is necessary to achieve the original goal of enhancing emotional closeness, sense of being attracted and attractive, committed, loved—together with the goal (accessed en route) of sexual satisfaction. Innate, spontaneous desire may only occasionally augment the intimacy-based motivation. Thus therapy for 'desire disorders' may more profitably focus on the woman's problematic motivation, inadequate sexual stimuli and context, diminished arousability and/or unsatisfactory outcome to an experience. A model of subjective sexual arousal reflects the ongoing affective and cognitive modulation and variable input from physical genital congestion. Awareness of the poor correlation between genital vasocongestion and the subjective experience allows subtyping of arousal problems in order to facilitate their management.",

A second study supported a role rejection account of this finding by demonstrating that (a) U.S. women reacted much more negatively to the traditional gender role expectations for modesty than did comparable men, and (b) those women who reacted most negatively also evidenced the greatest role-inconsistent intentions. The possibility is discussed that seemingly ambivalent role behavior may not be a result of role conflict but instead to the presence or absence of salient role-related stimuli.",

      "abstract": "Human sexual dimorphism has been widely misunderstood. A large literature has underestimated the effect of differences in body composition and the role of male contest competition for mates. It is often assumed that sexually dimorphic traits reflect a history of sexual selection, but natural selection frequently builds different phenotypes in males and females. The relatively small sex difference in stature (∼7%) and its decrease during human evolution have been widely presumed to indicate decreased male contest competition for mates. However, females likely increased in stature relative to males in order to successfully deliver large-brained neonates through a bipedally-adapted pelvis. Despite the relatively small differences in stature and body mass (∼16%), there are marked sex differences in body composition. Across multiple samples from groups with different nutrition, males typically have 36% more lean body mass, 65% more muscle mass, and 72% more arm muscle than women, yielding parallel sex differences in strength. These sex differences in muscle and strength are comparable to those seen in primates where sexual selection, arising from aggressive male mating competition, has produced high levels of dimorphism. Body fat percentage shows a reverse pattern, with females having ∼1.6 times more than males and depositing that fat in different body regions than males. We argue that these sex differences in adipose arise mainly from natural selection on women to accumulate neurodevelopmental resources.",

      "abstract": "There are sizable gender differences in aggressive behavior, with men displaying a much higher propensity for violence than women. Evolutionary theories suggest that men's more violent nature derives in part from their historically greater need to compete over access to potential mates. The current research investigates this link between mating and male violence and provides rigorous experimental evidence that mating motives cause men to behave violently toward other men. In these studies, men and women were primed with a mating motive and then performed a noise-blast aggression task. Being primed with mating led men, but not women, to deliver more painful blasts of white noise to a same-sex partner (but not an opposite-sex partner). This effect was particularly pronounced among men with an unrestricted sociosexual orientation, for whom competition over access to new mates is an especially relevant concern. Findings also suggest that mating-induced male violence is motivated by a desire to assert one's dominance over other men: when men were given feedback that they had won a competition with their partner (and thus had achieved dominance through nonaggressive means), the effect of the mating prime on aggression was eliminated. These findings provide insight into the motivational roots of male aggression and illustrate the value of testing theories from evolutionary biology with rigorous experimental methods.",

      "abstract": "Human gender differences tend to be largest in behaviors of high reproductive relevance, that is, sexual and parenting behavior. Such differences show up best in biologically meaningful configurations of specific behaviors rather than in coarse categories. Paternal involvement is thus expressed in aspects and optima which differ from those of maternal involvement. A case in point is sensitivity in its effect on secure attachment, with paternal behavior to be measured by a yardstick different from maternal behavior. Secure father-child attachment may be fostered by optimal levels of paternal activation/stimulation which are different from maternal optima. Paternal action preferences lead to preferences for rough play, which may be especially relevant to the socialization of male offspring. Moreover, fathers-unlike mothers-may perceive their paternal effort as mating effort. The study of father-child attachment-and especially its differences from mother-child attachment-can benefit from considering evolved sex differences in parental behavior.",

      "abstract": "Gender gaps may be observed in a variety of economic and social environments. One of the possible determining factors is that men are more competitive than women and so, when the competitiveness of the environment increases, the performance of men increases relative to that of women. We test this hypothesis in a field study conducted with 9-year old children, running on a track. They first run alone and then in pairs over a short distance with different gender composition of the pairs. The results support the hypothesis that performance in competition varies according to gender. When children ran alone, there was no difference in performance. In competition boys, but not girls, improved their performance. This finding relates to the discussion regarding single sex schools: the outcomes of examinations in a mixed sex school can show a gender gap in favor of boys, even when this gap does not reflect actual abilities. Girls who are as talented as boys will end up performing worse just because they are not as competitive, and will not achieve as high scores in examinations as boys.",

      "abstract": "Recent studies on the experiences of gay Asian men demonstrate that members of these groups experience both subtle and blatant forms of racism within lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer/questioning (LGBTQ) communities. This study expands on previous research by examining how gay Vietnamese American men experience racism within the gay community of Southern California, how racism affects members of this group mentally and emotionally, and their responses when facing racism. Based on 17 semi-structured, in-depth interviews with self-identified gay Vietnamese American men living in Southern California, this study found that they experienced racism similarly to other gay Asian men. Race and racism shape the everyday experiences of gay Vietnamese American men through the racial paradox of gay desire as they are either deemed undesirable and rejected as a potential sexual and romantic interest, or they are racially fetishized. However, members of this group do not experience racism passively but actively respond through various acts of resistance and intra-racial and ethnic community-building.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT People with a field‐dependent or field‐independent cognitive style are different in their interpersonal behavior in ways predicted from the theory of psychological differentiation. Field‐dependent people make greater use of external social referents, but only when the situation is ambiguous and these referents provide information that helps remove the ambiguity; field‐independent people function with greater autonomy from others under such conditions. Field‐dependent people are more attentive to social cues than field‐independent people. Field‐dependent people have an interpersonal orientation: they show strong interest in others, prefer to be physically close to people, are emotionally open and gravitate toward social situations. Field‐independent people have an impersonal orientation: they are not very interested in others, show both physical and psychological distancing from people and prefer nonsocial situations. Finally, field‐dependent and field‐independent people are different in an array of characteristics which make it likely that field‐dependent people will get along better with others. Altogether, field‐dependent people have a set of social skills that are less evident in field‐independent people. On the other hand, field‐independent people have greater skill in cognitive analysis and structuring. This pattern suggests that, with regard to value judgments, the field‐dependence‐independence dimension is bipolar; each of the contrasting cognitive styles has components adaptive to particular situations.",

      "title": "Copulatory Urgency",
      "abstract": "Copulatory urgency is produced by a psychological adaptation that evolved to solve the adaptive problem of sexual conflict resulting from the use of conditional mating strategies. Deployment of a long-term mating strategy, in which individuals invest substantially in the formation and maintenance of an enduring, committed relationship with one partner, puts those individuals at risk of loss of that investment (and more) should their long-term partner pursue a conflicting mating strategy. Consequently, people have evolved motivations, such as copulatory urgency, which protect against that loss. As the potential costs of a partner’s use of a conflicting mating strategy are sex-specific, so too are the manifestations of copulatory urgency. Among men, for whom paternity uncertainty, sperm competition, and cuckoldry are of primary evolutionary concern, copulatory urgency is demonstrated in response to increased risk of a partner’s sexual infidelity and results in behaviors that functioned ancestrally to reduce the risk of cuckoldry. Women, on the other hand, are not subject to maternal uncertainty or cuckoldry. However, women are more likely to be reliant on their long-term male partner’s investment of resources into the ongoing relationship, and so are more likely to demonstrate copulatory urgency and associated motivated behaviors when they are at particular risk of loss of that investment and when the loss of that investment would be particularly costly.",

      "abstract": "No other popular genre asks what it means to be a man so assiduously as\nthe Western does, which helps explain why violence is one of that genre’s\ncentral features. In a given decade, of course, Westerns resolve (or fail to\nresolve) the same range of cultural issues that energize other popular genres-from alarm over adolescent rebellion, to consternation at changing\nlabor patterns, to anxieties about foreign policy (and so on; the list is endless). But the Western’s obsession with violence grows out of a larger fascination with what is now termed the construction of masculinity. To be a\nman, at least as the Western understands it, requires not only a distinctively\nmale body but certain learned, appropriately male skills as well. Manhood,\nthat is, forms as much a culturally conditioned experience as a blunt biological process. And the Western’s characteristic eruption of violence occurs\nas a testing of both these assumptions-both the body that must recover\nits masculine features (tall in the saddle, quick on the draw) and the characteristic male response celebrated by the Western (restraint, taciturnity,\nendurance). Violence is the means by which men are encouraged to showtheir manliness, both as handsome cinematic figures that rivet the viewer’s\ngaze, and as individuals capable of triumphing over adversity as only men\nare allowed to do. Unlike any other genre, then, Westerns oscillate between\nthe conditions of sex and gender-between an essentialism that requires\nthe flamboyant display of a male physique and a constructivism that grants\nmanhood to men by virtue of behavior rather than bodies.",

Each couple lived together and did not have children living with them. Relationship quality was dimensionalized as love for partner, liking of partner, and relationship satisfaction. Cohabiting partners had the lowest Love for Partner and Relationship Satisfaction scores. Differences were also found among partner types on: barriers to leaving the relationship, alternatives to the relationship, a belief that mindreading is expected in the relationship, masculinity, femininity, androgyny, dyadic attachment, shared decision making, and perceived social support from family. The four partner groups did not differ in psychological adjustment. For each type of partner, love for partner was related to many barriers to leaving the relationship and high dyadic attachment; liking of partner was related to few alternatives to the relationship, high dyadic attachment, and high shared decision making; and relationship satisfaction was related to many attractions, few alternatives, few beliefs regarding disagreement is destructive to the relationship, high dyadic attachment, and high shared decision making. Stepwise multiple regression procedures were used to identify the best set of predictors for each partner type. Results are discussed in the context of existing models of relationship quality.",

      "abstract": "Abstract During human evolution, individuals interacted mostly within small groups that were connected by limited migration and sometimes by conflicts. Which preferences, if any, will prevail in such scenarios? Building on population biology models of spatially structured populations, and assuming individuals’ preferences to be their private information, we characterize those preferences that, once established, cannot be displaced by alternative preferences. We represent such uninvadable preferences in terms of fitness and in terms of material payoffs. At the fitness level, individuals can be regarded to act as if driven by a mix of self-interest and a Kantian motive that evaluates own behavior in the light of the consequences for own fitness if others adopted this behavior. This Kantian motive is borne out from (genetic or cultural) kin selection. At the material-payoff level, individuals act as if driven in part by self-interest and a Kantian motive (in terms of material payoffs), but also in part by other-regarding preferences towards other group members. This latter motive is borne out of group resource constraints and the risk of conflict with other groups. We show how group size, the migration rate, the risk of group conflicts, and cultural loyalty shape the relative strengths of these motives. JEL codes A12, A13, B52, C73, D01, D63, D64, D91.",

However, psychosocial issues can predominate and perpetuate sexual problems for women and often require concurrent assessment. The sexual difficulties may be concurrent to erectile dysfunction or another sexual problem in the man. An offer of multiple interventions should be recommended where indicated.",

      "abstract": "The perception of one’s own body image is an important determinant of adolescent health. While positive body image is associated with health-promoting behaviours, negative body image may be related to engagement in health-compromising risk behaviours. Hypothetically, an adolescent’s perceived body image may also be influenced by racial/cultural ideals and related gendered expectations, governed by social norms within distinct cultural groups. Variations in perceived body image by race/ethnicity remain largely unexplored in Canada, even descriptively. A descriptive, cross-sectional study was employed using data from the 2017–2018 cycle of the Canadian Health Behaviour in School-aged Children (HBSC) study (weighted n = 18,766 participants). Self-perceptions of body image were described for Canadian adolescents, stratified by race/ethnicity and gender (boys vs. girls). There were two main findings. First , variations in perceptions of body image mainly varied by gender. Boys were more likely to report feeling ‘too thin’ while a higher proportion of girls reported feeling ‘too fat’. These trends were observed across different races/ethnicities. Second , there was little variation in patterns of self-reported body image by race/ethnicity, while the gendered variations remained within all major racial/ethnic groups. Existing research on adolescent body image typically focuses on gender norms, overlooking the potential of racial and ethnic influences on body image perceptions. Our study confirms that adolescent body image does not appear to vary substantially on racial/ethnic lines among Canadian adolescents, consistent with existing studies that highlight the strong influence of gender norms on adolescent body image.",

      "title": "Don't Ask, Don't Tell: Lesbian Women and Work-Relationship Conflict",
      "abstract": "Ask, Tell: Lesbian Women and Work-Relationship Conflict We learn from an early age that there are good fun secrets and bad dirty secrets. Not telling your mom about her surprise birthday party falls into the good fun secret category. However, if a neighbor tells you that you must never tell anyone what you do at his or her house, this takes on the feel of a bad dirty secret. It is a cultural indicator that whatever is to be kept secret is shameful; that it is not meant to be aired in public. Sexual orientation and the policies that have been put in place to keep one's sexual orientation a secret have more the feel of a bad dirty secret than your mother's surprise birthday party. This seems all the more pronounced when some people can tell and some people can't tell. Heterosexual individuals can wear wedding rings and put up wedding photos, while gay and lesbian couples may face unemployment lines if they do so in a don't ask, don't tell workplace. Don't' Ask, Tell originated in a U.S. military policy (US Code Title 10, 1993) that prohibits anyone who demonstrate(s) a propensity or intent to engage in homosexual acts from serving in the military, because it would create an unacceptable risk to the high standards of morale, good order and discipline, and unit cohesion that are the essence of military capability. The policy goes on to forbid not only disclosing one's orientation, but also from speaking about any homosexual relationships, including marriages or other familial attributes. While the policy originated as a compromise between legislators and the military, it has become a common way in which organizations refer to similar policies or their approach to diversity when it comes to sexual orientation. This may be formalized policy or an informal organizational cultural norm that is communicated by the phrase Don't Ask, Tell. The implication generally being that a person is allowed to work, exist within, or be a member of an organization so long as one does not disclose a bisexual or homosexual orientation. Making it clear that heterosexual people are given free reign to talk about their sexual orientation, including their families and children (Pobo, 1999). Even when there is no explicit policy about disclosing a lesbian or gay sexual orientation at work, it is not something that people do lightly. Regardless of the policy in place, coming out (disclosing one's sexual orientation) at work is considered a problem by two-thirds of individuals (Levine & Leonard, 1984; Winkelpeck & Westfelt, 1982). One coping mechanism is to stay closeted, pass as heterosexual at work by devoting energy to portraying oneself as heterosexual, separating work and home life, and avoid social situations with co-workers (Garnets & Kimmel, 1991). A workplace that is supportive of workers being honest about who they are and employees being out in the workplace is related to decreased job anxiety and increased job satisfaction (Griffith & Hebl, 2002; Ragins, 2004). Deciding whether or not to come out is not a one-time decision. Rather, it is a decision that is made many times during the course of one's career (Sedgewick, 1990). A change in jobs or the hire of someone new at the workplace leads to another decision point. At each of these decision points the organizational climate comes to bear on the decision about whether or not to disclose one's sexual orientation to that person. Being out about being gay or lesbian is not always an all or none situation. Rather, most individuals are out to some people, but not others. Some are out to absolutely no one in the work environment, while others may be out to everyone in the work environment. It is important to understand how individuals who are out to one or two people and those that are out to everyone with whom they work may differ considerably. Even being partially closeted is likely to have some impact on feelings of stress in the workplace and stress specifically about their family life. …",

      "abstract": "Behavioral observations indicate the giant hind legs of male Magalopus ar matus beetles function as weapons in battles between males over sites where feeding and mating occur; they are not used to court females. Males court females actively during copulation. When male and female morphology show clear differences, it is reasonable to suspect that the sexually dimorphic male characters have evolved under sexual selection (Darwin, 1872). It is not so easy, however, to deduce whether a given male character has been under sexual selection by female choice, or by direct male combat. Given characters can, in fact, be under both types of selection. A first step in deciphering the function of a sexually dimorphic male structure is to observe the animal's behavior. If, for example, the structure is displayed prominently during male-female interactions in a way likely to increase the fem ale's perception of it, the male trait may play a role in sexual selection by female choice. If the structure is employed in aggressive interactions between males in such a way as to apparently increase a male's chances of defeating rival males, then a role in sexual selection by male combat is indicated. Males of the chrysomelid beetle Megalopus armatus Lacordaire have giant hind legs, with large spines on the femur and a curved tibia. This brief study indicates that these legs are used as weapons in fights between males over mating sites, and are probably not used in the context of female choice.",

      "title": "Gifted Girls and Women",
      "abstract": "There are many special characteristics and needs of gifted girls and women throughout the lifespan. As young girls, gifted girls can often be identified by early language development and precocious reading, and often need early admission to schooling, the opportunity for alone time, and encouragement and specialized training in the domains of their greatest interest. Adolescent gifted girls are often bored in school, conflicted about relationships and achievement, and eager for mentoring; they may need to advance through high school and early entry to college course-taking as well as strong relationships with master teachers and mentors. Gifted teens also need clear information about sexuality and sexual identity, particularly about the association of early sexual activity with lower achievement. Gifted women struggle throughout the world with gender relations, that is, the requirements by most societies that they bear an unequal share of the work of marriage and family life. How gifted women negotiate the dual demands of their societies often determines whether or not they will achieve eminence in their fields. Long-standing controversies concerning sex differences, women’s education, and definitions of eminence continue to have an impact on the educational and career development of gifted girls and women. Moderate sex differences favoring boys and men in sub-factors of cognitive abilities, like spatial-rotation abilities, continue to be highly publicized and are often interpreted to mean that gifted girls and women are less able than men to achieve in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) fields. Differences in adult gifted women’s and men’s STEM achievement are also attributed to preferences, when research shows that the most important variable associated with highest achievements are responsibilities in marriage and child-rearing, or gender relations. Controversies over single-sex education continue, with research both supporting and disputing the superiority of single-sex education for women; it may be that gifted women benefit more that average women from this kind of higher education. Whether single-sex or co-educational, the presence of a mentor may be most important to gifted women’s academic and career development. Finally, the concepts of eminence and genius are increasingly under scrutiny by scholars who claim they are highly gendered, with genius nearly always being associated with male dominated professions.

      "title": "Mental Health Among Sexual Minority Youth",
      "abstract": "The term sexual minority youth (SMY) encompasses youth who are not exclusively heterosexual. These are youth whose sexual orientations, identities, and/or behaviors are not exclusively heterosexual. Sexual identity is one’s personal identity as a sexual being, a label used in regard to oneself, such as “gay,” “lesbian,” “queer,” “pansexual,” or “asexual.”1 Sexual identity may not be indicative of sexual behaviors and, thus, understanding both identity and behavior are essential to providing excellent care— particularly as SMY youth often face health disparities.2 SMY youth, like their heterosexual peers, have strengths and vulnerabilities. Although the majority of sexual minority children and adolescents do well, they are likely to experience mental health issues such as anxiety, depression, substance abuse, and suicidality at higher rates than their heteronormative peers.1,3 This phenomenon may be due to stigma, microaggressions, victimization, and/or discrimination regarding their sexual identities, which in turn effects overall health.4 In a 2013 survey performed by the Gay, Lesbian &amp; Straight Education Network, 55% of sexual and gender minority youth surveyed stated that they felt unsafe at school due to perceived/experienced harassment from peers.5 This harassment can lead to an increase in suicidal ideation and attempts6 due to internalized shame and stigma, social isolation, and conflict about their identities. Microaggressions, stigma, and shame may also be experienced at home and in the community. Healthcare providers are in a unique position to support minority youth across multiple domains if they are aware and informed of social supports and experiences of conflict.",

      "title": "The Whore Stigma: Female Dishonor and Male Unworthiness",
      "abstract": "Whore means prostitute. And a prostitute is a woman who offers to hire her body for indiscriminate sexual intercourse, or so says The Concise Oxford Dictionary. Prostitute is further defined as a verb: to prostitute oneself is to sell one's honor for base gain or to put one's abilities to infamous use. Other dictionaries include men1 secondarily in the noun definition and specify in the verb definition the shame attached to dishonor and the unworthiness and wrongdoing attached to infamous use. The noun clearly denotes a person, especially a woman, offering heterosexual sex, in particular intercourse, for money; the verb denotes any person's activity, which need not be sexual, put to uncommendable use. Those meanings are likely to conform to popular opinion except that many people collapse the second definition into the first. A prostitute then becomes one who sells her honor by offering to hire her body for base gain or for an unworthy doing, specifically sexual intercourse. The following discussion will begin by comparing the dictionary's noun definition with the actual behavior of prostitutes. Since a whore is a prostitute, both words will be used interchangeably throughout this text. Actual whore life is described for the purpose of testing formal as well as popular definitions with reality. There are many reasons for exposing the reality of prostitution. Nonprostitute women are socialized not to possess sexual information or skill, not to talk about sex, not to ask for money in any situation, and not to associate with whores. A sharing of prostitute financial and sexual practices with nonprostitute women challenges that socialization, challenges the divisions it imposes upon women, and challenges the normative assumption of female sexual and financial dependency.",

      "title": "Emerging Perspectives on Distinctions Between Romantic Love and Sexual Desire",
      "abstract": "Although sexual desire and romantic love are often experienced in concert, they are fundamentally distinct subjective experiences with distinct neurobiological substrates. The basis for these distinctions is the evolutionary origin of each type of experience. The processes underlying sexual desire evolved in the context of sexual mating, whereas the processes underlying romantic love—or pair bonding—originally evolved in the context of infant-caregiver attachment. Consequently, not only can humans experience these feelings separately, but an individual's sexual predisposition for the same sex, the other sex, or both sexes may not circumscribe his or her capacity to fall in love with partners of either gender. Also, the role of oxytocin in both love and desire may contribute to the widely observed phenomenon that women report experiencing greater interconnections between love and desire than do men. Because most research on the neurobiological substrates of sexual desire and affectional bonding has been conducted with animals, a key priority for future research is systematic investigation of the coordinated biological, behavioral, cognitive, and emotional processes that shape experiences of love and desire in humans.",

      "abstract": "The present study examines how gender is represented in the visuals (or illustrations) of two English Language textbook series used in most primary schools in Hong Kong. Instead of conducting frequency counts of the occurrence of male and female characters in illustrations, or the spheres of activities they engaged in as in many previous textbook studies, this study involves qualitative analyses of how visualised male and female characters are represented in the selected illustrations of the analysed textbook series, particularly but not exclusively, in terms of their hair length and clothing. The results show that representations of females were more often portrayed having long hair rather than short hair and wearing dresses rather than trousers in both line drawings and photographs. For the colour of clothing, although blue and pink are generally considered 'masculine' and 'feminine' colours, respectively, less than half and only a small percentage of the human males and females were portrayed wearing blue and pink, respectively. For non-human characters, again, colour is not always a reliable cue to their sex. Yet, they can be recognised as males and females by the generally accepted 'masculine' or 'feminine' colour and clothing items. Hence, while binary notions of gender often remained intact in their normative forms there were also other forms of representation which challenged them.",

      "title": "Love Styles in the Context of Life History Theory",
      "abstract": "Abstract The evolutionary function of love is to create a strong bond between the partners with reproduction in view. In order to achieve this goal, humans use various sexual/reproductive strategies, which have evolved due to specific reproductive benefits. The use of particular strategies depends on many factors but one of the most important is early childhood experiences, on which life history theory (LHT) focuses. John Lee (1973) identified 6 basic love styles: eros, ludus, storge, pragma, agape, and mania. Our goal was to check whether love styles may be treated as sexual/reproductive strategies in the context of LHT - slow or fast strategy. In our study (N = 177) we found that people who prefer the slow reproductive strategy are inclined to show passionate, pragmatic and friendly love, and those who prefer the fast strategy, treated love as a game. A low level of environmental stress in childhood results in preferring eros, storge and agape love styles, belonging to the slow strategy, and a high one results in preferring ludus, which belongs to the fast strategy. People representing eros, storge or pragma styles have restricted sociosexual orientation so they prefer long-term relationships, whereas those with the ludus style are people with unrestricted orientation, preferring short-term relationships. Besides, storge, agape and pragma seem to determine preferring qualities connected with parental effort in one’s partner, mania - with mating effort, and eros - with both kinds of effort. No correlation was found between the love style and the number of children.",

      "title": "Men and Women: Mind and Body",
      "abstract": "Abstract Our culture judges a man primarily in terms of how powerful, ambitious, aggressive, and dominant he is in the worlds of thought and action. These are qualities more of the mind than the body. A woman, on the other hand, is judged almost entirely in terms of her appearance, her attractiveness to men, and her ability to keep the species going. Her sexual body can even be quite dangerous to a man on his way to success. She becomes a temptress distracting him from his true work, the pursuit of rationality, knowledge, and power. The split between mind and body is a central idea in Western culture. It often frames our perceptions of what it means to be feminine and masculine. This has been illustrated by studies conducted by Paul Rosenkrantz and his colleagues in the 1960s. They gave college students a list of extreme personality traits and their opposites: very passive vs. very active; very illogical vs. very logical; very vain about appearance vs. uninterested in appearance, and so on. The students were asked to ascribe each trait to either males or females, and to rank each trait’s social desirability. The findings from this study (and from others) showed that traits most often associated with competence and social desirability were assigned to men and those associated with having an “emotional” life were assigned to women. Men were viewed as more independent than women, more logical, more direct, more self-confident, more ambitious.",

Gender stereotypes are generalisations about the attributes of men and women. Quick and unconscious judgements based on gender stereotypes lead to gender bias in situations where women take a position perceived as more suitable for men, often to the detriment of their career progress. Prescriptive gender stereotypes indicate how women and men should behave. Both stereotypes can complicate women's career progress. The female stereotype prescribes emotionally sensitive and caring behaviour, while radiating confidence and dominance are regarded as appropriate behaviours for men but not women. To work effectively and be successful, however, women in high-level functions and/or in traditionally male fields, such as elite sport, must engage in behaviours inconsistent with the prescriptive female stereotype.",

      "title": "The Options of Greek Men and Women",
      "abstract": "Liberation is a better concept than for several reasons. First, a woman but not a man can be emancipated, while both men and women can be liberated. Second, a woman was considered emancipated if she voted, smoked, drove a car, went out by herself, worked, etc. That is, the designation emancipated was given when a woman was behaving in a particular manner that showed independence and, to some degree, equality with men. A woman or a man is defined as when she (or he) can in fact (and not only in theory, as it has been true in most societies up to now) choose what she (he) wants to be or how to behave from a range of options, all of which are equally socially acceptable. Liberation, then, means freedom from stereotypic sex-linked values and beliefs restricting the range of socially-acceptable options for men and women because some options are considered to be inappropriate for one or the other sex. Liberated men and women living in a liberated society have equal access to the range of options and may make any choice according to their particular inclinations, talents, wishes and idiosyncratic preferences (Safilios-Rothschild, 1970). A major goal, therefore, of emancipation was to give women as many privileges as men, while the major goal of is the elimination of social, cultural and psychological barriers in the way of both men and women's realization and, therefore, benefit both men and women. While the rural Greek men and women still adhere to a considerable extent to the traditional, sex-determined stereotypes regulating the behavior of men and women, their urban counterparts have been able to surpass some of these stereotypic beliefs. A relatively higher degree of liberation can be observed in Athens where, according to the 1970 census, 29 per cent of the Greek population lives at present. This relative liberation, however, is not uniform throughout all social classes and does not equally affect all life sectors. Upper middle and middle class Athenians can be expected to be more than working and lower class Athenians who have recently come to Athens from rural areas and are still largely influenced by the traditional sex stereotypes. Also, Athenian men and women may be quite in one life sec",

      "abstract": "Sex differences in some preferences and motivations are well established, but it is unclear whether they persist in selective sub-populations, such as expert financial decision makers, top scientists, or elite athletes.We addressed this issue by studying competitiveness in 1,147 varsity intercollegiate distance runners.As expected, across all runners, men reported greater competitiveness with two previously validated instruments, greater competitiveness on a new elite competitiveness scale, and greater training volume, a known correlate of competitiveness.Among faster runners, the sex difference decreased for one measure of competitiveness but did not decrease for the two other competitiveness measures or either measure of training volume.Across NCAA athletic divisions (DI, DII, DIII), the sex difference did not decrease for any competitiveness or training measure.Further analyses showed that these sex differences could not be attributed to women suffering more injuries or facing greater childcare responsibilities.However, women did report greater commitment than men to their academic studies, suggesting a sex difference in priorities.Therefore, policies aiming to provide men and women with equal opportunities to flourish should acknowledge that sex differences in some kinds of preferences and motivation may persist even in selective sub-populations.",

Si cette double contrainte existe pour l’ensemble des sportives investies dans un sport ‘masculin’, elle s’avère particulièrement forte pour les sportives ‘professionnelles’, plus dépendantes que les autres des politiques identitaires visant le maintien de la distinction entre les sexes mise en œuvre par les fédérations.

      "title": "The Effect of Mating Motives on Risk Taking Likelihood Assessment in Men",
      "abstract": "According to sexual selection theory,intra-sex competition mainly among males leads to male characteristics known as weapons.The large body size and thick proboscis of male elephant seals and the robust horns and antlers of various ungulate stags are well-known examples of weapons.Inter-sex selection or mate choice,mostly exercised by the limiting sex or females,leads male characteristics known as ornaments.The vibrant colors of the guppy and the bright plumage of various birds are examples of ornaments.Whereas human males possess similar physical sex-dimorphic characteristics such as larger body frames (weapons),and lower voice pitch (ornaments),human sex-dimorphism is mainly shown as weapon-like (e.g.,aggression) and ornament-like behavior (e.g.,bragging).Human risk taking is such an ornament-like behavior because,like all ornaments which are functionally useless but are yet costly to sustain,risk taking behavior brings danger to its carriers without apparent functional purposes.Like ornaments,risk taking behavior is preferred by conspecific females who find its male carriers sexually attractive.The purpose of the present study was to test sexual selection theory on humans by investigating the association between risk-taking behavior and mating motives among men but not women.This hypothesis was tested against the rival hypothesis that risk taking may be externally motivated by monetary reward that renders similar effects on both men and women.These hypotheses were tested on a sample of 127 graduate students (62 males,mean age=21.47;SD= 1.59).In a between-group design,participants were exposed,on a computer screen,either to attractive opposite-sex pictures (the mating condition) or pictures of money or medals (the control or monetary reward condition).These two conditions were manipulated as a simple perceptual task where participants were instructed to decide on the location of each picture as it flashes on the screen (500 ms) by pressing one of two keys on the keyboard.This is to distract the participants from being aware of the intended experimental manipulation (mating versus monetary reward).To facilitate this distraction,attractive opposite sex pictures were also mixed with a small number of average-looking opposite sex pictures,and the monetary award pictures were mixed with a small number of non-reward scenes.After the picture exposure,each participant was given 19 different risk taking scenarios and was asked to assess the likelihood the participant would engage in each of the risk-taking behavior.The 19 risk-taking scenarios represent four domains of risk,including financial,health,social,and recreational risk.Composite scores representing the four domains were used as the dependent variables.Except for one of the four dependent variables,A 2 (mating vs.reward) × 2 (gender of the participants) ANOVA did not yield a significant interaction effect.However,separate t-tests were statistically significant,showing that men indicated higher likelihood to take risk after being exposed to attractive opposite-sex pictures than to reward pictures,whereas women did not show the difference in risk taking likelihood assessment besides social risk.Taking health risk for example,M=21.03 vs.18.67 under the mating vs.reward condition for men.The mean difference was statistically significant,p.01.For women,M=17.94 and 17.35,respectively.Other mean comparisons showed similar results which are reported in Table 1 in the main text.The results support sexual selection theory.Like most mammals,human males but not females have acquired ornament-like behaviors which are driven by mating motives.When attractive women are around,men are more likely to engage in functionally useless and potentially harmful behavior,which,however,are useful in the sense that they serve as signals of good genes.Thus,men's risk taking is driven by mating motives.Women are drawn to men's risk taking behavior for the same sexual selection reason,i.e.,women use the signals to select quality mates.In part to address reviewers' concerns,motives and need states serve as proximate cues that drive our behavior both consciously and unconsciously.In everyday life,mating motives,like many other motives,may remain unconscious most of the time which nonetheless drive and shape our behavior as is shown by the present study.",

      "abstract": "level can forsee the deviancy disappearing at other ages or in other contexts. Hyperactivity, for example, can be seen as both normal and abnormal depending on whether the child is a pre-schooler or an adolescent. The mother who can appreciate the discontinuous nature of her child's behavior is better equipped to make qualitative changes in her treatment of the child as the child's activities and requirements change with development. The mother who is restricted to more primitive levels of viewing her offspring enmeshes the child at later stages in obsolete social and affective relationships formed during infancy. From the low levels of social cognition found in large segments of our society (Chandler, 1973; Looft, 1972) one might expect a much higher proportion of severe caretaking casualties than appears to be the case. Possibly, the same kinds of self-righting tendencies that Wad dington (1966) postulated for biological development are operative at the psychological level. One of these self-righting tendencies might exist in the transactions between parent and child. The mother has little difficulty viewing the infant from a sensorimotor level of cognition while the infant is in the sensorimotor period. However, as the child progresses through his own development, his caretakers are forced to view him from different perspectives, potentially causing a restructuring of their view of the child. At each new level the child makes interactional demands at higher levels of complexity, frequently surprising parents by this emerging precocity.

To the extent that the scientific and educational es tablishment are limited to a concrete view that perceives developmen tal deviancy as foreordained by poor genes or perinatal complications, there is little in the way of therapy to offer mothers with problems. To the extent that society as a whole can move from a main-effect to a transactional model of development a new context is provided for educating mothers toward understanding the intricate interplay between organismic and environmental factors in the determination of developmental outcomes. To summarize, disorders in development have been retrospectively attributed to a variety of early constitutional or environmental factors. When these predisposing factors have been studied prospectively little support is given to their causal role or their predictive value for later deviancy. Evidence for qualitative continuities and stabilities in development appear to be artifacts of an incomplete analysis of the child in its environment. When the two are examined in combination, complex reciprocal transactions are found which reduce or amplify ear ly problems in behavior. Developmental outcomes must be interpreted as the products of a child's characteristics, his material environment and the cognitive levels and values of his social milieu. Where the social environment fosters rigidity, stereotyping, and concreteness in thought and behavior, early deviancies can become resistant to the normal restruc turing implicit in development. Where flexibility, openness, and adap tability are fundamental characteristics of the environment, early problems are dissipated as the child advances in his construction and organization of both his cognitive and social world.",

      "abstract": "Virtual tridimensional creatures are active actors in many types of games. Some of these games require, in addition to quantity, the simulation of kinship and evolution, not only of human character models but also of different types of animals, toon models or other creatures. Some applications also require interactions between isolated populations with well-defined ethnic characteristics. The identification of similar traits between individuals of the same family is crucial to providing increased realism. The main difficulty in these situations is to generate models automatically, in real time, which are physically similar to a given population or family. Another desirable feature is the automatic generation of facial expressions as the character interacts with the environment. In those cases, the difficulty lies in finding a simple mesh adaptation system for different creatures with big differences in shape. In this work, the reproduction of diploid beings is mimicked to produce character models that inherit genetic characteristics from their ancestors, with the possibility to map all genes identifying the origin of each gene, and apply custom facial expressions. With this solution it is possible to create interactive evolution and life-simulation games, genetic educational applications, and many other possibilities.",

      "abstract": "Queer and feminist scholars frequently claim that non-heteronormative sexualities, like asexuality, challenge heteronormative practices within intimate relationships. They argue that these sexualities lead to the emergence of new intimate practice and have the potential to revolutionise what is understood as the sexual “public story”—one in which a sexual assumption is repeatedly performed and an absence is culturally denied, sometimes to the point of pathologisation (Carrigan, 2011; Przybylo, 2011; Jamieson, 1998). A more recent analysis of asexuality suggests that there is very little evidence of specific asexual practices and that many asexuals are in fact not challenging heteronormative practices (see Dawson et al., 2016). Neither of these contradicting arguments fully details the nuances of how asexuality operates within intimate relationships, straddling both of these positions in practice. This thesis investigates the complexity of an asexual identity to capture the way it sometimes does and does not engage with and/or challenge heteronormativity within intimate relationships. Drawing on 68 online surveys and 29 online interviews, I thematically analysed participants’ stories to (1) understand how asexuality functions as a meaningful label, including the adoption of an asexual identity and (2) investigate patterns of intimate practices—partner selection, relationship types and forms of intimacy—and their connection to heteronormativity, an asexual identity or both. I demonstrate the presence of asexual-specific preferences, and how these preferences are often compromised for largely heteronormative practices. However, among asexual intimate practices I found a potential for the creation of more varied understandings that, while not fully challenging heteronormativity, offer more complex intimate relationship practices and understanding(s).",

      "abstract": "Abstract A new theory of attraction and liking based on kin selection suggests that people detect genetic similarity in others in order to give preferential treatment to those who are most similar to themselves. There are many sources of empirical and theoretical support for this view, including (1) the inclusive fitness theory of altruism, (2) kin recognition studies of animals raised apart, (3) assortative mating studies, (4) favoritism in families, (5) selective similarity among friends, and (6) ethnocentrism. Specific tests of the theory show that (1) sexually interacting couples who produce a child are genetically more similar to each other in blood antigens than they are either to sexually interacting couples who fail to produce a child or to randomly paired couples from the same sample; (2) similarity between marriage partners is most marked in the more genetically influenced of sets of anthropometric, cognitive, and personality characteristics; (3) after the death of a child, parental grief intensity is correlated with the child's similarity to the parent; (4) long-term male friendship pairs are more similar to each other in blood antigens than they are to random dyads from the same sample; and (5) similarity among best friends is most marked in the more genetically influenced of sets of attitudinal, personality, and anthropometric characteristics. The mechanisms underlying these findings may constitute a biological substrate of ethnocentrism, enabling group selection to occur.",

We examine one possible cause: threatened masculinity among men who hold traditional gender ideologies. Past research has linked endorsement of traditional gender ideologies to gender-stereotypical occupational choices, and threats to masculinity can lead men to distance themselves from femininity. After confirming that 1,672 undergraduates stereotyped language learning as feminine, we applied a masculinity threat manipulation to investigate 182 men’s disinterest in studying foreign languages, a female-dominated university subject. Men with traditional masculinity ideologies reported less interest in foreign language study and less positive attitudes towards foreign languages following masculinity threat, compared to men whose masculinity was affirmed or who held less traditional masculinity beliefs. Traditional masculine gender roles may lead some men to avoid feminine-typed domains, such as foreign language learning.",

One notes that his mother—in keeping with a process often observed in children thought to be traumatised and profoundly deprived—shows a tendency to put his needs before her own.

      "abstract": "INTISARI : Penelitian ini bertujuan untuk mengetahui penyebab seseorang menjadi biseksual; dan ini terjadi pada orang dewasa yang sudah mempunyai pasangan. Penelitian ini adalah studi kasus dengan pendekatan kualitatif. Penulis juga berhasil mewawancarai 13 Responden atau Informan, orang-orang biseksual, yang berusia antara 30-65 tahun di kota-kota besar di Indonesia. Dengan mengunakan pendekatan fenomenologi dan penjelasan yang deskriptif, hasil penelitian menunjukkan bahwa fenomena biseksual disebabkan oleh pola asuh orag tua terhadap anaknya; adanya pengalaman masa lalu yang buruk terjadi, seperti pelecehan seksual ataupun korban sodomi; pengaruh lingkungan yang juga membentuk mereka menjadi biseksual; serta ingin mendapatkan kepuasan yang lebih kepada fantasi seksual mereka yang tidak didapatkan pada pasangan resmi mereka. Penelitian ini juga mendapati bahwa media sosial ikut menyumbang dalam mengeksplore keinginan yang dipendam dari mereka yang menjadi biseksual; serta panti pijat ataupun sauna menjadi tempat proses perkenalan sampai dengan melakukan hubungan seksual sesama jenis. Dalam status berhubungan diantara kaum biseksual terdapat dua tipe, yakni kaum biseksual yang memiliki komitmen untuk tetap setia pada pasangan sejenisnya yang satu saja; dan kaum biseksual yang tidak memiliki komitmen, dalam artian hanya untuk bersenang-senang saja dan kerap kali gonta-ganti dalam berhubungan dengan pasangan sejenis. Problema kaum biseksual ini harus difahami secara mendalam, dikaji sebab-sebab dan faktor yang mempengaruhinya, serta dicari cara mengatasi dan jalan keluarnya yang bijak oleh para pengambil kebijakan dalam bidang pendidikan, agama, sosial, kesehatan, dan bahkan politik negara.

This study aims to determine the cause of a person being bisexual; and this happens to adults who already have a partner. This research is a case study with a qualitative approach. The Author also successfully interviewed 13 Respondents or Informants, bisexual people, aged between 30-65 years in big cities in Indonesia. By using phenomenological approach and descriptive explanation, the results of the study indicate that the bisexual phenomenon is caused by the parents' upbringing for their children; bad past experiences, such as sexual harassment or victims of sodomy; environmental influences that also shape them to be bisexual; and want to get more satisfaction with their sexual fantasies that are not found in their official partners. The study also found that social media contributed to exploring the buried desires of those who became bisexual; and a massage or sauna as a place for introductions to same-sex sexual relations. In the status of relationships between bisexuals there are two types, namely bisexuals who have a commitment to remain loyal to one partner of the same type; and bisexuals who have no commitment, in the sense of just having fun and often mutually in dealing with same-sex couples. The problem of bisexuals must be understood in depth, examined the causes and factors that influence it, and sought ways to overcome and wise solutions by policy makers in the fields of education, religion, social, health, and even state politics.

      "title": "ESTIMATING SEXUAL SELECTION AND SEXUAL ISOLATION EFFECTS FROM MATING FREQUENCIES",
      "abstract": "Sexual selection (defined as the change in genotypic or phenotypic frequencies of mated versus total population frequencies) and sexual isolation (defined as the deviation from random mating in mated individuals) show different evolutionary consequences and partially confounded causes. Traditionally, the cross-product estimator has been used to quantify sexual selection, whereas a variety of indexes, such as Yule V, Yule Q, YA, joint I, and others have been used to quantify sexual isolation. Because the two types of estimators use different scales, the effects of both processes cannot be monitored simultaneously. We describe three new related statistics that quantify both sexual selection (PSS) and sexual isolation (PSI) effects for every mating pair combination in polymorphic traits, as well as measure their combined effects (PTI = PSI × PSS). The new statistics have the advantage of providing information on every mating pair combination, quantifying the effects of sexual selection and isolation in the same units, and detecting asymmetry in sexual isolation. The ability of the new statistics to ascertain the biological causes of sexual selection and sexual isolation are investigated under different models involving distinct marginal frequencies, mate propensity, and mate choice coefficients. We also studied the use of classical isolation indexes applied on PSI coefficients, instead of on raw data. The use of the classical indexes applied to PSI coefficients considerably reduces the statistical bias of the estimates, revealing the good estimation properties of the new statistics.Corresponding Editor: E.

      "abstract": "Certain physical, psychological and social characteristics of 20 adolescents with myelodysplasia are compared to those of age and gender-matched controls. In addition to the obvious physical differences the areas of greatest concern are self-esteem and social-sexual adjustment. Family relations, feelings, and modes of expression were not different in the two groups. Lack of appropriate chores, decreased opportunities to interact and compete with peers, plus uncertainties to interact and compete with peers, plus uncertainties about bowel and bladder continence appear to be the greatest impediments to emotional growth in this physically handicapped group of teenagers. Early recognition of such problems and finding strategies to overcome them are important aspects of the comprehensive care of any person with a chronic disability.",

      "title": "How do children and adults make inferences about ownership",
      "abstract": "In everyday life both adults and children are faced with the problem of judging who owns an object. Past research has indicated that adults and children may base their decisions on who was seen possessing an object first (the first possessor bias) or the person with whom an initial visual association was created.. The current thesis aimed to investigate this, and ascertain whether children and adults maintain their bias to choose the first possessor of an object as its owner when other competing information regarding ownership is available. Chapters 2 and 3 used between subjects factorial designs in which adults (aged 18 - 60) and children (aged 3 - 4 years) viewed a number of stories of characters possessing objects in a variety of different scenarios. After viewing each story participants were required to judge which character owned the object. Results showed that when adults and children had no information, other than who possessed an object first, they chose the first possessor as the owner of the object. However when other competing information, such as the gender or age stereotype of the object, or who had constructive possession of the object, was available both adults and children disregarded their first possessor bias and made decisions in line with this other information. Chapter 4 used a between subjects factorial design and a mixed factorial design. The aim of the experiments was to ascertain whether adults and children take the history of an object into account when deciding who owns an object. Adults (aged 18 - 60) and children (aged 3 – 4 years) were shown stories in which one character wore and object and another character held an object. Information was given to help participants infer the history of each of the objects in the stories. Following each story participants were asked to judge who owned the object. Results demonstrated that both adults and children take the history of an object into account in their ownership decisions, and privilege this information above other competing information such as visual association, but that adults do this more reliably than children. All the experiments in this thesis demonstrated that when there is no other information available both adults and children base their decisions on who was seen possessing an object first. However when other information is available both adults and children take this into account in their decisions. Adults and children may use the information in order to reconstruct the history of an object to ascertain who had contact with it in the past and therefore who may have a legitimate claim of ownership over it.",

      "abstract": "Whether partners are of the same sex or opposite sex, most committed love relationships are difficult. All of us, gay or straight, carry into our relationships childhood wounds, unmet needs, and character defenses that serve as fuel for the power struggle. Successful relationships demand that partners give up or alter the character defenses they developed as children and that are no longer adaptive as they reach adulthood. Unwilling or unable to make this transformation, most couples eventually break up or divorce.",

      "abstract": "Based on observations that challenge the theory of cumulative advantage/disadvantage (CAD) which says that inequalities increase over time this paper formulates a new theory; the theory of conditional social equality (CSE). Based on observations, informal conversations and interviews at eighteen different Men’s Sheds in Denmark, New Zealand and Australia, we argue that inequalities between older men may actually decrease – but only on certain conditions, and not any type of inequality. In the current study we use a narrative approach to show how learning groups that were homogeneous age and sex helped erase class divisions, while divisions of ethnicity and sexual orientation remained firm. Other configurations of divisions that are challenged or not challenged are evident from other studies. The theory of conditional social equality (CSE) predicts the following: i) in-group homogeneity enables the acceptance of some aspects of heterogeneity, ii) some other aspects of in-group heterogeneity will not be tolerated, thus maintaining in-group cohesion, and iii), in-group homogeneity and boundary setting towards out-groups are prerequisites for the acceptance of (some) aspects of in-group heterogeneity. We invite other researcher to test the theory in learning groups of different configurations.",

      "abstract": "In this study, 605 subjects were asked about romantic love and marriage. Married people differentiated themselves from single people with stable partners and divorced people with new partners by more frequently living together with their great love, more reciprocity in that love, and less disappointments in love relationships prior to the current relationship; but they also described themselves as less happy and satisfied than the single and divorced respondents, particularly with regard to tenderness, sex, and conversation with their partners. Independent of marital status, those who were greatly in love with their partners describe themselves as happier. Love at first sight, relative to a gradually developing love, nevertheless, did not have a worse prognosis for happiness in marriage. Being in love seems to be of greater importance for the prognosis of the marriage than marital happiness and satisfaction.",

A family background of alcoholism and physical abuse, social supports perceived as rejecting of homosexuality, and no religious affiliation were associated with a history of suicidal ideation, reported by 55% of the participants. Racial/ethnic minorities tended to be overrepresented among suicidal as compared to nonsuicidal gay men. Suicide attempts, reported by 20% of the sample, were most often associated with intrapersonal distress, and occurred most often while individuals were “closeted” and/or in the context of recent rejection for being homosexual. Nearly all attempters were aware of their homosexual feelings, but had not yet established a “positive gay identity” at the time of their first suicide attempt. Suicidal behavior in gay youths may be the product both of familial factors that predispose youths to suicidal behavior, and of social and intrapersonal stressors involved in coming to terms with an emerging homosexual identity.",

      "abstract": "Eleven self-identified gay/lesbian individuals were interviewed about the age at which they became aware of their gender and sexual identity and whether they recalled specific life events associated with that awareness. Thematic analyses focused on individuals who recalled a specific age and event in early childhood in which they became aware of their gender and sexual identity versus individuals who did not recall a specific age tied to their awareness of their sexual and gender identities. Results showed that five participants gave non-specific ages (e.g., “always” and “at an early age”) when their gender identity became particularly salient, the remaining 6 participants reported a specific age and typically a specific event when their gender identity became particularly salient. Findings are discussed in the context of intersectionality, gender and sexual identity development, and the coming out process. Findings suggest that experiences related to gender identity and expression and sexual orientation are non-linear processes that vary widely, and that there is no one “master narrative”. Implications for mental health and the need for ongoing support services are also highlighted.",

Using a high-stakes experimental paradigm and an immersive role-playing paradigm, we examined the psychology of experimentally-induced partial innocence on plea decisions. Participants were randomly induced to be either wholly innocent, guilty, or partially innocent of committing an academic transgression and then given the choice to accept or reject a plea deal to avoid disciplinary sanction. Partially innocent participants pled to cheating nearly as often as guilty participants and vastly more often than innocent participants. Partially innocent participants—not unlike guilty participants—experienced greater feelings of guilt than did innocent participants. In turn, these feelings of guilt, but not shame, were associated with taking responsibility for comparable, less severe, and more severe transgressions not committed.",

The ratio of men to women among those cautioned for or convicted of indictable offences decreases with age. Psychological tests involving sex-linked attitudes and opinions fail to discriminate between the sexes in such higher educational groups. The most important question relating to the age of the delinquent concerns his maturation, or the age at which delinquency comes to an end. One hypothesis which has been raised is that delinquency may have a similar incidence at all ages, but that boys are more easily caught at the peak ages. No one plays a more important part than the police in the control of delinquency, and cultural variations in their practice and social role have the greatest significance.",

      "abstract": "People with learning disabilities are frequently denied or restricted in their right to express their sexuality by restrictive policies, negative attitudes or lack of awareness of their needs. They also tend to have differing and unrecognised sexual health needs to those of the general population. Evidence suggests that acquiring a greater knowledge and awareness of sexuality and relationship issues helps to decrease these disadvantages and to promote a greater sense of well-being for this group.The experiences of eight adults with learning disabilities attending a sexuality and relationship group, based on a mixture of validated and established sexuality and relationship programmes, were explored using a case study approach. Participants' experiences were gathered through semi-structured interviews and analysed using qualitative content analysis supported by participant observation and pre- and post-group assessment of knowledge.Participant experiences were unique and individual, with few shared opinions. All participants demonstrated increases in their total knowledge scores in the post-group assessment and felt that attending the group had changed their views on relationships; they felt that they were more able to talk to others, to trust someone, to feel confident to want longer relationships and to be married with children.Sexuality and relationship groups can offer participants a beneficial and positive experience to explore such issues. The experiences of participants could be enhanced through adopting a person-centred approach and through recognising that participants have individual experiences that may not be shared within the group environment.",

The girl target was rated lower on feminine traits if she liked science, but the boy was rated higher on feminine traits if he liked science. Target ratings also showed in-group enhancement based on liking of science, and a 'black sheep' effect: those who liked science less discriminated against the same-sex target who liked science, especially on gender in-group relevant traits. We argue that gender differences in science education should be attributed partly to subjective group dynamics and not solely to images of science.",

      "abstract": "When one thrives, they grow, develop and succeed. For people of diverse sexual orientations (DSO) thriving within one's sexuality is often restricted by heteronormativity, minority stress and poor mental health outcomes. Particularly at risk, are DSO \"emerging adults\" aged between 18–29 years who seek stability before transitioning to adulthood. Therefore, this qualitative study interviewed 12 participants between the ages of 18–29 years to investigate perceptions of thriving within one's sexuality and factors that may foster or hinder its occurrence. The results indicated participants perceived thriving as a spectrum of states and processes involving a sense of personal safety with high levels of self-acceptance to believe one could exist freely as a person of DSO. The findings suggested thriving within one's sexuality during emerging adulthood is fostered through the factors of seeking personal growth, social representation/visibility, affirming social support and opportunities to support other DSO people. In contrast, identity denial, unsupportive social environments, erasure/tokenism, and experiences of discrimination eroded one's ability to thrive. Psychological interventions focusing on establishing a strong sense of identity, building a social support network and encouragement to seek thriving opportunities, may foster thriving experiences for Australian DSO emerging adults.",

Уровень аффилиативности и сексуальная активность самца по отношению к самке не коррелируют друг с другом. Аффилиативность и сексуальная активность самца по отношению к разным самкам различны, так же как различно отношение разных самцов к одной и той же самке.

      "abstract": "This article reports an exploratory study that investigated domestic labour in same-sex households, to the best of my knowledge the first in Australia to do so. In-depth semi-structured interviews with 12 couples in Southeast Queensland reveal that these lesbians and gay men do not take on heteronormative gender roles when doing domestic labour, and that their practices reflect a variety of styles of sharing, with no pattern emerging as clearly dominant. Theoretical frameworks conceptualising gender as performative, and queer theory's figuring of identity as a constellation of multiple and unstable positions, suggest how the performance of gender may vary in different domains of social and cultural space, and in relation to other actors in those spaces. I have conceptualised this process by means of an analogy with the modulation of sound such that each person adjusts the balance between treble (conventionally feminine behaviours, attitudes and attributes) and bass (conventionally masculine behaviours and attributes). Rather than being ‘the man’ or ‘the woman’, or even displaying a single form of gay masculinity or lesbian femininity, lesbians and gay men can be seen to perform varying degrees of masculinity and femininity in the private space of the home, and in relation to their intimate partners, by the way they engage with domestic labour. Finally, I reflect on how the socio-geographical specificities of being situated in Southeast Queensland may have impacted on this research.",

      "abstract": "This study tested predictions about development of gender-related thought and action from social cognitive theory. Children at 4 levels of gender constancy were assessed for their gender knowledge, personal gender standards, and gender-linked behavior under different situational conditions. Irrespective of gender constancy level, all children engaged in more same-sex than cross-sex typed behavior. Younger children reacted in a gender stereotypic manner to peers' gender-linked behavior but did not regulate their own behavior on the basis of personal gender standards. Older children exhibited substantial self-regulatory guidance based on personal standards. They expressed anticipatory self-approval for same-sex typed behavior and self-criticism for cross-sex typed behavior. Their anticipatory self-sanctions, in turn, predicted their actual gender-linked behavior. Neither gender knowledge nor gender constancy predicted gender-linked behavior. These results lend support to social cognitive theory that evaluation and regulation of gender-linked conduct shifts developmentally from anticipatory social sanctions to anticipatory self-sanctions rooted in personal standards.",

Indeed, several lines of reasoning, and some prior studies, suggest that individual differences in women's preferences for cues of men's underlying health will be more apparent among partnered women than among unpartnered women. The current study shows that preferences for male faces with masculine shape cues, characteristics that are thought to signal men's underlying health, are positively correlated with partnered, but not unpartnered, women's reported reproductive ambition (i.e., their desire to become pregnant). These findings (1) present new evidence for systematic variation in women's mating strategies, (2) suggest that partnership status may be important for potentially adaptive variation in women's mate preferences, and (3) suggest that reproductive ambition may influence women's mate preferences. Alternative explanations for these findings, focusing on the possible effects of a range of variables that may be correlated with reproductive ambition in partnered women and influence their masculinity preferences, are also discussed.",

      "title": "Living Arrangement Choices among the Elderly",
      "abstract": "ABSTRACT This research explores factors which differentiate non-institutionalized elderly persons living alone, living only with a spouse, and living with other persons (with or without a spouse present). Special attention is devoted to the measurement and investigation of several social norms and personal preferences. These factors are organized in terms of a decision-making framework developed from micro-economic and demographic theory. Choice of a living arrangement is seen as the product of underlying norms and preferences, a set of socio-demographic factors, and constraints on choice. This research relies on data from 454 personal interviews drawn from a stratified random sample of persons 65 and over living in private households in London, Ontario, Canada. Data analysis indicates that the decision of whom to live with is complex and is influenced by a large group of variables. However, the most important factors are the social norms and personal preferences of the respondents. Of these, a preference for independence and privacy surfaces as the strongest predictor of living arrangements. Being able to do what one wants without outside interference in conjunction with a private living style tends to be viewed by older persons as very important household ‘goods’. The expected separateness of the elderly, age segregation or differentiation, and kinship obligations and ties were found to be influential social norms affecting living arrangement decisions. The analysis also suggests that the constraining effects of domestic competence, physical strength and mobility, and availability of kin for co-residence are also important. In addition, several socio-demographic variables including age, sex and ethnicity arise as significant predictors of living arrangements.",

      "abstract": "Parents describe a want for better sex education for their young children compared to their own myth and silence-led experiences while growing up. However, introducing the vagina has proved a challenging step too far for many parents. This study arose from a secondary qualitative data analysis of 20 focus groups with parents in Ireland about how they engaged in body and sexuality communication and socialisation practices with young children, aged 4 to 9 years old. Though parents often utilised euphemisms, the language applied to male bodies tended to be generic, while euphemisms for female bodies tended to be family-specific. The language used in talking about the female body evaded reference to the vagina and talking about its functions. Protecting the child from knowledge about the sexual body was aligned with maintaining innocence and delaying the child's transition to adulthood. Parents demonstrated a commitment to stop using myths but still placed boundaries around their young children's sex education, albeit boundaries that were being redefined. Perpetuating intergenerational taboos, placing boundaries on knowledge of the sexual body, impacts a child's ability to fully integrate their body into their sense of self.",

Two five-step knowledge sequences of age growth and sex constancy were provided utilizing skill theory (Fischer,1980). Each step in a sequence had different stories of age or sex role with increasing cognitive complexity, but the two sequences were equivalent in complexity. The children were tested under two different assessment conditions : high support condition of elicited imitation and low support condition of free play and the best story. The findings are as follow : First, the understanding of age and sex roles develops through the predicted five-step sequences. Second, the understanding of age role seems to develop earlier than that of sex role although the developmental patterns of the two roles are similar. Third, variations in the children`s performances, under different conditions, are dramatic, especially for the older children.",

In a typical facial maturity condition (mature-faced males and baby-faced females), typical sex role stereotypes were obtained.

In the male pair the roles were overtly determined to the extent of genital satisfaction; in the adolescent female pair the roles were determined but without as yet overt sexual intimacies. The determining life experiences for the differentiation of the sexual role were found in the prenatal fantasies of the parents of one pair for a child different in sex from that of the twins at birth; and a slight but definite anatomical differentiation in the twins which determined for the mother a special attachment for one or the other child. There resulted early differentiation of the body ego for each of the individuals and later in life enhancement of the sexual role through the existence or deprivation of significant extrafamilial relations. Of significance also was the parental attitude toward the role of the individual child disclosed through the naming of the child. Biologically appropriate sexual behavior was unrelated to the type or degree of psychopathology. Homosexual seduction in itself was not found to determine homosexual behavior nor deter heterosexual behavior. Neurological and various biochemical examinations failed to reveal differences between these identical twin pairs divergent for homosexuality and heterosexuality.",

Men and women evaluated 400 English-language words on the characteristics of sexual charge and sexual ambiguity. Data gathered from these ratings were compared with other factors such as religious involvement, sexual experience, sex guilt, and social desirability. Men and women did not differ in their sexual ratings of the list. However, because the list contained a large number of words that had no sexual content at all, gender differences were examined for ratings of a sample of 30 sexually ambiguous words. As hypothesized, men rated these words as significantly more sexual than women. Significant gender differences were found on a number of sexuality and personality measures. Women were more religious than men, and religiosity was significantly correlated with most of the other measures. Women also had higher social desirability scores, which implies that they may have been responding in a socially desirable manner and were not completely honest. Overall, gender differences followed gender-oriented stereotypes: (a) Women have greater sexual guilt than men, (b) women are less sexually arousable or more \"erotophobic,\" and (c) women are less comfortable answering questions about their sexuality and rating words.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Selection due to social interactions comprises competition over matings (sexual selection stricto sensu ) plus other forms of social competition and cooperation. Sexual selection explains sex differences in ornamentation and in various other phenotypes, but does not easily explain cases where those phenotypes are similar in males and females. Understanding such similarities requires knowing how phenotypes influence nonsexual social interactions as well, which can be very important in gregarious animals, but whose role for phenotypic evolution has been overlooked. For example, ‘mate choice’ experiments often found preferences for ornamentation, but have not assessed whether those are strictly sexual or are general social preferences. Using choice experiments with a gregarious and mutually ornamented finch, the common waxbill ( E strilda astrild ), we show that preferences for ornamentation in the opposite‐sex also extend to same‐sex interactions. Waxbills discriminated between opposite‐ and same‐sex individuals, but most preferences for colour traits were similar when interacting with either sex. Similar preferences in sexual and nonsexual associations may be widespread in nature, either as social adaptations or as by‐product of mate preferences. In either case, such preferences may set the stage for the evolution of mutual ornamentation and of various other similarities between the sexes.",

It is in fact gendered masculine and defined within heteronormativity and homophobia. However, there are also overtly gendered roles for men, though these are characteristically represented in selective and flattering ways. Men therefore have little need for an ‘identity politics’ to work against an oppressive norm. Rather they are positioned against each other within competitive hierarchies, which are co-defined with the values and structures of militarism and capitalism.",

      "abstract": "This target article presents an integrated evolutionary model of the development of attachment and human reproductive strategies. It is argued that sex differences in attachment emerge in middle childhood, have adaptive significance in both children and adults, and are part of sex-specific life history strategies. Early psychosocial stress and insecure attachment act as cues of environmental risk, and tend to switch development towards reproductive strategies favoring current reproduction and higher mating effort. However, due to sex differences in life history trade-offs between mating and parenting, insecure males tend to adopt avoidant strategies, whereas insecure females tend to adopt anxious/ambivalent strategies, which maximize investment from kin and mates. Females are expected to shift to avoidant patterns when environmental risk is more severe. Avoidant and ambivalent attachment patterns also have different adaptive values for boys and girls, in the context of same-sex competition in the peer group: in particular, the competitive and aggressive traits related to avoidant attachment can be favored as a status-seeking strategy for males. Finally, adrenarche is proposed as the endocrine mechanism underlying the reorganization of attachment in middle childhood, and the implications for the relationship between attachment and sexual development are explored. Sex differences in the development of attachment can be fruitfully integrated within the broader framework of adaptive plasticity in life history strategies, thus contributing to a coherent evolutionary theory of human development.",

In terms of utilization rates, we find that the genders behave similarly. Nevertheless, we do detect some intriguing gender differences in these challenges. First, male players’ challenges are more likely to be provoked by those of their opponents. More importantly, at tiebreaks, females are more likely to reverse an umpire’s unfavorable call, while males make relatively more unsuccessful challenges. Furthermore, we find that men are a lot more likely to make “embarrassing” line-call challenges at tiebreaks and offenses (i.e., when the shot lands at the opponent’s side of the tennis court) than women. These significant gender differences suggest that women particularly diverge from men at crucial junctures of the match such as tiebreaks. Differences in factors such as risk aversion, overconfidence, pride, shame, and strategic signalling behavior might help us to explain these gender-difference findings in line call challenges.",

      "abstract": "A trait labelled as “morality” has been argued to be perceived and prioritised during first impressions of faces; however, immorality is not a homogenous concept. Violations of purity are frequently distinguished from other violations via distinct behavioural and emotional patterns, arguably stemming from physical disgust, sexual content, or “weirdness” impure scenarios. In the current research, participants were asked to rate unfamiliar faces based on social traits and their likelihood of engaging in immoral or nonmoral behaviours. Across two studies, perceived engagement in most autonomy and purity moral violations but also the non-moral sexual and “weird” acts was predicted by lower facial morality. There was also a distinction wherein most purity violations and physical disgust were more associated with male gender, and most autonomy violations with ratings of high dominance. The scenarios also differed within categories, such as sexually impure scenarios and disgust associated with unattractive faces; while behaving “weirdly” and certain other purity violations were associated with low dominance. Taken together, our results suggest faces seemingly low on the trait labelled “morality” are perceived as more likely to engage in most immoral behaviours, but also in other socially relevant, nonmoral behaviours. Social judgements are also not homogenous within or between theory-based categories of moral violations.",

This study explored associations between masculine gender-role congruence/incongruence and various aspects of sexual identity development in a sample of 106 nonheterosexual men between ages 18 and 74 years (M = 34.86, SD = 14.32). The majority of the sample identified as gay (79%), with the rest of the sample identifying as bisexual (10%), and nonexclusively same-sex-attracted sexual identity labels (e.g., pansexual, queer; 10%). Slightly more than half of the men reported congruence between their actual self-perception of masculinity and their ideal masculine presentation. However, men who experienced greater masculine gender-role incongruence, specifically presenting with lower masculine appearance and behavior than they desired, reported higher levels of identity distress and self-consciousness. Thus, though masculine gender roles are being challenged and gender nonconformity is becoming more widely accepted, masculine gender roles are still relevant to the lives of sexual minority men. Future research and clinical implications are discussed.",

These scenes should not be interpreted as satirical depictions of debauchery and excess, but as titillating conversation pieces inviting the viewers’ hermeneutics. Whether sexual pedagogy or unabashed hedonism, the common thread through all the representations we study here is the centrality of masculine spectatorship and performance to the erotic imagination of a culture familiar with athletic display of nude bodies. The females in these scenes are of little interest, mere vehicles for cementing bonds of male homosociality.",

      "abstract": "Religion's historical mistrust of sexuality shapes people's behavior by inhibiting liberal sexuality. Still, it is unclear whether this inhibitive role also includes common, normative sexual behavior, particularly in secularized contexts. Moreover, the possible mediating effects emotions, affects, and thoughts have on the association between religiosity and restricted sexuality have never been integrated into a single model. Finally, cross-religious differences in common sexual behavior have still yet to be documented. We addressed these three issues in two studies, with samples of Catholic and Muslim tradition (total N = 446). Consistently across samples, religiosity predicted, either directly or indirectly, less frequent common heterosexual behaviors and masturbation, partly through sexual guilt and inhibition, and/or decreased sexual fantasy and the search for sexual pleasure. However, married Muslims’ religiosity, unlike Catholics’, did not directly undermine fertility-oriented sexuality and the search for pleasure. Religion's role in restricting sexuality seems to be rooted in deep psychological rationale.",

      "abstract": "Sex, the states of being female or male, potentially interacts with all xenobiotic exposures, both inadvertent and deliberate, and influences their toxicokinetics (TK), toxicodynamics, and outcomes. Sex differences occur in behavior, exposure, anatomy, physiology, biochemistry, and genetics, accounting for female-male differences in responses to environmental chemicals, diet, and pharmaceuticals, including adverse drug reactions (ADRs). Often viewed as an annoying confounder, researchers have studied only one sex, adjusted for sex, or ignored it. Occupational epidemiology, the basis for understanding many toxic effects in humans, usually excluded women. Likewise, Food and Drug Administration rules excluded women of childbearing age from drug studies for many years. Aside from sex-specific organs, sex differences and sex × age interactions occur for a wide range of disease states as well as hormone-influenced conditions and drug distribution. Women have more ADRs than men; the classic sex hormone paradigm (gonadectomy and replacement) reveals significant interaction of sex and TK including absorption, distribution, metabolisms, and elimination. Studies should be designed to detect sex differences, describe the mechanisms, and interpret these in a broad social, clinical, and evolutionary context with phenomena that do not differ. Sex matters, but how much of a difference is needed to matter remains challenging.",

In nationally representative and local samples, minorities report personally caring about racial issues more than Whites do (Pilot Study), which we theorize makes racial attitude divergence with ingroup members especially disruptive. Both established friendships (Study 1) and face-to-face interactions among strangers (Study 2) provided evidence for the dissimilarity-repulsion hypothesis in same-race interactions for minorities but not Whites. For minorities, disagreeing with a minority partner or friend about racial attitudes decreased their positivity toward that person. Because minorities typically report caring about race more than Whites, same-race friendships involving shared racial attitudes may be particularly critical sources of social support for them, particularly in predominately White contexts. Understanding challenges that arise in same-race interactions, not just cross-race interactions, can help create environments in which same-race minority friendships flourish.",

      "abstract": "Pioneering research suggested that sexual afterglow (lingering sexual satisfaction following an act of sex) lasts 2 but not 3 days and predicts subsequent relationship satisfaction. Nevertheless, recent research highlights the importance of considering the differential impacts of sexual acceptance and rejection. We used 2-week, daily-diary data from 576 participants to demonstrate that sexual afterglow lasted at least 1 day on average, particularly following partner-initiated and mutually initiated sex, and did not depend on individual differences in the importance of sex or sexual rejection, though negative aftereffects of sexual rejection lasted 3 days. Furthermore, lingering sexual (dis)satisfaction often predicted subsequent relationship satisfaction. Mini-meta-analyses of the current data with all published data suggest sexual afterglow lasts at least 1 day and predicts relationship quality whereas sexual rejection did not reliably produce aftereffects. Conclusions focus future research on other factors that may contribute to differences in sexual afterglow and reactions to other discrete events.",

Does this mean we think people have control over what they believe? In two pre-registered studies, we tested how 5-6-year-olds, 7-8-year-olds, and adults judge the controllability of others' beliefs. Study 1 (N = 120) focused on fact-based beliefs and indicated children and adults thought beliefs that were unsupported or contradicted by evidence were controllable, while beliefs supported by evidence were much less controllable. Study 2 (N = 120) focused on value-based beliefs and indicated children and adults thought opinions and immoral beliefs were controllable, while moral beliefs were much less controllable. Developmental differences emerged, such that young children viewed moral beliefs as less free than adults. Our results suggest that judgments of how much of a choice people have over their beliefs greatly depends on the belief in question. Moreover, already at a young age, children have sophisticated intuitions of the controllability of beliefs and how these beliefs are constrained.",

However, because sports are typically sex-segregated, this athletic continuum is rarely seen but provides a potentially powerful mechanism of transformation relative to views of female athletes and women's sport. In women's intercollegiate basketball, it is common for teams to practice against a male scout team. We used Kane's continuum theory to examine the effects of integrated playing experiences on male practice players' attitudes towards female athletes and women's sports. Data from interviews revealed divergent first-order themes ('Acknowledgement of the Sport Continuum' and 'Maintenance of Traditional Gender Stereotypes') and several related second-order themes. The divergent themes reflect the complexity of gender relations in sport as the men simultaneously experienced and articulated a gender continuum while reinforcing a gender binary, which kept their own power and privilege in sport intact.",

Gender socialization and status processes suggest two potential explanations for the consistent finding that men self-handicap more than women. If status differences contribute to the tendency to self-handicap, then holding gender constant, those with high status on other characteristics would self-handicap more than those with low status. In Study 1, men assigned to high-status positions selected less study time (and thus self-handicapped more) than did men assigned to low-status positions. Women assigned high status, however, self-handicapped no more than did women assigned low status. Because study time as a measure of self-handicapping may be confounded with confidence or motivation, a second study assigned status and measured self-handicapping by the selection of performance-enhancing or -detracting music. Study 2 also found that high status increased self-handicapping among men but not among women. Both gender socialization and status processes may play roles in self-handicapping.",

      "abstract": "Previous studies try to account for variance in adolescent sexual precociousness, sexual mobility, and childbearing by reference either to sociological risk factors (e.g., poverty, social class, opportunitiesjbr sexual activity, or the absence of constraints on sexual activity) or to an evolved, domain‐specific cognitive mechanism. However, these forms of behavioral variation may reflect an evolved mental mechanism that creates behavioral plasticity and adaptability by assigning emotional weights to choice alternatives in all behavioral domains. Because it should act as a selective mechanismfor choice alternatives, this emotional mechanism should create enhanced ability to avoid predation (social exploitation) and to obtain access to resources, given the properties of specific environments. Sexual precociousness, sexual mobility, and childbearing thus should be determined by ecological contingencies that bear on how girls may best empower themselves. The findings of the present study support this ecological contingency hypothesis and show no effect for sociological and evolutionary psychology predictors. What we now characterize stress‐induced morbidity thus may consist of adaptive responses to environments in which children find themselves subject to predation and denial of access to resources.",

Men's diminished expressiveness is apparent in a context of intimate interaction. But in situations where they compete for social status, men seem more likely to express emotions. The authors suggest that more studies take into account the social contexts of emotional expressiveness generated by division of labor based on sex.",

Social ties were classified as solely close, solely problematic, or ambivalent, based on network placement (n = 3,392 social contacts). Multilevel models revealed that individuals viewed certain close familial ties (e.g., spouse, son or daughter, parent, sibling) with greater ambivalence than they viewed more distal family ties, friendships, or acquaintances. Participants classified more acquaintances than other relationships as solely problematic. Feeling closer to a social partner was associated with increased ambivalence. Older adults were more likely to classify their relationships as solely close than as ambivalent, in comparison with younger adults. Discussion focuses on tension and closeness in familial and nonfamilial relationships.",

Respected and legitimate childlessness may actually be a desirable life adjustment for individuals confronted with a worsening of the employment situation, a deterioration of their marital relationship, and an intensification of emotional and mental stress as a result of having children. Rather than simply supporting existing pronatalist views, counselors and physicians should be supportive of couples who have consciously chosen to remain childless. Control of fertility should be the right of the individual and should not be under the unlateral control of frequently biased physicians. Contraception and abortion should be available to all and not be subject to marital or parental status. It is also mandatory that there be recognition of the legal right to sterilization of individuals of legal age and with sufficient understanding of the consequences.",

However, the costs of developing and maintaining the sexually selected traits (ornaments) may reduce the resources available to the female for allocation to reproduction and hence result in lower reproductive success per brood. This hitherto unrecognized fecundity cost of sexually selected traits will constrain both the potency of sexual selection mechanisms and the degree of elaboration of sexually selected traits in females, and can also apply to males which invest in their offspring: sexual selection becomes self-limiting. The fitness implications of these costs are examined for both sexes in a variety of mating and parental care patterns. Sexual selection acting on both sexes may lead to either dimorphism or monomorphism, the latter being the case when the quality indicators chosen by both sexes coincide. Ways of evasion or reduction of these reproductive costs of allocations to sexually selected traits include using different resource components for the ornament and for reproduction, or partitioning the two allocations in time.",

      "abstract": "Cuando se produce la ruptura de una pareja con hijos, es preciso determinar judicialmente el régimen de comunicación del menor con el progenitor que no tiene su guarda y custodia. En estos casos, el testimonio del menor es un elemento controvertido, especialmente si existen denuncias de maltrato o abuso sexual. Gardner y sus seguidores defienden que el niño es mentiroso por naturaleza, en contraposición a otros autores como Clemente y Padilla, que argumentan que el testimonio de los menores ha de ser tenido en cuenta y que el niño raramente miente. Partiendo de estas dos orientaciones teóricas antagonistas, se demuestra mediante una investigación que los niños no mienten. Este estudio analiza si la edad de los menores es un elemento diferenciador de la veracidad de sus testimonios. La hipótesis es que los niños dicen la verdad en cualquier tramo de edad. En el estudio participaron 295 menores con edades comprendidas entre los 6 y los 11 años, divididos en dos grupos en función del sexo. Un grupo presenció una simulación de agresión y el otro no. Después fueron preguntados sobre lo que habían presenciado. En una segunda fase, se manipuló a los niños informándoles sobre aspectos del agresor: presión, informándoles que en un futuro sería su profesor o no; e imagen, expresándoles que era una buena o mala persona. Tras estas dos manipulaciones se preguntó de nuevo a los menores para que informaran sobre lo que habían presenciado. Los resultados del estudio revelan que los menores dicen la verdad en sus testimonios independientemente de sus edades. Dentro de ello, cabe señalar que, cuando los menores presencian la agresión, el porcentaje de testimonios veraces es muy elevado y similar en todas las edades estudiadas. Y cuando no presencian la agresión, los menores de 7, 8 y 9 años son los que más tienden a decir la verdad, y los de 10 años los que obtienen el menor porcentaje de veracidad. No es significativo estadísticamente en la veracidad del testimonio el que los menores presencien la agresión o no, pero es en los niños de 10 años donde mayor peso tienen estas variables, y en los niños de 7 años donde no tienen ninguna repercusión. Si a los menores se les intenta manipular introduciendo elementos de presión e imagen, la veracidad del testimonio de éstos no varía significativamente, habiendo una mayor incidencia de estas variables en los testimonios de los niños de 7 y 11 años cuando han presenciado la agresión y mienten al respecto. Se concluye, por tanto, que los menores no mienten es sus testimonios independientemente de sus edades. Se realizan recomendaciones para que el sistema de justicia tenga en cuenta el testimonio de los menores, para garantizar la salvaguarda del bienestar de éstos.",

      "title": "Extreme right-handedness, older brothers, and sexual orientation in men.",
      "abstract": "Two of the most consistent correlates of sexual orientation in men are handedness and fraternal birth order (i.e., number of older brothers). In the present study, the relationship among handedness, older brothers, and sexual orientation was studied in 4 samples of heterosexual and gay or bisexual men (N = 944). Unlike previous studies, which have only observed an increased rate of non-right-handedness in gay or bisexual men relative to heterosexual men, an elevated rate of extreme right-handedness was found in gay or bisexual men relative to heterosexual men. The results also demonstrated that older brothers moderate the relationship between handedness and sexual orientation. Specifically, older brothers increase the odds of being gay or bisexual in moderate right-handers only; in both non-right-handers and extreme right-handers, older brothers do not affect (or decrease) the odds of being gay or bisexual. The results have implications for an early neurodevelopmental origin to sexual orientation in men.",

      "abstract": "There is increasing evidence that inter-individual interaction among conspecifics can cause population-level lateralization. Male-female and mother-infant dyads of several non-human species show lateralised position preferences, but such preferences have rarely been examined in humans. We observed 430 male-female human pairs and found a significant bias for males to walk on the right side of the pair. A survey measured side preferences in 93 left-handed and 92 right-handed women, and 96 left-handed and 99 right-handed men. When walking, and when sitting on a bench, males showed a significant side preference determined by their handedness, with left-handed men preferring to be on their partner's left side and right-handed men preferring to be on their partner's right side. Women did not show significant side preferences. When men are with their partner they show a preference for the side that facilitates the use of their dominant hand. We discuss possible reasons for the side preference, including males prefering to occupy the optimal \"fight ready\" side, and the influence of sex and handedness on the strength and direction of emotion lateralization.",

      "abstract": "The sex-role position of a child with developmental disorder plays an important role in the process of family’s adaptation to disability. The literature provides evidence of the favourable influence of a healthy child in the family on both the mother and the relationships in the family; the differences in the gender selectivity of parents in the upbringing of girls and boys, including the presence of children with developmental disorders, are established.Main results of the study. The study found that mother’ relation to an only child on most indicators does not differ from her relation to a child who is one of the siblings in the family. Mothers rate the child equally on the health, intelligence, beauty, character and happiness scales, regardless of the child’s position in the family. Mothers rate themselves equally on all scales, regardless of whether they are only mothers of a child with a developmental disorders, or they also have normally developed children.There are some differences in the maternal relation to the only children compared to non- only children. In relation to their only child mothers accept unconditionally of their child and are more sensitive to it. This data corresponds to the idea of high significance of the first child for a mother.The mother’s relation to boys and girls does not differ in all the studied parameters, which can be explained by the implementation of the mother’s role content in relation to a very young child, the main component of which is responsibility and care.The data obtained do not quite correspond to the expected results. This can be explained by the fact that a mother perceives her child as different from other children, and therefore not so much the youngest or middle among the children in the family, as the only one. The order of birth of a child and its gender, being objective and emotionally neutral characteristics, acquire sense for the mother and therefore play the role of individual factors in the formation of maternal relation.",

Some authors have reported that both intrafamilial and extrafamilial offenders show sexual interest in children; others have found that intrafamilial offenders evidence little interest in children. The authors compared the phallometrically measured sexual interests of 19 intrafamilial heterosexual child molesters, 20 extrafamilial heterosexual child molesters, and 18 heterosexual nonoffender men recruited from the community. Stimuli consisted of 27 audiotapes describing either consensual sex with an adult partner, sexual contacts with a child using different degrees of force and violence, nonsexual aggression against a child, and neutral interactions. Nonoffenders showed a clear preference for adult stimuli; intrafamilial and extrafamilial child molesters did not discriminate between the adult and child categories and showed very similar arousal patterns.",

The most frequent cause of this is premature ejaculation in the male. Only the selfishness of the male, and of physicians who are generally males, has made it possible to overlook the fact that such a state of affairs, if it becomes stabilized, must lead at least to functional disturbances. The female sex, which has subjected itself to the male viewpoint in morals as in other matters, has so completely adopted this ideal of femininity that it holds the opposite attitude to be impossible for itself, even in thought. The female sex provides a great contrast to this. All sexual excitement is methodically kept away from girls but also in fantasy.",

In Study Two ( n = 137), we explore these same moderating effects on zenoism, fear of dependency, value of life, and favorability toward physician-assisted suicide (PAS). Results indicate: 1) men and non-religious respondents (especially men) zenoize more than women and religious respondents; 2) non-religious respondents, (especially men) are more generally favorable to PAS and more suicidal; 3) Zenoism is negatively related to depression, demoralization, and value of life for non-religious respondents, and for men; 4) Zenoism is positively related to favorability toward PAS toward one's self and overall suicidality; and finally 5) general and self-specific favorability toward PAS are distinct, but both relate to overall suicidality.",

Research suggests that sexual consent is frequently expressed nonverbally and indirectly. In fact, many people seem to indicate consent passively by doing nothing (i.e., not refusing or resisting). For these reasons, it can be difficult to interpret when consent has, or has not, occurred. Further, consensual sex is not always wanted sex; research has found that individuals often consent or agree to engage in sex that they do not want or desire. Traditional expectations for men's and women's roles in sexual encounters (e.g., the expectation that men will initiate sex and women will act as “gatekeepers”) may influence how consent is communicated by men and women in heterosexual interactions.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Though research suggests that sexual minorities (e.g., nonheterosexual individuals) are more geographically mobile in the transition to adulthood than their heterosexual counterparts, quantitative estimates are rare and previously used data sources have significant limitations. Using data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (N = 11,705) that directly measure sexualities across dimensions (i.e., identity, behavior, and attraction), I examine variation in geographic mobility between childhood (ages 11–17) and adulthood (ages 26–34) across various sexualities (e.g., gay/lesbian and bisexual). Three findings emerge. First, mobility varies across sexualities. Individuals with gay/lesbian identity, same-sex behavior, and same-sex attraction are more geographically mobile than individuals with heterosexual identity, different-sex behavior, and different-sex attraction, respectively. By contrast, individuals with bisexual identity, both-sex behavior, and both-sex attraction tend to be statistically indistinct from individuals with heterosexual identity, different-sex behavior, and different-sex attraction, respectively. Second, mobility differences are largest and most prevalent when sexualities are operationalized according to identity. Third, evidence suggests that the effects of gay/lesbian identity, same-sex behavior, and same-sex attraction on mobility are larger for men than for women. In providing the first quantitative estimates of geographic mobility differences across broader sexual minority and heterosexual populations, this study expands inquiry related to sexualities and mobility.",

Some identify as transgender, whereas others consider themselves nonbinary or gender fluid . Nonbinary and gender fluid youth are distinct from transgender youth in that they typically report that their gender identity (i.e., their internal sense of gender) or their gender expression (i.e., their public presentation of their gender through appearance, dress, and behavior) fall outside the traditional male–female binary. For example, nonbinary youth may identify as both male and female or neither male nor female. In this article, I discuss what we know about nonbinary forms of gender identity and expression among children and adolescents, and how these experiences converge and diverge from binary forms of the transgender experience. I also identify the most important priorities for fostering well‐being among all youth.",

Four studies ( N s = 526, 567, 769, 154) tested whether middle childhood to mid‐adolescent girls and boys (ranging from 8 to 17 years old) differ in how they expect that talking about problems would make them feel. Girls endorsed positive expectations (e.g., expecting to feel cared for, understood) more strongly than boys. Despite common perceptions, boys did not endorse negative expectations such as feeling embarrassed or worried about being made fun of more than girls. Instead, boys were more likely than girls to expect to feel “weird” and like they were wasting time. Sex differences in outcome expectations did help to account for girls’ greater disclosure to friends.",

      "title": "Sexual Conflict Theory",
      "abstract": "Sexual conflict arises from differences in the fitness interests of males and females. A trait that is beneficial for the reproductive success of one sex reduces the fitness of the other sex, resulting in opposing selection pressures on the two sexes. The two sexes need each other for reproduction, but their dependence is asymmetric. Males benefit from a higher mating rate than females, as their reproductive success is usually constrained by the number of receptive mates, while female reproductive success is limited by egg production. Sexual conflict can occur at any stage of reproductive interactions – before or during copulation, or after insemination – and over almost any aspect of reproduction, from the decision to mate to the investment into parental care. The conflict results in a perpetual tug of war between the sexes. Each sex attempts to maximize its fitness at a cost to the other sex, which results in sexually antagonistic selection. This can cause the rapid evolution of sexual traits, and ultimately results in the diversification of traits, and possibly even in speciation. Sexual conflict can manifest in two ways, intra- and interlocus sexual conflict. Intralocus sexual conflict occurs when a trait expressed in both sexes (determined by alleles in the same locus in the two sexes) has opposite effects on male and female fitness. Interlocus sexual conflict occurs when the conflicting traits are determined by alleles in different loci in the two sexes and the optimal outcome of male–female interactions differs between the two sexes. Intralocus sexual conflict generates a genetic tug of war between the sexes over the optimal trait expression, while interlocus sexual conflict can lead to open-ended cycles of sexually antagonistic coevolution. Sexual conflict before mating has resulted in a diversity of tactics and strategies that males use to overcome female unwillingness to mate, from forced copulations and sneaky fertilization to the emission of love darts. Sexual conflict after mating has favored the evolution of male traits that increase success in sperm competition, such as postcopulatory mate guarding, toxic seminal substances that destroy the sperm of other males, mating plugs that prevent other males from mating with the female, and morphological and physiological traits that harm females, such as spines on the intromittent organ that pierce the reproductive tract of the female. Females have evolved cryptic choice of sperm to influence which males fertilize her ova. Whether the sexual conflict between males and females can be resolved depends on the type of conflict. Several mechanisms may reduce the strength of intralocus conflict, such as sex-limited expression of traits, but the interests of males and females are unlikely to become aligned when it comes to interlocus conflict. The relative influence of sexual conflict on the fitness of organisms, and the degree to which it can be resolved, are open questions.",

This survey study of mate preferences ( N = 738) found that participants’ age (from 18 to 40) was associated with lower mate selectivity. This negative association between age and mate selectivity was greater for men than for women. Age continued to be associated with mate selectivity controlling for shyness and perception of available partners—and both of these variables were uniquely associated with mate selectivity (negatively and positively, respectively). This study also examined participants’ beliefs about how the importance of various traits in a partner had changed over time. Overall, the participants perceived no change or a slight increase in their preferences over time, although the perceived change depended on the particular trait domain, sex of the participant, and the other individual difference variables.",

Notably, sometimes this effect is seen to differ between males and females. However, the effects of social cues on negative behavior along with its gender dimension have not been studied in a controlled setting. We investigate this with a dictator taking game with and without an eye-image involving a gender balanced subject pool. We find that the eye-image affects the taking behavior of the males and females very differently. Males take significantly less, and females take significantly more in the presence of the eye-image, compared to a baseline. The two groups' opposing effects cancel each other to produce no overall treatment effect. Furthermore, while with the eye-image males are less likely to act selfishly (i.e., to take the whole amount) and more likely to act as an egalitarian, the females exhibit the opposite behavior. We discuss possible reasons for this asymmetric gender effects.",

      "abstract": "Biased media content shapes children’s social concepts and identities. We examined gender bias in a large corpus of scripts from 98 children’s television programs from the United States spanning the years 1960 to 2018 (6,600 episodes, ~2.7 million sentences, ~16 million words). We focused on agency and communion, the fundamental psychological dimensions underlying gender stereotypes. At the syntactic level, words referring to men or boys (vs. women or girls) appear more often in the agent (vs. patient) role. This syntactic bias remained stable between 1960 and 2018. At the semantic level, words referring to men or boys (vs. women or girls) co-occurred more often with words denoting agency. Words denoting communion showed both stereotypical and counterstereotypical associations. Some semantic gender biases have remained unchanged or have weakened over time; others have grown. These findings suggest that gender stereotypes are built into the core of children’s stories. Whether we are closer today to gender equality in children’s media depends on where one looks.",

      "abstract": "Animals act to obtain rewards such as food, shelter, and sex. Sometimes, their actions are rewarded or reinforced immediately, but often this is not the case; to be successful, animals must learn to act on the basis of delayed reinforcement. They may also profit by choosing delayed reinforcers over immediate reinforcers, if the delayed reinforcers are sufficiently large. However, individuals differ in their ability to choose delayed rewards. Selfcontrolled individuals are strongly influenced by delayed reinforcement, and choose large, delayed rewards in preference to small, immediate rewards; in contrast, individuals who are relatively insensitive to delayed reinforcement choose impulsively, preferring the immediate, smaller reward in this situation (1). Impulsivity has long been recognized as a normal human characteristic (2) and in some circumstances it may be beneficial (3), but impulsive choice contributes to deleterious states such as drug addiction (4-8) and attentiondeficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (9).",

An association has also emerged between being more evening, as opposed to morning, oriented and having a greater number of sexual partners. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether eveningness in males is an evolved sexually dimorphic trait consistent across different cultures. A sample of 179 male Sri Lankan men residing in two different cultural and economic settings, Italy and Sri Lanka, were administered the Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire (MEQ) followed by assessing their sexual behavior history. The results robustly portrayed a highly significant main effect of MEQ types highlighting the twofold sexual success enjoyed by the evening individuals in both regional locations. Morning oriented individuals, showed a stronger preference for going out and partying than evening-types, suggesting that the higher mating success of evening types is not due to their different lifestyles allowing more opportunities to encounter females. However, evening types exhibited a preference for flirtatious behaviors in the later part of the day. Shoulder-to-hip and handgrip strength, as measures of testosterone levels, were not significantly associated with eveningness. The results are discussed in terms of sexual selection and its interplay with human cultural variation.",

However, this idealization can fade once couples marry and experience routine daily living. Highly passionate (i.e., quickly accelerating) courtships, replete with idealization, likely make partners vulnerable to subsequent declines in marital affection—or disillusionment. To test this notion, 168 newlywed couples provided retrospective survey and interview information on how passionate their courtship was and brief series of daily assessments of affectionate behavior during the first 2 years of marriage. Results from multilevel analyses showed that respondents who experienced highly passionate courtships reported their spouses as behaving more affectionately toward them as newlyweds, but experienced declines in perceived affectionate expression as the marriage progressed. Results persisted after controlling for possible confounding variables (e.g., age at dating onset, courtship length, premarital love, cohabitation, and conflict). Findings support the disillusionment model.",

      "abstract": "Ethical controversies in patients with intellectual disability who are sex offenders. Patients with an intellectual disability (ID) have a disorder with onset during the developmental period that includes both intellectual and adaptive functioning deficits in conceptual, social, and practical domains (according to the DSM-5). These deficits in adaptive functioning result in failure to meet developmental and sociocultural standards for personal independence and social responsibility. Without ongoing support, the adaptive deficits limit functioning in one or more activities of daily life. Therefore, it is not surprising that these patients cross physical/sexual boundaries quite often. Above that, a proportion of all sex offenders have an intellectual disability. The treatment of these sex offenders with an ID has to focus on protective factors, next to risk factors in order to decrease the risk of recidivism. Due to the chronicity of their disorder, quality of life is an important issue in these patients. In this paper, we want to address some ethical controversies: – hormonal treatment in patients with ID who are sex offenders; – the right to have a ‘normal’ sexual life in these ID offenders, and the Dutch experience of the Stichting Alternatieve Relatiebemiddeling (SAR, that can be translated as foundation of alternative relationship mediation). The SAR is an alternative dating service, giving information about the sexuality of physically or mentally disabled people and organizing sexual encounters for them.

      "abstract": "The expression of alternative reproductive tactics can be plastic and occur simultaneously depending on cues that vary spatially or temporally. For example, variation in resources and sexual selection intensity is expected to influence the pay-off of each tactic and shape the decision of which tactic to employ. Males of the nuptial gift-giving spider Pisaura mirabilis can adopt three tactics: offering a genuine prey gift, a worthless' non-nutritious gift or no gift. We hypothesized that resources and/or male body condition, and mating opportunity and sexual selection intensity, vary over the course of the mating season to shape the co-existence of alternative traits. We measured these variables in the field over two seasons, to investigate the predictions that as the mating season progresses, (i) males become more likely to employ a gift-giving tactic, and (ii) the likelihood of switching from worthless to genuine gifts increases. Prey availability increased over the season and co-varied with the propensity of males to employ the gift-giving tactic, but we found no support for condition-dependent gift giving. Males responded to an increase in female availability by increasing their mating effort (gift production). Furthermore, the frequency of genuine gift use increased with sexual selection intensity, consistent with the assumption that sperm competition intensity increases with time. Our results suggest that the frequency of alternative tactics is shaped by seasonal changes in ecological factors and sexual selection. This leads to relaxed selection for the gift-giving tactic early in the season when females are less choosy and resources more scarce, and increased selection for genuine gifts later in the season driven by mating opportunity and risk of sperm competition.",

      "abstract": "The aim of this study was to investigate how teenage boys who had offended against peers in a rape-like way talked about their childhood experiences and about themselves as teenagers. Through the narratives, troubled families in which the boys had experienced neglect, abuse, and lack of monitoring and care become visible. However, on a semantic level, the boys stated that all was good and nothing was bad and recurrent was that these boys seldom found a storyline or a prominent chronology. The boys seemed to want to present an image of not being preoccupied with sex and they seemed to have no discussion partner concerning sexuality. The boys were reluctant to talk about the sexual abuse committed by them, and it was common to describe these assaults as something taking place out of one's control. Many stated a wish to forget the offences they had done due to the pain and distress connected to remembering. For a majority, the role of a rowdy boy and a young troublemaker almost seemed to function as an identity. A part of these boys' “tough attitudes” to life was to state that they did not need anybody and few told of friendships or emotional closeness to others. The boys' experiences of interpersonal rejection, together with a “tough-guy” attitude as young troublemakers, could be interpreted as a foundation for hostile masculinity, described, for example, by Malamuth et al.

There were no gays or lesbians in TV-series before 1976. After that, a period followed with few, male and ridiculed characters. The 1990's however have changed much: today homosexuality is treated in a more realistic way, and there are more lesbians in TV-series. The homosexual character is seen from a heterosexual perspective. He or she is often lonely, seldom shown other than surrounded by heterosexuals. The gay person is always a minority. As a result the gay character has to symbolize homosexuals, and homosexuality, in general. He/she has gay-related problems with his/her parents, at work, among friends; he/she gets gaybashed, becomes infected with HIV etc. Most of the TV-series have been shown on commercial TV, even though public television as a special responsibility to present programmes with or for minorities. My conclusion is that Sveriges Radio/TV consciously has chosen to ignore homosexuality. This policy only mirrors that of the Swedish government, and other influential groups within society, such as the church.",

      "title": "Do You Love Me, Too? Perceptions of Responses to I Love You",
      "abstract": "Saying I love you to a romantic partner for the first time in a new relationship is a terrifying moment that exposes the initiator to vulnerability and can sway the balance of power within the relationship. However, this moment can also be terrifying for the receivers of I love you, especially if they do not love their partners in return. The receivers then have to choose whether to be honest with their partner-potentially hurting their partner's feelings-or to be dishonest and preserve their partner's feelings while being untrue to themselves. In this type of awkward situation, it is possible that women and men may prefer different responses to I love you. One reason that women and men may prefer different responses to I love you is that they have different timelines for falling in love. Harrison and Shortall (2011) surveyed college students to explore which gender says I love you first. Contrary to popular perceptions that women fall in love first, they found that men reported falling in love more quickly and were more likely to say I love you first. In addition to falling in love at different rates, women and men may also have different motives for saying I love you to their partners. To investigate such motives, Brantley, Knox, and Zusman (2002) surveyed college students to explore when and why they say I love you to their romantic partners for the first time. They found that men were more likely than were women to say I love you first in a relationship and to do so as a means of obtaining sex from their partners. Thus, men may have ulterior motives for saying I love you to their partners. Not only do men say I love you in order to have sex with their partners, but evidence suggests that they have other reasons for saying it as well. For example, a diary study of college students' romantic relationships indicated that men were more likely to say I love you first in order to force women to commit to the relationship (Owen, 1987). By contrast, women were more likely to refrain from saying I love you first, presumably because they were better able to distinguish love from other related emotions such as like or lust, and also because they view their role in the relationship as reactive and men's role as proactive (Owen, 1987). Therefore, it seems that men often say I love you in order to move their relationship forward either emotionally (i.e., with commitment) or physically (i.e., with sex). Whereas men say I love you to obtain sex from their partners, women appear to use the opposite strategy, namely using sex to obtain love. Consistent with this notion, Regan and Dreyer (1999) questioned college students about their motives for engaging in casual sex and found that men engage in casual sex to improve their social status and to show their sexual prowess, whereas women engage in casual sex to improve their chances of obtaining a long-term committed relationship. According to Reiss (1981), this pattern is the result of a patriarchal society in which men receive positive reinforcement for being promiscuous, but women are only justified in having sex if love is involved. It is also possible that women and men have different motives for saying I love you and engaging in sexual intercourse because they have different goals in mind. According to Sexual Strategies Theory (Buss & Schmitt, 1993), in order to obtain maximum reproductive fitness, men should operate on a short-term mating strategy that involves impregnating as many women as possible, whereas women should prefer a long-term mating strategy in which mates are carefully chosen for their resources and protection. However, Buss and Schmitt (1993) suggest that in order to obtain sex from women, men may need to act as if they want a long-term relationship when, in fact, all they want is casual sex. Saying I love you to their partners may be one way that men attempt to convince women of their commitment. By contrast, waiting to have sex until I love you has been said may be how women attain emotional and resource investment from men. …",

The impact of menarcheal timing on female delinquency was moderated by the sex composition of schools; early-maturing girls in mixed-sex settings were at greatest risk for delinquency. Individual differences in delinquency were also significantly more stable among girls in mixed-sex schools than among those in all-girl schools. These contextual variations are interpreted in terms of the differential distribution of reinforcements and opportunities for delinquency. The life course is punctuated by numerous biological and social events that require individuals to organize their behavior around newly denned tasks. Puberty is among the most profound of these biosocial transitions. Thus, the onset of menarche in the adolescent girl not only signals her approaching reproductive capacity, but it also elicits new expectations from others, alters her reference group, and reorganizes her body image and sexual identity (Brooks-Gunn & Petersen, 1983; Koff, Rierdan, & Silverstone, 1978). Menarcheal onset is also associated with increases in the prevalence of norm-breaking behaviors and social deviance during the adolescent years (Stattin & Magnusson, 1990). In an effort to contribute to our understanding of the etiology of female delinquency, this article examines the processes linking biological and behavioral changes in different contexts during adolescence. Our work represents an effort to integrate an ecological approach to the study of human development, sociological perspectives on delinquency causation, and recent advances in our understanding of the role of biological maturation in adolescent social behavior. Biosocial models of adolescence highlight the hormonal and social-stimulus effects of pu",

This study tested two conflicting sets of predictions concerning divorce patterns in the United States: a socioeconomic set and a biocultural set. The socioeconomic perspective predicts that the addition of one or more children to a marriage would increase the husband's (as compared with the wife's) motivation to petition for a divorce. The biocultural perspective posits that a man-to-child affiliative bond would add to a man's adherence to his child(ren) and, in turn, would lower his motivation (as compared with the woman's) to petition for a divorce. The biocultural perspective was supported in this study.",

      "abstract": "Little research has examined if there are differences in sexual well-being, negative sexual health outcomes, or levels of sexual identity development between racial/ethnic minority and non-racial/ethnic minority youth in the foster care system. Using a sample of youth formerly in the foster care system (n = 219), this study compared the sexual well-being, sexual identity development, and negative sexual health outcomes of racial/ethnic minority and non-racial/ethnic minority youth and found that racial/ethnic minority and non-racial/ethnic minority youth did not differ in overall levels of sexual well-being and had no significant differences in their levels of sexual identity development. There were differences in incidence of the youth or a partner having an STI/STD. These results indicate that there are few differences in sexual well-being, negative sexual health outcomes, or sexual identity development between racial/ethnic minority and non-racial/ethnic minority youth formerly in the foster care system. All four domains of sexual identity development predicted sexual well-being for non-racial/ethnic minority youth, but sexual orientation identity uncertainty did not predict sexual well-being for racial/ethnic minority youth, emphasizing the importance of sexual identity development. Attention to the sexual development and sexual health of youth in the foster care system continues to be lacking and should be expanded.",

A\r\n problem with the research is the non-unified form of professional terminology within the video game domain, so\r\n different authors use different words for the same terms. Most of the research was based solely on video games,\r\n and in order to have a good run on the subject, other disciplines need to be incorporated to dispel gaming myths\r\n and stereotypes. In the last decade, we have witnessed a widespread movement toward declaring game studies to\r\n be our own sovereign area of study or discipline. The study of games, of course, has a much longer history and is\r\n embedded in the theories and practices of all areas of academic research. In the process of joining forces around a\r\n common subject of study, it is important to clarify the different theoretical and methodological foundations\r\n A survey in the Republic of Croatia showed that gamers are mostly men between the ages of 18 and 25.\r\n They mostly play FPSs, averaging one to four hours a day, and at least MOBAs and MMORPGs. The game\r\n mechanics and story within the game are their most important aspects of video games. They rarely neglect\r\n commitments like business, school / college, sports and cultural. Most of them do not consume alcohol while\r\n playing and tend to play solo. By testing the hypotheses, we came to the conclusion that there were no statistically\r\n significant differences in experiences and preferences between male and female participants.

      "abstract": "Elite-athlete Karin was 17 years old when the considerably older team coach Selma became her girlfriend. Responding to calls to prevent harm and sexual abuse in sport, this study represents Karin's story, investigates how she makes sense of her coach–athlete sexual relationship, and analyses what can be learnt about consent. Although sexual consent is often the defining criterion of sexual abuse, consent is rarely explicitly defined or its social implications examined. Moreover, there are no studies on coach–athlete lesbian or gay relationships despite sexual minority vulnerability. The interview with Karin was analysed using narrative case study methods; represented as a short story and discussed in reference to sexual consent theory. The analysis outlines contextual factors conditioning the negotiation of consent and problematises heteronormative, gendered perpetrator and victim stereotypes. Secrecy, alienation and isolation is recognised, extending into additional vulnerability inflicted on socially problematic and atypical coach–athlete relationships. In conclusion, social implications of consent are more complex than yes/no to sex or inherent incapability to consent. Consent is multi-layered, alternately absent and present; an ongoing process that includes compromises, contradictions and (re)negotiations influenced by structure and agency. Further research examining a diversity of sexual experiences among majorities and minorities is proposed.",

Participants rated the men less masculine when cat persons than when dog persons or unlabeled, and less masculine and more feminine when gay than when anything else or unlabeled. The more masculine man received lower feminine ratings when a dog person than when a heterosexual, and higher masculine ratings when a dog person than when unlabeled. Labels did not affect likability. Overall, the gay label consistently promoted cross-gender attributions, the dog person label encouraged somewhat heightened gender-appropriate attributions, and the cat person label allowed for normative attributions.",

Women's emancipatory potential cannot be realized through accumulation of contrasting characteristics (e.g., emotionality vs. achievement orientation, etc.). The context of women's daily life in household, family, among friends and acquaintances and the professional work related to this sphere is usually not more closely analyzed, even though women (dissatisfied and protesting) clearly relate to this sphere and are oppressed by its everyday routine. The problems of the female role are neither made comprehensible nor explained sociologically through the contradictory structures of this sphere; rather, they are usually attributed to the specific socialization training process of the young female child, in which girls, as compared to boys, experience less encouragement to be independent, more parental care, less cognitive and social pressure to establish unique identities (independent of their mothers) and more hygienic training.",

      "abstract": "Discussions of sexual misconduct often focus primarily or exclusively on the parties directly involved in sexual behavior. As a result, the discussion generally centers on consent. While consent is critically important, this Article instead focuses on harms to third parties resulting from sexual behavior—regardless of whether that behavior is consensual. Doing so reveals a dynamic that the conversation about sexual misconduct has not yet fully acknowledged: the presence or absence of consent between participants does not determine whether third parties suffer harm. Sexual behavior does not occur in a vacuum. Rather, it occurs in a particular context and often has significant consequences for other individuals beyond the participants in the behavior.Sexual behavior is problematic when it involves what this Article will refer to as an institutional power disparity: that is, one participant has power over the other as a result of their institutional roles. Institutional power disparities are inherent, for example, in sexual behavior involving a supervisor and their subordinate or a professor and their student.Such behavior risks significant harm to third parties within the institution. Third parties may be injured as a result of sexual favoritism. For example, a worker may be passed over for a promotion in favor of a less qualified worker who is having sex with the boss. Or third parties may suffer harm from a sexualized institutional environment. For example, students may avoid professors who are known for pursuing sexual relationships with students or may find it alienating to be viewed as a professor’s prospective sexual partner. And the institution itself may suffer harm when sexual behavior involving an institutional power disparity interferes with worker productivity and morale, or with student learning and intellectual growth.Harm to third parties justifies regulation of sexual relationships in the context of an institutional power disparity. In some circumstances, such relationships should be prohibited so long as the institutional power disparity remains. In other circumstances, careful regulation can mitigate potential harms to third parties and to the institution itself.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Disorders of sex development (DSD) are relatively rare conditions with diverse pathophysiology, which usually present in the newborn or adolescent periods. These conditions are very heterogeneous and can present in a variety of different ways, most commonly with ambiguous genitalia noticed in the newborn period or delayed puberty in adolescents. The impact of these disorders on the lives of these patients and their families should not be underestimated. These clinical situations can often be difficult to manage, particularly in those cases where the sex of rearing is uncertain. The needs of each individual patient presenting with DSD conditions must be fully considered, along with the needs of their families and where appropriate, cultural practices. The multidisciplinary team should be involved from early in the diagnosis and ethical principles must be considered at all stages of management of the condition. Key Concepts: Disorders of sex development usually present in the newborn or adolescent periods. There are three broad groups of DSD: sex chromosome DSD; 46,XY DSD and 46,XX DSD. Where there is uncertainty about the sex of a patient, sex assignment should be delayed until appropriate investigations have been carried out. A multidisciplinary team should be involved from an early stage. The psychosocial implications of a diagnosis of DSD must be considered for the family and the patient.",

      "abstract": "Previous chapters have identified a number of social norms, discourses, or unwritten rules surrounding young people's sexuality that contribute to the persistence of Gen-Y women's experiences of pressured and unwanted sex. It is apparent that this implicit set of rules and the associated meanings attached to love and sex have specific implications for how young people feel able to negotiate consent and safe-sex practices. This remains the case even in online spaces where it has been suggested that gender norms may have less sway. The role of the love relationship for young women, in particular, as the acceptable context for expression of their sexuality, can be associated with pressure to engage in unwanted sex or in sex under unwanted circumstances (such as without the continued use of condoms, when a partner is drunk or drug-affected, or sending a sext message that may then be widely distributed by the receiver). Yet these social norms and gendered discourses are not straightforwardly reproduced or necessarily reflected upon by young people; rather, young people's negotiations of sexual consent reflect an embodied gendered practice: they engage with the field of sexual encounters according to the social rules adopted in their gendered habitus. While, according to Bourdieu, this process of social reproduction is not easily amenable to self-reflection and change, it is nonetheless subject to disruption, which might allow a more reflexive practice.",

Significant heritabilities were observed for a range of psychological and behavioural measures (orientation of present sexual feelings and fantasies, ever having been sexually attracted to a man, attitude to homosexual sex, number of male and female sexual partners), with approximately 42 to 60 per cent of observed variance estimated to be due to genetic influences in these variables.

      "title": "Sex differences in parental response to offspring begging are associated with pair bond strength across birds",
      "abstract": "Abstract Mothers, fathers, and offspring regularly clash over how much care offspring receive. Offspring beg to solicit for more resources—but how much begging is rewarded can depend on who is listening. While both parents benefit from provisioning offspring, each would benefit from their partner shouldering more of the burden of care, leading to sexual conflict. Additionally, if the costs and benefits of provisioning differ by sex, parent-offspring conflict should vary by sex. How these evolutionary conflicts influence sex differences in parent-offspring communication is unknown. To determine whether the sexes differ in their response to offspring signals, we conducted a meta-analysis on 30 bird species, comparing responsiveness to social and physiological traits affecting conflict. We found that a species’ typical pair bond strength predicts whether males or females respond more to offspring begging. In species with stable and/or monogamous bonds, and thus lower sexual and paternal-offspring conflict, males’ provisioning effort is more strongly correlated with offspring begging than females’. The opposite holds for species with weak pair bonds: females respond more to begging, perhaps compensating for males’ lower responsiveness. These results demonstrate that sex differences in parental care can arise via sex differences in parent-offspring communication, driven by evolutionary conflicts.",

These differing reproductive strategies are a function of their differing degrees of parental investment. It is reasonable to predict that variations in deviant and unfit strategies would differ between the sexes. That males are much more likely than females to utilize “unfit” sexual outlets is well known. Kinsey, et al. (1953) reported that the incidence of human females incapable of erotic arousal is much larger than that of males. That this “unfit” deviation is more common in females is consistent with their cautious reproductive strategy.",

Peneliti menggambarkan strategi komunikasi gay dalam mengungkapkan informasi privat berupa identitas seksualnya kepada orang lain.Penelitian ini menemukan keunikan strategi yang dilakukan gay dalam proses pengungkapannya. Pengungkapan pertama dilakukan kepada teman, bukan keluarga.Keluarga dipandang memiliki resiko penolakan yang lebih besar daripada teman, terutama tidak adanya pengakuan. Hal ini disebabkan oleh fungsi keluarga sebagai pusat afeksi atau kasih sayang dan rasa aman yang tidak dimiliki oleh institusi lain. Selain itu, dalam `pengungkapan kepada temannya, gay, baik dengan peran maskulin maupun feminin lebih memilih teman perempuan daripada laki-laki karena perempuan dengan femininitasnya dirasa lebih suportif secara emosional.Proses coming out gay dilakukan secara bertahap dan dipengaruhi oleh reaksi pertama yang diterimanya.\r\n \r\nKata kunci gay, heteronormativitas, Communication Privacy Management, identitas seksual, coming out",

      "title": "Dating App Use and Everyday Discrimination among Bisexual and Heterosexual Individuals",
      "abstract": "Mobile dating applications (“dating apps”) have become popular, particularly among sexual minority groups (e.g., lesbian, gay, bisexual, pansexual, and other sexual orientations), potentially due to limited opportunities to meet similar others offline. Experiences of discrimination in everyday life (i.e., not constrained to dating apps, such as being treated with less respect or courtesy than others based on membership in a particular group) are common among sexual minority groups, and this factor has received little empirical attention in relation to dating app use. In this secondary data analysis ( Lenton-Brym et al., 2021 ), data from 243 adults who completed online questionnaires about the extent of one’s dating app use were analyzed. Bisexual participants reported greater everyday discrimination overall compared to heterosexual participants. Frequency of everyday discrimination was positively associated with the extent of dating app use when controlling for age, gender, and race/ethnicity, but only for heterosexual and not bisexual individuals. Findings suggest that bisexual participants use dating apps regardless of discrimination experiences in everyday life, whereas heterosexual individuals are more likely to use dating apps with increased perceived discrimination, potentially due to other factors unrelated to sexual orientation, age, gender, and race/ethnicity, such as physical appearance. Seventeen percent of the variation in dating app use scores was explained by the statistical model. Further exploration of factors that contribute to one’s extent of dating app use is needed.",

      "abstract": "Considerable ambiguity surrounds both scientific and popular attempts to define the term “late‐life sexuality.” Agreement as to when “late life” begins increasingly has moved upward over the last century with the lengthening of the average life course in most industrial societies. Meanwhile, the term “sexuality” has come to connote a wide variety of human sociobiological responses that range from varying levels of social attraction or physiological arousal to intimate body contact that may or may not include physical penetration. The failure of research scientists to define what they mean by “sexuality,” “sexual behavior,” or “late life” when designing studies or publishing their results complicates attempts to compare research findings within older age groups and across societies and sociocultural environments. Still, at least five themes emerge as constant premises in the literature concerning sexual desire and activity in later life as defined by some form of mental and/or physical sexual response at age 50 or older.",

We know that recognition of the psychological sense of self as distant from the other is achieved in most infants during the second half of the first year of life. The child's dyadic relationship slowly merges into the oedipal triadic relationship with the parents by the end of the fourth year, ushering in a severely conflictual situation for children of both sexes. Curiosity about sexuality gives way, under reasonably adequate psychological conditions, to curiosity about the wider aspects of the world, a sublimation of a portion of sexual as well as aggressive wishes that continues into adult life unless inhibitions arise because of psychological conflicts that were insufficiently resolved during the pre-oedipal and oedipal periods.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Previous evidence shows that heterosexual people perceive heterosexual status to be more fragile than homosexual status. However, research has not yet investigated whether sexual minorities have similar, or diverging, perceptions of the fragility of sexual orientation. With a sample that included 89 heterosexual and 80 sexual minority participants, we investigated the fragility of heterosexuality using a between-participants design in which participants indicated their agreement with gender neutral statements about the fragility of either heterosexual or homosexual status. Contrary to our expectations we found evidence of Fragile Heterosexuality perceptions regardless of participants’ sexual orientation. Additionally, we explored the potential moderating effects of social-dominance orientation, right-wing authoritarianism and prejudice against gay/lesbian people on this Fragile Heterosexuality effect. For sexual minority participants, high levels of social dominance orientation moderated (i.e., increased) the perceived fragility of heterosexual identity relative to homosexual identity. No other inter-group ideology was a significant moderator. These findings highlight that heterosexuality is perceived as more fragile by both heterosexual and sexual minority individuals. Implications and possible avenues for future research are discussed.",

      "title": "Lust, trust and latex: Why young heterosexual men do not use condoms",
      "abstract": "This paper examines young heterosexual men's participation in unsafe sex. A qualitative study of young heterosexual Australian men's understandings and practices of safe and unsafe sex, involving in-depth interviews conducted with 17 men aged between 18 and 26, found that five principal themes recur in young men's accounts for the non-use of condoms. First, men stress the risk of pregnancy rather than the risks of HIV or other sexually transmitted infections, and they respond to the former risk by relying on their partners' use of the contraceptive pill. Second, men perceive that wearing condoms decreases penile sensation and that condoms are difficult to use. Third, men find that the 'heat of the moment' of sexual episodes, and their spontaneous and passionate ambience, makes it hard to incorporate condoms. Fourth, men privilege 'trust' as fundamental to their sexual involvements, and quickly define involvements as 'relationships' and therefore as trusting and monogamous, such that they abandon condoms. Fifth, men believe that they are very unlikely to contract HIV because they see their social circles, the 'heterosexual community' or heterosexual sex per se as safe and free of HIV/AIDS. Future education and prevention efforts directed at the heterosexual sexual transmission of HIV should address such configurations of sociosexual meaning and practice in men's lives. Cet article examine la participation des jeunes hommes hétérosexuels à des rapports sexuels hétérosexuels à risque. Une étude qualitative des compréhensions et des pratiques des rapports sexuels protégés et à risque par des jeunes hétérosexuels australiens, comprenant des entretiens en profondeur avec dix-sept hommes âgés de 18 à 26 ans, montre que cinq thèmes majeurs sont récurrents dans les discours de ces hommes sur la non utilisation du préservatif. Premièrement, les participants mettent plus en avant les risques de grossesse que ceux de la transmission du VIH ou d'autres MST, et ils y trouvent une solution en comptant sur l'utilisation de pilules contraceptives par leurs partenaires. Deuxièmement, ils perçoivent le préservatif comme pouvant réduire les sensations au niveau du pénis et comme quelque chose de difficile à utiliser. Troisièmement, ils trouvent que e le feu de l'action f des rapports sexuels, la spontanéité et la passion qui en découlent, ne se prêtent pas très facilement à l'utilisation du préservatif. Quatrièmement, ils considèrent e la confiance f comme fondamentale à leurs engagements sexuels et, rapidement, définissent ces engagements comme des e relations suivies f , alors basées sur la confiance et monogames, leur permettant d'abandonner le préservatif. Cinquièmement, ils croient très peu probable leur contamination par le VIH parce qu'ils considèrent leurs cercles sociaux, la e communauté hétérosexuelle f ou les rapports sexuels hétérosexuels, comme intrinsèquement protégés du VIH/sida. Les stratégies d'éducation et de prévention contre la transmission hétérosexuelle du VIH doivent prendre en considération ces configurations sociales et sexuelles existant dans la vie des hommes. En este documento se analizan los comportamientos de riesgo de jóvenes heterosexuales en sus relaciones sexuales. Un estudio cualitativo sobre los conceptos y prácticas de sexo seguro y de riesgo de jóvenes heterosexuales de Australia que incluyó entrevistas en profundidad a diecisiete hombres entre los 18 y 26 años de edad, encontró cinco razones principales que los hombres mencionaron para no usar preservativos. En primer lugar, recalcaron que existía más riesgo de embarazo que de contagio del virus del SIDA u otras enfermedades de transmisión sexual, y en cuanto al riesgo de embarazo respondieron que confiaban en que sus compañeras tomaran la píldora. En segundo lugar, manifestaron que utilizar preservativos disminuía la sensibilidad en el pene y que era difícil utilizarlos. En tercer lugar, según ellos el 'calor del momento' en los episodios sexuales y su ambiente de espontaneidad y pasión hacía difícil el uso de condones. En cuarto lugar, para los hombres la confianza era un factor fundamental en las relaciones sexuales, que en seguida definían como 'relaciones serías' y, por lo tanto, monógamas y de confianza, lo que hacia que ignorasen el uso del preservativo. En quinto lugar, los hombres están convencidos de que no pueden contagiarse de VIH porque consideran a su círculo social, la 'comunidad heterosexual' y a las relaciones heterosexuales per se como segura, es decir, sin el peligro de VIH/SIDA. En el futuro, la educación y la prevención de la transmisión heterosexual del VIH deberá abordar tales configuraciones del significado y la práctica sociosexual en la vida de los hombres.",

These include: attitudes toward the treatment of animals, attachment to pets, involvement in animal protectionism, animal hoarding, hunting, animal abuse, and bestiality. Women, on average, show higher levels of positive behaviors and attitudes toward animals (e.g., attitudes towards their use, involvement in animal protection), whereas men typically have higher levels of negative attitudes and behaviors (e.g., hunting, animal abuse, less favorable attitudes toward animal protection). The effect sizes of gender differences range from small (e.g., attachment), to medium size (e.g., attitudes toward animal use) to large (e.g., animal rights activism, animal abuse by adults.) In most areas, there is considerable overlap between men and women, with much greater within-sex than between-sex variation. Research on the roles of gender in human–animal relationships is hindered by the omission in many reports of gender difference effect sizes and basic descriptive statistics.",

Equivalent beliefs about heterosexuality and beliefs about components of sexuality have been less often researched. 136 people with diverse sexualities described heterosexuality as more universal across history and culture than homosexuality (Study 1). 69 heterosexual-identified participants similarly believed that love, identity, behavior, and desire were more historically invariant aspects of heterosexuality than of homosexuality (Study 2). Less prejudiced participants thought all components of homosexuality--except for identity--were more historically invariant. Teasing apart beliefs about the history of components of heterosexuality and homosexuality suggests that there is no \"essential\" relationship between sexual prejudice and the tension between essentialist and constructivist views about the history of sexual identity.",

Dennoch finden sich auch einige Besonderheiten in sexuellem Erleben und Verhalten bei Menschen mit einer Autismus-Spektrum-Störung, die größtenteils auf die störungsspezifischen Symptome zurückzuführen sind. Hierzu zählen eine höhere Diversität bezüglich der eigenen sexuellen Orientierung sowie des eigenen Geschlechtsrollenverständnisses, aber auch Probleme im Hinblick auf das Eingehen von festen Partnerschaften oder im Hinblick auf die eigene sexuelle Funktionsfähigkeit. Darüber hinaus finden sich bei manchen Personen mit einer Autismus-Spektrum-Störung (insbesondere bei Männern) Hinweise auf das Vorliegen hypersexueller Verhaltensweisen sowie paraphiler sexueller Fantasien und Verhaltensweisen. Bisher existieren keine empirischen Befunde, die nahelegen, dass eine Autismus-Spektrum-Störung einen Risikofaktor für allgemeine oder sexuelle Straffälligkeit darstellt. Basierend auf Fallstudien wurden jedoch einige Erklärungsansätze publiziert, die beschreiben, wie in einigen wenigen Fällen die autismusspezifische Symptomatik mit zu der Begehung einer Straftat beigetragen haben könnte, was auch bei der Schuldfähigkeitsbegutachtung Berücksichtigung finden könnte. Hierzu zählen eine fehlende Opferempathie, das Vorliegen kognitiver Verzerrungen oder defizitäre Kommunikations- und Interaktionsfertigkeiten. Straftäter mit einer Autismus-Spektrum-Störung sollten individuell auf sie zugeschnittenen psycho- und pharmakotherapeutischen Interventionen zugeführt werden, um eine erneute Straffälligkeit im besten Falle zu verhindern.",

      "title": "Social interactions in different environments impacts and motivates reproductive displays in college students",
      "abstract": "Social environments can have an impact on the interactions between the sexes, specifically pre-courtship behaviors. Sexual selection theory may explain social interactions of the sexes, where males display and attract mates more than females. These behaviors may intensify in a sexual environment. It was hypothesized that individuals would display more in a sexualized environment compared to a non-sexualized location. This research sampled N = 880 participants at a university in a southern state in North America and asked which unisex sunglasses they preferred. While the most popular non-showy sunglasses were selected the most, showy new arrival sunglasses were selected more often when the surveyor's behavior was flirty, compared to normal behavior and dressing sexy. Thus, social interactions such as flirting between the sexes impacted the behaviors of others and increased the intensity of reproductive displays. At the location with sexualized behaviors and dress, individuals selected the non-showy sunglasses, possibly to draw attention to their bodies in swimsuits, whereas at the non-sexy location, new arrivals were chosen at a higher frequency, possibly to stand out when wearing normal clothes. The sexes chose to stand out at equal frequencies as did single participants and people in a relationship, suggesting that all individuals are trying to display and attract mates equally. Social environments impacted display behaviors and the motivation to display is discussed.",

No sex differences could be found in regard to role attribution. Sings of sex-specific role perception could not be shown amongst the couples being part of the domestic proceedings. Sex-specific differences in regard to the image as perceived by the other parent do not exist any more. The exact complementary role of ones own role-perception is being attributed to the former partner. The role-characteristics attributed to the former partner can be described as dominant, under-controlled, hypomanic, and inaccessible.

The psychological formation of gender in the three generations has affinity to the psychoanalytic theories on gender and development that were conceived around the time of their childhoods. This indicates that it is not only the theories that have changed, but also the gendered psychologies they set out to describe. However, there are also more sluggish elements in the gendered psychologies over these three generations: mothers are taken more for granted than fathers and gender polarity seems to be more psychologically important for men than for women.",

      "abstract": "A variety of non-human females do not select male partners independently. Instead they favor males having previous associations with other females, a phenom- enon known as mate copying. This paper investigates whether humans also exhibit mate copying and whether consistent positive information about a man' sm ate value, and a woman's age and self-perceived mate value (SPMV), influence her tendency to copy the mate choices of others. Female university students (N=123) rated the desir- ability of photographed men pictured alone or with one, two, or five women represent- ed by silhouettes. In accordance with the visual arrays, men were described as currently in a romantic relationship; having previously been in one, two, or five relationships; or not having had a romantic relationship in the past 4 years. Women generally rated men pictured with one or two previous partners as more desirable than those with none. Men depicted with five previous partners, however, were found to be less desirable. Younger, presumably less experienced women had a greater tendency to mate copy compared with older women, but high SPMV did not predict greater levels of mate copying. The findings reaffirmed and expanded those suggesting that women do not make mate choices independently.",

      "title": "Is It Bad to Prefer Attractive Partners?",
      "abstract": "Abstract Philosophers have rightly condemned lookism—that is, discrimination in favor of attractive people or against unattractive people—in education, the justice system, the workplace, and elsewhere. Surprisingly, however, the almost universal preference for attractive romantic and sexual partners has rarely received serious ethical scrutiny. On its face, it is unclear whether this is a form of discrimination we should reject or tolerate. I consider arguments for both views. On the one hand, a strong case can be made that preferring attractive partners is bad. The idea is that choosing partners based on looks seems essentially similar to other objectionable forms of discrimination. (In particular, the preference for attractive partners is arguably both unfair and harmful to a significant degree.) One can try to resist this conclusion in several ways. I consider three possible replies. The first has to do with the possibility of controlling our partner preferences. The second pertains to attractiveness and ‘good genes’. The last attempts to link certain aspects of attractiveness to a prospective partner's personality and values. I argue that the first two replies fail conclusively, while the third only amounts to a limited defense of a particular kind of attractiveness preference. The idea that we should often avoid preferring attractive partners is thus compelling.",

To examine the relationship between gender, gender roles, and attitudes towards violence, 161 individuals were administered the Bem Sex Role Inventory and a violence questionnaire. It was hypothesized that a significant number of non-androgynous people would have a great predisposition towards violence. The mean violence score was higher for men than for women, however, there was no difference between androgynous individuals and others. There were no significant interaction effects. Results are surprising when compared to previous research. It may be that more and more people, regardless of their interpersonal style, are moving towards a view which does not condone violence.",

      "title": "Do Female Sex Fantasies Reflect Adaptations for Sperm Competition?",
      "abstract": "Researchers have suggested that female strategies for sexual selection in humans include the promotion of sperm competition. Sperm competition entails the simultaneous presence of fertile sperm from at least two males in the female's reproductive organ competing for the opportunity to fertilise the ovum. Certain behaviour patterns near ovulation may enable such competition. In this paper, we describe relative preferences for female sexual fantasy types and explore the idea that these preferences may help us understand the settings and mechanisms that promote sperm competition, and discourage interfemale competition. To expand this exploration, we also examine whether preferences vary with respect to the menstrual cycle. Our preliminary findings indicate notable preferences among females for multiple male-partner fantasies over multiple female-partner fantasies or fantasies that include multiple male and female partners. This suggests that females find multipartner settings as arousing as males do, but the psychological mechanism relating to settings that include the presence of same sex competitors may differ from that of males. We also discovered some indications that the female preference for promoting sperm competition and avoiding interfemale competition is the highest and strongest near ovulation.",

      "title": "Models of Sibling Relations in Tales by the Brothers Grimm",
      "abstract": "Based on a formal analysis of Grimm’s tales, this paper proposes four typical models of the structure of the sibling group: (1) model of the type (1) + (1), or (1 + 1) + 1 or (xn) + 1. The sibling group is formed of rival subsets. The opposition between the siblings stems from a struggle to obtain the father’s recognition (in the case of brothers) or the mother’s love (in the case of sisters), or integration in the clan of brothers (or sisters) in the case of the model of the type (xn) + 1; (2) model of the type (1 + 1) or (1 + 1 + 1) or (1 + 1 + 1 + 1). The sibling group is united and based on mutual assistance. The group’s solidarity rests on the rejection and mistrust of an adult who is considered as holding absolute power and to have stolen the father or the mother’s love; (3) model of the type 1 = 1, which only pertains to twins. The sibling group is based on identity and a mirror relationship. Here, the identity of form is predominant: the sibling relationship is not constructed, but is part of the natural order; (4) model of the type (1n), or the model of the only child, who has to face the parents’ deception, which stems from the gap between the imaginary child and the real child. The only child is particularly vulnerable to incestuous or symbolic desire for one of the parents in cases where the other parent is not able to play the role of a third party.",

Changing sleep in teens results in their not becoming tired until 11 : 00 in the evening despite the fact that they have to get up approximately five to six hours later. Therefore, from a general perspective-by virtue of not being tired due to hard wired developmental changes in their sleep-all teenagers are boxed in by not being tired until later evening hours yet having to get up even earlier than they did in junior high years. Their sleep is limited by a lack of tiredness and society demands of school start times, automatically resulting in unfulfilled sleep needs and building sleep deprivation.",

Young boys did not engage in more rough‐and‐tumble play than girls, but adolescent boys participated in this type of play more than adolescent girls. Children were also more likely to participate in work‐themed play which conformed to gender norms within their society.

Availability of family and/or friends as a source of support was found to be most important for satisfactory coping. Loneliness, isolation, loss of former friendships, and ostracism by former intimate friends were some of the perceptions of the widows. Sexual problems, especially frustration, were evident among many widows. Adaptation to sexual frustration included sexual affairs with men who would not ordinarily be considered a partner, such as the married or one's physician. All widows reported that the sexual relationship was salubrious, which has implications for counselors and therapists comforting the widowed or providing death education. Each widow's individual personality and life events affected coping. Increased mental and physical ailments after the death of their spouse, especially in the first year of bereavement were reported by 15 of the 18 widows.",

During adaptation, both at stable, and at unstable families the mismatch of requirements for certain spheres of family life takes place: at stable couples it insignificant, at unstable considerable. This insignificant divergence at stable couples gives them opportunity of gradual development and improvement of the relations. Young families are very unstable educations, feelings to the spouse bear both powerful positive, and a negative charge (ambivalence of feelings is great). For many families extremes in behaviour and in feelings are also characteristic. Constant life near other person inevitably leads to accumulation of disagreements, tantrums and the conflicts. All couples face troubles in the course of marriage: all happens sometimes painfully, sometimes people are disappointed and don't understand each other. The love cools down, dies away or disappears; about it forget, in its revival any more don't believe. Without love the happiness of family life, satisfaction with marriage disappears. In case of a conscious dissatisfaction there is usually open recognition by the spouse of that the family relations don't satisfy it. The instruction on global character of a dissatisfaction that family life doesn't conform even to the most minimum requirements thus is indicative. The conscious dissatisfaction is quite often accompanied by the conflict between spouses. Otherwise «the smoldering dissatisfaction» acts. The spouse expresses relative satisfaction with family life. The true dissatisfaction comes to light an indirect way. First, through expression of feelings and states: monotony, boredom, dullness of life. Secondly, the dissatisfaction appears in numerous complaints to various private parties of family life. The dissatisfaction, quarrels, the conflicts inevitably lead changes in behaviour, character and attitude of spouses. Thus, the considered features of a modern matrimony and family relationship show a wide palette of the determinant, defining matrimonial satisfaction with marriage both providing formation and development of intra family relationship and influence on vital style of the child in a family. The psychologist participates in inspection addressed in the health Center within complex screening inspection, applying a hardware-software complex for screening assessment of level of psycho physiological and somatic health, functional and adaptive reserves of an organism with a set of the equipment for measurement of parameters of physical development which includes: personal computer; complex software. Within complex inspection research of married couples on a technique «LSI questionnaire (an index of vital style)» is conducted. The obtained data allowed to draw a conclusion on inability of a modern family to provide realization of satisfaction of vital style in a modern family.",

There is a strong desire for presenting a desirable image of themselves to other people, accompanied by considerable uncertainty that it can be done. Harmonious and deep relationships with family members, friends and romantic partners are very important for every person, but for socially anxious people they are a source of stress. A number of studies have shown that social anxiety disrupts interpersonal relationships. On the one hand, socially anxious, like most people, want social acceptance and intimacy and they have a desire to achieve satisfying relationships with other people. But, on the other hand, their beliefs and strategies prevent them from participating in social encounters and the disaffiliation makes them lonely and depressed. Their inhibitory and avoiding behaviors have negative consequences for developing and maintaining close relationships. Socially anxious people have strong conflict between need for affiliation and need for avoidance other people. Studies have also shown that although socially anxious people are characterized by an avoidant style of interaction there is evidence that they also develop a dependent interpersonal style.",

      "title": "Associations Between Father Absence and Age of First Sexual Intercourse",
      "abstract": "Children raised without a biological father in the household have earlier average ages of first sexual intercourse than children raised in father‐present households. Competing theoretical perspectives have attributed this either to effects of father absence on socialization and physical maturation or to nonrandom selection of children predisposed for early sexual intercourse into father‐absent households. Genetically informative analyses of the children of sister dyads ( N = 1,382, aged 14–21 years) support the selection hypothesis: This association seems attributable to confounded risks, most likely genetic in origin, which correlated both with likelihood of father absence and early sexual behavior. This holds implications for environmental theories of maturation and suggests that previous research may have inadvertently overestimated the role of family structure in reproductive maturation.",

Retrospective studies have also shown large differences in childhood gender nonconformity, but these studies have been criticized for possible memory biases. The authors studied an indicator of childhood gender nonconformity not subject to such biases: childhood home videos. They recruited homosexual and heterosexual men and women (targets) with videos from their childhood and subsequently asked heterosexual and homosexual raters to judge the gender nonconformity of the targets from both the childhood videos and adult videos made for the study. Prehomosexual children were judged more gender nonconforming, on average, than preheterosexual children, and this pattern obtained for both men and women. This difference emerged early, carried into adulthood, and was consistent with self-report. In addition, targets who were more gender nonconforming tended to recall more childhood rejection.",

The intensity of the child's wish is as though the choice were between gold and lead-or even between life and death, yet an analysis of the choice shows that nothing so objective is involved But this does not mean that the choice is simply spiteful or capricious The highly rational parent may view the choice as such, however, and will be further appalled to find that the reasons which the child gives, upon demand, seem absurd. But the child shows that he really means it when he says he wants X instead of Y and the sensitive adult may get enough alarmed either to gratify or appease the child, hoping, by this concession to irrationality, that he can still eventually make the child a sensible human being like himself It seems in such cases that the child has meaningful reactions yet is unable to communicate his meaning even to the grown-ups who love him most The psychologist, on the other hand, will make more of an attempt to infer the meaning of the child's values He will point out that getting pop-corn and avoiding root-beer have nothing whatever to do with the socially established values of pop-corn and root-beer, but that, for some cause of previous association or identification, pop-corn may signify security, love, or attention while rootbeer may mean rejection, reluctance, or indifference. Of course these abstract psychological words are for the parent's benefit and would not designate anything to the child Pop-corn, for the child, may only remind him of the day he went to Playland with Daddy-who ignores him so much of the time. Even the psychologist, without an intimate knowledge of the child's history, would be at a loss to determine the specific importance which the child gives to pop-corn But it would still seem that pop-corn, originally provided by Daddy at Playland, has become a symbolic instrument for recapturing the experiences of excite-",

It is expressed in differential beliefs about virginity the context of sexual behavior and motivation to use contraception. Institutional and social-cultural standards have tended to discourage male participation and devalue the male role in family planning decisions. Despite this methods used by males account for nearly half of teenage contraceptive use. Recent research indicates that males are attitudinally more traditional than females in terms of sex roles. In areas pertaining to family division of labor and child care males continue to hold a more sex-typed view than females. Most teenagers do not talk about contraception with their partners and many males may not be worried enough about the possibility of pregnancy to use contraception. Efforts should be made to increase males concern and increase responsibility as a necessary part of a nonexploitative relationship.",

Responsible behavior does show significant sex differences in the six culture samples, but does in recent observational studies in Kenya. The crucial variable seems to be economic; in societies with animal husbandry or agricultural work that can be assigned to boys, there are sex differences in amount of work required of girls and boys after 7-8 years of age. When one contrasts the mean proportion scores of the boys, girls, the magnitude of the sex differences is smaller than in any of the six societies with the exception of Orchard Town. Females are frequently characterized as more dependent, passive, compliant, nurturant, responsible, sociable than males, who in turn are characterized as more dominant, aggressive, active.",

En effet, la production de l’ejaculat (sperme et substances non gametiques) peuvent generer des couts energetiques substantiels, voire etre limites au cours de la vie des mâles. Par ailleurs, les traits impliques dans l’attraction des femelles ou la competition entre mâles rivaux peuvent egalement etre lies a d’importantes depenses energetiques et/ou des risques de dommages physiques. Enfin, la selection sexuelle post-ejaculat (competition spermatique et choix femelle cryptique) peut fortement affecter leurs chances de paternite. Sous ces conditions, il est attendu que les mâles allouent strategiquement leurs ressources reproductives au regard (i) des opportunites d’accouplement presentes et futures, (ii) de la qualite reproductive de la femelle et (iii) du risque et/ou de l’intensite de la competition spermatique. Toutefois, la nature des allocations strategiques chez les mâles et les contraintes qui influencent leur evolution restent encore mal comprises, en particulier parce que les interactions potentielles entre selection sexuelle pre- et post-copulatoire peuvent soumettre les mâles a des episodes selectifs plus complexes que ceux existants chez les femelles.",

In this paper some of the basic assumptions that can be drawn from famous Trivers' theory of parental investment and sexual selection are tested on a Croatian sample. The theory predicts sex differences when it comes to choosing a mate due to different parental investment in offspring. Females are expected to be choosier than males and to seek a reliable partner who has the resources and is willing to invest them in potential offspring (in order to increase their survival), while males should mostly seek a healthy and reproductively capable partner. The basic assumptions derived from the theory received empirical support: men seek short-term mates more than women do ; sex differences were found in rankings of desirability of certain characteristics of a potential mate, as well as in his/her preferred age ; more men than women would express sexual vs. emotional jealousy.",

      "abstract": "Introduction This study examined how certain sports are represented as masculine or feminine in Saudi adolescents, namely, which sports adolescents associate with males and which sports they associate with females. Previous research aligned with this concern was conducted within Western culture; however, there is a need to shed light on how the issues of social representation of masculine and feminine sports affect other cultures such as Middle Eastern cultures. Methods A survey was completed by 280 Saudi adolescents, aged between 12 and 17 ( M = 13.5, SD = 1.3). The survey contained open-ended recall questions that asked participants to name three masculine, feminine, and natural sports. Results Most participants were familiar with using feminine and masculine terminology to describe sports, and nearly half had personally used gendered terms to describe sports. Overall, the participants generated 2,195 names of various sports, with the majority classified as natural (appropriate for both men and women), many masculine, and the fewest feminine. Discussion The connection between specific sports and masculinity or femininity can restrict the activities of adolescents who do not conform to traditional gender roles. Also, adolescents who are interested in sports that are not typically associated with their gender may experience social stigma or exclusion, which can discourage their participation. Therefore, it is important to establish inclusive environments in sports, regardless of the gender.",

      "abstract": "BackgroundAlthough humans experience orgasms with a degree of statistical regularity, they remain among the most enigmatic of sexual responses; difficult to define and even more difficult to study empirically. The question of whether animals experience orgasms is hampered by similar lack of definition and the additional necessity of making inferences from behavioral responses.MethodHere we define three behavioral criteria, based on dimensions of the subjective experience of human orgasms described by Mah and Binik, to infer orgasm-like responses (OLRs) in other species: 1) physiological criteria that include pelvic floor and anal muscle contractions that stimulate seminal emission and/or ejaculation in the male, or that stimulate uterine and cervical contractions in the female; 2) short-term behavioral changes that reflect immediate awareness of a pleasurable hedonic reward state during copulation; and 3) long-term behavioral changes that depend on the reward state induced by the OLR, including sexual satiety, the strengthening of patterns of sexual arousal and desire in subsequent copulations, and the generation of conditioned place and partner preferences for contextual and partner-related cues associated with the reward state. We then examine whether physiological and behavioral data from observations of male and female rats during copulation, and in sexually-conditioned place- and partner-preference paradigms, are consistent with these criteria.ResultsBoth male and female rats display behavioral patterns consistent with OLRs.ConclusionsThe ability to infer OLRs in rats offers new possibilities to study the phenomenon in neurobiological and molecular detail, and to provide both comparative and translational perspectives that would be useful for both basic and clinical research.",

      "abstract": "The outcome of any intelligence test may be regarded as con ditioned by a series of factors, such as age, sex, native ability, school training, practice, and race. Of these factors, comparatively little attention has been paid to sex, perhaps because the sex difference was regarded as of little magnitude or of little practical import. In the classifications of pupils, for example, the scores of either sex have been, doubtless quite properly, compared with the single standard score for the age or grade in question, which has been itself derived from the scores obtained by hundreds of children of both sexes combined, to furnish the standard age score or the standard grade score. Most investigators, however, have been aware of the existence of a small sex difference, and this difference has at least an aca demic interest when it is considered in its possible theoretical rela tions to the rate of physical and mental maturity of the two sexes during childhood and adolescence. Moreover, it possesses still greater interest when the direction of the sex difference is discovered to be reversed in the secondary school. It seems worth while, there fore, to assemble pertinent facts concerning the sex differences in elementary-school scores and then to compare this situation with that revealed in the high school. In this paper, accordingly, I shall present facts concerning two well-known intelligence tests designed for elementary-school use, namely, the National Intelli gence Test, Scale A, and the Illinois General Intelligence Scale. Subsequently, I shall present facts concerning sex differences dis covered by the use of Army Alpha in the high school.",

However, a large proportion of child sexual abuse victims do not go on to sexually offend, and such individuals are labeled as resilient victims. Surprisingly few studies have looked at why some male victims of sexual abuse do not go on to offend. In-depth qualitative interviews were conducted with 47 resilient men focusing on their beliefs as to why they had not gone on to sexually abuse others. Results revealed four themes for why the victims did not offend: empathy, morals, lack of sexual desire, or a combination of the previous three. In regard to the process of developing their resiliency, some participants claimed they made a conscious decision, whereas others reported the decision was an unconscious one. The various factors that were reported as contributing to the conscious or unconscious decision (becoming aware of sexual abuse, admitting the experience had happened to them, empathy, social support, and lack of sexual desire to abuse) are discussed, along with the four themes, and the implication of these results for prevention. Finally, conclusions are drawn that the victim–offender pathway is far from inevitable as most participants stated their reason for not offending was directly related to their own experience of sexual abuse victimisation.",

Thus, in one of the key contemporary representations of male commitment-phobia, the relationship between Chandler and Janice on Friends , our sympathetic horror derives not from Chandler's having been encompassed by Janice's body but by her postcoital laugh. To surrender, by surrendering to the feminizing procedure of commitment, one's contempt for women; to put oneself in the position where one had no choice but to put up with such a laugh—worse, perhaps, to feel compelled to excuse such a laugh among one's friends: such would be the anxious hypothesis of a heterosexual body magnetized toward feminization, but just as strongly defended from it.",

Death narratives were almost nonexistent in children under five-and-one-half years of age, but the majority of children who were six or older spontaneously produced narratives about death. Children under nine years of age discuss death as a dramatic event to be told like a television story plot; there is no affective reaction to the deaths of strangers, pets, or relatives. With one exception, only the nine year old children indicated emotional reactions to a death, or their affection for the deceased. This contrast suggests that younger children have difficulty coping with death in emotional terms, and suppress or deny their affective reactions to it. Additionally, three children talked about the death of a parent; none produced narratives with evaluation and affective reactions to these deaths. These children denied the parent's death as well, by talking of the deceased parent as if he or she were still alive in other narratives. The possibility of a “distance phenomenon” in children's ability to cope with death emotionally as the victims become closer to the child is suggested.",

      "abstract": "Male mate choice might be based on both absolute and relative strategies. Cues of female attractiveness are thus likely to reflect both fitness and reproductive potential, as well as compatibility with particular male phenotypes. In humans, absolute clues of fertility and indices of favorable developmental stability are generally associated with increased women's attractiveness. However, why men exhibit variable preferences remains less studied. Male mate choice might be influenced by uncertainty of paternity, a selective factor in species where the survival of the offspring depends on postnatal paternal care. For instance, in humans, a man might prefer a woman with recessive traits, thereby increasing the probability that his paternal traits will be visible in the child and ensuring paternity. Alternatively, attractiveness is hypothesized to be driven by self-resembling features (homogamy), which would reduce outbreeding depression. These hypotheses have been simultaneously evaluated for various facial traits using both real and artificial facial stimuli. The predicted preferences were then compared to realized mate choices using facial pictures from couples with at least 1 child. No evidence was found to support the paternity uncertainty hypothesis, as recessive features were not preferred by male raters. Conversely, preferences for self-resembling mates were found for several facial traits (hair and eye color, chin dimple, and thickness of lips and eyebrows). Moreover, realized homogamy for facial traits was also found in a sample of long-term mates. The advantages of homogamy in evolutionary terms are discussed.",

      "abstract": "This article is written to help prosecutors as well as defense counsel gain more knowledge of the science relevant to child sex abuse allegations. Increased knowledge reduces professionals' doubts about handling these enormously complex cases, and the greater confidence moves these professionals just a little way toward certainty. The behavioral sciences can assist legal professionals in their efforts to determine the validity of a given child sex abuse (CSA) allegation. To provide some information from those fields, the author reviewed the pertinent literature. Some findings emerged: 1) clinicians' judgments about the veridicality of unconfirmed CSA allegations may well lack a firm scientific basis; 2) no psychological test or method reliably indicates whether a child has been sexually mistreated, or whether someone has committed an act of abuse; 3) children do sometimes falsely accuse; 4) the concepts of “memory repression” and “recovered memory” are not scientifically substantiated; 5) medical evaluations are often inadequate to determine the presence or absence of sex abuse; 6) the most reliable indicator of sexual mistreatment is often not the physical examination, but rather the child's own report; 7) certain features of the child's account suggest that the accusation is valid. It is concluded that conducting such interviews is of paramount importance; suggestions are made to improve these interviews' quality.",

On the other side, sexuality can be maintained up to high age. In any case is the demand for affection, tenderness, love and sexual relations nearly always present, and its realization should not be inhibited. The sexual reactions are decreased and retarded. Therefore often a change of the role and behaviour pattern of the partners is necessary in the sexual contact. The partners should know their mutual problems and desires, show understanding and should adjust to each other. Counselling, behaviour therapy and treatment with sexual hormones can help to solve the problems.",

      "abstract": "Pregnancy is one of the most critical periods of women life which can make physical, mental and behavioral changes.These physical and psychological changes may also lead to changes in sexual and marital relations of couples (1, 2).Conflicts and challenges of couples associated with pregnancy and multiple physical and psychological changes during pregnancy reduce quality of the sexual relation (3,4).During pregnancy and even months after childbirth, desire for sexual activity decreases and rate of sexual dysfunctions compared to pre-pregnancy increases.This can cause emergence of considerable turmoil in relations between spouses (5).Couple's relationship quality during pregnancy is largely influenced by their sexual relations and specific set of beliefs and opinions that have been exist around the world which know no borders (6).As the pregnant women report lower levels of sexual desire and sexual intimacy comparing with non-pregnant women (3), stressful physical, emotional and financial factors resulting from pregnancy may have a negative effect on the emotional and sexual intimacy.Attitudes and sexual behaviors during pregnancy are affected by sexual value systems, indigenous culture, traditional and religious beliefs (7).Some of the beliefs such as change of mental image of one's own body (body image), discarding the sexual activity and feeling guilty about sexual relations during pregnancy, decreased feeling about being attractive to the husband, fear of harming the fetus, fear of miscarriage and preterm delivery, etc may have negative effect on the individual sexual response and finally on the relationship of couples, that it cause anxiety and lack of confidence of them (8-10).About 86% to 100% of couples keep their sexual activity during pregnancy; most of women show decreased sexual desire and frequency of sexual intercourse as the pregnancy is progressed (11).Although sexual desire, performance and satisfaction of pregnant women and husbands are unpredictable and may increase, decrease or remain unchanged during pregnancy (7,12), Fok et al showed that more than 60% of women and 40% of their spouse experienced decrease sexual desire and arousal during pregnancy, and more than 80% of women and their spouse were concerned about harmfulness of sexual activity on the fetus (13).Although continued sexual activity during pregnancy, without proper principles, lead to complications for mother and fetus, medical science has not placed restrictions on sexual activity in a healthy pregnancy and the balanced sexual relationship can be continued during pregnancy apart from high-risk groups (14).Results of meta-analy-",

The only statistically significant racial difference is that Asian children score slightly worse than those of other races. To the extent that there are any genetically-driven racial differences in intelligence, these gaps must either emerge after the age of one, or operate along dimensions not captured by this early test of mental cognition.",

The purpose of this study was to understand what behaviors are typically considered to be masturbation as well as the situational and individual variables that may affect the labeling of a behavior as such. An online study of 564 individuals demonstrated that a wide variety of behaviors were considered to be masturbation by a majority of participants. No difference was found between men and women in the total number of behaviors labeled as masturbation. Both men and women were more likely to label a behavior as masturbation (1) if there was no sexual partner present than if there was and (2) if an orgasm occurred than if it did not. In addition, women were more likely than men to label a behavior as masturbation if they were alone and if no orgasm occurred. Younger age was associated with labeling more behaviors as masturbation, but sexual identity, self-pleasuring experience, partnered sexual experience, and attitudes toward masturbation were not related to the number of behaviors labeled as masturbation. Results speak to the importance of behavioral specificity when discussing masturbation with students, clients, and in sex research.",

      "abstract": "Childhood sexual abuse has been consistently associated with suicidal behavior. We studied suicide attempt features in depressed individuals sexually abused as children. On average, sexual abuse started before age 9. It frequently coexisted with physical abuse. Suicide attempters more often had personality disorders and had endured abuse for longer, but did not differ in terms of other clinical characteristics from non‐attempters. Earlier onset of sexual abuse and its duration were associated with more suicide attempts. However, when personality disorders were included in the regression model, only these disorders predicted number of attempts. The severity of sexual abuse and the coexistence of physical abuse were correlated with age at first suicide attempt. However, only severity of sexual abuse was marginally associated with age at first suicide attempt in the regression model. Finally, the earlier the age of onset of sexual abuse, the higher the intent, even after controlling for age, sex and personality disorders. This suggests that the characteristics of childhood sexual abuse, especially age of onset, should be considered when studying the risk for suicidal behavior in abused populations.",

But what if this element were removed? The current research tested the hypothesis that women engage in more comfortable and intimate interactions with a gay (but not a straight) man immediately after discovering his sexual orientation. In two studies, female participants engaged in imagined or actual initial interactions with either a straight man or a gay man. After the man's sexual orientation was revealed, women (particularly attractive ones) who were paired with a gay man reported greater anticipated comfort, which was mediated by their reduced worry about his sexual intentions (Study 1). Further, once women discovered that they were interacting with a gay man, they displayed more intimate engagement behaviors with him (Study 2). These findings reveal how, and why, close relationships often form quickly between women and gay men.",

      "title": "The Structure of Power in Young Adult Problem Novels",
      "abstract": "Young adult (YA) reading interests and preferences have been the subject of ongoing study for decades. (1) These and other studies show conflicting results about what adolescents are reading in terms of genres and formats, but some trends do emerge. Girls tend to read more (and more fiction) than boys (2); adolescents seem to prefer realistic stories featuring teens (though fantasy, mystery, and horror/supernatural are recurring favorites); and, according to one study by Barbara Samuels, one of the favorite types of fiction for adolescents is problem novels. (3) Adolescents possess an increasing variety of choices for reading materials (in print and online), so how do adolescent problem novels capture the interest of young adults and adults alike? The World of Adolescence YAs who are twelve to eighteen years old are in a transitional period of their lives that is fraught with change. Their bodies are maturing physically and chemically, their minds are expanding beyond their egocentric childhood confines, they are developing a social network that far exceeds physical proximity (technology has redefined our understanding of community in this regard), and they are exploring emotions, spirituality, and possibilities that didn't enter their flame of reference as children. As early as 1904, psychologist G. Stanley Hall described adolescence as a series of antithetic impulses, including overactivity and sluggishness, euphoria and despondence, egotism and self-abasement, selfishness and altruism, seclusiveness and gregariousness, sensitivity and callousness, radicalism and conservatism, and precociousness and foolishness. (4) He viewed adolescence as a chaotic time in which young people had to contend with the extremes of life in all aspects of their development. In 1973 Gisela Konopka found similar traits in her article describing the requirements for healthy development of adolescents. She explains that adolescence is characterized by * audacity and insecurity; * loneliness; * psychological vulnerability; * mood swings; * peer group need; and * the need to be argumentative and emotional. (5) More recently, the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry has described the middle school and early high school years (approximately ages thirteen to sixteen) as characterized by (1) a movement toward independence (struggle with sense of identity, moodiness, feeling awkward about one's self and one's body, occasional rudeness, and a tendency to return to childish behavior, especially when stressed); (2) cognitive change (still present oriented but a growing array of intellectual interests); (3) developing sexuality (increased interest in sex but often shy about it as they are also concerned about their attractiveness to others, frequently changing relationships and sexual experimentation, and a concern about being normal); and (4) defining values and developing a sense of self (testing rules and limits, choosing role models, and developing ideals). (6) What all of this literature addresses is the upheaval and unease that many adolescents face during this time in their lives. Certainly there are wonderful times as well, filled with joy, excitement, love, a sense of belonging to a peer group (whether physical or digital), and wonder, (7) but many YAs also find the transition to adulthood filled with sturm und drang (storm and stress). Reed Larson and Linda Asmussen offer several possible explanations for this. They discuss a 1989 study that found first, that our adolescents experienced more negative events in their lives than did our preadolescents and, second, that those who reported more negative events experienced a greater frequency of negative states. (8) There is a correlation, then, between the sheer number of problems and negative effect, though establishing a causal link is difficult. They also suggest that adolescence is associated with an expanding horizon, an increased awareness of a wider social, political, and economic world . …",

      "abstract": "Abstract The role of personality in marital sexual satisfaction was investigated in 102 married couples, studying three major measurable personality dimensions–extraversion-introversion, neuroticism, and psychoticism. The results indicated that for females greatest sexual satisfaction in marriage occurred when the male's personality was essentially identical to the female's for extraversion-introversion and neuroticism; for these same couples, however, the males sexual satisfaction was not related to such personality similarity or dissimilarity. Interestingly, for males, greatest sexual satisfaction in marriage was found when spouses were essentially identical in the personality dimension of psychoticism. Thus, all three personality dimensions were shown to be related to sexual satisfaction in marriage. Personality \"fit\" between marital partners would appear to be important for sexual satisfaction, with females perhaps being more sensitive to personality than males. If the three personality dimensions are ranked in terms of their psychiatric illness implications, from extraversion-introversion (least) to neuroticism to psychoticism (most), one might speculate that females resonate to the more normal aspects of personality, relative to males who may resonate to less healthy aspects of personality. These results have not before been reported in marital analyses. They open up a fascinating range of new approaches to understanding the sources of male and female marital sexual satisfaction.",

Drawing from social learnign theory, researchers expected the lesbian group to report more negative childhood sexual experiences with males, more positive childhood sexual experiences with females, more accepting parental attitudes toward sexuality and sexual experimentation, and more distant relationships with parents. Results indicate tha, rather than childhood sexual experiences distinguishing groups, respondents' current attitudes are significant between-group discriminators. These findings are consistent with the recent body of literature that suggests that sexual orientation cannot be explained in terms of early sexual trauma or negative heterosexual experiences.",

Sexual orientation of a person could even be a criminal offence according to the law of India (Indian Penal Code: section 377). In such a society it is expected to follow social norms and hiding one's sexual orientation (if it's different from the pre set social norm). Here the question arises where hiding one's sexual orientation is desired then why some people choose to show that. Hence, the coming out might have some positive psycho-social implications, which motivates these individuals to step out of the closet. The purpose of this study is to find out the positive psycho-social factors behind stating ones sexual orientation (when it's different from the social norm) through interview method. 6 LGBTQ individuals were interviewed and asked to state the positive factors of stating their sexual orientation, 3 of them are already out to their parents and peers and 3 are not yet out to their parents and peers. Those who have told their close kin(s) and acquaintances about their sexual orientation were also asked about the reaction of their parents and friends when they break the matter to them. The research assumption was that revealing sexual identity might have change the way of perceiving well being, happiness and meaning in life of the LGBTQ individuals, thus these areas were probed in this research.",

      "title": "Authenticity from Benevolent Sexism: Women’s Perception of Male Allies",
      "abstract": "Men are often called to be allies for women to challenge sexism and gender inequity. However, despite intentions to help, men may still approach allyship from a position of benevolent sexism. Benevolent sexism (BS) appears positive but is based on restrictive gender roles and stereotypes that women are weak and need protecting. Such beliefs lead male allies to overhelp or provide help that is ineffective in improving women’s status. However, women may interpret the protective and supportive face of BS as an authentic desire to improve women’s status.This interpretation may also depend on how strongly women identify with feminism which can inform their awareness of gender inequity and recognition of sexism. The current study explored whether women will perceive help from a male ally as an authentic desire to improve women’s status even if he exhibits BS. Women recruited from undergraduate psychology classes completed a pre-test survey measuring their endorsement of BS and identification with feminism. They were then randomly assigned to one of two conditions in which they read about a man engaging in efforts to help women in his school’s robotics club but who also exhibited either BS or egalitarian views. Participants then completed measures about their perceptions of the ally, including his motives and intentions. Women who identify as feminists and are low in their endorsement of BS should be more able to recognize sexism and be more suspicious of the intentions of an ally who exhibits it.",

      "abstract": "Rates of nonfatal suicidal behavior among gay and lesbian youth surpass those recorded among their heterosexual peers. A frequently cited precipitant of gay and lesbian nonfatal suicidal behavior is the turmoil associated with coming out to one's family. This study investigated young adults' attitudes toward peers who engaged in suicidal behavior after coming out and being rejected by their parents, and compared them with attitudes toward persons who had become suicidal in response to other stressors (a physical illness, a relationship loss, or an academic failure). Our goal was to explore whether young persons hold beliefs that may encourage lesbian and gay suicidal behavior. We found that gays and lesbians who engaged in suicidal behavior following coming out were not viewed in particularly forgiving or empathic ways, as was the case for persons who became suicidal following an incurable illness. All suicidal persons were perceived as relatively feminine. At the same time, suicidal males were rated as more masculine if they engaged in suicidal behavior because of an academic failure or a physical illness, while suicidal females were viewed as more masculine only if their suicidal behavior followed an academic failure. Finally, we found that both respondent sex and respondent gender-identity influenced evaluations of suicidal persons. Building on these findings, future research should explore attitudes toward the permissibility of a suicidal decision by lesbian and gay persons.",

      "abstract": "Although malevolent individuals may be willing to use any tactic necessary to obtain sex, not all antagonistic traits will predict coercion or coaxing in all situations. A sample of 447 adult men, collected in two waves, reported their intentions to engage in coercion or coaxing of hypothetical targets. Study 1 provided three hypothetical scenarios that result in sexual rejection: (a) an expensive date, (b) a stranger, and (c) a relationship partner, and Study 2 provided the same scenarios, and three additional scenarios: (d) a rival's partner, (e) a bet, and (f) a powerful person. A Structural Equations Model indicated that a common antagonistic factor, indicated by Social Dominance and the Dark Triad traits of psychopathy, narcissism, and Machiavellianism, predicted coaxing across all situations, whereas only psychopathy predicted coercion across all situations. In addition, narcissism accounted for additional variance in coaxing when rejected by an expensive date. These findings suggest that across the different scenarios, psychopathy is primarily associated with coercive tactics and the common malevolent core among the traits is associated with coaxing tactics.",

      "abstract": "Abstract : This limited review suggests that some traditional factors like, personality and circadian amplitude seem to have little to do with tolerance of shift work. Neither does gender, at least not if social responsibility is controlled for. Age on the other hand seems of more interest and also diurnal type, but the two seem closely related. However, the major determinants of shift work tolerance probably have more to do with states or rather ways of coping with irregular work hours. Thus, the way an individual organizes his behavior to promote sleep may be of importance, as may be the need for sleep. This may be related to commitment to night work, avoiding light after night work, etc. One should probably give priority to teaching sleep/wake optimization, rather than trying to find individuals with particular traits. One gets the feeling that the highly tolerant single night shift worker would be older, have a low need for sleep, have a high sleep quality, be in good physical shape, and plan sleep strategically (using naps). If several night shifts occur in sequence, younger individuals may have an advantage.",

      "abstract": "Most societies are heavily organised around a dichotomous model of gender, and individuals are heavily policed on their conformity (or otherwise) to gender norms. This scrutinisation of gender has a profound impact on the identities and lived experiences of trans people, especially for those whose gender identity (or presentation) does not appear to match social expectations for that gender; or where someone's physical body in some way does not match the body conventionally associated with that gender. This might result in trans people avoiding certain situations to reduce the risk of being exposed. Based on a sample of 889 UK-based participants who self-defined as trans, the current paper explores situational avoidance with particular reference to gender identity and stage of transition. A key finding of this study concerned statistically significant associations between group (gender identity and stage of transition) and avoidance (or not) of certain situations, namely clothing shops, gyms, and public toilets. The implications of these findings for supporting trans people through transition – in particular, the real life experience – are also discussed.",

      "abstract": "From the old days, people believe that men have less non-commitment in their relationship with the opposite sex, while according to new research women can betray and not be in a relationship with men! Therefore, the ultimate goal of the studies was to identify the main cause and the main pattern of this non-commitment, and to continue to refine and provide solutions to this problem. The fact is that some women in the long-standing relationship and finally commitment in all years will eventually betray their Infidelity and commit themselves. Of course, men may also be betrayed after having had a long relationship with one person. At the same time, none of the parties, ultimately lethargy, refuse to accept their own indignation and Infidelity! With the difference that the method of Infidelity and its causes are different in both sexes, they are completely different. Men, while committing to their own people, if they are fascinated, emotionally or sexually abusive others, on the contrary, women, until they are fully satisfied by their man, Committed to their commitment. But as soon as a person creates and continues to experience the emotions, sexual relations, finances and ... on the part of the man, with the onset of problems between the two, the woman is also drawn to Infidelity and inertia. Most women cannot easily engage in sexually abusive relationships and intimacy with another man, because unlike men, the creation of a new sexual relationship on the part of the woman is quite apparent in the state of affection and self-expression in relation to the previous man. For women: If men learn to respect their own person, emotionally, financially, and financially, there is no reason for a woman to betray her.",

While being in a relationship or not is unrelated to antisocial behavior, romantic partner characteristics (antisocial behavior and antisocial influence) are associated with greater antisocial behavior. As males age, they become increasingly resistant to romantic partner characteristics. In contrast, females become increasingly vulnerable to the effects of romantic partner characteristics on antisocial behavior as they age, particularly when these relationships are relatively shorter. Females in shorter romantic relationships with partners who are antisocial or exert antisocial influence are at risk of persisting in antisocial behavior.",

Across three preregistered studies ( N = 1,096), we examine gender discrimination against gender-nonconforming people. Studies 1 and 2 show that behavioral and appearance-based gender nonconformity leads to the misgendering of cisgender and transgender women and men. This was true for the gendered perception of these targets and the binary assignment to gender/sex-based spaces and policies (e.g., access to bathrooms or gender/sex-based leadership training). Surprisingly, whether the target was transgender or cisgender did not affect these results. Study 3 replicated findings for transgender targets and showed that adherence to gender stereotypes is seen as a necessity for transgender individuals who want their gender identity recognized by others (e.g., on official documents or through pronoun use).",

The current study explored the frequency of parent–adolescent consent communication, as well as demographic, adolescent, and parent predictors of adolescents’ beliefs about the importance of consent and the frequency of parent–adolescent consent communication. Two national samples were used, one consisting of 2,044 adolescents, ages 13 to 18 (Mage = 16.19, SD = 1.71; 50% female), and a second sample of 2,081 nonrelated individuals, ages 28 to 81, who were parents of teens ages 13–18 (Mage = 15.25, SD = 1.56). Findings suggested that parents did not talk about sexual consent any more than they did about other sexual topics (e.g., reproduction). We also found that maternal warmth was positively associated with adolescents’ importance of consent beliefs and that adolescents’ uninhibited temperament and parents’ self-efficacy and sexual beliefs were associated with parent–adolescent consent communication. The discussion focuses on the need to educate parents so they feel more confident talking to adolescents about the importance of giving and receiving sexual consent.",

      "abstract": "Children, across cultures, show an early-emerging tendency to essentialize gender, viewing gender as inborn and predictive of stereotypical preferences. However, research has been limited to children whose own gender experience is largely consistent with the assumptions of gender essentialism. In contrast, transgender children have gender identities (and related stereotypical preferences) that differ from their sex assigned at birth, which therefore appear to challenge an essentialist view of gender. In the current study, we examined the degree to which transgender children (N = 97, 3–11 years) view a child's sex at birth as predictive of their later gender-typed preferences. Additionally, we recruited two comparison groups: cisgender siblings of transgender participants (N = 59) and cisgender, age- and gender-matched controls (N = 90). In an adapted switched-at-birth paradigm, participants in all groups believed that a child's sex at birth would predict their later gender-typed preferences; participants were especially likely to think so when the target character was reared in a socialization environment that aligned with the target's own gender, rather than one where the socialization environment aligned with a different gender. Whereas cisgender participants showed a decline in essentialism with age, transgender children did not show any age-related changes in their beliefs. The current findings are the first to show that transgender and cisgender children, despite differences in gender experiences, might similarly essentialize gender. However, these findings also raise questions about how different participant groups might interpret measures differently.",

      "abstract": "Latar Belakang: Fenomena keberadaan laki-laki yang suka berhubungan dengan laki-laki atau yang lebih di kenal dengan nama LSL sebenarnya sudah lama ada. Dalam istilah kekinian, para kaum LSL enggan disamakan dengan kaum Gay, karena mereka menganggap dapat melakukan hubungan seksual dengan lawan jenis, sedangkan pada umumnya mereka melakukan hubungan sejenis dipengaruhi oleh faktor desakan atau dorongan birahi sesaat. Perilaku LSL yang cenderung tidak aman dapat menjadi bom waktu penyebaran HIV, apalagi komunitas meraka cenderung tertutup sehingga sangat sulit terjangkau dalam program penanggulangan HIV/AIDS. Tujuan: Penelitian ini bertujuan untuk mengkaji penyebab penyimpangan seksual pada remaja lelaki, mengkaji kehidupan sosial serta mengetahui kebijakan dan program pemerintah daerah terkait dengan penyimpangan seksual remaja lelaki. Metode: Penelitian ini menggunakan metode kualitatif dengan sampel adalah remaja lelaki yang mempunyai penyimpangan seksual (LSL), sedangkan teknik pengambilan sampel pada penelitian adalah dengan menggunakan  snowball sampling . Hasil: Penyebab penyimpangan seksual pada remaja lelaki diantaranya adalah karena kurangnya perhatian dari orangtua, laki-laki dianggap lebih mengerti dan penuh perhatian, serta adanya rasa bosan terhadap perempuan Simpulan: Penyebab terjadinya penyimpangan seksual pada remaja lelaki adalah remaja kurang mendapat perhatian dari orang tua dan kondisi lingkungan yang kurang mendukung dalam membentuk kepribadiannya. Perhatian dan rasa kasih sayang yang didapatkan dari sesama jenis menjadi pemicu seseorang mengalami perubahan perasaan, menjalani kehidupan asmara dengan sesama jenis dirasakan jauh lebih menyenangkan dan menantang. Kata Kunci: Dinamika, Lelaki Seks Lelaki (LSL), Penyimpangan, Remaja, Seksual ABSTRACK Background : The phenomenon of the existence of men who like to relate to men or whose relationship is better known as MSM actually has long existed. In contemporary terms, men with MSM are refuse to be equated with gays, because they consider that they are able to have sexual relations with the opposite sex, whereas in general, they conduct similar relationships by being influenced by a momentary pressure or urge. The behavior of MSM which tends to be unsafe can be a time-bomb for the spread of HIV; moreover, their communities tend to be closed so that it is very difficult to reach in the HIV / AIDS prevention program. Objective : This study aims to examine the causes of sexual irregularities in young men, study social life and find out the policies, and becomes programs of local governments related to sexual deviations of male adolescents. Methods : This study uses a qualitative method with a sample of young men who have sexual deviations (MSM), while the sampling technique in research is to use snowball sampling. Results : The cause of sexual deviation in young men is due to a lack of attention from parents, the fact that men are considered more understanding and attentive, and there is a sense of boredom towards women. Conclusion : The causes of sexual deviations in young men are adolescents who get less attention from parents and environmental conditions that are less supportive in shaping their personality. The attention and affection gained from the same sex trigger a person to experience a change of feeling, living a same-sex life is much more fun and challenging.

      "abstract": "Abstract Contemporary mate preferences can provide important clues to human reproductive history. Little is known about which characteristics people value in potential mates. Five predictions were made about sex differences in human mate preferences based on evolutionary conceptions of parental investment, sexual selection, human reproductive capacity, and sexual asymmetries regarding certainty of paternity versus maternity. The predictions centered on how each sex valued earning capacity, ambition— industriousness, youth, physical attractiveness, and chastity. Predictions were tested in data from 37 samples drawn from 33 countries located on six continents and five islands (total N = 10,047). For 27 countries, demographic data on actual age at marriage provided a validity check on questionnaire data. Females were found to value cues to resource acquisition in potential mates more highly than males. Characteristics signaling reproductive capacity were valued more by males than by females. These sex differences may reflect different evolutionary selection pressures on human males and females; they provide powerful cross-cultural evidence of current sex differences in reproductive strategies. Discussion focuses on proximate mechanisms underlying mate preferences, consequences for human intrasexual competition, and the limitations of this study.",

Subjects then completed the revised UCLA (University of California, Los Angeles) Loneliness Scale and the Personal Attributes Questionnaire, measuring sex-role orientation. For both sexes, loneliness was negatively related to the amount of time spent with females and to the meaningfulness of interaction with males and females. However, meaningfulness with males was more important than meaningfulness with females. Femininity was negatively related to loneliness for both sexes and partially mediated the above relationships. There were sex differences, however, in the extent to which variables overlapped in predicting loneliness. For example, a large group of nonlonely males was characterized both by having meaningful relationships with males and by spending time with females, whereas a second group of nonlonely males was characterized simply by having meaningful relationships with males. The largest group of nonlonely females was characterized simply by having meaningful relationships with males, but another sizable group was characterized simply by spending time with females. Females doing both accounted for very little of the variance.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Early years of childhood, for boys as well as girls, would have been spent at home with the mother, and there is no reason to doubt that, generally speaking, a strong bond existed between a mother and her children. 1 But while Athenians recognized the affective power of the maternal bond, a mother played only a small role in determining a childߣs public or private identity. So, while Aristotle claims that mothers love their children more than fathers, he still asserts that the child is part of its father until it reaches a certain age. 2 In the case of widowhood or divorce, children of a marriage usually remained in their fatherߣs house while their mother returned to her father's house. 3 If a man had had a daughter but no sons, the sons of his daughter (who in this situation was called an epikleros) would inherit his property, but they were only considered to be the true continuance of their maternal grandfather's line if one of his close male relatives (e.g. his brother or first cousin) were the father.4 A woman was not thought capable of perpetuating her fatherߣs line without an infusion of the familyߣs male principle in her offspring. In such a culture, theories of reproduction were bound to emphasize the importance of the male component over the female. In the realm of mythology this emphasis took the form of stories",

      "abstract": "TO guard against misconception on so obscure and so complex a subject as that of the present inquiry is a somewhat hopeless endeavour. But it may, perhaps, be worth while to say once more, what has so often been said already, that those who ask for a fuller and freer life for women have no desire to interfere with distinctions of sex. The question under debate is not whether, as a matter of fact, there is such a thing as distinctive manhood and womanhood; for that no one denies. The dispute is rather as to the degree in which certain qualities, commonly regarded as respectively masculine and feminine characteristics, are such intrinsically, or only conventionally; and further, as to the degree of prominence which it is desirable to give to the specific differences in determining social arrangements. It is not against the recognition of real distinctions, but against arbitrary judgments, not based upon reason, that the protest is raised. If, in the exigencies of controversy, expressions may sometimes be used which seem to involve a denial of differences in the respective natures of women and of men, it must be regarded as a misfortune for which the advocates of restriction and suppression are responsible.",

      "title": "What Needs to Be Done in Prevention Programmes?",
      "abstract": "Child sexual abuse and assault can be characterized by an individual committing a sexual act against other individuals who are too young to consent. Sexual acts could range from verbal sexual harassment, to sexual organs being fondled, to penetration (oral or genital), and other sexual acts. Perpetrators stem from heterogeneous populations and can be related to their victims, known by their victims or, more rarely, strangers to their victims. Victims of sexual abuse can suffer short-term and long term adverse consequences on different levels. In many, mostly western, societies the occurrence of child sexual abuse is regarded as a traumatic experience for the victims on an individual level and as a problem of the corresponding society on a macro-societal level. One (Western) response to the problem has been the development of group-based empowerment prevention programmes which are seen as cost cutting and cost-effective. Still, many critiques view the empowerment model is ineffective and dangerous for children at the same time. Some critiques are outlined here and suggestions are made for further preventive directions in child protection.",

      "abstract": "Relationships involving a woman who is much older than her male partner have become increasingly visible in popular culture. These women are referred to as “cougars” and their partners as “toyboys.” This type of relationship has the potential to undermine elements of heteronormativity and intersectional gender/age performances, as women who are past their forties are not expected to engage in sexual relationships with (younger) men. The present study discusses the discourse found in Dutch gossip media (n = 138) on the relationships of preselected celebrity “cougars:” Demi Moore, Madonna, Patricia Paay, and Heleen van Royen. A qualitative content analysis reveals that certain aspects of heteronormativity are challenged: these women are depicted as financially and sexually empowered, whereas their partners are seen as interchangeable male suitors who are dependent on the female partner’s (financial/career) achievements. Yet, traditional understandings of intersectional performances (i.e., gender/age) are also found: a wise, caring mother, and a handsome, boyish, adventurous partner. Overall, these women are seen as both maintaining and challenging traditional roles that are typically associated with older women.",

      "abstract": "Dimorfismo sexual é a diferença física entre machos e fêmeas (Andersson 1994). A competição entre machos pelo acesso a fêmeas pode levar à evolução de atributos sexualmente dimórficos (dimorfismo sexual). Esses atributos presentes de forma mais exagerada nos machos supostamente sinalizam a qualidade fisiológica do indivíduo, seja para rivais em interações agonísticas ou para fêmeas na escolha de parceiros sexuais (Andersson 1994).As brigas entre machos por acesso a fêmeas, que frequentemente ocorrem na forma de briga, podem ser muito custosas, pois consomem grande parte do orçamento temporal e energético dos indivíduos, além de poderem causar lesões (Arnott &amp; Elwood 2009). Logo, mecanismos que permitam que os indivíduos avaliem seus rivais e decidam se devem entrar em um confronto deveriam ser favorecidos (Enquist &amp; Leimar 1983). Em algumas espécies esses atributos indicam a condição nutricional do indivíduo (Zahavi 1975, Zuk 1996). Porém, em outas espécies os machos são selecionados por possuírem atributos que são mais atrativos para as fêmeas, mesmo que tais atributos não indiquem vantagens para elas, a não ser a manutenção da atratividade na prole (seleção desenfreada - Prokop et al. 2012).Em libélulas a maioria do dimorfismo consiste em padrões de colorações mais conspícuas geralmente nas asas e no tórax dos machos (Córdoba-Aguilar, 2008). Em Erythrodiplax clitella o dimorfismo sexual consiste em manchas alares escuras e manchas brancas abdominais presentes apenas nos machos. Nesse estudo, usamos machos de E. clitella para avaliar a hipótese de que as manchas alares e abdominais indicam a condição nutricional dos machos. Nossa previsão é de que quanto maior a área da mancha alar e da mancha abdominal, maior a massa de gordura corpórea ou maior massa corpórea do individuo.",

      "abstract": "Author(s): Nehl, EJ; Talley, CL; Yu, F; Nakayama, KK; Lin, L; Wong, FY; Ong, PM; Takahashi, LM; Ross, MW | Abstract: Little is known about the dating preferences of Asian American gay men. To conceptualize the dating preferences among these men, the impact domains model (IDM) was used to investigate if nativity and/or acculturation might explain dating preferences. Previous studies have pointed out the problematic nature of a racist cultural stereotype that Asian American gay men prefer white partners (Choi, Yep, a Kumekawa, 1998; Han, 2008). The current findings do not support that Asian American gay men prefer white partners. In our sample, 17.1% preferred dating white men and over 20% preferred Asian men. Over 60% had no clear racial/ethnic dating preference. Multivariate analyses indicated that those reporting higher ethnic acculturation (p l.001) and were U.S.-born (p l.01) were more likely to prefer dating Asian men. In contrast, those younger (p l.001) and living on the East Coast (p l.01) were more likely to prefer dating white men. Limitations of the study include a self-report cross-sectional design with purposive recruitment to study HIV/STIs and sexual health rather than dating preferences. Additionally, the data set included only a coastal classification (East vs. West Coast) and an acculturation scale which included cultural identity, language, and competence. The complex effect of nativity and acculturation on dating preference warrants further investigation. The IDM may be useful to guide future studies of partner preference among Asian MSM. Researchers in future studies should pay attention to identifying the key behavioral, social, and affective beliefs that underlie partner preference and examine actual dating practices.",

Prior studies have demonstrated model generations favor one gender or exhibit stereotypes about gender, but have not investigated the complex dynamics that can influence model reasoning and decision-making involving gender. We study gender equity within LLMs through a decision-making lens with a new dataset, DeMET Prompts, containing scenarios related to intimate, romantic relationships. We explore nine relationship configurations through name pairs across three name lists (men, women, neutral). We investigate equity in the context of gender roles through numerous lenses: typical and gender-neutral names, with and without model safety enhancements, same and mixed-gender relationships, and egalitarian versus traditional scenarios across various topics. While all models exhibit the same biases (women favored, then those with gender-neutral names, and lastly men), safety guardrails reduce bias. In addition, models tend to circumvent traditional male dominance stereotypes and side with 'traditionally female' individuals more often, suggesting relationships are viewed as a female domain by the models.",

With homosexuality constant, it was found that feminine gender identity was more characteristic of the homosexuals in the more gender‐role rigid and anti‐homosexual society (Australia), independent of differences in perceptions of parents. This was taken to indicate support for the hypothesis that in anti‐homosexual societies with rigid gender roles, opposite‐sex gender identity in homosexuals will be, to some degree, a function of believing that heterosexual relationships are the only appropriate ones, and that individuals who are homosexual will thus validate same‐sex preference by opposite‐sex identification. The findings also support the more general hypothesis that gender role is based on societal, as well as parental, models.",

Abuse cuts across all social categories and classes. It occurs in well-educated high-income areas and in low-income working-class areas; it happens in all races and religions. It can occur in families, extended families, in neighbour hoods, schools, churches, and community groups. Both men and women can be abusive and it can occur in virtually all age groups.

The current research analyzes reasoning about three kinds of beliefs: those that concern matters of fact (e.g., dinosaurs are extinct), preference (e.g., green is the prettiest color), and ideology (e.g., there is only one God). The domain of ideology is of unique interest because it is hypothesized to contain elements of both facts and preferences. If adults’ distinct reasoning about ideological beliefs is the result of prolonged experience with the physical and social world, children and adults should reveal distinct patterns of differentiating kinds of beliefs, and this difference should be particularly pronounced with respect to ideological beliefs. On the other hand, if adults’ reasoning about beliefs is a basic component of social cognition, children and adults should demonstrate similar belief representations and patterns of belief differentiation. Two experiments demonstrate that 5-10 year old children and adults similarly judged religious beliefs to be intermediate between factual beliefs (where two disagreeing people cannot both be right) and preferences (where they can). From the age of 5 years and continuing into adulthood, individuals distinguished ideological beliefs from other types of mental states and demonstrated limited tolerance for belief-based disagreements.",

A vignette study was conducted in Hungary in which we explored people’s perceptions regarding male or female actors behaving in a modern or in a traditional way in a work–family conflict (caring for a sick child). Respondents ( N = 297) evaluated the femininity and masculinity of the actor and the appropriateness of his/her choice. We found that modern gender role behavior triggers approval. Biological sex (male or female actor) and social role of the actor influenced perceptions regarding femininity, but masculinity evaluations were solely based on social role. Thus, our results confirmed the existence of asymmetries in the perceptions of female and male gender role vanguards: modern males are seen similar to traditional females, but similar conflation is not present in the case of modern females. As a consequence, strict gender role expectations toward males work against social changes to a fairer share of family labor.",

Developing Searchers are notably enthusiastic when searching, and are eager simply to be using the computer. More negative emotions, ranging from dislike of searching to uncertainty, place a child more firmly into the role of Non-motivated. While this dichotomy of emotions toward search itself is apparent for the roles of Developing and Non-motivated, there are numerous other emotions occurring during searching that do not associate to roles, with the exception of frustration. Frustration with perceived search failure is notably higher for children in the sub-role of Distracted than for children in other roles.",

Many theoretical arguments and the case of Andre Gide in particular indicate that preadolescent masturbation helps create adult sexual misfits. Gide a famous twentieth century French writer explained that during his life he never felt sexually attracted to a woman; instead he always tried to recreate an early experience of sexual gratification with a young boy. Kinseys report of 317 adult male biographies indicates that conditioned reflexes form most easily in youth and if formed are more difficult to erase than those formed later. It is felt that in the past most parents have discouraged masturbation at an early age hence very few preadolescents practiced it. People must beware of being too permissive with children or allowing indiscriminate sexual knowledge for the young for fear of interfering with instinctive societal controls of such behavior.",

      "abstract": "The potential impact of traditional Latinx masculine gender norms (e.g., traditional machismo and caballerismo) on sexual identity development of Latino sexual minority men (LSMM) is an expanding area of inquiry in Latinx psychology. The purpose of this cross-sectional study is to determine whether endorsement of traditional machismo and caballerismo among LSMM vary based on their (a) sexual identity development status and (b) self-labeled sexual identity. We surveyed 499 LSMM (aged 18-57 years) across the United States via an online study. Based on correlational analyses and a multivariate analysis of variance, we describe how traditional machismo and caballerismo are related to (a) different levels of theorized sexual identity development statuses (uncertainty, exploration, commitment, synthesis/integration) as well as (b) participants' use of sexual identity labels (exclusively heterosexual/straight, mostly heterosexual/straight, bisexual, mostly homosexual/gay, exclusively homosexual/gay). Mixed results were found regarding hypothesized differences in participants' traditional machismo and caballerismo endorsement across the four sexual identity development statuses. Findings support the hypotheses that LSMM who indicate more traditional machismo and caballerismo tend to self-identify with heterosexual/straight labels compared to respondents who identify with bisexual or homosexual/gay labels. Implications for psychological research and clinical practice are discussed concerning the promotion of healthy and culturally congruent sexual identity development of LSMM.",

However, research has not examined the question of whether men and women react similarly or differently to a partner’s engagement in different types of sexual infidelity. The present research sought to answer this question. Based on the aforementioned prior research, and short term mating desires, sex differences in reactions to different types of sexual infidelity were not expected. Both women and men were expected to report higher levels of upset when a partner engaged in sexual intercourse rather than when a partner engaged in oral sex, heavy petting, or kissing with another person. The results were consistent with the hypothesis. Both men and women were most upset by a partner’s engagement in sexual intercourse with another person.

      "title": "Deconstructing Early Life Experiences",
      "abstract": "In rodents, a pup's experiences in utero and during postnatal development shape its sexual behavior as an adult and how it is perceived by potential mates. We show that the male rat's sexuality is primarily influenced by the postnatal sex ratio of its litter, but not by the litter's prenatal intrauterine sex ratio or the behavior of its mother. Pups from litters with differing prenatal sex ratios were divided into litters with differing postnatal sex ratios. We found that males raised in a female-biased litter exhibited less mounting than males raised in either a male-biased litter or one with an equal sex ratio, and were less attractive to sexually receptive females, eliciting fewer soliciting behaviors, such as hop-darts, and fewer lordosis behaviors. However, the number of intromissions and ejaculations did not differ across groups, which suggests that males from female-biased litters mate as efficiently as males raised in other sex ratios, but do not require as many mounts to do so. The reported differences in sexual behavior did not vary with the quality of maternal behavior or with sexual experience in adulthood.",

      "abstract": "Pedophilia is defined as a sexual interest in prepubescent children. It is empirically linked with sexual offending against children: Child pornography offenders and sex offenders with child victims are more likely to be pedophiles based on self-report or objective measures of sexual interests. At the same time, some pedophiles have not had any known sexual contact with children, and perhaps half of sex offenders against children would not meet diagnostic criteria for pedophilia. Pedophilia can be diagnosed using a variety of methods and is an important factor to consider in the assessment of sex offenders because pedophilic offenders are more likely to sexually reoffend and require different interventions. There is no evidence to suggest that pedophilia can be changed. Instead, interventions are designed to increase voluntary control over sexual arousal, reduce sex drive, or teach self-management skills to individuals who are motivated to avoid acting upon their sexual interests.",

      "abstract": "Gender rules, that is, prescriptive and proscriptive gender stereotypes, dictate how women and men should and should not be, and thereby perpetuate the gender hierarchy that privileges men over women. Across seven nations that span the continuum of gender equality, we investigated gender status norms by identifying the extent to which gender rules correspond with social status beliefs. As expected, in all investigated nations, participants ( N = 4,327) believed that men should not show low-status traits reflecting weakness (e.g., weak, naive) but should show high-status traits reflecting agency (e.g., leadership ability, ambitious). Correlational analyses found that the more gender-equal a nation, the more men's agency prescriptions were aligned with high-status and their weakness proscriptions with low-status characteristics. Moreover, participants believed that women should not show high-status traits reflecting dominance (e.g., dominant, demanding) in the United States, Turkey, India, and Ghana—that is, in the relatively less gender-equal nations. Yet, no trait was proscribed for women in the relatively more gender-equal nations of Switzerland and Sweden. The status alignment of women's prescriptions and proscriptions did not relate to nations’ achieved gender equality. We discuss how the alignment of men's gender rules with status beliefs represents a hidden barrier to achieving full gender equality.",

      "abstract": "The degree and form of sexual conflict is strongly influenced by the relative proportions of potentially reproductive males and females in a population. Patterns following from the operational sex ratio of groups in other species are reflected in human populations. Because the reproductive strategies of men and women are somewhat divergent, market influences on the intensity of mating competition and selectivity for partners produce different outcomes in female-biased and male-biased populations. Male mating opportunities are enhanced by scarcity, and incentives for long-term commitment are diminished, encouraging serial and simultaneous polygyny. Scarce females may be able to more effectively secure commitment from partners as well as demand higher levels of resource investment. However, male social power often constrains women’s ability to leverage their market scarcity for serial or simultaneous polyandry. Imbalanced sex ratios are associated with largely consistent social and cultural trends in specific historical periods and populations.",

      "abstract": "Centuries of exclusion have resulted in a tangible human diversity deficit, where the diversity of oceanographers does not represent the global diversity of people impacted by ocean processes. We present six challenges faced by oceanographers who have one or more marginalized identities: (1) historical practices of conquest, discrimination, and exclusion underpin oceanography’s modern diversity deficit; (2) undervalued and uncompensated labor by oceanographers from underrepresented groups can perpetuate a lack of representation by leading to burnout and attrition; (3) marginalized individuals are often forced to hide parts of their identities (languages, appearances, partners, behaviors) that deviate from outdated expectations of professionalism; (4) oceanography requires trainees to navigate extensive logistical and financial hurdles; (5) individuals from non-Western cultural and religious traditions often conceal their spiritual obligations in attempts to assimilate or avoid forgoing valuable research experiences; and (6) limited planning and transparency in oceanographic fieldwork can threaten the physical and mental safety of marginalized individuals. We highlight how holding multiple, intersecting identities can compound negative impacts on the well-being of marginalized oceanographers. Finally, we recommend solutions that individuals, mentors, professional societies, funding agencies, and institutions should undertake to move toward a more diverse oceanographic community.",

      "abstract": "Looked after and adopted children are among the most vulnerable in our society and it is well established that they present with a higher prevalence of mental health problems than children who live with their birth family. In their histories, they frequently have birth parents who have lived chaotic lives, some with mental health problems and substance misuse, and have experienced disruptions of care as well as exposure to neglect and/or abuse. However, often when they try to access mental health services, all their problems are formulated as ‘trauma and attachment issues’ with lack of data to support these. This article presents a case study of a 15-year-old boy whose severe difficulties were understood and formulated in terms of ‘attachment problems’ for many years. Neuro-developmental issues, unrelated to his being removed from his birth parents and adopted, had not been considered as the biological factors of the formulation (e.g. genetics and intra-uterus events) were ignored. Because there are no evidence-based interventions for a vaguely defined presentation such as ‘attachment problems’, he was given non-evidenced therapies for years and the parents felt blamed. Understandably, there was then little progress with his difficulties and this in turn had a very detrimental impact on his family, academic and social life. It is recommended that looked after and adopted children have their presentations formulated using a biopsychosocial model that takes into account their complexities to personalise future interventions, just like children who live with their birth parents. It is imperative they stop receiving mental health services where ‘one size fits all’ and that the training of staff working with this group ensures that children’s whole life experiences are understood.",

They may point to women's participation in marathon running or rugby, or look to girls and boys playing together in co-educational physical education classes as proof that we now have equality between the sexes in sport and physical education. However, some less sanguine members of the public may remind us that girls remain more likely to drop out of sport than boys and that in some elite sport contexts women do not receive the same rewards as men for what are arguably as good or better performances. Others might suggest that in order to gain public recognition and acceptance of their participation, women have increasingly had to 'play like men' (Hargreaves, 1994), or rather, like certain men. As other authors in this collection emphasise, particular forms of masculinity remain dominant in many sporting contexts and this dominance serves to exclude both women and men from participation, enjoyment and/or achievement in sport.",

Sexual selection thus results in a complex network of traits that enhance fighting ability, such as endurance capacity, bite force, and speed, but can also push males to their performance limit during displays to females. This chapter examines these traits and explores the limits of performance in relation to reproductive success. In addition, it examines how the diversity of sexual structures of animals can be explained through variation in performance traits.",

Although these relationships have long been theorized, strong empirical evidence is lacking. Across two studies, men who strongly endorsed (Study 1) or were primed with (Study 2) traditional gender norms perceived relationship violence directed toward gay men as less severe, less in need of intervention, and more likely caused by the victim than participants low in gender norm endorsement or primed with neutral content. In contrast, traditional gender norms were less predictive of heterosexual men’s prejudice toward lesbian victims of relationship violence, and not predictive of heterosexual women’s prejudice toward gay and lesbian victims. Thus, the relationship between traditional gender norms and sexual prejudice appears to be strongest for heterosexual men’s prejudice toward gay men.",

      "abstract": "Recently, scholars have become interested in the impact of culture on people's attitudes, emotions, and behavior. In this study, it was predicted that culture and gender would have an impact on people's sexual self-schemas – especially, women's self-schemas. It was also predicted that couples that verified one another's sexual self-schemas would be more satisfied than those couples that did not. Contrary to the predictions, race did not prove to be a good predictor of either women's or men's sexual self-schemas. However, self-construal was a significant predictor of women's sexual self-schemas. Again, contrary to prediction, whether or not couples verified one another's sexual self-schemas did not appear to be an important predictor of either sexual or general relationship satisfaction. Some unexpected findings were found, however. Women who perceived their partners to be passionate and men who perceived their partners to be romantic were more sexually and generally satisfied in their relationships than were their peers. Men were also less satisfied if they viewed their partners as more shy/embarrassed sexually. These data demonstrate that culture (as indicated by self-construal) may influence how women see themselves sexually and that perception (for both men and women) of their partner's sense of sexual self are important predictors of sexual and relationship satisfaction.",

In male heterogamety, possession of two similar (X) chromosomes determines a female individual, whereas possession of two non-identical chromosomes (X and Y) deter- mines a male. Because haploid sperm are produced by fair (Mendelian) segregation of the male sex chromosomes, half produce daughters and half sons. This keeps the sex ratio at approximate equality.",

The persistence of standards and reference models from youth into age seems to have different effects on men and women. For the older man, an active sex life appears to be crucial to his feelings of self-worth and his feeling that he is respected by his friends and secure socially. As with the younger man, dissatisfaction with sexual activity is related to depression and feelings of worthlessness. For the older woman sexual behavior remains a separate activity dimension. One might think that this would protect older women from disintegrating self-evaluations, but where the younger woman derives confidence from feeling attractive, the older woman feels unattractive and therefore socially rejected and of less value.",

At Time 2, boys engaged in more mild physical aggression and insulting, than girls, but there were no sex differences in other forms of aggression. At Time 1, parents’ responses were relatively uninfluenced by the sex of the children. However, parents were more likely to prohibit mild physical aggression, grabbing, and property damage by and towards girls at the second time period. Conversely, parents showed more tolerance for boys’ mild physical aggression at Time 2, suggesting that this socialisation message may play a role in boys’ greater use of physical aggression both at home and with peers.",

Gaps in the existing literature about these determinants are identified and a sociopsychological model integrating existing knowledge is proposed. In general, the following groups of individuals have relatively high fertility and/or relatively low or ineffective contraceptive use: low socioeconomic status, adolescents and people aged 40 and older, Catholics and highly religious, rural, many siblings, unemployed women or working women who do not attach great importance to their careers; and ethnic minorities. Sociopsychological determinants of fertility and contraceptive use have been classified into 2 groups: personality traits and values and attitudes. In general, the evidence linking values and attitudes to fertility-related behavior is stronger than personality traits, but some promising work in the personality area is being conducted. In general an early age at 1st marriage related to higher fertility, and duration of marriage positively associated with fertility as is a younger age at 1st birth. In general, there is a positive correlation between contraceptive knowledge and contraceptive behavior. Certain aspects of the husband/wife relationship, including the allocation of roles and responsibilities between husband and wife and the scope and frequency of their communication--are related to their fertility and contraceptive use. The extent to which family planning programs contribute to fertility decline, over and above the effects due to modernization and development, remains unanswered empirically. The following gaps in the literature were observed: the need for more research on the role of the male partner in determining fertility and contraceptive use, the experiential or behavioral determinants of fertility and contraceptive use, employment history, environmental aspects, and integration of the area into theoretical framework(s) capable of empirical verification.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The relative salience for children of various human facial features was examined in five experiments. The first two experiments were designed to validate the conclusion from previous research (McGraw, Durm, & Patterson, 1983) that the sex of adult faces is more salient than their race or age, and that the presence or absence of glasses is extremely unsalient. Children's spontaneous verbal descriptions confirmed the salience hierarchy of sex, race, age, and glasses. Experiments 3, 4, and 5 were designed to ascertain whether the salience of race, glasses, and age would be stable across potentially relevant subject and task-stimuli differences. There were some salience asymmetries; most notably, black skin was more salient than white skin for both Black and White children. In general, the results of these studies indicate that sex, race, age, and glasses represents a naturally occurring salience hierarchy that is reliably present among children of preschool and early elementary school age.",

It was hypothesized that German might have a more masculine ‘image’ than French and that this might render it more attractive and acceptable to male students. It was also thought that boys might find German less difficult, in some respects, than French. However, it was found in an empirical study that although German did have a more masculine image, it was nevertheless generally perceived as less interesting, more difficult and less useful than French. It was concluded that the association between ‘gender‐image’ and language is much less powerful than the association between language and certain socio‐linguistic factors such as nationalism.",

Much of our thinking about conflict has negative connotations, however. A definition that frames conflict primarily as a heavy-handed adversarial activity is hardly gender neutral. Heavy-handed contests fit hegemonic masculine gender stereotypes in many cultures and have been shown to be more typical of Euro-American and Afro-American boys' behavior than of girls'. The chapter focuses on the discourse skills used by some White, middle-class, advantaged preschool girls to manage their disagreements. It shows how their management of opposition is a jointly constructed achievement. There is a likeness between pretend play and theater. The language of pretending embodies both the planning and enactment of a story. There are stagecraft roles as well as character roles to be played.",

      "abstract": "This paper analyses data on sexuality from ethnographic research and from group discussions and in-depth interviews with 58 14–16 year old males in two schools. The research was carried out in a working class locality (Brockhill) in Glasgow, Scotland. Fourteen to sixteen year old boys in Brockhill lead homosocial lives and learn about sex and develop their sexual identities almost entirely from males. Heterosexuality is taken-for-granted as the cultural norm. There is considerable ambivalence about heterosexual sex, however, because of the gulf between male and female worlds, the inconsistencies between the dominant norm of teenage male sexuality and the boys' own personal experiences and emotions, and the vulnerability of their sexual identities. Although most boys conform to the convention of talking about sex in a way that objectifies women and focuses on male gratification, this discourse does not always reflect their more private views, particularly amongst those most familiar with girls. Several of these latter respondents expressed frustration with the passive role to which girls usually conform. There is a strong sense of the social construction of sexuality, but resignation to the idea that existing norms are inevitable.",

      "abstract": "From about 3-8 years of age boys are busily being recognised as boys - boisterous, inquisitive, assertive, active and outdoors. At the same time boys are actively\r\ntaking themselves up as male and demonstrating to the world their competence in getting their gender right. They do this by not engaging with activities that are usually associated with being a girl - passive, helpful, deferent, obedient, indoors. In this way, activities commonly linked to the development of literacy become associated with the feminine and as such are sometimes resisted by boys.\r\n\r\nThe Boys and Literacy project is based on evidence that boys, as a group, achieve lower levels in school-based literacy than do girls. Significantly, this is contextualised by structural relations of power in which women are positioned as a subordinate (although at times, majority) group. Although boys (as a group) achieve lower academic standards in English they do not suffer the same\r\nstructural disadvantage on the basis of gender that is experienced by girls. Girls continue to be under-represented in high status subjects such as Maths and Sciences dominated by boys and considered to be masculine. Positions of power and authority (social, economic and academic) continue to be claimed aIniost exclusively by men. As indicated by the research presented throughout the Boys and Literacy Project, the structural disadvantages experienced by boys are clearly linked to their positioning within hierarchical categories of race and class.\r\n\r\nA program of activities such as those suggested below has been devised by teachers' thinking about the need to work towards more balanced outcomes. By self-consciously deconstructing the metaphor of balance symbolised by the\r\narchetypal scales that appear throughout ancient, modern, mythic and scientific histories, the teacher can be read as the fulcrum or pivotal point. Within the context of the teaching-learning program (assumed to be designed to facilitate particUlar kinds of learning and understandings), the movements and words of the teacher (interacting with, and on behalf of students) act as a balance and counter balance to the intricate dynamics of power and achievement that prevail. The activities .outlined below are suggestions -for what the teacher might do to disrupt the maintenance of inequitable practices and outcomes that have become so usual that they are taken for granted within schooling.",

As predicted, male and female foreclosed subjects were more impulsive than were those in the other statuses, and male moratorium subjects were more reflective than others. However, female moratoriums were impulsive, and male and female diffused were reflective, findings which contradict theoretical expectation. Similarly, data on identification were mixed; female achieved subjects scored (as predicted) with higher identification than female moratorium or diffused subjects, while diffused males were highly identified with their fathers. One reason offered for the conflicting results is that identity formation is, as some have suggested, a different process for women than it is for men. Therefore, study of both genders with the same measures and hypotheses is not recommended.",

Women are diverse in their choices and priorities, with varying balances of personal and professional life. 3. Eighty-three percent of the women responding to the survey have married, and 82% of those married have children. They thus are likely to have two sets of seriously competing responsibilities. 4. It is possible to identify especially promising women during residency or fellowship. Exploring their priorities and values with good mentors will be important to avoid short-changing academic medicine of competent women. 5. Men and women need to be SUPERCHOOSERS in making the choices right for that individual, rather than superwomen or supermen. 6. We can question whether the development and potential of women (and some men) in academic medicine could be enhanced by: a. Consideration of guidance or support for child care resources? b. Flexibility in the system (tenure clock, etc.)? c. Identification of limited full-time clinical or research opportunities for faculty with young children or unusual family demands? d. Facilitation of bridging after a period of part-time activity or re-entry after limited participation? e. Consideration of part-time work at home and flexible on-site work hours for periods of special family demands? Finally, a supportive work environment is important for both men and women in medicine and is an essential priority in academic medicine. Medicine is a wonderful field. Academic medicine on my terms, to include family, has been very rewarding. Sometimes there also have been disappointments, in that I have fallen short of some of my aspirations. However, I must accept the responsibility for my choices. I owe a great debt to many of the men and women of the American Clinical and Climatological Association and of Johns Hopkins who are both friends and colleagues and especially to my husband, Dick Johns. After 42 years of marriage, I am still learning about the balance of personal and professional life. May we all be Superchoosers!",

A different research program indicates that men have lower second-to-fourth finger length ratios (2D:4D) than women, possibly because men are exposed to higher levels of androgens during prenatal development. We hypothesized that sex differences in sexual arousal patterns are influenced by prenatal androgen exposure and would thus be explained by sex differences in 2D:4D. We measured the sexual response patterns of 139 men and 179 women via genital arousal and pupil dilation to erotic videos, in addition to their 2D:4D. Compared to women, men showed stronger responses to one sex over the other, although this pattern was clearer in genital arousal than pupil dilation. Men also had lower 2D:4D than women. However, there was no evidence that sex differences in sexual arousal related to sex differences in 2D:4D. Thus, whichever factor explains sex differences in sexual arousal patterns may not be reflected in 2D:4D.",

During the past few decades, however, the majority of young singles have maintained a partnered sex life, and marriage has given way to cohabitation as the typical way for heterosexual couples to live together in young adulthood. Taking a longitudinal population-based sample of young Norwegian adults ( n = 2695, age 20-26), we investigated the degree to which sexual satisfaction was associated with the type of relationship in which they were engaged. Among both males and females, the sexually active unattached were the least satisfied with their sex lives, and a committed and long-lasting relationship seemed to be of greater importance for women than for men. In these relationships, however, a decrease in sexual activity and sexual satisfaction was observed over time, suggesting that boredom and routine may rapidly decrease sexual satisfaction. Most striking was the finding that females seem to profit in their sexual relationships from traditionally feminine and masculine gender roles in the form of androgyny. Men, on the other hand, still seem to manoeuvre on the basis of less flexible gender roles.",

They may both attempt to rationalize away his behavior as stress reactions related to work or finances, etc. Often the woman believes her adapting behavior will act to control his violence. This tension building phase time lapse varies greatly from the relationship to relationship. For some it may be days or weeks, for others there may be years of tension building between acute incidents. As the tension builds, her coping skills may become less and less effective at protecting herself or de-escalating the tension. It is during this phase that women will often reach out for help or support since they are aware of the increasing danger.

The results of the research demonstrate that digital games are not often perceived as a multidimensional phenomenon but, instead, they are understood through one or several properties of the game, i.e. through stereotyping.The following dominant stereotypes applicable to digital games (Digital games are addictive; They reduce children’s creativity and skills; Girls do not play. Games are not a feminine thing; Digital games are no art; They promote aggressive behaviour; A game is a game. Science is science; When playing, people do not think; The goal is to make people addicted to the product) are analysed in terms of stereotype forming characteristics associated with digital games, in terms of stereotype formation stages, and in terms of maintaining, changing and denying stereotypes.Feelings, emotions, initial experience influencing any new experiences, and social context are important factors of the stereotype formation process related to digital games. Stereotype formation stages described by other researchers are also characteristic of the stereotypes applicable to digital games. The stereotypes of digital games are maintained through: illusory correlation and assimilation, attributional and automatic processes and, also, by the fact that they often are self-fulfilling prophecies. The existing stereotypes on digital games are resistant but they can still be changed. The researchers have distinguished between the following stereotype change models: bookkeeping, conversion, subtyping, and exemplar-based model, which can also be seen in the stereotype change mechanisms related to digital games.",

      "title": "Why is absent/low sexual desire a mental disorder (except when patients identify as asexual)?",
      "abstract": "This analytic essay challenges the psychiatric practice of treating absent/low sexual interest/desire/arousal as a mental disorder. It does so by calling attention to the fact that asexuality is treated differently than other non-heterosexual orientations. The current DSM contains no psychiatric diagnosis which has, as its primary symptom, same-sex sexual desire. Yet, the same DSM offers diagnoses such as male hypoactive sexual desire disorder and female sexual interest/arousal disorder which have, as their primary symptom, absent/low sexual interest/desire/arousal. One of the unfortunate consequences of treating absent/low sexual desire as a mental disorder is that it perpetuates the false belief that those who experience their sexuality differently than the heterosexual ‘sexusociety’ norm are less healthy and more dysfunctional. It is also troubling because of the implied gender bias: women are more likely to experience absent/low sexual interest/desire/arousal than men and more likely to be diagnosed with a sexual interest/desire/arousal disorder. Women’s sexual desires, or the absence thereof, are, thus, more likely to be seen as abnormal. Since that judgment has long been used to pressure women to engage in sex they do not want, the unavoidable inference is that the psychiatric tradition of diagnosing absent/low sexual desire as pathological has placed, and continues to place, women at greater risk of sexual exploitation and abuse. The remedy: stop treating absent/low sexual desire as pathological. Recognize that people are sexually different and are entitled to desire sex a lot, a little, or not at all—whatever feels right for them.",

      "abstract": "Sociologists have documented sex talk as a crucial mechanism in the reproduction of heteronormativity in schools. In this highly sexualized context, how did asexual people make sense of sex talk? Drawing upon 21 retrospective interviews with asexual adults (between 18 and 31 years of age), I examined their accounts of sex talk in high school. Contrary to expectation, most of my respondents did not link sex talk to issues of masculinity/femininity, but instead framed it as about discovery of asexual identity, friendship, immaturity and inappropriate conduct, and/or simply meaningless noise. I suggest that the diverse range of gender ideologies and abundance of gender-coded symbols in our society enabled many respondents to assert asexuality-compatible femininities/masculinities, foreclose potential gender dilemmas, and retain a sense of security in their gender subjectivity. While the diverse narratives of sex talk encounters remind sociologists to appreciate asexual people’s heterogenous experiences, the possibility of subjectively degendering sex talk and desexualizing gender challenges sociologists to adopt a multidimensional approach to understand gendered sexuality.",

      "abstract": "Researchers have paid little attention to societal (as opposed to social) influences on attribution. The two present studies demonstrate the influence of sex, and its societal definition as gender, on attributions in the context of victimization. Across several types of assault and in different situations, more blame was attributed to female victims than to male victims. The type of blame attributed also varied by sex of the victim: (a) more blame was attributed to the character of female victims than to that of male victims, and (b) more blame was attributed to the behavior of male victims than to that of female victims. These attributional patterns were particularly strong among respondents with traditional gender role attitudes. Implications of these findings for the major attributional approaches are reviewed. The socioeconomic status, race, or sex of an actor may influence attributions about the behavior of that individual. The application for unemployment benefits by middle-income persons or by whites (both increasingly common phenomena), for example, may be attributed to different causes than applications for such benefits by members of the workingclass or by blacks. These different attributions, in turn, may influence the outcomes of such applications, or the self-esteem of the applicants and their families. Each of these factors—socioeconomic status, race, and sex— is the basis of a societal stratification system. The influence of such variables on the process of attribution, though not entirely ignored, has received little theoretical or empirical attention. Thorough consideration of the importance of societal and other omitted variables for the many theories of attribution of cause, blame, responsibility, or personal traits is a major theoretical endeavor.

      "abstract": "Child molesters are frequently uncomfortable in adult company but show high emotional congruence with children. It was hypothesized that these emotional problems may be mirrored by physical intimacy problems such that child molesters would show exaggerated disgust reactions to the thought of coming into physical contact with adults, but not children. It was demonstrated that the discomfort shown by both offenders and non-offenders at the prospect of coming into contact with the bodily fluids of another person increases in relation to the age of the person that the bodily fluid came from. Furthermore, child molesters, in comparison to non-offenders and violent offenders, showed excessive concern at the thought of being touched on the lips or tongue with a re-sterilized surgical swab. These exaggerated anxieties combined withthe implicit belief that children are less contaminating than adults could add to the drive for child molesters to seek physical intimacy with children.",

As a story about sex it is (possibly) salacious and will reveal things about me that some may regard as private, better left unsaid and unsuitable in an academic essay. Except that I am not an academic and this is not an academic essay but a story of someone usually identified as a (transsexual) woman. Except I don’t identify myself as a binary transsexual woman but as a non-binary assigned male at birth (AMAB) person. In writing about my sex life I want to ask a few questions about (my) gender, sexuality, identity and deception. \r\nSex, at least for me, can be risky in more ways than one. I’m anally receptive but sexual risk for me is not all about possible exposure to sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), it is also whether a sexual encounter might leave me as a victim of “trans panic”: will the next person who fucks me perhaps beat me senseless before claiming I deceived them and they didn’t know I was AMAB until it was too late? Am I at more risk, and also more deceptive, if a partner thinks I’m a cis-gender woman or a binary transsexual woman? Just where does the line between being “out and proud”, passing and deception lie for me as a non-binary AMAB surviving in a largely binary world? \r\nIn this essay, I thus wish to explore how issues of sex and deception might interact and raise questions for me as a non-binary, AMAB person. In doing so I will attempt to interweave a critical analysis of some media stories of sexual deception with an autoethnographic account of sex. I am not wise enough to have answers to my questions, however, but instead hope that others may do so.",

      "title": "Lessons in romance from middle-aged men who have had affairs",
      "abstract": "Popular talk of romance often involves what men do to court women, and elaborates on women's needs and fantasies. Our culture doesn't appear to worry itself much with the emotional needs of men in relationships, too often dismissing a male's sexual needs as being purely physical. But does that reflect a man's internal reality? Does it even represent the external reality of heterosexual relationships? Do women romance men? If so, how? Recently I witnessed middle-aged men in my practice examining their sexuality with unusual candor. Our discussions led to some surprises. They were re-evaluating their lives in light of changing circumstances, and sexual issues were of concern, especially as waning libido and declining physical abilities made them aware that their sexual lives might not last forever. Several of them were relieved to talk about extramarital affairs. Their descriptions clarified for me how psychoanalytic discussions were currently not inclusive of their ideas. Integral to their experience was the notion of sexual \"generosity\", the antithesis to the \"body narcissism\" of spouses who regularly refused sexual engagement. These men searched for an antidote in the nurturance and other-centered behavior of mistresses, where they discovered a sense of invitation, respect, and even merger, establishing a foundation of acceptance and love of their physical selves. These men recalled how their mistresses romanced them in and out of the bedroom by centering on their needs. Whether through the suggestion of a sexual treat, engagement in a man's favorite outdoor activity, or offering a massage, such responsiveness was unexpected and deeply moving. Erotic acts and dirty talk were often known to be a gift for which these men were grateful. The case material demonstrates complex dynamics where these patients were plagued with ambivalent feelings, guilt, rage, and relief. Some were delightfully confused, being romanced for the first time in their lives. Others used affairs to assuage anger caused by marital rejection and deprivation. The resulting guilt was felt to preserve the marriage. After all, how can you be enraged at someone you've betrayed? A therapist's tendency to be repelled by tales of cheating on an unsuspecting spouse can interfere with the ability to assess the root causes and emotional impact of an affair. I hope this material will contribute to a needed new perspective, and suggest a sexual theory that acknowledges two forms of sexuality: the first, short-term and novel; the second, long-term and comforting, affirming a connection between stable longstanding relationships and sexual arousal. This theory would avoid the dismissal of sexual behavior as being solely predicated on drive discharge and acknowledge that sexuality can originate in the physical excitement that comes with establishing abiding trust and connectedness within a secure relationship.",

      "abstract": "Sexual development is one of the significant traits in an organism’s life because it is closely related to its genetic fitness. The only legacy we pass into subsequent generations are germ cells in the developing gonads. [1] In sex development, there are two distinguishably different processes, namely sex determination and sex differentiation. Sex determination is the developmental decision that directs the bipotential gonad into a sexually dimorphic individual. [2] Sexual differentiation is how the male and female sexual organs develop from bipotential embryonic structures. It involves sequential stages, namely genetic, gonadal, hormonal, phenotypic, and psychological. At the genetic stage, chromosomal sex is determined by the chromosomal constitution after fertilization, where XY denotes male and XX indicates female. Until the sixth week of embryonic life, no sexual difference is observable in the fetus. Undifferentiated gonads of XX or XY are similar in morphology and can form either ovaries or testes. Differentiation of bipotential gonad into either ovaries or testes occurs in the gonadal stage. Followed by gonadal differentiation, the internal genital tract and the external genitalia develop into male or female structures in the phenotypic stage. [3] [4]",

The deficit or distortion of these developmental conditions blocks the satisfaction of the needs of the adolescent's personality, which are the source of sociogenesis. The most vulnerable in the development process are adolescents with developmental disabilities, which is associated with the specifics of the socio-biological conditions in which they grow up. Disorders sensory (visual or hearing), motor or mental spheres in adolescents with disabilities, as well as the specifics of the social situation of their development lead to difficulties in communication, expression of emotions, lower levels of self-control, possession of verbal and nonverbal communication in adolescents of this group. Deprivation or delay in the development of social needs in adolescence can lead to frustration, impoverish the conditions for the development of the individual as a whole. Solving the experimental task of identifying the main social needs of adolescents with developmental disabilities in three different groups (mentally retarded, visually impaired, and hard of hearing) in comparison with normatively developing adolescents, we assume that they will differ in their specificity and severity.",

Slim and fit bodies, obese and carnivalesque bodies, young and old bodies, murdered and mutilated bodies, alien and machinic bodies appear constantly on our television and computer screens, producing diverse modes of entertainment, engagement, and contestation. Media are also ubiquitous in bodies. Media technologies such as personal computers, cell phones, and gaming consoles transform and extend our bodies in all kinds of ways, often leading to cyborgian materialities and subjectivities. Even though people often think of media technologies as producing \"virtual\" as opposed to \"physical\" environments, the body is never absent in media. Bodies can be transcended or reconfigured in online environments, in the sense that children can become adults and vice versa, men can become women and vice versa, bodies can be differently abled, but the body is never absent. Being online often means being seated in front of a computer screen or at the very least having a smartphone in one's hand or pocket. People have sex in Second Life and have of course been having \"phone sex\" for decades (Stone 1995). As Mark Hansen (2006: xvi) puts it, the contemporary moment is one in which we are seeing \"the exteriorization of the human into a convergent media platform and the massive infiltration of technics into the body.\" So while our bodies are never absent, the use of media technologies does transform the ways in which we are embodied.",

To the extent that women's sexual pleasure is represented at all, it is subordinated to that of men and is never an end in itself as is the sexual pleasure of men. What pleases women is the use of their bodies to satisfy male desires. The participants so treated in virtually all heterosexual pornography are women or children, so heterosexual pornography is, as a matter of fact, material which endorses sexual behavior that is degrading and/or abusive to women and children. Control of pornography diminishes freedom—directly the freedom of pornographers, indirectly that of all of us.

      "title": "Untethered lives: Barriers to societal integration as predictors of the sexual orientation disparity in suicidality",
      "abstract": "Abstract Background Despite increasing legal protections and supportive attitudes toward sexual minorities (e.g., those who identify as lesbian, gay, and bisexual [LGB]) in recent decades, suicidality remains more common among this population than among heterosexuals. While barriers to societal integration have been widely theorized as determinants of suicidality for the general population, they have not been comprehensively explored to explain the sexual orientation disparity in suicidality and/or compared to more established contributors. Methods Data come from the cross-sectional Swedish National Public Health Survey, which randomly collected data from individuals (16-84 years of age) annually from 2010 to 2015 (1,281 (2.2%) self-identified as LGB). Analyses examined sexual orientation differences in suicidality (i.e., past-12-month ideation and attempts), and explored the role of barriers to societal integration (i.e., not living with a partner or children, unemployment, and lack of societal trust) in explaining this disparity over-and-above more commonly explored psychological (e.g., depression, substance use) and interpersonal (e.g., discrimination, victimization, lack of social support) suicidality risk factors. Results Compared to heterosexuals, suicidal ideation and attempts were more common among both gay men/lesbians (AORideation: 2.51; AORattempts: 4.66), and bisexuals (AORideation: 3.76; AORattempts: 6.06). Barriers to societal integration mediated the association between sexual orientation and suicidality even in models adjusting for established risk factors for suicidality. Conclusions The disproportionate barriers to societal integration that LGB individuals experience seem important contributors to the elevated risk of suicidality among sexual minorities. Preventive interventions should consider innovative ways to foster societal integration within sexual minority populations and to adjust hetero-centric social institutions to better include sexual minorities.",

This case study clinically explores the complex psychobiosocial interactions for understanding, assessing, and treating sexual problems for couples age 60 years and older, emphasizing the Good Enough Sex approach of variable, flexible, and shared sexual pleasure. Aging couples are discouraged from appraising their sexual experiences within the parameters of the pass/fail binary of the traditional individual performance model and are instead encouraged to embrace the evolving elasticity of their sexual experiences.

      "abstract": "AVE you ever seen a stuttering girl?A girl, that is, who chronically stutters?If so, you have observed a phenomenon which is rare, although stuttering boys are common enough.However badly coordinated or hysterical may be the actions of girls and young women, the disturbances seldom take the form of the annoying repetition of the same syllable which is properly called stuttering.That other form of stammering in which there is a deadlocking of the vocal apparatus so that no sound is uttered for a painfully long period, with practically no other abnormal behavior, is also relatively infrequent in females.Stuttering, and to a less extent stammering in general, is peculiarly a masculine derangement.It is obvious that there must be some connection between this sex-limitation of stuttering, and the cause or causes of the trouble.The source of stuttering must be sought in some peculiarity of the language function of the male which is not found in the language function of the female, and not, as is popularly supposed, in mere shock, fright or 'nervousness.'I have heard detailed stories concerning various stutterers, dating the beginnings of their speech difficulty from a severe fright in one case, from the shock of an accident in another case, from an attack of typhoid which left a weakened system in another, and soon.Even if we were not forced to discount these histories heavily, we would be obliged to conclude that they are only contributing causes; agencies which by weakening the resistance gave the real cause a chance to get in its deadly work.The theory of stuttering which suggests itself most",

      "abstract": "One of the most common reported postpartum concerns, linked with relationship dissatisfaction, is how body image will affect sexuality. Outside of the postpartum period, feeling more satisfied with one's body is linked with feeling more sexually and relationally satisfied, with some cross-sectional evidence that sexual satisfaction mediates these associations. This dyadic daily experience study examined how new parents' daily satisfaction with their own and their partner's bodies relates to their own sexual satisfaction, and in turn, their own and their partner's relationship satisfaction during a vulnerable time in their sexual and romantic relationship-3- to 4-months postpartum. First-time parent couples (N = 240) completed 21 daily surveys. On days when birthing parents reported greater satisfaction than usual with their own or their partner's body, they reported higher sexual satisfaction and in turn, higher relationship satisfaction. On days when non-birthing parents reported greater satisfaction with their own or their partner's body, they reported higher sexual satisfaction and in turn, both parents reported higher relationship satisfaction. Evidence of bidirectionality was also observed such that relationship satisfaction mediated links between body satisfaction and sexual satisfaction. Findings support that daily body satisfaction is important for both sexual and relationship satisfaction among postpartum couples.",

      "abstract": "THE kind of prejudice which will concern us here is limited to the irrational, negative, or hostile attitude, more or less intensely held and/or expressed by one individual or group toward members of another group, and elicited primarily by the fact of their group membership. The understanding of prejudice has in recent years become one of the major concerns of social science. Numerous studies undertaken during the past decade have considerably increased comprehension of the phenomenon. The earlier notion that the cause of prejudice was to be sought in the nature of its object has all but disappeared. It is sometimes still encountered, but chiefly as a conciliatory gesture to stimulus-response theory (if a response exists, some stimulus must have called it forth) or, almost apologetically stated, as a variant of Merton's (33) self-fulfilling prophecy (minority groups develop certain characteristics as defenses against prejudice or because of limitations imposed upon them). Early studies of prejudice were mostly statistical or descriptive-how many people in a given group showed prejudices, in what areas, against which groups. More recent research has dealt largely with personality correlates of prejudice, its development in children, and to a lesser extent with social, cultural, and situational factors which lead to its growth or favor its expression. As one consequence of these investigations, prejudice has come to be recognized as a symptom in a total personality configuration or syndrome, appearing under given social and historical conditions, as the review by Van Til and Denemark (50) indicated.",

On the other hand, within-sex analyses of who is more likely to engage in a short-term relationship have been somewhat neglected. Therefore, the aim of this study was to compare proportions of individuals interested in short-term relationships (if single) or extra-pair relationships (if pair-bonded) in groups of different ages, incomes and education levels. While the proportion of single women interested in short-term relationships differed among those groups, men of all ages, incomes and education levels were equally interested in short-term relationships. The proportion of pairbonded individuals interested in extra-pair relationship also differed among age groups (both men and women) and income levels (men only), but not across education levels. Furthermore, we tried to determine the structure of sex differences in mate preferences within the temporal context of a relationship. The discriminant analyses showed that mate preferences which mostly differentiated men and women seeking a short-term relationship were good looks and good financial prospects. In a long-term relationship context, three more preferences differentiating men from women have emerged: emotional stability and maturity, favorable social status and dependable character.",

      "abstract": "Masa remaja akhir merupakan masa dimana individu mengalami perkembangan minat terhadap lawan jenis dan mulai mempersiapkan diri untuk menjalankan tugas perkembangan masa dewasa, terutama dalam memilih pasangan hidup dan membentuk keluarga. Perkembangan minat heteroseksualitas pada remaja ditunjukkan dengan adanya masa pacaran. Pasangan yang berpacaran akan memiliki dorongan seksual yang besar sehingga dapat melibatkan mereka dalam interaksi seksual, seperti melakukan hubungan seksual ketika berpacaran (premarital sex).\r\nTerjadinya\tperilaku premarital\tsex\tini\ttidak\tterlepas\tdari\tadanya\r\nmotivasi/dorongan dalam diri individu. Adapun tiga motif utama yang dapat mendorong remaja melakukan premarital sex, yaitu intimacy, feeling of affection, dan experience erotic pleasure motives. Salah satu faktor yang dapat mempengaruhi motivasi mahasiswi remaja akhir untuk melakukan premarital sex adalah persepsi mereka mengenai virginitas. Hal ini dikarenakan dalam konsep virginitas mengandung pengertian sebagai suatu kondisi perempuan yang belum melakukan hubungan seksual dengan lawan jenisnya, dan umumnya secara fisik ditandai dengan utuhnya selaput dara. Oleh sebab itu, penelitian ini bertujuan untuk mengetahui apakah ada hubungan antara motivasi untuk melakukan premarital sex pada mahasiswi remaja akhir dengan persepsi mengenai virginitasnya.\r\nSubjek penelitian yang digunakan (N=77) adalah mahasiswi remaja akhir berusia 18-22 tahun, sedang dan/atau pernah berpacaran, dan berkuliah di Fakultas Psikologi Universitas Katolik Widya Mandala Surabaya. Pengambilan sampel penelitian ini menggunakan teknik incidental sampling, dan pengumpulan datanya menggunakan skala motivasi untuk melakukan premarital sex dan skala persepsi mengenai virginitas. Data yang diperoleh dianalisis menggunakan teknik korelasi non parametrik kendall's tau b.\r\nHasil analisis datanya mendapatkan koefisien korelasi(rxy) sebesar -0,429 dengan p= 0,000 (p<0,05) yang berarti bahwa ada hubungan negatif yang signifikan antara motivasi untuk melakukan premarital sex pada mahasiswi remaja akhir dengan persepsi mengenai virginitasnya. Dengan demikian dapat disimpulkan bahwa semakin tinggi motivasi yang dimiliki oleh mahasiswi remaja akhir untuk melakukan premarital sex maka persepsinya mengenai virginitas akan semakin rendah (negatif), begitu pula sebaliknya.",

      "abstract": "Esports’ gender-based inequalities remain intractable, particularly among the highest levels of competition and also, increasingly, in the burgeoning North American collegiate esports scene. Rather than viewing these inequalities as merely incidental to the professionalization of competitive gaming, particularly in North America, I argue that esports arose as a response to the threat of greater gender-based equity in gaming cultures. Esports does not have a gender problem; it is a gender problem. This article connects three historical transformations in the history of professionalized spectator sports in order to constitute a media genealogy of esports and a prehistory of its gender troubles. Through a series of vignettes—a late nineteenth-century boxing match, a mid-twentieth-century football game, and a 2008 esports tournament—I trace the development of “kinaesthetic masculinity”: the capacity for masculine subjects to feel a sense of belonging, by virtue of broadcasting media techniques and infrastructures, to aestheticized (and most often violent) competition between men.",

Players develop do-it-yourself solutions and accommodate themselves with the circumstances. Furthermore, it is quite impossible neither to share playing experiences nor to play together on the same device. Consequently, this practice is not considered as a legitimate part of the cultural activities nor of sociability networks, the game goes unnoticed even to the users themselves.",

      "title": "Topical Review: Fetal Testosterone and Sex Differences in Typical Social Development and in Autism",
      "abstract": "Experiments in animals leave no doubt that androgens, including testosterone, produced by the testes in fetal and/or neonatal life act on the brain to induce sex differences in neural structure and function. In human beings, there is evidence supporting a female superiority in the ability to read nonverbal signals, specific language-related skills, and theory of mind. Even more striking than the sex differences seen in the typical population is the elevated occurrence of social and communicative difficulties in human males. One such condition, autism, occurs four times more frequently in boys than in girls. Recently, a novel theory known as the ``extreme male brain'' has been proposed. It suggests that the behaviors seen in autism are an exaggeration of typical sex differences and that exposure to high levels of prenatal testosterone might be a risk factor. In this article, we argue that prenatal and neonatal testosterone exposures are strong candidates for having a causal role in sexual dimorphism in human behavior, including social development, and as risk factors for conditions characterized by social impairments, particularly autism spectrum conditions.

      "abstract": "Feminine trans individuals (i.e., individuals who were assigned male at birth but who have a feminine gender presentation and identity) are present in many cultures. In some cultures, these individuals identify as (trans) women. Many of these individuals undergo medical treatments to feminize their bodies (e.g., breast augmentation), but most do not undergo vaginoplasties and therefore have penises. In many non-Western cultures, feminine trans individuals identify as a non-binary gender (i.e., neither man, nor woman). Many of these individuals do not surgically augment their bodies. Across cultures, some men express sexual interest in feminine trans individuals. Are manifestations of sexual interest in feminine trans individuals consistent across Western and non-Western cultural settings? Our review suggests that, across cultures, most of these men are also sexually attracted to cisgender individuals. Many are sexually attracted to cisgender women or to cisgender members of both sexes. A small subset is sexually attracted to cisgender men. Men who are sexually interested in feminine trans individuals commonly report being primarily insertive during anal sex. Additionally, they tend to report that their sexual interest in these individuals is motivated by attraction to femininity or to the combination female- and male-typical characteristics.",

It is a progressive disease associated with many vascular and cardiac risk factors. The subject of sexual dysfunction is more widely discussed in the media as a result of newer therapies that have become available in the past decade. Therefore, men and women of all ages are seeking assistance to improve their sexual relationships. Male sexual dysfunction refers to a problem with one or more of the four components of male sexual function, i.e. libido, erection, ejaculation or orgasm, that interferes with the ability or interest to engage in sexual intercourse. Psychological and physical factors as well as drugs may affect male sexual dysfunction. Female sexual dysfunction has both psychogenic and organic causes, related to desire, arousal, orgasm and sexual pain disorders. This article focuses mainly on erectile dysfunction (ED) in males. However, it is important to remember that the sexual partner plays an integral role in the successful and effective management of the ED patient.",

      "abstract": "Female primates carry and nurse the fetus, and thus have the first responsibility for rearing the offspring. Assuming males are at least equally adept at obtaining food, males might either share surplus food with females or consume the food themselves. The distribution of this surplus is the subject of a battle of the sexes. If females succeed in obtaining a large share of the surplus, then there is little size dimorphism between males and females; otherwise males might use the surplus themselves to become larger and stronger, and to engage in sexual competition with other males. Besides competing with males, females may compete with each other. Dependency may coincide with sexual competitiveness (sexiness). This paper introduces these ideas in a game theoretic setting and derives a simple bound, called the ‘female condition, on the male ‘sexiness’ required for a nonsupportive strategy to be worthwhile.",

      "abstract": "Studies of mate choice commonly ignore variation in preferences and assume that all individuals should favor the highest-quality mate available. However, individuals may differ in their mate preferences according to their own age, experience, size, or genotype. In the present study, we highlight another simple reason why preferences may differ: if there is costly competition for mates, the poorest competitors might be better off avoiding the highest-quality partners and instead targeting low-quality partners, so that they minimize the costs they incur. We present a game-theoretical model of mate choice in which males of differing quality compete for access to females and try to retain them till the time of mating. Our model predicts that high-quality males, who are better competitors, have a preference for the best females that is typically several times stronger than that of low-quality males. Early in the competitive period, the latter may even prefer low-quality females over high-quality females. Thus, variation in competitive ability generates variation in both the strength and direction of preferences. Differences in competitive ability result in assortative mating with respect to quality, which is reinforced by variation in preferences. As the time of mating draws near and there is an increased risk of ending up unpaired, all males become indifferent to the quality of potential mates. Our findings are equally applicable to female choice for males, and offer a new explanation for adaptive variation in mating preferences based on differing abilities to cope with the costs of mate choice.",

      "abstract": "While substantial research attention has been paid to the disproportionately high levels of fear of crime among women relative to men, less attention has been paid to the apparent mirror of this: that men have disproportionately more concern for female partners than women do for male partners. The work that does exist on fear for partners has focused exclusively on different-sex partnerships. The present article proposes and explores several explanations for sex differences in fear for partners among different-sex as well as same-sex partnerships. The analysis uses a sample of persons who live with a partner (155 in same-sex and 2,817 in different-sex partnerships) from a Seattle survey that includes measures of altruistic fear, as well as measures of personal, familial, sexual assault, and sexual identity bias victimizations. Results suggest that female partners inspire more fear regardless of the sex of the respondents, that sex differences persist even after perceptions of danger are accounted for, and that personal fears and fears for children are positively associated with fears for partners and do not explain sex differences in such fears. These results are more consistent with explanations rooted in gendered perceptions of vulnerability and the shadow of sexual assault than explanations rooted in the differential gender socialization of men as protectors or of a limited capacity for fear.",

      "abstract": "Sexuality as a human need for belonging and being close with someone, as a need for affiliation and physical pleasure is typical for all ages in the life span development [1]. In regard to human needs sexuality is a goal (the need) and a mean through which individuals satisfy their needs. Sexuality has a significant impact on individual's self-esteem, well-being, and functioning; it includes personal, cultural and social identity, and not just sexual orientation and behaviour [2]. The need for sexuality and intimacy is maintained in old age [3], only modes of sexual expression can be different concerning individual's age. In addition to physical sexual relations elderly can express sexuality through hugging, fondling, kissing, holding hands, touching or physical closeness [3, 4], through demonstrating mutual tenderness, support, and under‐ standing, and through developing a new partnership relationship [5].",

      "abstract": "[Please see published material] - Not my type is the usual invocation when rejecting potential lovers who don’t align with the racial hierarchy of mating preferences. The largely unchallenged norm of interracial intimacy aversion, particularly how the desire for some racial groups and rejection of others reinforces existing racial inequities, is inconsistent with the blanket notion of greater interracial acceptance. Our investigation assessed the openness of monoracial and multiracial individuals to form interracial romantic relationships. We partially replicated an interracial mate preference known as the Multiracial Dividend Effect, finding that most monoracial groups equally preferred same-race lovers and interracially dating multiracials, and they preferred interracially dating someone multiracial over any monoracial group, whereas Multiracials were more open to interracially dating any monoracial group than monoracials were to interracially dating each other. In addition, Hispanic-White and East Asian-White multiracials were more open to interracially dating White individuals than their respective monoracial in-group members, and East Asian-White multiracials were more open to interracially dating all monoracial minority groups than monoracial East Asian participants. Finally, half-White multiracials are more likely to be in partial-racial couples (e.g., former President of the United States Barack Obama is Black-White multiracial and the former First Lady of the United States, Michelle Obama, is Black) whereas interminority multiracials are more likely to be in 100% interracial/non-overlapping couples (e.g., Vice President of the United States Kamala Harris is interminority Tamil Indian and Black whereas the Second Gentleman of the United States, Doug Emhoff, is White).",

Both groups reported similar values, levels of self-esteem, and capacity for intimacy.

A majority of women in lesbian couples (58%) and a third of women in heterosexual couples reported choosing the orientation of their current sexual relationship. Women with male partners did not perceive major differences between homosexual and heterosexual relationships, citing sexual attraction as the primary reason they chose a male partner. In contrast, many women with female partners characterized lesbian relationships as more intimate and equal, and less gender-role stereotyped, frequently citing these characteristics, along with sexual attraction, as reasons for their relationship preference.",

      "abstract": "[EN]\r\nThe definition of cyberspace addiction concerns a relatively new and poorly studied problem in clinical and consulting psychology. The most common definition of internet addiction defines this specific behavior as obsessive pursuit of the patient to enter the network and his inability to get out of it in time. Our study shows that the gender more endangered to development of addiction to Internet are women, although men have the same habits of stay in the virtual environment plus two additional activities to which women do not exhibit substantial interest - computer games and eroticism. Cyber-dependents compensate for failures in social, family and personal life by the reality experienced in front of the monitor commutating their relationships - live (Internet mostly) or computer-modeled (games mostly) to achieve recognition, pleasurable experiences or a getaway from frustrating obligations and expectations.\r\nEntering in a role is an essential component of the experience in the virtual environment. Thus insecure, introverted or hypomanic personalities, individuals who do not know any better way of mastering their emotions and contact with others, achieve subjectively satisfactory social realization.\r\nThe computer can serve as means to satisfy compensatory behavior. Through the PC the individual can offset the need for independence and rejection of rapprochement with others and to oppose privacy interference. Essential element of compensatory behavior in the use of computer is the need to avoid failures. This is the risk profile of a student 14-15 years of age with negative social resonance regardless of location, with pronounced either dominant, or subordinate type, and low self-control (regardless of location). The chance of developing cyber-dependence is three times higher in people with hypomanic type compared to those within the norm.\r\nIn the city, the chance pupils 14-18 years of age with positive social resonance type to develop an addiction to cyberspace is 66.8 percent lower than a the one of a student with negative social resonance. For individuals designated as dominant type the risk is 3.2 times higher than for those identified as neutral type; the likelihood for individuals defined as subordinate type to develop dependency is 4,778 times higher than for the neutral type.\r\n////////////\r\n////////////\r\n[BG]\r\nОпределението пристрастеност във виртуалното пространство касае един относително нов и недобре проучен проблем в клиничната и консултативната психология\r\nСпоред най-разпространеното определение интернет пристрастеност е обсесивен стремеж на пациента да влезе в мрежата и неспособността му да излезе навреме оттам.\r\nПо-застрашеният пол за развитие на зависимост към интернет е женският, въпреки че мъжете имат същите навици при престой във виртуалната среда, както жените, плюс още две дейности, към които жените не проявяват съществен интерес – компютърните игри и еротиката. Зависимите компенсират неблагополучия в социалния, семейния и личния живот посредством реалността, която преживяват пред монитора, като комутация на връзките си със субекти – живи (предимно в интернет) или компютърно моделирани (предимно в игрите), за да постигнат признание, удоволствени преживявания, бягство от фрустриращи задължения и очаквания към тях.\r\nВлизането в роля е съществен компонент от преживяването във виртуалната среда, като неуверените, интровертни или хипоманийни личности, индивидите, които не умеят добре да владеят емоциите си и контакта с околните, постигат посредством компютъра субективно задоволителна социална реализация.\r\nКомпютърът може да служи като средство за удовлетворяване на компенсаторното поведение. Посредством компютъра личността може да компенсира потребността от самостоятелност и отказ от сближаване с другите, както и да се противопостави при намеса в личното ? пространство. Сред съществените елементи на компенсаторното поведение при употребата на компютър е потребността от избягване на неуспехи.\r\nРисковият профил е на ученик на възраст между 14-15 години, с негативен социален резонанс независимо от населеното място, с добре изразен или доминантен, или подчиняем тип и понижен самоконтрол (също независим от населеното място). Шансът от развитие на зависимост към виртуалното пространство е три пъти по-висок при лицата с хипоманиен тип в сравнение с лицата в норма.\r\nВ големия град шансът ученик във възрастовата група 14-18 години с позитивен тип социален резонанс да развие пристрастеност към виртуалното пространство е с 66,8% процента по-нисък спрямо ученик с негативен социален резонанс. Рискът при лицата, определени като доминантен тип, е 3,2 пъти по-висок спрямо лицата, определени като неутрален тип, а вероятността към зависимост за лицата, определени като подчиняем тип, е 4,778 пъти по-висока спрямо неутрален тип.",

      "abstract": "This chapter aims to propose an ethnomethodologically informed, and therefore distinctively sociological, understanding of gender as a routine, methodical, and recurring accomplishment. Analyses of sex and gender in the social sciences, though less likely to accept uncritically the naive biological determinism of the view just presented, often retain a conception of sex-linked behaviors and traits as essential properties of individuals. Gender may be routinely fashioned in a variety of situations that seem conventionally expressive to begin with, such as those that present “helpless” women next to heavy objects or flat tires. Many situations are not clearly sex categorized to begin with, nor is what transpires within them obviously gender relevant. Subsequently, little boys appropriate the gender ideal of “efficaciousness,” that is, being able to affect the physical and social environment through the exercise of physical strength or appropriate skills. Thus gender differences, or the sociocultural shaping of “essential female arid male natures,” achieve the status of objective facts.",

      "abstract": "Our society normally regulates a certain range of activities; it is illegal to perform these activities unless one has received prior permission to do so. We require automobile operators to have licenses. We forbid people from practicing medicine, law, pharmacy, or psychiatry unless they have satisfied certain licensing requirements. These general criteria for regulatory licensing can certainly be applied to parents. First, parenting is an activity potentially very harmful to children. The potential for harm is apparent: each year more than half a million children are physically abused or neglected by their parents. Many millions more are psychologically abused or neglected not given love, respect, or a sense of self-worth. The results of this maltreatment are obvious. Abused children bear the physical and psychological scars of maltreatment throughout their lives. Far too often they turn to crime. They are far more likely than others to abuse their own children. Even if these maltreated children never harm anyone, they will probably never be well-adjusted, happy adults. Therefore, parenting clearly satisfies the first criterion of activities subject to regulation. This discussion is abhorrent and needs to be supplanted with a more child-centered view. Parents who hold this view may well maltreat their children. If these parents happen to treat their children well, it is only because they want to, not because they think their children deserve or have a right to good treatment. Moreover, this belief is manifestly at odds with the conviction that parents should prepare children for life as adults. Children subject to parents who perceive children in this way are likely to be adequately prepared for adulthood. Hence, to prepare children for life as adults and to protect them from maltreatment, this attitude toward children must be dislodged. As I have argued, licensing is a viable way to protect children. Furthermore, it would increase the likelihood that more children will be adequately prepared for life as adults than is now true.",

There are relatively specific effects of X‐linked genes on social cognition, language, emotional regulation, visuospatial, and numerical skills. Many human X‐linked genes outside the X–Y pairing pseudoautosomal regions escape X‐inactivation. Dosage differences in the expression of such genes (which constitute at least 15% of the total) are likely to play an important role in male–female neural differentiation, and in cognitive deficits and behavioral characteristics, particularly in the realm of social communication, that are associated with sex chromosome aneuploidies. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

      "title": "Gender Segregation in Nursery School: Predictors and Outcomes.",
      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Sex segregation is a powerful phenomenon in childhood. It occurs universally whenever children have a choice of playmates and is found in sub-human primates too. Adults are not directly responsible for sex segregation. Data do not support the hypothesis that the most ladylike girls and the most rough and active boys first form the segregated play groups that emerge in nursery school. Modest evidence indicates that participation in all-girl play groups serves a positive socializing function for girls. For boys, no such evidence was found. Recent findings contribute to the growing body of evidence that the cultures developed by boys and girls in their segregated groups are distinctive and serve different functions. Altogether, these findings and results of primate studies suggest that females are first to initiate segregation to avoid being dominated by males. These conjectures, however, do not explain why boys avoid playing with girls. It is concluded that gender segregation appears to be relatively intractable; it may be unwise for adults to try to prevent boys and girls from choosing same-sex playmates in unstructured play situations. Adults can play a very large role, though, in setting up structured situations in which cross-sex interactions can occur without placing on children the burden of letting their peers see that they have chosen a cross-sex partner.

      "abstract": "AbstractThe roots of deviance are often sought in the family of origin, and the families of male heroin addicts have not escaped such attention. (See Seldin, 1972, for a review of this literature.) A composite picture derived from the previously reported findings summarized in Table 1 suggests that the addict's mother is typically the dominant and pathological parent, while the father is either weak or absent. Yet it is usually the mother who is seen in positive terms by the addict himself, and the father who is viewed negatively. Presumably in many cases the addict simply accepts his mother's negative view of his father. Some common consequences of this family situation have been reported: (1) the addict's mother may depreciate her son because she sees him as like her husband, and the addict may incorporate his mother's negative appraisal into his self-concept; (2) the addict may experience unusual difficulty in achieving independence from his mother; (3) when he does, he may then select a similarly deviant woman for a mate; and (4) both wife and mother may unconsciously attempt to perpetuate the addict's drug use.",

Health\n issues were analysed from 6854 dogs and behavioural aspects from 1063 adult\n dogs between the ages of four and eight years. The observations made by the\n owners were correlated with sex, age, reproductive status and age at gonadectomy of the dogs. Only a few behavioural\n differences were found between gonadectomized and\n intact dogs. Dogs which were spayed/neutered before\n social maturity were considered to be more anxious than intact conspecifics.\n No association between prepubertal castration and\n aggression towards conspecifics of the same sex was found.

      "title": "Social relationships of immigrant and resident female mountain gorillas. I. Male‐female relationships",
      "abstract": "Adult males are important social partners for all females in mountain gorilla social groups, but male-female relationships can vary in association with variation in female residence status, male age and mating status, and relatedness. Such variation occurred in a large group observed over a 3-year period. All females associated and interacted affiliatively relatively often with a young silverback with whom all mated. Long-term resident females also did so with an old, non-breeding male to whom most were related, but recent immigrants spent little time near him and had few non-aggressive interactions with him. The old male made agonistic interventions to support relatives; interventions in female conflicts by the younger male tended to ameliorate competitive differentials that immigrants faced and may have helped him to retain them as mates. Males aggression toward females was common, most probably served as a mating tactic, and did not involve resource competition. Extensive grooming by an adolescent male suggests that males may also use affiliative behavior to develop mating relationships. Females may have competed for proximity with and social access to the younger silverback; competitive success could influence how well females and their offspring are protected by silver-backs, but the extent of such competition was not clear. Large group size may have heightened differentiation of male-female relationships and competition among females, but comparative data from smaller groups generally corroborate the findings from the large group. © 1992 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",

      "title": "Gender and Ethnicity in Dating, Hanging Out, and Hooking Up: Sexual Scripts Among Hispanic and White Young Adults",
      "abstract": "We examined the scripts associated with heterosexual Hispanic and White young adults' most recent initial sexual or romantic encounter using two samples of heterosexual undergraduates: 224 Hispanic students (49% female) and 316 White students (51% female). Scripts were identified for three types of encounters: dating, hanging out, and hooking up. The three scripts had more than half of their actions in common. Items such as get to know one another, feel aroused, and engage in physical contact were present across all scripts for all participant groups. As expected, traditional gender roles were present within all scripts, but more so for dates than for hangouts and hookups. Men reported a higher presence of traditional gender roles than women across scripts and put a higher priority on the goal of physical intimacy across all scripts. Dating was the most prevalent script for all young adults, contradicting contemporary claims that \"dating is dead.\" In terms of ethnicity, a higher proportion of Hispanic than White young adults went on dates, and a higher proportion of White students went on hookups, implying that social and contextual variables are important in understanding young adults' intimate relationships.",

      "abstract": "Las investigaciones realizadas en los últimos años en el área del deporte y la educación física, resaltan la existencia de un clima hostil hacia las diversidades en este ámbito. Además, reconocen la importancia del papel del profesorado de educación física como agente implicado en un cambio de sensibilidad. Con este estudio se persigue conocer las opiniones y actuaciones del profesorado de educación física en relación con la homofobia y a la aceptación de diferentes tipos de masculinidades en sus clases. La investigación se lleva a cabo mediante entrevistas realizadas a 10 docentes de educación física en Andalucía. Los resultados destacan la sensibilidad que estos docentes dicen que tienen hacia la diversidad sexual en sus aulas, afirmando que tienen un trato cordial y respetuoso con estas personas. Sin embargo, estas afirmaciones a veces se contradicen con otras declaraciones de este profesorado, que en muchos casos reproducen de manera inconsciente estereotipos con su alumnado, transmitiendo una educación discriminativa. Por tanto, podemos concluir que existe un pequeño número de chicos y chicas que no se amoldan a los patrones sociales asignados a los hombres y a las mujeres, sin embargo, la gran mayoría de estos chicos sufren discriminaciones y hasta agresiones por no cumplir con los principios de la masculinidad impuesta.Palabras clave: homosexualidad, masculinidades, educación física, profesorado, igualdad, coeducación.Abstract: Current researches in sport and physical education underline existence of a hostile climate for diversities in this area. In addition, scholars recognize important role of physical education teachers as involved agent in the change of sensitivity. This study aims to know the opinions and engagements of physical education teachers regarding homophobia and acceptation of different kind of masculinities in their classes. The research was carried out with interviews to 10 physical education teachers in Andalusia. The results highlight the sensitivity that these teachers affirm to have towards sexual diversity in their classes, asserting being friendly and respectful with this part of the population. Nevertheless, sometimes such assertions contradict other assertions of these teachers, transmitting a discriminative education. Consequently, we conclude that there is a small group of girls and boys who don’t adjust to social patterns assinged to men and women, nevertheless, most of them suffer discriminations, even harassments by not fulfill with the principles of imposed masculinity.Key words: homosexuality, masculinities, physical education, teachers, equity, coeducation.",

      "abstract": "Several species can detect when they are uncertain about what decision to make-revealed by opting out of the choice, or by seeking more information before deciding. However, we do not know whether any nonhuman animals recognize when they need more information to make a decision because new evidence contradicts an already-formed belief. Here, we explore this ability in great apes and human children. First, we show that after great apes saw new evidence contradicting their belief about which of two rewards was greater, they stopped to recheck the evidence for their belief before deciding. This indicates the ability to keep track of the reasons for their decisions, or 'rational monitoring' of the decision-making process. Children did the same at 5 years of age, but not at 3 years. In a second study, participants formed a belief about a reward's location, but then a social partner contradicted them, by picking the opposite location. This time even 3-year-old children rechecked the evidence, while apes ignored the disagreement. While apes were sensitive only to the conflict in physical evidence, the youngest children were more sensitive to peer disagreement than conflicting physical evidence.",

      "abstract": "The Prakriti (genetic constitution) and Kala (season) are extra ordinarily related with each other from the origin of a Prakriti due to many common and mutual factors. Naturally the effect of Kala on the Prakriti is unavoidable. The off springs from the conjugation of same Sukra (sperm) and Shonita (ovum) are not alike by Prakriti , because the time of conception or fertilization of the ovum might be different. The prominent Doshas during the time of conception has got definite role in the formation of Prakriti during conception, as well as birth also. If the time predominates the Vata dosha , there must be certain qualities of Vata Dosha , even though the conjugating Sukra and Shonita may be of different Dosha . In such cases the chances of mixed Prakriti is more. The Charakacharya said that, a chance of Sama prakriti find is very difficult or rare. Most of the Prakrities are Vatala, Pittala and Sleshmala with predominance of Vata, Pitta and Kapha respectively. The season has great role in the genetic constitution because the fertilization of ovum also depends upon the time. Sushruta said, after the cessation of the Rajo darshana (menstrual period) the 12 nights are useful for fertilization only. The modern physiology also states that the mature ovum get discharged through one of the two ovaries, every month, on or around the 14th day of cycle and so the period round about the 14th day is best for definite conception. This clearly shows the relation of Kala (season) and Prakriti (genetic constitution) since its origin and again ahead throughout the life time. Nowadays, the nature is changing its qualities due to various atmospheric changes like pollution, space experiments, heavy industrialization and population crisis. So while studying the effects of Kala (season) one has to face the hyper/ hypo and perverted faculties of Kala (season) which are affecting the generations. So the study of Kala (season) in respect of its various effects on Prakriti (genetic constitution), will be the essential thing in future. As per Ayurveda, Ritucharya (seasonal lifestyle) should be followed for prevention of diseases arising from variations in Tridosha due to Kala (season). In present study, we tried to advocate Ritucharya (seasonal lifestyle) with respect to Prakriti (genetic constitution).Â",

      "abstract": "When identifying with a character in a narrative, one experiences the narrative from the character's perspective, as if the events were happening to oneself.Many researchers and theorists have suggested that a character's similarity to the audience member should be related to identification.Although some research supports this relationship, it has rarely been tested directly.Additionally, higher identification may lead to more learning from a narrative.These two proposed links, between character similarity and identification, and between identification and learning, suggest that children may learn more from narratives that contain characters who are similar to them than from narratives with dissimilar characters.There is, however, another side to the coin: Reading about (and perhaps identifying with) dissimilar characters may decrease children's outgroup biases.This study tests these two possibilities, examining race as a point of similarity.Findings suggest that (1) White children may be more likely to identify with own-race characters than with other-race characters, (2) White children do not appear to learn more from stories with own-race characters than those with other-race characters when knowledge is probed via specific questions, but do freely recall more information from stories with own-race characters, and (3) Exposure to a storybook with a Black main character does not reduce White children's racial bias.These findings inform our understanding of the nature and effects of children's identification with ownand other-race characters.",

      "title": "The effect of cartoon movies on children's gender development",
      "abstract": "Cartoon movies which are necessary sources of fun for children also have educational aspects. Innocent display of cartoons which give many subtle messages include various negativities. One of these negativities is related with the characters’ gender. Characters in cartoon movies include females, males, animals and inanimate objects. While male and female characters’ roles are shaped according to existing stereotypical role models in society, animal and inanimate characters have anthropomorphic characteristics like walking on two feet or speaking. Such characters have their places in these movies with their human-like characteristics. Animal and inanimate characters are sometimes designed on the bases of stereotypical female and male role models and sometimes these characters are seen as asexual or homosexual. In some cartoon movies, transformations between sexes draw attention. For example, a character designed as female can be transformed into male via a magical process. Such changes of sex, asexuality and representation of characters according to the stereotypical role models are alarming. The fact that children spend much of their time watching television and especially choose such movies augments these concerns. Children coming across with such complicated gender role models will affect them negatively in the future years of their lives. This study, “The Effect of Cartoon Movies on Children's Gender Development”, will analyze these cartoons in which complicated gender role models are presented critically and propose some solutions to this problem. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Intersexual should not be used when referring to those showing the endocrine phenomena of postnatal virilization or feminization; the person with an abnormal psychosexual drive; or the individual with just any form of bisexual manifestation. The correct diagnosis of intersexual problems may be difficult, but with the routine careful inspection of the genitals of all infants at birth, disastrous errors may be prevented.

      "abstract": "Gay and lesbian theatre proliferated in the nineteen nineties in the United States, yet theatre by and for young people remains largely unaffected by this phenomenon. In both theatre for young audiences (TYA) and high school theatre, plays including gay and lesbian characters or any mention of homosexuality are rare, reflecting the degree to which heteronormativity dominates the field. When homosexuality is represented in TYA it is often treated as a calamity, discreetly packaged in plays intended to teach lessons about tolerance. In the last decade, a small body of drama for young people has emerged that includes gay and lesbian characters characterized by a discourse of \"troubled gay youth,\" which limits representation to those who are victimized because of their sexuality. This negative discourse perpetuates the notion that \"being gay\" puts youth at risk for a plethora of problems by indicating that lesbian, gay, or queer youth will likely become either victims of self-hatred or victims of social hatred. However, queer plays that move beyond these heteronormative restrictions have developed in countries outside of the U.S. and are readily available for production.1",

Does this incongruence reflect a dissonance between sex and gender, specifically, or a broader tension in the perception of minds and bodies? To address this question, here we gauged mind–body intuitions in transgender and cisgender individuals. Results showed that transgender participants considered the mind as more ethereal, as more resilient to the obliteration of one's body by death (in Experiment 1) and to its swapping with another person's body (in Experiment 2). Remarkably, these intuitions emerged even when participants were asked to consider psychological traits that are unrelated to gender (e.g., forming sentences). They also correlated with participants' own gender identity. These results reveal striking psychological differences between transgender and cisgender individuals. In the eyes of transgender people, the self is aligned more strongly with the ethereal mind, rather than with the body.",

      "abstract": "An introductory course on gender so often begins with this distinction: sex is about the physical differences between female and male, while gender is about the social constructions involved in being female and male. Of course, this distinction has been challenged, stretched, and examined in a myriad of ways (e.g. Hoodwilliams 1995; Oyewumi 1997). Whether the distinction holds, it does suggest an underlying question: what is the relationship of the corporeal body to social practice? In the practice of sport, the body is central. The physical manipulation of one's body to achieve an end is, of course, mapped with multiple political, economic, social, cultural, psychological, and spiritual forces. Yet the body remains pivotal to the practice. Hence, within sport, the varied social practices that rest on beliefs and assumptions about physical possibilities, including those of sexual difference, are magnified. One historically specific expression of this naturalizes sport as masculine and a code for heterosexual male superiority and domination over the feminine, which in turn is distinctly unathletic. Under such an ideology, female athletes, gay or straight, put their \"femininity\" at risk, threaten the social order, and invite disapproval and hostility because they \"act\" male. In spite of this, many feminists view (and female athletes have certainly experienced) sport as an embodied practice which can liberate girls and women from a constraining hegemonic feminine ideal. Gay male athletes also disrupt this social order that equates \"masculine\" physicality with heterosexuality. In a milieu where sport occupies an important social role and the normative for sport is heterosexual and male, an athlete who deviates poses a critical challenge.",

      "title": "Against racial profiling",
      "abstract": "A police officer sees a suspicious bulge in the pocket of a passing pedestrian and deliberates whether to stop and search. The pedestrian is also a young, black man, and from past searches and convictions, the police arguably know that such men are much likelier than other people to carry an illegal firearm. Should the police officer be instructed to take this information into account? This article objects to racial profiling because it relies on the following type of inference: from the individual’s membership of a certain racial group, the searcher is invited to infer that the individual is likelier to exhibit some culpable behaviour. The article shows that such an inference to culpable behaviour requires contradictory presuppositions about the freedom of the suspected behaviour. On the one hand, racial profiling ought to presuppose that the individual suspect’s behaviour is unfree because the inference it involves takes the suspect’s behaviour to be determined by his race, age, and gender, none of which is within his control. On the other hand, similarly to criminal trials, search practices ought also to presuppose the exact opposite: that the individual is free to determine his own behaviour. If the suspected behaviour is free, the involved inference to culpable behaviour is not probative of the individual suspect’s behaviour, so profiling methods which rely on it are useless. And if the suspected behaviour is unfree, the inference is probative, but the suspect is not culpable and should thus not be put to trial, whatever the profiled search yields.",

      "abstract": "Opponents of lesbian and gay parental rights claim that children with lesbigay parents are at higher risk for a variety of negative outcomes. Yet most research in psychology concludes that there are no differences in developmental outcomes between children raised by lesbigay parents and those raised by heterosexual parents. The analysis here challenges this defensive conceptual framework and analyzes how heterosexism has hampered intellectual progress in the field. The authors discuss limitations in the definitions, samples, and analyses of the studies to date. Next they explore findings from 21 studies and demonstrate that researchers frequently downplay findings indicating difference regarding children's gender and sexual preferences and behavior that could stimulate important theoretical questions. A less defensive, more sociologically informed analytic framework is proposed for investigating these issues. The framework focuses on (1) whether selection effects produced by homophobia account for associations between parental sexual orientations and child outcomes; (2) the role of parental gender vis-a-vis sexual orientation in influencing children's gender development; and (3) the relationship between parental sexual orientations and children's sexual preferences and behaviors.",

      "title": "Autogynephilia in Some Bisexual Cisgender Men",
      "abstract": "Abstract Although some bisexual men experience conventional sexual attraction to both males and females, others have less obvious sexual interests underlying their bisexual identity, attraction, or behavior (i.e., bisexual phenomena). Accordingly, it has been proposed that some men’s bisexual phenomena are motivated by autogynephilia, a male’s propensity to be sexually aroused by the thought or image of being a woman. For these men, sexual attraction to males is secondary to their autogynephilia, rather than a reflection of conventional attraction to males. The present study examined how common autogynephilia is among bisexual cisgender men, and how autogynephilic bisexual men may differ from non-autogynephilic bisexual men in their sexual interests and behavior, uncertainty about their sexual orientation, and gender-related experiences. We recruited a large sample of bisexual-identified men ( n = 254) via Prolific to complete an online survey. Of the sample, 35% ( n = 89) endorsed at least half of the items on a measure of core autogynephilia. Consistent with past research on autogynephilia, autogynephilic bisexual men reported more paraphilic sexual interests than non-autogynephilic bisexual men. Of clinical importance, autogynephilic bisexual men reported less certainty about their sexual orientation, elevated childhood and adult gender nonconformity, and elevated gender dysphoria relative to non-autogynephilic bisexuals. These findings suggest that a substantial minority of bisexual men experience autogynephilia, and that future research should consider the unique experiences and needs of autogynephilic bisexual men, including how else they might differ from other bisexual men.",

      "abstract": "Historically in western societies, adulthood began almost as soon as adolescence ended, as the transition to adulthood had clear milestones and a relatively short timetable. In the mid‐twentieth century most young people had completed their education, entered the labor force, left home, married, and become parents – the traditional milestones of adulthood – by their early twenties. Moreover, these roles were usually achieved in a regular order (e.g., spouse before parent), and the importance of each of these roles varied by gender (e.g., worker was more salient for males). In the early twenty‐first century, however, this transition typically takes 5 to 10 years longer, resulting in a pathway to adulthood that is markedly prolonged. Moreover, most young people are taking more diverse and less gender‐specific pathways to adulthood, making the transition to adulthood more individualized than ever before.",

      "abstract": "Men who request a family leave are viewed as poor organizational citizens and ineligible for rewards. In addition to a poor worker stigma, we found that male leave requesters suffer femininity stigma. Compared with control targets, male leave requesters were viewed as higher on weak, feminine traits (e.g., weak and uncertain), and lower on agentic masculine traits (e.g., competitive and ambitious). Perceptions of weakness uniquely predicted greater risk for penalties (e.g., being demoted or downsized) and fully accounted for the effect of poor worker stigma on male leave requesters’ penalties. By contrast, the poor worker stigma and both agency and weakness perceptions contributed to their reward recommendations. Results were comparable regardless of the reason given for requesting a family leave, target race (White or Black), and participant gender. The implications of these findings for work–life balance and gender equality are discussed.",

One-hundred fifty-five heterosexual women and men participated in a marriage matching task in which they created ideal marriage matches for profiles that differed across sexual orientation and HIV status. The results showed a clear perception that bisexual partners were best suited to other bisexual individuals (whether those individuals were of the same- or other-sex). In general, bisexual women and men were not seen as viable partners in cross-orientation marriages with heterosexual, lesbian, or gay individuals. Additionally, the results overwhelmingly emphasize the belief that HIV concordant pairings are ideal in marriage relationships.

One question focused on how important it was for their children to become either very masculine or very feminine. It was predicted that the less parents stressed the importance of gender appropriateness, the less they would view their children in a traditional sex-stereotyped fashion. This prediction held true only for fathers of girls. Mothers of girls actually showed a trend toward the opposite tendency, while mothers and fathers of boys revealed no distinct overall patterns. For fathers but not for mothers, ratings of the importance of their children's developing gender appropriateness, independence, and high achievement were significantly positively correlated. More research developing and refining the concept of parental cognitive commitment to the sex of the child was recommended. (Author/RH)",

Orang yang telah melakukan perkawinan akan terhindar\r\ndari godaan setan, baik godaan melalui penglihatan mata maupun melalui alat\r\nkelamin atau syahwat, nafsu dan sebagainya. Untuk dapat melaksanakan\r\nperkawinan harus dipenuhi syarat-syarat sahnya perkawinan bagi calon mempelai\r\npria maupun calon mempelai wanita, karena hal ini akan memberikan pengaruh\r\npsikologis bagi suami isteri dalam membina rumah tangganya. Ada kalanya\r\nperkawinan telah disepakati atau disetujui, baik oleh calon suami maupun calon\r\nisteri, tetapi ternyata ada pihak lain yang keberatan, pihak lain yang dimaksudkan\r\ndi sini adalah wali nikah atau disebut wali‘aḍ al atau enggan atau membangkang. \r\nTujuan dari penelitian ini adalah, untuk memahami gambaran kasus-kasus\r\npernikahan wali ‘aḍ al di KUA Kecamatan Pandak Kabupaten Bantul DIY dan\r\nmenggambarkan upaya-upaya yang dilakukan oleh Pegawai Pencatat Nikah\r\n(PPN) dalam penyelesaian sengketa pernikahan wali ‘aḍ al di KUA Kecamatan\r\nPandak Kabupaten Bantul DIY. Metode penelitian yang digunakan dalam\r\npenyusunan skripsi ini adalah field research (penelitian lapangan) dengan lokasi\r\npenelitian yaitu di KUA Kecamatan Pandak Bantul DIY. Sumber data yang\r\ndigunakan adalah data primer dan data sekunder. Teknik pengumpulan data\r\nmelalui Wawancara (interview) kepada PPN sekaligus Kepala KUA Kec. Pandak\r\ndan melalui studi dokumen. Metode pendekatan yang dipergunakan yaitu\r\npendekatan normatif dan yuridis. Analisis data menggunakan metode kualitatif,\r\ndilakukan pada saat proses pengumpulan data berlangsung dan setelah selesai\r\npengumpulan data tersebut dalam periode tertentu dengan menggunakan metode\r\npenulisan induktif diambillah sebuah kesimpulan. \r\nKasus pernikahan wali ‘aḍ al yang ditangani PPN KUA Kecamatan\r\nPandak selama tahun 2009 silam, diketahui bahwa alasan keengganan wali\r\nnikahnya tersebut tidak syar’i (wali nikah ‘aḍ al karena terbujuk dari pihak lain,\r\ncalon suaminya bukan dari suku yang sama, orang miskin, dan masih kentalnya\r\npengaruh adat Jawa dalam perhitungan tanggal keberuntungan). Upaya PPN\r\ndalam penyelesaian sengketa pernikahan wali ‘aḍ al adalah PPN bertindak\r\nsebagai mediator dan mencari kejelasan/ klarifikasi (tabayun) atas sengketa dari\r\nkedua belah pihak, sehingga dengan upaya dari PPN tersebut, sengketa\r\npernikahan wali ‘aḍ al dapat diselesaikan ditingkat KUA Kecamatan Pandak.

Data from a sample of 18-year-old men and women document the importance of dating and courtship development on the initiation of intimate heterosexual relations. Young people who begin to date at an early age also tend to develop steady relationships relatively early and continue to date more frequently. Both the timing of the initiation of dating and the development of steady dating relationships have substantial implications for the development of sexual relations. Young women and men who begin dating early and who develop steady relations early are more likely to be sexually experienced, to have had sexual relations with more partners, to be more sexually active during their late teenage years, and to have more permissive attitudes concerning premarital sex. Among those who experience sexual intercourse, those who had their first experience at a relatively young age had the most partners and had intercourse more frequently when they were 18.",

      "abstract": "The stress, exhaustion, and negative impacts on sexual relationships associated with parenthood are well documented, but father's perceptions of these changes are underexplored. Since sexuality and physicality are cornerstones of traditional/hegemonic masculine norms, changes in these domains resulting from fatherhood may produce concerns about masculinity maintenance and loss of masculine status. However, fatherhood provides clear evidence of a man's sexual capability and virility – highly valued masculine traits. Therefore, fatherhood could theoretically make perceptions of masculinity more stable. The present study compared fathers and non-fathers on perceptions of masculinity and sexuality, and explored potential predictors of sexual esteem versus sexual depression during fatherhood. A sample of primarily heterosexual, White North American fathers and non-fathers participated in an online survey (N = 564) including measures of sexual esteem, sexual depression, and precarious manhood belief. Fathers were also asked to report their perceptions surrounding parenthood. Fathers endorsed precarious manhood beliefs less than non-fathers, and reported higher levels of both sexual esteem and sexual depression. Among fathers, a high personal sex drive predicted sexual esteem, while parental stress, low partner sex drive, and low self-perceived masculinity after parenthood predicted fathers' sexual depression.",

      "title": "The effects of modeling on the development of sex-role behaviors in children",
      "abstract": "THE EFFECTS OF MODELING ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF SEX-ROLE BEHAVIORS IN CHILDREN Candace S. Garrett, Indiana University The purpose of this investigation was to examine the effects of modeling on sex-role development in first-grade children. It was hypothesized that when male-female pairs of children observe a male-female pair of models each child would shift his sex-role behavior toward that of the like-sex model. Sixty children served as subjects. The results did not support this hypothesis. Instead, the data supported the opposite effect: each child imitated the actions of the opposite-sex model. These results are explained in terms of identification, rather than modeling, theory. By the time a child is three years old, he (or she) usually can distinguish between the sexes; he also knows which sex he is (Brown, 1958). Soon after this, he begins to exhibit appropriate sex-typed behaviors and attitudes (Sears, Maccoby, and Levin, 1957). The learning of these behaviors and attitudes is an important and pervasive aspect of development which has consequences not only in childhood but also in the adult years. For example, in the last few years a great deal of concern abairthFlfireTrwattretrliimodeii society has arisen, concern revolving around the aspirations, occupations, careers, and behavior patterns of women and the conflicts that choices in these areas may produce. The basis for these. conflicts is formed during childhood, as children acquire their concepts of what are appropriate sex-role behaviors. There are several theories concerning sex-role development in children, including the psychoanalytic theory of identification, Brown's theory of identification, and social learning theory. This study is primarily concerned with the latter. According to Mischel (1966), observational learning from models, live or symbolic, is the first step in the acquisition of sex-typed behaviors. Bandura ard Walters (1959) reinforce this point of view by stating that most of the values that will influence a child's behavior are acquired through imitation of the important adults in his life. Research on the effects of imitation or modeling has shown that children will model aggression (Bandura, Ross, and Ross, 1965a; Hicks, 1965; Kuhn, Madsen, and Becker, 1967; Madsen, 1968), self-reward criteria (Bandura and Kupers, 1964; Mischel and Liebert, 1966), self-imposed delay of reward (Bandura and Mischel, 1965), and moral judgments (Bandura and McDonald, 1963). Modeling takes place even when the children are not",

In both male and female primates, cues from or interactions with conspecifics can inhibit reproductive development in juveniles, as well as reproductive physiology and sexual behavior in adults. In males, reproductive maturation may be delayed, and adult testosterone levels and sexual behavior are often reduced, in low‐ranking individuals compared to dominants. Female reproductive maturation can be delayed by the presence of a dominant female and/or the absence of an unrelated adult male, while numerous aspects of adult female reproductive function can be inhibited by cues from same‐sex rivals or adult males. Social suppression of reproduction appears to be a mechanism whereby individuals avoid investing in reproductive attempts that are likely to fail due to inauspicious social conditions, thereby increasing the likelihood of breeding successfully in the future.",

      "abstract": "A questionnaire designed to measure subtle discrimination experi enced by professional women in the work place generated some unanticipated and unsolicited data which revealed a variety of forms of false consciousness among this group. Ninety-five (95) of the one hundred and forty (140) women who responded to a set of general, open-ended questions on the survey offered one or more comments that were either implicitly or explicitly critical of the relevance of feminist principles to their own employment experience and/or to the position of working women as a whole. For example, some respondents denied that women constituted a minority group. Of this group, a few argued that women had already achieved equality while others either suggested that innate differences between men and women accounted for differential treatment or that individual women solicited such treatment by their actions. A second group denied individual membership in the minority group. Professionalism (read de-feminization) was the personal factor most often identified as allowing these individuals to transcend group affiliation. Third, among those who did acknowledge discriminatory treatment, many failed to recognize the institutional basis of sexism, the pervasiveness of this form of prejudice, and/or the dangers of an apolitical response to this problem. Blaming individual males for the inequality experienced by women, claims that sexism is merely a minor and diminishing problem, and a propensity to inaction based, among other things, on a fear of being labeled a women's libber, are illustrative of this type of false consciousness.",

      "abstract": "In this research, the authors measured the levels of sexual guilt between two groups of people on multiple levels, virgins and nonvirgins, by gender. The differences between men and women’s virginity were also studied. Based on the sample size of college students, n = 364. College students completed a 34item online survey of questions that measured guilt levels. Ten out of the twenty questions were demographic questions, such as: age, ethnicity, religion, year, etc. The other questions were a combination of Likert scaled questions and open ended responses. The researchers predicted that females would experience more guilt compared to males after the loss of their virginity. The researchers found that females experienced more sexual guilt compared to males, as well as, females with high scores of religiosity also experienced higher levels of sexual guilt. Views of sex have changed over time, but what exactly makes an individual want to lose their virginity? Many factors seem to influence the quality and enjoyment of the first sexual experience. One was gender: Men seemed to have more positive attitudes than women about their first experience (Baumeister, 2001). Currently, the main factors that affect the decision to keep or lose one’s virginity are primarily surrounded by gender differences in emotional reactions to first intercourse. To explain gender differences in emotional reactions to first intecourse, DeLamater (1987) conducted three studies to expand on reasons why males have more favorable reactions compared to females. The first reason is based on the assumption that males are more likely to experience an orgasm the first time they have intercourse. The second explanation DeLamater offered proposed that females need more closeness with their partners to enjoy fully the first intercourse (DeLamater, 1987). This finding seems to support the idea that women would experience more shame or guilt upon loss of virginity, especially if the ideal closeness is not achieved.",

Using implicit and explicit measures, we found that transgender children showed a clear pattern: They viewed themselves in terms of their expressed gender and showed preferences for their expressed gender, with response patterns mirroring those of two cisgender (nontransgender) control groups. These results provide evidence that, early in development, transgender youth are statistically indistinguishable from cisgender children of the same gender identity.",

Using a within-subjects design, we examined stereotypes as a function of target gender (male, female), race (Black, White), and age across the life span (adolescent, young adult, middle-aged, young-old, and old-old). Participants rated 20 target groups on 10 attributes representative of either an agentic (e.g., ambitious) or communal (e.g., considerate) orientation. Participants were presented only with categorical information (e.g., Black, 85-year-old, males), and ordering of categorical information and target groups was counterbalanced across participants. We hypothesized differential effects of target gender and race as a function of age. Multivariate analyses of variance on each attribute revealed significant main effects that supported traditional stereotype research, but significant interactions revealed a more complicated picture. Overall, results showed that while gender stereotypes about agency and communion generally hold up across the life span, they are more applicable to White than Black targets. Results also supported the notion that we hold unique stereotypes based on multiple social categories rather than simply perceiving one social category as more salient than another, which was best exemplified in the case of Black female targets that were less likely to be perceived in gender stereotypic ways across the life span. We suggest stereotype research needs to shift to accommodate for the complexity and diversity of real people.",

      "abstract": "The present study aims to determine whether homosexual behavior in stump-tailed macaque males of different age groups were socio-sexual or sexually motivated. Male homosexual encounters were divided into two categories for analysis; manual genital stimulation and actual mounting. Manual genital stimulation in adult males occurred bidirectional, in the context of social affiliations. There was no significant difference between dominant and subordinate partners in terms of genital stimulation performed or received. Mounting was in double foot-clasp position similar to heterosexual encounter. We identified three types of mounts. All types of mounts occurred unidirectional among adult males and mostly occurred in aggressive context. Unique homosexual encounters was observed between α-male and β-male where mounting involved anal intromission terminated by ejaculation and occurred only during the mating season after the heterosexual copulation between β-male and estrous female, which was known to be sexually motivated. We examined several socio-sexual explanations for male homosexual mounting, including (1) dominance-assertion (2) tension-regulation (3) reconciliation and (4) practice for heterosexual copulation. Homosexual encounters between adult males interpreted: a strict relationship between dominant individuals mounting subordinate individuals, reconciliation attempted by the subordinate; and the mechanism employed to regulated aggression and reestablished social bond among adult males. Mounting among immature males occurred bidirectional. Five evidences indicated the homosexual mounting between immature males as socio-sexual behavior. The evidences based on: (a) the mating season (b) the same day heterosexual encounter (c) assistance provided by adult male to immature males (d) occurrence in the context of play (e) immature males in homosexual mounting and learning heterosexual mounting with adult females. The male-male homosexuality adds a new dimension in sexual behavior of stump-tailed macaque.",

Age intersected with gender such that women within a decade of the woman interviewer's age assumed similarity and were communicative. In interviews with similarly‐aged heterosexual men, awareness of sexuality inhibited answers around intimacy. With older interviewees, gender similarity bridged the age chasm with women. In contrast, age and gender difference inspired older men to act paternalistically and give unsolicited advice. Even among adults, interviewees' classification of the interviewer's age contours the interactional dynamic, impacts data acquisition, and reproduces social distinctions.",

Women experience sexual pleasure on many levels: physical, emotional, spiritual and intellectual. Sexual functioning of women and men is determined by many factors. A strong correlation between the state of subjective arousal and genital response (erection) is typical for men. In the case of women important role played: emotions, cognitive interpretation of the situation, age, self-esteem and previous sexual experiences. Among women experience orgasm during intercourse or masturbation is not a goal in itself. Modern approach to the phenomenon of orgasm and sexual education of women, make absence of orgasm as a failure. It becomes a source of low self-esteem, less self-confidence or sense of lack of attractiveness.",

      "abstract": "In many birds, males are presumed to protect their paternity by closely guarding their mate or copulating frequently with her. Both these costly behaviors are assumed to reduce the risk and/or intensity of sperm competition. However, despite many studies on avian extra‐pair paternity, it remains unclear how strongly these behaviors are related to fitness and other key life‐history traits. Here, we conduct meta‐analyses to address two questions. First, are mate guarding and/or frequent copulation positively correlated with a male's share of paternity at his nest? We find a significant positive correlation between both presumed paternity protection behaviors and paternity share. The relationship is, however, weak (r = 0.08–0.23). This is perhaps unsurprising if the risk of partner infidelity, hence the need to protect paternity, varies among males. For example, more attractive males might have less need to protect their paternity. Second, do males with higher indices of so‐called male \"quality\" (phenotypic measures, usually subjectively defined by researchers as predictors of male attractiveness) exhibit lower levels of paternity protection behavior? We find a negative correlation between male quality and paternity protection. This finding might partly explain the weak relationship between paternity protection and paternity, although we discuss other, nonmutually exclusive possibilities.",

      "abstract": "Queer Bodies of Knowledge: Constructing Lesbian and Gay Studies Lynda Goldstein Abelove, Henry, Michele Anna Barale, and David M. Halperin, eds. The Lesbian and Gay Studies Reader. New York: Routledge, 1993. Gever, Martha, John Greyson, and Pratibha Parmar, eds. Queer Looks: Perspectives on Lesbian and Gay Film and Video. New York: Routledge, 1993. As the newest kid on the interdisciplinary block looking for legitimation (with not a little attitude), Lesbian/Gay or Queer Studies (depending upon one’s political affiliations) poses a number of obvious challenges to academia and publishers. One of these, of course, has to do with the strategic, if not essential, reliance of lesbian and gay studies on a particular kind of identity politics that parallels the institutional maneuvering of other “minority studies” programs. Indeed, lesbian and gay studies can be charted along much the same trajectory as Women’s, African-American, Asian-American or Latino/a Ethnic Studies, all of which were institutionalized (however tenuously in these times of “down-sizing” colleges) at historically specific moments at the conjuncture of their respective (and overlapping) political activism, cultural production, and scholarship. Indeed, lesbian/gay studies shares more with these other emergent subdisciplines than a certain path toward discursive legitimation within the academy (though this is not to suggest that the struggles of every field of study have all been identical). It also often shares theoretical frameworks, and even some specific objects of study. The Harlem Renaissance, for example, has been a recurring area of focus, as queer studies has sought to rethink cultural history in terms of the intersections of sexuality, class, gender, and race. Begun as an inclusion of queer contributions to history here, a special topics course on lesbian and gay “coming out” literature there, and a rigorous theoretical interrogation of sexuality as a constitutive category of subject formation elsewhere, queer studies has reached critical mass in the “gay nineties.” This is evident in the increasing number of gay and lesbian studies undergraduate programs in and across the various humanistic disciplines; the special collections at university and large public libraries from coast to coast; and the critical/theoretical work on the cultural inscriptions of sexuality, much of which would be far more difficult to assemble without the explosive production of identifiably, often “in your face,” queer culture, most especially in literature/comics, theater/performance, music, the visual arts, film/video, and popular style/fashion. My emphasis here on popular cultural productions should not indicate that queer studies traffics exclusively in the popular (though the intersection of queer and popular is an intriguing one), as any study of homoclassics or anthrodrag surely indicates. Perhaps nothing suggests the critical materiality of lesbian and gay studies more substantially than the queer line of critical and theoretical work coordinated by Routledge, cagey publisher to the stars of queer theory. Indeed, as hefty as Routledge’s two anthologies delineating the field of Cultural Studies, and with much the same cutting-edge rationale guiding its journey through the contestatory fields of academic discourse, the compendium anthology, The Lesbian and Gay Studies Reader, establishes itself as an indispensable introduction to the field, at least as it is determined within the (inter)disciplinary boundaries of the arts and humanities. Published just two years after Inside/Out (a collection of essays theorizing lesbian and gay sexual politics and culture edited by Diana Fuss and published by Routledge in 1991), How Do I Look? (the conference proceedings from “How Do I Look? Queer Film and Video” organized and edited by Bad Object Choices) and the “Queer Theory: Lesbian and Gay Sexualities” issue of the journal differences (edited by Teresa de Lauretis), The Lesbian and Gay Studies Reader collects forty-two contemporary essays from a variety of disciplines, many of them no doubt known to readers from their previously published incarnations in journals. I mention the earlier collections because they were all distinguished by a theoretical approach that might be broadly defined as that of “cultural studies,” an approach that The Lesbian and Gay Studies Reader has not merely adopted but sought to extend by encompassing an even wider range of disciplines and sites of investigation. Indeed, The Lesbian and Gay Studies Reader is in many...",

      "title": "The rise and fall of gay: A cultural-historical approach to gay identity development",
      "abstract": "Abstract Research on identity development has paid relatively little attention to the development of marginalised identities such as those of gays and lesbians, whose isolation from the canonical narrative of sexuality may limit the available resources required for establishing a coherent identity. We examined these contested identities in relation to cultural-historical factors that may have played a role in shaping these identities over the past 50 years, and looked at how such factors have impacted the voicing and silencing of gay experiences. Participants (N=251) reported (1) a memory of a cultural event relevant to their sexuality, and (2) a self-defining memory about their sexuality. Those in older cohorts reported cultural memories centred on politics and other external events (e.g., Stonewall riots), and younger cohorts reported more personal memories (e.g., coming out), suggesting that homosexual identities have become less culturally defined, and instead more personally defined. Further, participants of older cohorts reported self-defining events that were predominantly from one private domain (e.g., sex). In contrast, younger participants reported a variety of self-defining events. These results suggest that cultural-historical factors play an important role in defining the developmental pathway of individuals, perhaps especially those who have marginalised identities.

This study was supported by a grant from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada awarded to the second author. Notes 1In the current paper there are many instances where the term \"gay\" is used to capture the experiences of both males and females who identify as homosexual. The usage of this term is intended only for convenience sake, as in mainstream discourse we often find \"gay\" used as such a catchall phrase. We are not in any way trying to offer a male-centred view of sexuality. We will identify and attempt to explain those points at which our results diverge for males and females. 2There are some exceptions to this rule, where silence can conversely represent a form of power (Fivush, Citation2010 this issue), such as when one's personal narrative is so powerful it need not be voiced. For example, one need not voice one's heterosexual orientation, because heteronormativity assumes this to be the case unless otherwise told. Fivush (Citation2010 this issue) conceptualises this form of silence as \"being silent\", in contrast to \"being silenced\". The latter is an imposed form of silence and is the focus of the current study. 3One might challenge this claim, given the large collection of research that has examined coming-out narratives (e.g., King & Noelle, Citation2005; King & Smith, Citation2004). Certainly for many gay individuals this is an important developmental milestone, a turning point where the gay person claims their voice. However, coming-out experiences are only one possible narrative among a potentially vast number of experiences that a gay identity might be built around. To this end, we have taken a broader approach to gay identity development that is reflective of the pervasive silencing that we believe to be typical of this non-canonical narrative. 4We note that we are coming more from a historical framework than a collective memory framework, viewing historical events as possible vehicles for creating shared master narratives. 5For the cultural memory sex and romance were treated as one category, unlike the distinct categories in the coding of the self-defining memory. This was done because both categories are personal memories in response to a cultural prompt and only comprised 6% of the responses to the cultural memory combined, whereas they made up 30% of the narratives in the self-defining memory. 6See Loiacano (Citation1989) who discusses how racial and sexual identity interact to produce marginalisation among the marginalised, specifically examining the challenges associated with identification as an African American in the predominantly white gay community.",

      "abstract": "Young men with superior upper-body strength typically show a greater proclivity for physical aggression than their weaker male counterparts. The traditional interpretation of this phenomenon is that young men calibrate their attitudes and behaviors to their physical formidability. Physical strength is thus viewed as a causal antecedent of aggressive behavior. The present study is the first to examine this phenomenon within a developmental framework. We capitalized on the fact that physical strength is a male secondary sex characteristic. In two longitudinal cohorts of children, we estimated adolescent change in upper-body strength using the slope parameter from a latent growth model. We found that males’ antisocial tendencies temporally precede their physical formidability. Boys, but not girls, with greater antisocial tendencies in childhood attained larger increases in physical strength between the ages of 11 and 17. These results support sexual selection theory, indicating an adaptive congruence between male-typical behavioral dispositions and subsequent physical masculinization during puberty.",

      "abstract": "Young children spontaneously share resources with anonymous recipients, but little is known about the specific circumstances that promote or hinder these prosocial tendencies. Children (ages 3–11) received a small (12) or large (30) number of stickers, and were then given the opportunity to share their windfall with either one or multiple anonymous recipients (Dictator Game). Whether a child chose to share or not varied as a function of age, but was uninfluenced by numerical context. Moreover, children's giving was consistent with a proportion-based account, such that children typically donated a similar proportion (but different absolute number) of the resources given to them, regardless of whether they originally received a small or large windfall. The proportion of resources donated, however, did vary based on the number of recipients with whom they were allowed to share, such that on average, children shared more when there were more recipients available, particularly when they had more resources, suggesting they take others into consideration when making prosocial decisions. Finally, results indicated that a child's gender also predicted sharing behavior, with males generally sharing more resources than females. Together, findings suggest that the numerical contexts under which children are asked to share, as well as the quantity of resources that they have to share, may interact to promote (or hinder) altruistic behaviors throughout childhood.",

That is, a lesbian woman may not be represented in relation to either the category ‘woman’ or the category ‘homosexual people’. Two online experiments conducted in Sweden and the United Kingdom ( N = 1923) tested predictions from the IIH at different intersections of specific genders (woman and man) and sexual orientations (heterosexuality, homosexuality and bisexuality) using an attribute generation task and direct similarity ratings. Results show strong support for the influence of heterocentrism: Only prototypes for heterosexual women/men match general prototypes for women/men. Androcentrism influenced the prototype for ‘homosexual people’, which had a stronger match with the prototype for gay men compared with lesbian women. In contrast, bisexual women were seen as more prototypical ‘bisexual people’ than bisexual men were. Psychological research conducted on general gender groups may therefore only be applicable to heterosexual individuals, while research on homosexual people in general may be applicable mainly to gay men.",

      "abstract": "Jealousy is defined as one of the most common automatic responses to endangering a relationship by a third party, and in evolutionary psychology it has the function of maximizing self-reproduction fitness, ensuring paternity security in men, and maintaining partner's resources in women. These include romantic jealousy, in men assuring certainty of paternity, and in women assuring the maintenance of partner's resources. Thus, according to this logic, a woman’s sexual infidelity should be more threatening for men and a man’s emotional infidelity (emotional involvement with other women than a primary partner) should be more threatening for women. Many previous studies confirm the existence of sex differences in jealousy; men reporting a higher level of sexual jealousy and women reporting a higher level of emotional jealousy. On the contrary, studies of romantic jealousy in homosexual individuals show inconsistent results. Some studies suggest that the type of sexual and emotional jealousy does not depend on the sex of the individual who is jealous, but rather on the sex of the partner or the sex of the rival. Therefore, the aim of this review is to introduce romantic jealousy from an evolutionary perspective and to acquaint the reader with current knowledge of the study of cognitive, emotional and behavioral aspects of romantic jealousy in heterosexual and homosexual men and women.",

On average, participants are undecided about the merits of inclusive language, but older participants are more supportive than 18- to 22-year-olds. Attitudes toward women are a significant predictor of attitudes toward sexist/nonsexist language in all age—gender groups. Education is a stronger predictor than age; perspective-taking ability and gender self-esteem are each significant predictors for one age—gender group.",

      "title": "Racial preferences in sexual attraction among White heterosexual and gay men: Evidence from sexual arousal patterns and negative racial attitudes",
      "abstract": "Abstract Racial preferences in sexual attraction are highly visible and controversial. They may also negatively impact those who are excluded. It is unclear whether these preferences are merely self‐attributed or extend to patterns of experienced sexual arousal. Furthermore, some argue that racial preferences in sexual attraction reflect idiosyncratic personal preferences, while others argue that they are more systematically motivated and reflect broader negative attitudes toward particular races. In two studies, we examined these issues by measuring the sexual arousal patterns and negative racial attitudes of 78 White men in relation to their racial preferences in sexual attraction to White versus Black people. For both White heterosexual men ( n = 40; Study 1) and White gay men ( n = 38; Study 2), greater racial preferences in sexual attraction to White versus Black people of their preferred gender were associated with more subjective and genital arousal by erotic stimuli featuring White versus Black people of their preferred gender, and with more explicit and implicit negative attitudes toward Black people. Findings suggest that racial preferences in sexual attraction are reflected in patterns of sexual arousal, and they might also be systematically motivated by negative attitudes toward particular races.",

Four studies (N1 = 90, N2 = 247, N3 = 500, N4 = 1,176) investigated whether this was the case for heterosexual identity, relative to gay identity. Support for fragile heterosexuality was found using various methods: sexual orientation perceptions of a target who engaged in incongruent behavior, free-responses concerning behaviors required to change someone's mind about a target's sexual orientation, agreement with statements about men/women's sexual orientation, and agreement with gender-neutral statements about sexual orientation. Neither participant nor target gender eliminated or reversed this effect. Additionally, we investigated multiple explanations (moderators) of the perceived difference in fragility between heterosexual identity and gay identity and found that higher estimates of the gay/lesbian population decreased the difference between the (higher) perceived fragility of heterosexual identity and the (lower) perceived fragility of gay identity.",

In this paper using data from the British National Sexual Attitudes and Lifestyles Survey we examine how far the timing of first coitus plays a role in the genesis of this demographic behaviour for children of divorced parents. Other factors including the timing of menarche attitudes to sexual activity degree of parental strictness and religiosity were also examined. In general these factors had little explanatory power. The analysis showed that earlier sexual activity for men and women from disrupted families is an important proximate determinant of their earlier entry into partnership and parenthood compared with those brought up with both natural parents.

      "title": "On Mating Systems and Sexual Selection",
      "abstract": "Certain aspects of the relationships of mating systems, sexual selection, sex ratios, rates of maturation in males, and behavior in grackles and other icterids have been considered. In the promiscuous grackles of the genus Quiscalus, the nestling sex ratio is balanced but differential mortality in the sexes following the nestling stage produces a marked imbalance in the tertiary sex ratio in favor of females. Further imbalance in the sex ratio at the breeding colonies results from the failure of first-year males to breed. Imbalances in the tertiary sex ratio of the population and in the sex ratio at breeding colonies are viewed as consequences of the promiscuous mating system rather than as causal factors promoting promiscuity. An explanation for the failure of first-year males of polygynous and promiscuous species to participate in the breeding effort of the population is sought in terms of individual rather than group selection. Because the probability of a young male obtaining mates in competition with older, experienced males is very low, males which postpone breeding may ultimately have greater total reproduction; and through selection first-year males have become adaptively \"handicapped\" physiologically and morphologically in competition with adult males for mates. The fact that sympatric hybridization is more frequent among non-monogamous species than among those having a monogamous mating system is attributed in part to the higher sex \"drive\" and the lower thresholds of response of males to feminine releasers, which arise through strong sexual selection in polygamous and promiscuous mating systems. It is also suggested that the heightened aggressive tendencies of non-mono gamous males place a premium on feminine characters which minimize the chances of the female eliciting aggressive responses on the part of the male at the time of mating.",

Adults consider play, even that silent and solitary musing at any age, to be open-ended and dynamic. The most clearly innovative play is evolutionary in that it is open-ended, exploratory, unpredictable, unique, and “comedic” or imbued with “surprise”. The English-language notion of play conventionally spars with work. Culture and society shape children’s play enactment as much as language shapes its conceptualization. In contemporary US society, scholars have described children as being as adultlike as adults are childlike. In Western culture, there have been several watersheds for children’s play. Insofar as children may initiate play while alone, a sense of autonomy accompanies the evolutionary, exploratory grammar of free-form or imitative activities. In Western culture, there have been several watersheds for children’s play.",

Sin embargo, diversos índices sugieren que la igualdad entre hombres y mujeres dista mucho de ser una realidad. Esta situación contradictoria ha llevado a formular la existencia de formas más sutiles o encubiertas de sexismo. Según Glick y Fiske (1996), el sexismo ambivalente conjuga las formas tradicionales con formas \"benévolas\", que si bien tienen un componente afectivo y conductual positivo siguen considerando a la mujer de forma estereotipada y limitada a ciertos roles.En esta investigación se presentan datos de 1110 varones, de diferentes edades, niveles educativos, estado civil, etc. que contestaron la versión española del Ambivalent Sexism Inventory (ASI), así como otras medidas de sexismo tradicional y de amenaza a los intereses de los varones. Los resultados muestran que la versión española del ASI cumple satisfactoriamente los requisitos de fiabilidad y validez.

      "abstract": "The association between religiosity and the construct of sexual passion was examined to see whether religiosity is associated with harmonious, inhibited, and obsessive sexual passion styles. Using multiple regression and checking for interactions between religiosity, gender, broad categories of religion (Catholic, other Christian, other religious, nonreligious), and the three sexual passion styles, the following associations were found: Religiosity had a significant curvilinear relationship to all three sexual passion styles, suggesting an overlap in levels of religiosity and the construct of sexual passion. Optimal sexual passion outcomes were found at both higher and lower levels of religiosity, whereas mid-level religiosity was associated with the less beneficial sexual passion outcomes. Religious men were significantly more obsessively passionate than religious women, and religious men and women were similarly high on levels of harmonious and low on inhibited sexual passion. There were no significant interactions between religiosity, broad categories of religion, and sexual passion styles. Understanding how religion and sexual passion are associated could be useful for applied researchers as well as those who work with religious individuals who want to help these individuals develop beneficial patterns of sexual passion.",

      "abstract": "Zusammenfassung Hintergrund Die Zahlen von Menschen, die ihre sexuelle Identität nicht als heterosexuell sondern als schwul, lesbisch, bisexuell oder in einer anderen Kategorie definieren, steigen seit Jahren leicht an; man schätzt, dass in westlichen Ländern ca. 5% der Bevölkerung zu den sexuellen Minderheiten zu rechnen sind. Diese Studie ist darauf angelegt, die psychischen Problemlagen der sexuellen Minoritäten anhand US-amerikanischer Bevölkerungsstudien sowie weiterer wichtiger Studien aus anderen Ländern genauer darzustellen. Ergebnisse Zusammenfassend ergibt sich Folgendes: Unabhängig vom Geschlecht liegt der Konsum von Alkohol und anderen Drogen sowie die Abhängigkeit von diesen Stoffen mindestens auf dem Niveau der heterosexuellen Männer. Lesbisch/schwule und bisexuelle Frauen sind noch etwas stärker durch den Konsum von psychoaktiven Substanzen belastet als schwule und bisexuelle Männer. Untersucht man Belastungen durch Depressionen und Suizidversuche, findet man wiederum bei den sexuellen Minoritäten höhere Belastungen. LSB-Frauen haben die höchsten Raten hinsichtlich Depressionen und Ängsten. Darüber hinaus weisen die Daten darauf hin, dass bisexuelle Männer und Frauen hohe psychische Belastungen haben. Alles in allem genommen ist davon auszugehen, dass die sexuellen Minoritäten einen relativ hohen Bedarf an Behandlungen ihrer psychischen Störungen haben. Dennoch gibt es bislang nur sehr wenige Behandlungsprogramme mit der Zielgruppe: sexuelle Minoritäten. Schlussfolgerungen Wir benötigen dringend deutsche Studien zu sexuellen Minoritäten allgemein und besonders zu trans* Personen mit ihren sehr spezifischen Problemlagen. Die Studien sollten neben den Substanzkonsumstörungen der sexuellen Minoritäten auch andere psychische Störungen erfassen. Kenntnisse über die psychische Befindlichkeit sexueller Minoritäten sind die Grundlage für optimale Behandlungsgestaltungen.",

Parents confirmed the memory events and dated the memories. There were surprisingly few developmental differences between the earliest memories of children. Although 6--9-year-olds recalled earlier events than did older children, there were no differences between older age groups. Memories from all age groups were similar in structure, social orientation, and the nature of the recalled event. However, memories of older children were more likely to involve negative affect. There were also few gender differences, although girls were more likely to recall traumatic or transitional events while boys were more likely to recall play events. Overall, results deepen the paradox of early memory: 6--9-year-olds have verbally accessible memories from very early childhood that then seem to disappear as they get older.",

The traditional explanation for this relationship suggests that men experience this greater level of jealousy due to threats of a loss of paternal certainty. In this article, we present three studies that demonstrate that men's differentially greater jealousy occurs in response to situations that threaten paternity opportunities. These results suggest that a loss of perceived paternity opportunities is the ultimate origin of men's increased jealousy in response to sexual infidelity.",

À partir d’une enquête ethnographique et d’un questionnaire de terrain, l’article souligne que la plupart des enfants âgés de 6 à 11 ans savent différencier l’amour de l’amitié. Alors que le premier est un sentiment perçu comme féminin et hétérosexuel, le second apparaît comme principalement homogame et neutre du point de vue du genre. Au-delà des attributs liés au sexe, la principale différence que les enfants opèrent entre ces deux sentiments concerne la présence ou non d’une proximité physique. Dès qu’une relation entre les enfants met en scène des bisous ou des câlins, elle est immédiatement requalifiée comme une relation amoureuse. Cependant, cette proximité physique ne constitue pas l’unique frontière entre ces deux sentiments. D’autres caractéristiques telles que le fait d’être toujours ensemble peuvent également être utilisées. Ce déplacement des frontières dépend des propriétés sociales des enfants et de leurs représentations différenciées des relations amicales et amoureuses.",

      "title": "Sexual Selection and Static Allometry: The Importance of Function",
      "abstract": "Many spectacular cases of biological diversity are associated with sexual selection, and structures under sexual selection often show positive static allometry: they are disproportionately large for the size of the animal's body in larger individuals. Other sexually selected structures, however, show negative allometry or isometry. Theory fails to account for this variation and recent summaries do not agree regarding the frequency of positive allometry in sexually selected structures. We propose explanations for why sexually selected structures with different functions (courtship, threat signals, and weapons) should differ in allometry. Positive allometry is predicted for threat structures (including most weapons) because larger individuals tend to win fights and threat signals are used to avoid unwinnable fights with larger opponents, the reproductive payoffs for contests tend to be higher for larger males, and discriminating the sizes of relatively larger traits requires greater absolute differences due to Weber's Law of sensory physiology. Male courtship signals, in contrast, convey many types of information, much of which is not consistently related to male size, so positive allometry is expected less often. We tested these predictions empirically by comparing the allometries of male structures with relatively \"pure\" functions. Our predictions were confirmed, thus helping to explain differences in previous empirical surveys.",

But this conception has shown its limits in the complexity of children's social worlds. Today, dominance is rather conceived in terms of asymmetry in resource control within children's dyads. Some observational studies have been done in this context, but only on small groups of familiar children and often up to 3 years of age. Our aim was to reveal whether asymmetry in resource control would occur between younger children who met each other for the first time in the presence of an attractive toy. We observed 201 dyads of 19‐month‐old unfamiliar peers in four repetitive competitive sessions for a toy. Resource control and asymmetry between participants were highly consistent between sessions. The level of asymmetry in resource control between participants was very high. This asymmetry was influenced neither by gender nor by age, and coercive behaviors in the situation, physical aggression rated by parents, birth order, and day‐care habits did not account for the asymmetry in our setting. However, body size at birth (although not at the time of testing) and anxiety rated by parents contributed significantly to the asymmetry in resource control.",

      "abstract": "Pathogen stress is an important form of environmental extremeness and uncertainty for humans as well as other organisms. It is predicted to: fl] increase the degree of polygyny (as fewer males become appropriate mates); [2] make non-sororal polygyny more frequent (as variable offspring become more advantageous), and [3] be correlated with signs of sexual selection: physical dimorphism, societal rules about allowed wives for men in different categories, both achieved and inherited. The first two hypotheses are supported. As pathogen stress increases, the degree of polygyny increases, no matter how polygyny is measured. As pathogen stress increases, non-sororal polygyny and capture of women from outside societies increase; sororal and other endogamous forms of polygyny decrease. The third hypothesis is not supported. Measures of male-male competition and reflections of male status are not associated with pathogen stress. A man's actual present appearance (physical, behavioral) may provide a more direct and accurate reflection of a man's worth as a mate. It is possible that the measures available for testing here are not fully appropriate. These results suggest that major pathogens may have been, during human evolutionary history, an important selective force, shifting the polygyny threshold, and resulting in greater polygyny, and polygyny of specific types, in areas of high stress. The relationship appears to be of a threshold sort (at high levels of pathogen stress monogamy, polyandry, and mild polygyny are absent) rather than a linear relationship. We need within-society data for appropriate pathogens regarding relationship between individual pathogen load and probability of getting a mate, possible interactions between pathogen stress and resource accumulation in sexual selection, and impact of pathogen load on fertility.",

When confronted, Tom doesn’t deny it, but he insists it’s just “a thing” and he isn’t gay. Elsewhere, John’s wife, Karen, discovers that her husband likes to watch gay porn. John doesn’t understand his wife’s reaction. Why does she care what he watches if he’s not unfaithful? In couple’s therapy, Karen and Jennifer raise the same questions: Does this mean my husband is gay? Can my marriage survive? These and other stories illustrate the difficulties inherent when a wife or girlfriend finds out her man has had or wants to have sexual contact with other men. But many times, the man is not gay or even bisexual. Of course, some men with gay sexual interests are gay men in a process of self-discovery; they are “coming out.” These desires may only reflect a different side of a man’s sexuality or some response to childhood trauma or experiences they have not fully processed. Here Joe Kort and Alexander P. Morgan make the distinction between gay men and “straight men with gay interests” clearer to women who want to know how they can overcome these revelations. The authors explain the many reasons why straight men may be drawn to gay sex; how to tell whether a man is gay, straight, or bisexual; and what the various options are for these couples, who can often go on to have very fulfilling marriages. Is My Husband Gay, Straight or Bi? is intended to help couples understand how male sexuality can express itself in ways that may be difficult to understand. Many marriages have been hurriedly terminated when couples (and their therapists) have lacked the information they needed to understand their current situations. This book provides the clarity, describes the choices, and (in many cases) offers hope for relationships and marriages that have been brushed off as doomed.",

      "title": "The Impact of Urinary Incontinence on Sexual Health in Older Adults",
      "abstract": "“Therefore my age is as a lusty winter, frosty but kindly.” In William Shakespeare's comedy about romantic love, As You Like It (Act II, Scene 3), Adam, the elderly manservant, speaks these lines as he contemplates his aging and tries to underscore that his spirit and abilities remain robust. These words ring true today as many people hope for a similar fate with their own journey through the aging process. For many older adults, maintaining a satisfying level of sexual activity is an important part of sustaining a high quality of life. Clinical research and practice have clearly demonstrated that, although a person may be elderly, it does not mean that they are necessarily asexual.1, 2 In fact, studies of residents in long-term care facilities have revealed that many of these individuals remain interested in sex and that some remain sexually active in this environment.3, 4 The availability of a regular partner certainly influences the degree to which elderly individuals remain sexually active. Many older adults want to continue to experience the full range of sexual activities they enjoyed in younger years for as long as possible, but forms of sexual expression may also change with advancing age. For some older adults, masturbation may become a primary sexual outlet. In many cases, the simple acts of touch and physical intimacy may supplant penetrative sexual intercourse as highly meaningful and satisfying forms of sexual expression. Many factors can negatively influence sexual function in older adults. Significant comorbid conditions such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and peripheral vascular disease may limit genital blood flow. Impaired circulation may in turn lead to erectile dysfunction in men and diminished sensation or orgasmic dysfunction in women.5 Osteoarthritis and neurological disorders may impair physical mobility during intercourse and make certain sexual positions difficult or uncomfortable for older adults. Atrophic vaginitis is a common condition in postmenopausal women that may be associated with dyspareunia and decreased sexual activity.1 Hormonal changes may lead to alterations in libido for both men and women.2 Clinicians must ask specifically about sexual function, because many older adults will not volunteer this information or raise questions themselves.6 The study by Tannenbaum et al. in this issue examined the association between urinary incontinence and self-reported levels of sexual activity in a community-based postal survey of 5,000 Canadian women aged 55 and older.7 Particular strengths of this study were that it surveyed a broad range of women across the country and represented approximately 15% to 18% of the total female Canadian population. Data were available for 2,361 of the 5,000 women surveyed. The overall prevalence of urinary incontinence was 38%, and 27% of the women reported being sexually active. The authors found that continence status did not appear to influence participation in sexual activity for many older women. Age and marital status, a proxy measure for the availability of a sexual partner, were the strongest predictors of continued sexual activity. Although the frequency of incontinent episodes was not related to changes in sexual activity, overall physical and mental health did appear to influence this outcome. In addition, stress incontinence, nocturnal incontinence, and larger volumes of urine loss did appear to negatively affect sexual participation. The authors concluded that marital status and physical and mental health parameters must be considered in evaluating the results of intervention studies to improve sexual health in older incontinent women. In addition to the community-based design, other strengths included the exploration of multiple predictor variables such as overall physical and mental health and body image. There were also several potential limitations that the authors recognized and discussed. The results were based on a self-reported postal survey that may have some inherent response biases. The question on sexual activity was dichotomous and thus may not have accounted for varying levels or forms of sexual expression. Sexual satisfaction was also not measured in this study. The use of marital status as a proxy measure for a regular sexual partner was also potentially biased. This variable will not capture single women who may have a regular sexual partner, married women whose partner suffers from significant sexual dysfunction, or women who engage in sexual activity with other women. The generalizability of the research findings are also limited to relatively healthy, community-dwelling adults. Several other studies have examined the relationship between urinary incontinence, pelvic organ prolapse, and decreased sexual function in women. One demonstrated that urinary incontinence was significantly associated with decreased libido, vaginal dryness, and dyspareunia.8 These findings were independent of subject age. Another found that women with incontinence and prolapse were less sexually active than women without these problems.9 It also found that women who feared being incontinent during sexual intercourse had lower levels of sexual participation. Some studies have reported that pelvic organ prolapse may be associated with a significant reduction in sexual activity,10, 11 but other studies have been less conclusive.12 The etiology of incontinence during sexual intercourse is most likely multifactorial. Mechanical and nonmechanical factors may be involved.13 Some women only experience urinary incontinence at the time of orgasm. Studies have shown that women with incontinence during sexual activity report less overall satisfaction with the sexual act itself and lower health-related quality of life than women who do not leak urine.14, 15 The associations between urinary incontinence and low levels of sexual activity in women appear to cross multiple ethnic and cultural boundaries. Studies of women in Europe, Asia, and the Middle East have also revealed relationships between urinary incontinence, decreased sexual activity, and diminished quality of life.16-19 Although similar studies in men have been limited, there is evidence to suggest that men with urinary incontinence may also decrease their level of sexual activity.15 Anecdotally, many prostate cancer survivors who suffer from postprostatectomy urinary incontinence describe limiting their sexual activity. Even if they are able to achieve and maintain an adequate erection, they may avoid sexual activity for fear of leaking on their partner. In some cases, use of a condom to catch the urine may be helpful. However, in patients with large volume leakage, this would not be an adequate solution. Studies examining the effect of therapies to improve continence status on sexual health in women have yielded mixed results. Some have demonstrated an associated improvement in sexual function,20 whereas others have shown little or no improvement after surgical correction of prolapse or incontinence.5, 10 Nevertheless, Tannenbaum et al. correctly noted that partner availability is often not measured in these studies of older women.7 Additional research will be needed to further elucidate the effects of incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse on sexual function in older adult women. Because partner availability is such a strong predictor of sexual activity in this population, this variable must be taken into account in epidemiological research and studies designed to examine targeted intervention outcomes. Depictions of human sexuality are pervasive in modern popular culture. This imagery is used to sell everything from automobiles to soda pop, but it is rare to see depictions of sexuality in the elderly population and then almost never in a positive light. There have been occasional exceptions, such as the television program The Golden Girls, which originally aired from 1985 to 1992. This program depicted four vibrant older women, all of whom were sexually active at some point during the series. Yet their continence status was unknown. Perhaps urinary incontinence is one of the last taboo topics for the mainstream media? The younger members of the Baby Boom generation came of age in the 1960s during the height of the sexual revolution in the United States. As this population cohort ages, they will likely be more open to discussing matters of sexuality and sexual health and the associated effects of age and comorbid conditions such as urinary incontinence. There is a critical need for additional research on normative sexual behavior in older adults, particularly with regard to female sexual function. The role of the living environment must also be considered. The sexual activity of community-dwelling older people may be quite different from those in assisted living or long-term care because of availability of privacy for sexual activity. Increasing numbers of older adults are living with family members, and this may be a limiting factor for sexual activity for some people. Despite the recent wave of research and clinical interest in treatment of erectile dysfunction in men, there are limited available data on the overall degree of sexual satisfaction experienced by elderly people. There has also been almost no published research on the relationship between quality of life and alternate forms of sexual expression including masturbation and simple physical intimacy in older adults. Additional scholarly work in the areas of urinary incontinence and geriatric sexuality will help to better clarify the complex relationships between these conditions. This enhanced knowledge may aid in the development of future therapies for sexual dysfunction for men and women. These could have profound effects on sexual health and its overall effect on quality of life. Financial Disclosure: Dr. Tomas L. Griebling had no financial support in preparation of this editorial.

A disparate population is one in which disease and/or death rates are significantly worse compared to the health or mortality status of the general or comparison population. Rural-urban health disparities may be present among older adults in a number of ways. One common subtype differences by rural-urban status can occur when rural older adults are at a relative health disadvantage compared to urban and suburban older adults. Another common subtype, moderation of other disparities by rural-urban status is when other types of disparities are more pronounced among older adults living in rural areas than those living in urban and suburban areas. That is, where an older adult lives moderates or amplifies existing demographic, social, or economic disparities.",

      "abstract": "It is widely agreed that fecundity selection and sexual selection are the major evolutionary forces that select for larger body size in most organisms. The general, equilibrium view is that selection for large body size is eventually counterbalanced by opposing selective forces. While the evidence for selection favoring larger body size is overwhelming, counterbalancing selection favoring small body size is often masked by the good condition of the larger organism and is therefore less obvious. The suggested costs of large size are: (1) viability costs in juveniles due to long development and/or fast growth; (2) viability costs in adults and juveniles due to predation, parasitism, or starvation because of reduced agility, increased detectability, higher energy requirements, heat stress, and/or intrinsic costs of reproduction; (3) decreased mating success of large males due to reduced agility and/or high energy requirements; and (4) decreased reproductive success of large females and males due to late reproduction. A review of the literature indicates a substantial lack of empirical evidence for these various mechanisms and highlights the need for experimental studies that specifically address the fitness costs of being large at the ecological, physiological, and genetic levels. Specifically, theoretical investigations and comprehensive case studies of particular model species are needed to elucidate whether sporadic selection in time and space is sufficient to counterbalance perpetual and strong selection for large body size.",

      "abstract": "Serosorting (i.e., engaging in unprotected sex with partners known to be of the same serostatus) can be a difficult process for men who have sex with men (MSM) who frequently make assumptions about their partners' serostatus. This process can be further complicated by a partner's dishonesty as well as other individual and contextual factors. The present study specifically examined how assumptions of serostatus made about unknown serostatus partners impact on the sexual behavior of 110 alcohol–abusing HIV–positive MSM. Although previous research has shown that HIV–positive MSM are more likely to serosort with other known HIV–positive men than with known HIV–negative men, our data suggest that unprotected sex behavior may not be specifically driven by whether or not they made assumptions of seroconcordance or serodiscordance. The types of assumptions these HIV–positive MSM made about their unknown status sexual partners and the basis for such assumptions were also examined. Owing to the ambiguities involved in assumptions of a partner's serostatus in sexual encounters, the 'unknown status' partner category is analytically distinct from 'known status' categories, and needs to be more fully explored because of its impact on perceived serosorting, rather than actual serosorting, among HIV–positive men.",

      "title": "Gender Differences of African American Adolescents When Exposed to Race Related Stress",
      "abstract": "For African Americans, issues of discrimination, oppression, and belonging to a minority group may significantly impact their identity formation, and their cognitive and subjective beliefs regarding racial issues. Racism-related stress as it affects African American adolescents has become an area of concern for African American researchers. Racism related stress can be characterized as the negative psychological or physiological response to a perceived instance of a racism related attitude or behavior. African American adolescents, because of their race, continue to be subjected to various social stressors that lead to negative stress that depletes them of their abilities to cope in response. Without the ability to effectively cope with threatening life episodes African American adolescents experience more stressful and negative lifestyles. This study examined: (a) whether there are gender differences with regards to race related stress, (b) the association of SES and race related stress, (c) the association of the type of neighborhood one live in and race related stress, and (d) the association of which parent(s) the adolescent lives with and race related stress. Independent samples T-tests and Analysis of Variance were conducted to determine if there was a difference in gender with regard to race related stress. A significant difference was found with regards to the overall stress measure, as well as on the individual and collective subscales. Pearson-product moment correlations coefficients were conducted to determine the relations among demographic variables and race related stress. A significant positive relation was found between SES and family dynamic and race related stress. Race Related Stress vi ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS iii Abstract v Chapter I",

Men are less disapproving of a male friend who cancels plans with them for a date, or a male friend who kisses someone who is not his current partner, than are women of a friend of either gender in these situations. Men also use approximately half as many normative words when evaluating a male friend as when evaluating a female friend, or as women use when evaluating a friend of either gender. Nevertheless, gender has less effect on evaluations of behavioral appropriateness than do the type of friendship behavior evaluated and the context.

      "title": "Boys and Fatherhood",
      "abstract": "The academic study both of boys’ lives and of fatherhood has increased exponentially since the late 20th century, with both fields part of a wider expansion of masculinity studies, itself the product of a renewed focus on issues of gender and identity resulting from the rise of feminist studies in the closing decades of the 20th century. While some studies of fathering have paid attention to the topic of parenting boys, and a few of the growing number of studies of boys’ experiences have focused on relationships with fathers, research that brings the two topics together, exploring either fathers’ experience of raising sons, or boys’ relationships with their fathers, is a relatively new and developing field. This is by contrast with the situation in popular discourse, where a good deal of attention has focused on fathers and sons, often with a negative slant, viewing the so-called problem of boys (whether a supposed decline in educational achievement or a rise in antisocial behavior) as the result of father absence and a lack of positive male role models in the lives of boys in modern society. The topic of boys and fatherhood thus stands at the intersection of a number of important areas both of academic interest and of current policy debates and discourses, and this review seeks to include a cross section of those connected discussions from a range of intersecting disciplinary backgrounds. The primary focus is on aspects of boys’ relationships with their fathers, including the influence of those relationships on boys’ developing identities, and the role of fathers in responding to specific challenges in their sons’ lives. The emphasis on relationships complements the broader Oxford Bibliographies in Childhood Studies article on “Fathers” (by Esther McDermott), which focuses on social and structural aspects of fatherhood, as well as its representations. Any review of the academic literature on boys and fatherhood cannot avoid the vexed question of absent fatherhood, which is covered by two sections here: the first attempting to present diverse perspectives on the impact on boys, and the second examining the related debate surrounding the supposed absence of male role models in boys’ lives. The final section reviews the literature on another contentious issue, young fatherhood, and includes a range of perspectives on the implications of boys themselves becoming fathers. Although Oxford Bibliographies in Childhood Studies already includes a review of the literature on teenage fatherhood in the “Teenage Fathers” article (by Andrew M. Kiselica and Mark S.

      "title": "Virtual gender: How men and women use videogame bodies",
      "abstract": "Abstract Qualitative and quantitative data reveal that residents of virtual worlds have rich expectations for their in-game bodies (avatars), and that these expectations are important to how players respond to the typically hypersexualized bodies produced for most games. This paper argues that players are not a homogenous group in their response to such sexualization, but rather that while some players object to it, others, both male and female, enjoy it. The sexualization of videogame avatars participates in the social construction of gender norms and this process can disenfranchise players, but it also offers many players opportunities reclaim, subvert, and/or transform gender norms and thereby experience feelings of empowerment. As players have varied responses to the sexualization of videogame bodies, game designers need to provide a wide variety of customization options for both male and female bodies; these need not eliminate those currently offered, but should supplement them with other body types.",

      "title": "Geographic Variation in the Gender Differences in Test Scores",
      "abstract": "The causes and consequences of gender disparities in standardized test scores—especially in the high tails of achievement—have been a topic of heated debate. The existing evidence on standardized test scores largely confirms the prevailing stereotypes that more men than women excel in math and science while more women than men excel in tests of language and reading. We provide a new perspective on this gender gap in test scores by analyzing the variation in these disparities across geographic areas. We illustrate that male–female ratios of students scoring in the high ranges of standardized tests vary significantly across the United States. This variation is systematic in several important ways. In particular, states where males are highly overrepresented in the top math and science scores also tend to be states where women are highly overrepresented in the top reading scores. This pattern suggests that states vary in their adherence to stereotypical gender performance, rather than favoring one sex over the other across all subjects. Furthermore, since the genetic distinction and the hormonal differences between sexes that might affect early cognitive development (that is, innate abilities) are likely the same regardless of the state in which a person happens to be born, the variation we find speaks to the nature-versus-nurture debates surrounding test scores and suggests environments significantly impact gender disparities in test scores.",

      "abstract": "Masculinity is frequently talked about in contemporary Western media as being in crisis, needing reform or even being ‘toxic’. However, no research to date has assessed the impact that this pervasive narrative might be having on people, particularly men themselves. This cross-sectional online pilot survey asked 203 men and 52 women (mean + SD age 46 + 13) their opinions about the terms toxic masculinity, traditional masculinity, and positive masculinity, and how they would feel if their gender was seen as the cause of their relationship or job problems. Most participants thought the term toxic masculinity insulting, probably harmful to boys, and unlikely to help men’s behaviour. Having feminist views, especially being anti-patriarchy, were correlated with more tolerance of the term toxic masculinity. Most participants said they would be unhappy if their masculinity or femininity were blamed for their work or relationship problems. Further analysis using multiple linear regression found that men’s self-esteem was significantly predicted by older age, more education, and a greater acceptance of traditional masculinity. Men’s mental positivity – which is known to be negatively correlated with suicidality – was significantly predicted by older age, a greater acceptance of traditional masculinity, and more education. Implications for the mental health of men and boys are discussed in relation to the narrative around masculinity in the media, social sciences, and in clinical psychology.",

      "abstract": "Although much has been written suggesting that stress, grief, and other factors associated with parenting a child with disabilities results in high rates of marital discord, marital dissatisfaction, and divorce, this notion is poorly supported by research. Research demonstrates that parents of children with disabilities have marriages that exhibit the full range of function and dysfunction seen in the general population, most parents of children with disabilities have normal marriages, and the same things that predict healthy and unhealthy marriages in the general population also predict healthy and unhealthy marriages among parents of children with disabilities. A careful review of empirical studies of divorce rates of parents with and without disabilities suggests two reasonable possibilities: (1) There is no difference in divorce rates between parents of children with disabilities and parents of other children and most parents of children with disabilities do not divorce, or (2) there is a statistically significant but small increase in divorce rates among parents of children with disabilities. Even if the second possibility proves correct, it does not follow that increases in marital problems result from the children’s disabilities. It is at least equally likely that family dysfunction increases risk for divorce and disabilities in children. While a great deal of research has attempted to demonstrate that children with disabilities are somehow harmful to their parents’ marriages, very little attention has been paid to how bad marriages result in poor outcomes for children with disabilities.",

      "abstract": "Despite early emerging and impressive linguistic abilities, young children demonstrate ostensibly puzzling beliefs about the nature of language. In some circumstances monolingual children even express the belief that an individual's language is more stable than her race. The present research investigated bilingual children's thinking about the relative stability of language and race (Kinzler & Dautel, 2012). Five-to six-year-old bilingual children were asked to judge whether a target child who varied in race (White or Black) and language (English or French) would grow up to be an adult who maintained the target child's race or her language. Similar to many monolingual children, a heterogeneous group of bilingual children on average chose the language-match. Yet French-English bilingual children were relatively more likely to choose the race-match, especially when tested in their non-dominant language. Specific experience with relevant languages, and communicating in a non-dominant language, may contribute to children's developing metalinguistic success and their thinking about social categorization.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Increasing diversity and rapidly evolving sociopolitical context are changing how sexuality and gender identity are experienced, expressed, and measured in contemporary America. Based on longitudinal data from Aging with Pride: National Health, Aging, and Sexuality/Gender Study, we examine sexual and gender identity, differentiation from other related constructs (i.e., desire, behavior, expression, relationships) as well as the associations between properties of sexual and gender identities (e.g., congruence, continua, visibility, centrality, and transformation) and the health and well-being of LGBTQ midlife and older adults (N=2,233), aged 50-102 at baseline. The findings document important differences in current as well as lifetime sexual experiences, desires, and romantic relationships by sexuality and gender identity. Measures incorporating a continuum as opposed to binary response categories better capture the experiences of bisexual, sexually diverse, and transgender older participants as compared to lesbians and gay men. When examining transformation, 7% reported changes to their sexual identity and 3% reported changes to their gender identity over 4 years. Those who changed their identity over time showed a higher level of identity stigma and poorer physical and psychological health-related quality of life. Our findings reveal that heterogeneity and intersectionality are critical to understanding sexual and gender identity. It is important to consider multiple aspects of sexuality and gender (e.g., romantic relationships) that are often overlooked in gerontological and sexuality and gender research. Scholarship on sexual and gender identity development and transformation in later life is needed to better address diversity in the aging population.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Sexual selection is a potent force shaping multiple aspects of the interaction between the sexes, including the characters underlying reproductive success and sexual conflict, and may play an important role in determining the viability of populations. Experimental evolution is a methodological approach in which researchers either act as selective agents or establish the selective pressures operating on individuals to investigate changes in traits across generations and the genetic underpinning of these changes. Experimental evolution replicates the evolutionary process under controlled conditions and, by doing so, offers exceptional insights into the role of variation, selection and adaptation in evolution. Applied to the study of pre‐copulatory (before mating) and post‐copulatory (after mating) sexual selection, experimental evolution proves critical to understand the evolutionary consequences of male–male competition and female mate choice, and the repercussions of concurrent or divergent interests between the sexes in regard to reproduction. Key Concepts: Experimental evolution is a methodological approach to study adaptation under controlled experimental conditions. Sexual selection shapes the characters underlying reproductive success. Experimental evolution is a powerful tool for understanding the evolutionary consequences of sexual selection and sexual conflict.",

      "abstract": "The concept of adoption is not of common law origin, but a 'creature of statutory origin' in United States. Adoption is, therefore, a court procedure by which an adult becomes legal parent of someone who is not his or her biological child. Adoption creates a parent-child relationship recognized for all purposes-including support obligations, inheritance rights and custody. While in most cases adults adopt miners, it is possible in most states for one adult to adopt another. Regardless of type, adoptions can be granted only by a court and are allowed only when court declares adoption to be in best interests of child. To assist court in making this determination, state (or local) welfare department conducts on investigation into home maintained by prospective adopting parents. The court looks at: occupations, earnings and stability of prospective parents; medical, emotional and physical needs of child; religious and racial compatibility; whether prospective parents has any criminal record or history of abuse; age of child. In recent years, some people have challenged certain aspects of adoption process, calling for reform. Many of these people have conflicting concerns. Biological parents have challenged time limits when their consent for adoption becomes final. They want a longer period of time. For them, adoption should be viewed as a process of last resort. Conversely, adoptive parents wants shorter time limits in order to assure certainty and finality of adoption process. Adult adoptees, who were adopted as children, assert that adoption files that were closed when they were adopted and remain confidential should be open upon their request. They are in search of their biological identity. States are at various stages in responding to these reform demands. The Uniform Adoption Act, promulgated in 1994 by National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws and also adopted by American Bar Association in 1995, attempts to respond to these conflicting concerns. The promoters of Act also seek to influence various states to adopt this Act and bring uniformity of adoption law among states. Especially I have studied concerning Best Interests of Child in American Adoption Law. As a result, For generations, American law has professed the best interests of child doctrine, a threshold standard, as basis for american court decision and legislative intent concerning children.",

Primarily, both sexes gave gifts for special occasions and to build or maintain interpersonal relationships. However, men were more likely than women were to want to build and maintain one particular type of interpersonal relationship, that being romantic/sexual relationships. Men were more likely than women were to give gifts to escalate relationships to sex/dating and as a materetention tactic. Of all the personality traits examined, it was agreeableness that was correlated with the most reasons to give gifts. Moderation by the sex of the participant suggests that men who are low on extraversion and self-esteem may use gifts to do the “talking” for them.",

The fantastical possibilities a video game could explore are nearly limitless. However, a game’s design often precludes certain imaginative routes, shutting down one fantasy in favour of another. Games close out possibilities through actions as small as character design (gender, race, ability) and restrict imaginative interpretations to serve a narrow audience. Game developers design play that prioritizes hypermasculine narrative experiences, and players that do not align with this identity must condition themselves to play that excludes fantasies or alternate worlds that align with their experiences.\r\nThis essay explores attempts by game development studio Bioware to create video games that are inclusive of gay, lesbian, and bisexual players by writing in queer romantic narrative subplots into their games. While Bioware’s attempts are certainly not malicious, they fail time and time again, game after game, to break free of the hypermasculine and heterocentric culture dominant in the gaming industry. Instead, Bioware appropriates queer experiences and construes them as a burden to the player so as not to displace the fantasies of male, heterosexual gamers.",

By comparing the answers of the pupils with respect to their own sex and also between the two different schools, the study shows that girls tend to have a more gender-equal attitude towards issues connected to power-structure than boys. Boys are more varied in their attitudes towards these questions than girls. A vast majority of the youths claim social factors to be of more importance than biological ones. Special effort has also been made in analyzing one specific question, regarding the attitudes of the youths toward the position of prime minister/president. The results indicate that a majority of the girls believe that the post as a prime-minister/president is more natural for boys. This correlates with the fact that more girls than boys believe this specific position is bound by biological factors.",

Dalam perkawinan ada dna bentuk kategori dasar yakni monogami (satu istri\r\ndengan satu suami) dan poligami yang terdiri dari polyandry (dua atau lebih suami dengan satu istri), polygyny (dua atau lebih istri dengan satu suami) dan group marriage (dua atau lebih pasangan hidup bersama dalam sebuah perkawinan). Meskipun Pemerintah mempersulit dan mempersempit poligami dalam praktiknya cukup banyak laki-laki Indonesia yang melakukan poligami baik secara sah di Pengadilan maupun hanya kawin agama saja atau siri. Di dalam berpoligami masing-masing individu memiliki banyak motif, baik yang ditimbulkan oleh faktor luar maupun dari dalam individu. Pernikahan poligami tidaklah mudah, karena mulai dari memutuskan untuk berpoligami sampai perjalanan kehidupannya mereka mengalami konflik, baik konflik interpersonal maupun intrapersonal.\r\nPenelitian ini melibatkan 3 responden laki-laki yang memiliki istri lebih dari satu. Metode penelitian yang digunakan adalah kualitatif-studi kasus dengan teknik wawancara mendalam. Wawancara dilakukan secara terpisah dan dijadwalkan sesuai dengan kegiatan masing-masing responden. Metode analisis data mengacu pada analisis isi tematik, yang dimulai dengan wawancara kemudian memunculkan tema-tema, kategori-kategori dan pola hubungan diantara kategori-kategori tersebut.\r\nHasil penelitian menunjukkan bahwa motif responden menikah lagi adalah mencapai\r\npemuasan dan kebahagiaan pribadi karena responden tidak puas dengan kehidupannya, lari dari masalah rumah tangga yang dihadapinya dengan mencari tempat yang baru dan karena kekuatan ekonomi serta sikap otoriter laki-laki. Keputusan untuk menikah lagi mendapatkan protes baik dari keluarga,istri dan anak, karena tidak setuju dengan poligami. Pertentangan tujuan itu menjadi konflik tersendiri bagi responden baik bersifat interpersonal maupun intrapersonal, konflik itu timbul tidak hanya pada saat memutuskan untuk berpoligami saja melainkan pada saat setelah berpoligami. Pada saat memutuskan poligami konflik interpersonal timbul karena adanya perbedaan pendapat dan tujuan antara suami, keluarga, istri dan anak. Konflik intrapersonalnya dikarenakan dihadapkan pada dua pilihan atau dua situasi yang tidak mengenakan. Konflik interpersonal setelah atau selama berpoligami dikarenakan ketidakmampuan responden untuk me-manage para istri sehingga istri tidak bisa saling mengerti, memahami dan menerima.",

      "abstract": "My thesis seeks to reduce what may be a natural human antipathy to ageing and/or the elderly by working with one distinctive and consistently approved feature of some older people. This feature is a bold and cheerful struggle within a self‐chosen project. The argument opens by distinguishing short‐term gratification from lasting, fulfilling happiness, and showing the link between gratification and dependence. Three kinds of struggle (non‐voluntary, part‐voluntary and positive) are then outlined and exemplified. Gerontological and anthropological research suggest that attitudes to struggle are fixed early in life, and while in the past they mitigated for or against successful survival, they now influence happiness and coping in later life. I argue that the negative effects of the first two kinds of struggle ‐ which are often misguided, grudging or ‘no‐win’ struggles ‐ are responsible for the rigidity, narcissism and resentment disliked in some older people. Self‐respect, contrasted with self‐righteousness, is shown to accrue only from the positive (voluntary and congenial) struggle that seems at any age to deflect or compensate for depression, disappointment, loneliness and illness.",

Further explored is what establishment of such female-excluding male spaces reveal about relative parallels and/or differences in construction of gender identity and definitions of masculinity held by participating members of two male group—one in the Tuscany region of Central Italy, the other in southwestern Connecticut and made up largely of second and third generation Italian-Americans. Do these men, when in their own and exclusive company, act out too easily assumed stereotypes of Italian and Italian-American masculinities—hot tempered, competitive, prone to violence, mother adoring, Latin lovers? Or are their constructions of masculinity based on other and socioculturally and ethnohistorically tempered criteria of masculinity (Società, skill attainment, physical strength and separation from an impoverished past and the feminine)?",

The pilot interviews involved two heterosexual couples, one co-resident and one not; and two co-resident same sex couples, one female and one male. The number of heterosexual couples living in long-term arrangements outside of marriage has significantly increased. There may be growing resistance among young adults to making any moral distinction between marriage and cohabitation. This is suggested by British data both qualitative and the quantitative British and Scottish Social Attitudes Surveys (BSAS and SASS), indicating that only a minority of the population now disapprove of sex before marriage or cohabitation. A morality that only sanctioned sex within marriage has been largely replaced by one that sanctions sex among consenting adults in loving relationships regardless of marriage and, for some, regardless of heterosexuality.",

The current study examined such tolerance in the Chinese ( N = 949) and the British ( N = 305) cultural contexts. Consistent with the predictions derived from an evolutionary framework, across different cultural settings, men exhibited higher tolerance than women to their partners' same-sex infidelity. In addition, if they had to choose, men were considerably more likely than women to prefer their partners to cheat with an individual of the same than of the opposite sex. Participants were also more tolerant of infidelity involving their short-term than their long-term partners. Moreover, men who preferred same-sex attraction in women were more tolerant to the same-sex infidelity of their female partners than men who did not share these preferences. Finally, men and women who experienced same-sex attractions indicated higher tolerance to infidelity. The implications of these finding for the evolution of same-sex attraction in women were further discussed.",

      "abstract": "Background: The prevalence of vaginismus ranges from 1-6%, and the ratio becomes 5%-17% in clinical setting, although it varies widely worldwide. The main cause of vaginismus is not known, but is often considered multifactorial. This paper aims to describe the factors that contribute to vaginismus. Case: A 26 years old, married woman, health practitioner presented with the complaint of not being able to have sexual intercourse. About 1 month ago, since marriage, the patient was unable to have sexual intercourse with her husband. The patient feels guilty and anxious because of the inability to please her husband. The patient's father was very dominant and was a \"religious\" type of parent who always gave advice with religious aspects regarding all matters. The patient's mother was a nervous person and always said that what the father said was a law that had to be obeyed. Likewise, talk about sex is a taboo topic of discussion and is considered embarrassing. Discussion: Many factors need to be explored related vaginismus. In the case, the biological aspect can be ruled out because the patient has consulted with the ob-gyn doctor. from the psychological aspect; perceptions, attitudes and attitudes towards sex and the values ​​held by parents contribute to vaginismus in this patient. Conclusion: a therapeutic approach which focuses on all aspects promises quite good therapeutic outcomes.",

      "abstract": "Sexual selection theory argues that females invest more heavily in reproduction than males and thus tend to be choosier in terms of mate choice. Sport may provide a context within which females can gain information about male quality to inform this choice. Males may be able to display attractive traits such as athleticism, strength, and physique to females while participating in sport. We predicted that females would favor males that participated in team sports over individual sports and non-athletes because team sport athletes may be more likely to display qualities such as the ability to work well with others and role acceptance. We used a questionnaire, a photograph, and manipulated descriptions to gauge the effects of sport involvement, attractiveness, and status on 282 females' willingness to participate in various types of relationships. Team sport athletes were perceived as being more desirable as potential mates than individual sport athletes and non-athletes. It is suggested that team sport athletes may have traits associated with good parenting such as cooperation, likeability, and role acceptance, and/or these athletes may be better able to assert dominance in a team setting. Results are discussed in terms of further implications and future research.",

      "title": "Sexual Manifestations of Emotionally Disturbed Behavior",
      "abstract": "It is difficult to define sexual disturbance today because concepts about emotional disturbance in general and sexual disorder in particular have recently undergone signifi cant changes. Sexual disorders may be seen in terms of (a) specific aberrant acts or (b) the psychological and philo sophic causes that underlie such acts. It would appear to be more meaningful to define them largely in relation to the self- defeating ways in which and reasons for which an individual behaves sexually rather than in terms of the concrete behav iors he performs. When so viewed, the basic causes of sexual disorders seem to be quite the same as those of most general emotional difficulties. Societal reaction to disturbed indi viduals with sexual problems has improved in recent years but is still much too condemnatory and punitive. At the same time, some social thinkers, in a misguided effort to pre vent the persecution of sexually troubled and deviant indi viduals unrealistically refuse to face the facts of their intrinsic neurosis or psychosis and trace all their upsets to social persecution. Sexually disturbed persons are not easy to treat successfully for a variety of reasons, especially by conven tional psychoanalytic methods. But if a hard-headed thera pist actively-directively intervenes in their lives and induces them to challenge and work against their irrational value systems, he may achieve effective results in a relatively brief period of time.",

      "abstract": "Depression and anxiety disorders are prevalent mental health conditions that exhibit sex/gender differences in their incidence and clinical presentation. Women are more susceptible to these disorders, showing more severe symptoms and a higher likelihood of chronicity. Suicide rates also vary by gender, with men experiencing higher rates of completed suicide and women having higher rates of suicide attempts. The underlying mechanisms for sex/gender differences in these disorders are multifactorial, with significant roles played by biological factors such as sex hormones, the endocrine/immune system, the neuroimmune system, and the neuroregulatory system. Psychosocial and sociocultural factors also contribute to these differences. Sex/gender differences in the diagnosis and treatment of depression and anxiety disorders remain poorly understood. However, research indicates that there are sex differences in drug response and metabolism and that sex hormones may influence the effectiveness of pharmacotherapy. Women generally have better access to and response to treatment than men, although the evidence for sex/gender differences in treatment outcomes is limited, and further research is needed to better understand these differences.",

      "title": "Flying Solo at Midlife: Gender, Marital Status, and Psychological Well-Being",
      "abstract": "This study examines gender and marital status differences in psychological well-being across an extensive array of measures using data from a sample of non-Hispanic, White, midlife adult participants in the Wisconsin Longitudinal Study, 1992-1993 (N = 6,876). Evidence for how selection and social causation might account for differences also is evaluated. Multivariate analyses reveal several gender interactions, usually indicating a greater disadvantage for unmarried men than for unmarried women. Separate analyses by gender show a complex picture of both positive and negative effects of being single. Contrary to what the selection argument hypothesizes, single women have higher scores on relatively enduring personality characteristics associated with better psychological well-being than married women. Single men do not compare so favorably with married men. Overall, selection does not account for marital status differences in well-being. Household income and having a kin confidant mediate some of the remaining effects. Key Words: gender, marital status, midlife, personality, psychological well-being. Historically, researchers have found that married men and women report better psychological wellbeing than their unmarried peers (e.g., Gove, Hughes, & Style, 1983; Gove & Shin, 1989; Gove, Style, & Hughes, 1990; Lee, Seccombe, & Shehan, 1991). Yet despite a significant lengthening of life expectancy during this century for both men and women, younger birth cohorts of American adults are spending proportionately less of their adult lives married. This is due to historical trends toward a later age at marriage, a higher rate of nonmarriage, a higher rate of divorce, and a lower rate of remarriage (Schoen, Urton, Woodrow, & Baj, 1985). Larger proportions of younger birth cohorts are now more likely to be single (never married, divorced, or widowed) during their midlife and older years. Uhlenberg, Cooney, and Boyd (1990) project that almost one third of White women in the 1955-1959 birth cohort will be unmarried at midlife between the ages of 50 and 54, and one half will be unmarried when they enter young old age between 65 and 69. If marriage is associated with better mental health, do these demographic trends portend a proliferation of mental health problems in our future aging society? Or is there any additional evidence that might indicate that as adult single life becomes more common, it is also becoming less disadvantaged or at least not unequivocally problematic? Glenn and Weaver (1988), using data from separate national surveys conducted from 1977 through 1986, reported that the relation between being married and self-reported happiness declined during this time. Most of the decline appeared to be related to an increase in the happiness of never-married males and a decrease in the reported happiness of married females. The decline in differences in happiness between the married and the nonmarried was most obvious for younger adults (ages 19-24). Recent qualitative studies of single (both never-married and formerly married) midlife women (Anderson & Stewart, 1994; Gordon, 1994) also have suggested that mature single women are beginning to report advantages to single status, advantages such as personal autonomy and growth that have made flying solo a psychologically rewarding experience. Previous work evaluating gender, marital status, and psychological well-being has been limited by a narrow set of outcome measures. Measures of depression most commonly are employed, followed by one-item measures of life satisfaction or overall happiness. However, it has become increasingly clear that psychological well-being is multidimensional and that scoring high on both positive and negative outcome measures might be expected to occur because positive and negative psychological states are negatively correlated but are not a bipolar continuum (Bradburn, 1969; Bryant & Veroff, 1982; Ryff, 1989, 1995; Ryff & Essex, 1991; Ryff & Keyes,1995). …",

All models of sexual selection assume that sex traits are costly to produce and maintain, and individuals with reduced costs of production and maintenance of secondary sexual characters would be at a selective advantage. A number of morphological, physiological and behavioural traits may have evolved as a result of their cost‐reducing properties: (1) body size, which does not change throughout life, that allows certain individuals to develop exaggerated sex traits, (2) cost‐reducing traits, such as muscle size, that improve with practice and (3) actual cost‐reducing traits, such as wing size in birds with song flight, which are produced in advance of or simultaneously with the sex trait. Cost‐reducing traits may coevolve with secondary sexual characters and allow more extreme sexual signalling than would otherwise have been possible in their absence or in reduced versions.",

Males account for %5-15 of all eating disorders. History of a criticism or a teasing for fatness by relatives or friends is very common in males before the onset of the illness. Males who are in occupations or athletic pursuits that emphasize body weight, or who work in potential high-risk jobs, and who are homosexual are at increased risk for eating disorders. Potential high risk jobs include appearance-based jobs, jobs traditionally held by women and food related jobs. Comorbid psychiatric disorders, mainly depression and anxiety disorders, and especially for bulimic males, substance-related disorders and cluster B personality traits with marked impulsivity are common. When family dynamics are considered, a father who is psychologically distant from his son, and an \"over-protective, over-involved and over-dependent\" mother have been described. Separation difficulties and lack of boundaries within covertly conflictual relationships have been noted in a number of clinical reports. The only difference in clinical presentation between males and females is; males rarely use medicine in order to lose weight and weight changes throughout the illness are more common in males. In this case report, a male anorexia nervosa case's psychodynamics are discussed under the influence of his psychiatric illness and his childhood history.",

      "abstract": "The \"Greater Male Variability Hypothesis\" (GMVH) of intelligence is a century-old idea that males have been over-represented in elite academic, political, and economic roles because they are more variable in intellectual ability than females. Proponents of the GMVH argue that males and females may have similar average intelligence, but greater male variability implies that males are over-represented at the extreme high end of the distribution. The evidence for this hypothesis is mixed but consists of greater male variance in intelligence test scores, especially from the early 20th century. While it is often assumed that intelligence measures are independent of test design procedures, I show, with computational modeling, that designing a test for one population leads to statistical irregularities when applied to another. For example, early intelligence tests were often designed to test intelligence in primarily male populations, including exclusively male Army draftees in the First World War or mostly male secondary school applicants. I show that typical question selection procedures, when used to design a test for males, tend to increase the variance of male scores relative to female scores. This suggests that greater male test score variance may be explained by biased test design, and other explanations are needed to explain male overrepresentation in elite positions.",

Sex differences emerge primarily in social situations, and their nature varies with the gender composition of dyads and groups. Children find same-sex play partners more compatible, and they segregate themselves into same-sex groups, in which distinctive interaction styles emerge. These styles are described. As children move into adolescence, the patterns they developed in their childhood same-sex groups are carried over into cross-sex encounters in which girls' styles put them at a disadvantage. Patterns of mutual influence can become more symmetrical in intimate male-female dyads, but the distinctive styles of the two sexes can still be seen in such dyads and are subsequently manifested in the roles and relationships of parenthood.

      "abstract": "Purpose Definitions of rape and sexual aggression have varied widely in the research literature, resulting in a wide range of estimates for perpetration and remaining questions as to the factors that may affect involvement in sexual violence. The paper aims to discuss this issue. Design/methodology/approach The current study uses a sample of college men to assess multiple forms of measurement of sexual aggression and theoretical predictors. Findings Findings indicate that the different measures of sexual aggression (broad vs narrow; hypothetical vs behavioral) are significantly correlated with each other. Additionally, many theoretical predictors (rape myths, low self-control, sexual entitlement, and pornography use) are consistently related to all measurement forms. However, some variables (masculinity, peer support for violence against women, sexual partners, and alcohol and drug use) are only related to broad measures of sexual aggression, and some are related only to hypothetical (i.e. certainty of apprehension) or behavioral measures (i.e. fraternity membership). Research limitations/implications Because of the chosen approach, the results may lack generalizability. Findings do, however, point to important considerations in defining sexual aggression moving forward.

      "abstract": "Occasionally, a preschool child may erroneously accuse a parent of molestation. When this occurs, the child usually believes that his or her story is correct. A false accusation can be made when an adult has persuaded a child that the sexual events actually occurred, when a child in the oedipal stage has misinterpreted caregiving ministrations, when a child's thought processes are confused by primary process material, or when a child is secondarily involved in the projective identifications of a dominant caregiver. More than one of these mechanisms may operate in a given case.",

      "abstract": "Many have suggested that complementary gender stereotypes of men as agentic (but not communal) and women as communal (but not agentic) serve to increase system justification, but direct experimental support has been lacking. The authors exposed people to specific types of gender-related beliefs and subsequently asked them to complete measures of gender-specific or diffuse system justification. In Studies 1 and 2, activating (a) communal or complementary (communal + agentic) gender stereotypes or (b) benevolent or complementary (benevolent + hostile) sexist items increased support for the status quo among women. In Study 3, activating stereotypes of men as agentic also increased system justification among men and women, but only when women's characteristics were associated with higher status. Results suggest that complementary stereotypes psychologically offset the one-sided advantage of any single group and contribute to an image of society in which everyone benefits through a balanced dispersion of benefits.",

      "title": "Sexual Conflict in Human Mating",
      "abstract": "Despite interdependent reproductive fates that favor cooperation, males and females exhibit many psychological and behavioral footprints of sexually antagonistic coevolution. These include strategies of deception, sexual exploitation, and sexual infidelity as well as anti-exploitation defenses such as commitment skepticism and emotions such as sexual regret and jealousy. Sexual conflict pervades the mating arena prior to sexual consummation, after a mating relationship has formed, and in the aftermath of a breakup. It also permeates many other social relationships in forms such as daughter-guarding, conflict in opposite-sex friendships, and workplace sexual harassment. As such, sexual conflict constitutes not a narrow or occasional flashpoint but rather persistent threads that run through our intensely group-living species.",

      "abstract": "Expecting parents are often eager to learn the sex of their baby. Gender-reveal parties offer a community or family celebration of that information, often complete with clichéd pink or blue colour coding. Common practices include party games, competitions between Team Boy and Team Girl, and the colourful surprise reveal via confetti, smoke, balloons or food. Not only is the term ‘gender-reveal’ inaccurate (at best sonograms reveal biological sex), the practice privileges stereotypical gender binaries and legitimates pre-birth personhood under the guise of merriment, appropriating the unborn body as a contested discursive site. The gender-reveal party enhances reliance on medical technology and consumerism, retrieves traditional superstitions about pregnancy, obsolesces privacy and reverses into the commodification of both mother and child. Gender-reveals do not necessarily celebrate the pregnancy or the mother. The gender-reveal party functions to reinforce traditional cisgender binaries and constructs gendered expectations for the child even before birth.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT In adolescence curiosity about sexual problems is very important in the formation of a new, more mature relationship with the opposite sex. Information about sexual problems should be started, so that teens do not seek information from another person or from sources that are not clear or even wrong at all. Giving information about sexual problems become s even more important in view of teenagers who are sexually active in potency, because it is associated with hormone-influenced sexual drive and often do not have enough information about their own sexual activity. Of course it w ill be very harmful to the mental development of a teenager when he does not have the right knowledge and information. Facts show that the majority of our youth do not know the impact of sexual behavior that they do, often adolescents are not mature to have sexual intercourse especially if you have to bear the risk of the sexual relationship.

These associations hold regardless of whether the young mad is the provider or the recipient of the gifts and whether the sex is with his main partner or a casual partner. (excerpt)",

      "title": "Sex differences in partner preferences in humans and animals",
      "abstract": "A large number of morphological, physiological and behavioural traits are differentially expressed by males and females in all vertebrates including humans. These sex differences, sometimes, reflect the different hormonal environment of the adults, but they often remain present after subjects of both sexes are placed in the same endocrine conditions following gonadectomy associated or not with hormonal replacement therapy. They are then the result of combined influences of organizational actions of sex steroids acting early during development, or genetic differences between the sexes, or epigenetic mechanisms differentially affecting males and females. Sexual partner preference is a sexually differentiated behavioural trait that is clearly controlled in animals by the same type of mechanisms. This is also probably true in humans, even if critical experiments that would be needed to obtain scientific proof of this assertion are often impossible for pragmatic or ethical reasons. Clinical, epidemiological and correlative studies provide, however, converging evidence strongly suggesting, if not demonstrating, that endocrine, genetic and epigenetic mechanisms acting during the pre- or perinatal life control human sexual orientation, i.e. homosexuality versus heterosexuality. Whether they interact with postnatal psychosexual influences remains, however, unclear at present.",

      "title": "Gay and Straight Men Prefer Masculine-Presenting Gay Men for a High-Status Role: Evidence From an Ecologically Valid Experiment",
      "abstract": "Abstract There is increased acceptance of gay men in most Western societies. Nevertheless, evidence suggests that feminine-presenting gay men are still disadvantaged compared to gay men who present in a more traditionally masculine way. Though gay men themselves may be complicit in perpetuating this bias, studies that demonstrate this possibility are scant. Whereas most studies on perceptions of feminine-presenting gay men have manipulated gender nonconformity via written descriptions, research suggests that behavioural cues such as voice and body-language can mitigate or exacerbate prejudice toward a stereotyped individual. In the current study, audio-visual stimuli were created to investigate how masculine versus feminine behaviour would impact status endowment from other gay and heterosexual men. In total, 256 men ( M age = 42.73, SD = 14.48: half gay; half heterosexual) cast, from a selection of six video-taped candidates, one gay man to play a lead role in a purported ad for a tourism campaign. In the videos, the actors delivered a script related to the tourism campaign in a manner where their voice and body-language was manipulated to come across as either masculine or feminine-presenting. Findings indicated that gay and heterosexual participants showed a significant preference for the masculine videoclips. For heterosexual men, the preference for masculine-presenting actors was predicted by greater anti-gay sentiment, whereas internalised anti-gay prejudice did not predict a preference for masculine-presentation among gay men. Implications of the findings for discourse and education on intraminority prejudice and suggestions for future research are offered.",
