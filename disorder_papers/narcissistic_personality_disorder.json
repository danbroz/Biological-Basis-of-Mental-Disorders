      "title": "Disintegration of the Self-Structure Caused by Severe Trauma",
      "abstract": "Severe trauma affects all structures of the self – one's image of the body; the internalized images of the others; and one's values and ideals – and leads to a sense that the self-coherence and self-continuity are invaded, assaulted, and systematically broken down. The traumatic events overwhelm the ordinary human adaptations to life and generally involve threats to life or bodily integrity, confront human beings with the extremities of helplessness and terror, and evoke the response of catastrophe. The vulnerable self-structure of traumatized individuals is evident in the following ways: (a) difficulties in self-regulation (self-esteem maintenance, lower tolerance levels, and the sense of self-discontinuity and personal agency), (b) appearance of the clinical symptomatology (frequent upsurges of anxiety/fear, depression, and specific fears or phobias regarding the external world or one's own bodily integrity), and (c) reliance on primitive or less-developed forms of the self-object relatedness. Severe trauma may lead to de-centering of the self (self-at-worst), loss of groundlessness and a sense of sameness, self-discontinuity and ego-fragility, leaving scars on the one's 'inner agency' of the psyche, fragmentation of the ego-identity resulting in proneness to dissociation.",

      "title": "18Boosting State Humility via Gratitude, Self-Affirmation, and Awe: Theoretical and Empirical Perspectives",
      "abstract": "Humility is a psychological characteristic marked by a balanced, accurate \nself-concept and pronounced focus on other people rather than oneself \n(Tangney, 2000). We propose that humility is characterized by five hallmarks, \nor observable markers: (a) a secure and accepting self-identity; (b) freedom \nfrom distortion about one’s strengths and weaknesses; (c) openness to new \ninformation about oneself and the world; (d) high focus on others relative to \nthe self; and (e) a belief that other people are equally worthy (Chancellor & \nLyubomirsky, 2013). Each hallmark must be present, but none is individually sufficient for a person to be humble. These hallmarks thus both define \nhumility and differentiate it from what it is not. In particular, the opposite of \nhumility is high self-focus, including an excessively positive (e.g., narcissism \nor arrogance) or negative (e.g., depression or low self-esteem) self-view. Further, under this hallmarks-based definition, humility can be distinguished from \nmodesty. Although humble people are frequently modest, they may sometimes \nbehave immodestly when speaking frankly about their genuine strengths and \naccomplishments. Additionally, narcissistic individuals may behave outwardly \nmodestly for self-presentational purposes while maintaining an inwardly inflated \nself-worth. As such, humility is neither merely the absence of arrogance nor the \npresence of modesty.",

      "title": "A review on personality disorders; narcissistic and cluster C",
      "abstract": "This article reviews four types of personality disorders. Narcissistic, avoidant, dependent, obsessive compulsive personality disorders. Here is a brief introduction to these four personality disorders: The avoidant personality disorder is defined by a constant feeling of inadequacy. Patients with this disorder are hepersensitive to negative situations and they fear of being criticized of rejected. Thus, they avoid social and cultural interactions. They have limited themselves into a small line of close friends. The narcissistic personality disorder can cause great difficulties in interpersonal relationships, especially marriage. This is because narcissists are always self-righteousness and the world should revolve around them. Narcissistic people are not able to love others. They do not understand love (they constantly ridicule others and humiliate their subordinates). However, they take advantage of concept of love in order to deceive and trap others but it is all theatrics and role-playing. People with dependent personality disorder typically rely on others for their needs. They expect that others accept responsibility for most important issues in life. They lack self-confidence. They feel intense dissatisfaction whenever they feel lonely, even for a short time. Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder is presented by discipline-oriented perfectionism and psychological control. The individuals with this disorder try to be in control of everything through careful attention to norms, details, lists and programs. They are extremely careful, repeat every task for several times, and pay special attention to details and frequently resolve probable mistakes. They do not pay attention to the fact that other people feel upset in case of delays and discomfort that arises from their excessive behavior.",

      "title": "The Abnegated Self",
      "abstract": "A self-abnegating person has lost contact with her agency, either against or without her will. This doesn't mean that she cannot provide reasons for or a narrative about her actions. It is just that those reasons and that narrative are someone else's. People abnegate part of their agency regularly; for example, this is done within hierarchical institutions. In other times, the self-abnegation is all-encompassing; for example, this happens to victims of brainwashing. An agent in such a position can completely fail to understand herself or be understood as having a self. This can arise from internal and external forces. After describing the features of self-abnegation, Wieland concludes by considering whether the self-abnegated person is owed respect. Should a person be treated as if her reasons and narratives were her own even though they are derived from the will of another? Are we obligated to cultivate self-affirmation in the self-abnegating agent?",

      "abstract": "Identity interweaves with the emotions of its bearer, either as an individual or a group member. Identity defines the emotional attitude towards other people (their ‘own’ or ‘alien’), towards the social and natural environment, towards the world as a whole. On the other hand, the emotional attitude determines the identity. This attitude could be spontaneously occurring, but very often it is culturally conditioned, and purposefully designed. Postulates of national identity can take the form of imperatives like „Love your motherland!” Very often they are formulated in another way that replaces the imperative with allegations expressed by claims in first person (single or plural) or in impersonal form. Such statements are similar and operate as spells. The ambivalent attitude to the ‘own’ contains some negative elements. Their designation may indicate a trauma, frustration caused by some kind of insufficiency (including a lack of heroic deeds), inferiority complex. Trauma and shame can be pushed to the unconscious, but can also be productive as a cohesive element and as search for compensatory actions or verbal structures.",

      "title": "Debts of Good Will and Interpersonal Justice",
      "abstract": "A debt of good will (utang na loob in Filipino) is incurred when a person becomes the beneficiary of significant assistance or favor given by another. Usually, the beneficiary is in acute need of the assistance given or favor granted. This provides an opportunity for the giving of help to serve as a vehicle for the expression of sympathy or concern. The debt could then be appreciated as one of good will because, by catering to another person's pressing need, the benefactor is able to express positive dispositions towards the beneficiary. It is not merely the receipt of the assistance or favor that puts the recipient in a position of indebtedness. The indebtedness is created by the benefactor's kagandahang loob (good will). An act can be considered to convey kagandahang loob only if it is done out of kusang loob (roughly, free will); and can only be considered to have been done out of kusang loob if the agent (1) is not acting under external compulsion, (2) is motivated by positive feelings (e.g. charity, love or sympathy) towards the beneficiary, and (3) is not motivated by the anticipation of reward. These conditions entail debt-of-goodwill relationships where the benefactor has no right to demand reciprocity but the beneficiary has a \"self-imposed\" obligation to repay kagandahang loob with kagandahang loob. Debts of good will are about some forms of justice. But we should not reduce all talk about debts of good will to talk about justice.",

Empathy requires both the suspension of disbelief, indeed of one’s very existence (by assuming someone else’s identity if only for a moment, like actors do) and the surrender of control (by allowing other people to dictate how one feels). Both feats go against the grain of narcissists, let alone psychopaths. In the case of the narcissist, he has already suppressed his true self. To also suspend his False Self (to make room for the Other) would amount to self-annihilation. It is safe to say that the same applies to such patients who are co-diagnosed (co-morbid) with other personality disorders, notably Schizoid, Paranoid, Borderline, Avoidant, and Schizotypal.",

However considered, sympathetic, well-intentioned, and technically couched his opinions may be, he judges some behavior and its attendant circumstances to be less desirable than others.

Or else, he sees the patient's means of striving, the inordinately great or miniscule amount of energy he expends in adaptation, his emotionally inappropriate tone of behavior, or the character of his relationship with other people to be somehow wrong. Just as the law sees a lawbreaker deviating from legal norms, the psychiatrist , views his patient to be deviant with respect to some ideal pattern which may be left unvoiced or inexplicit. My object is not to question the propriety of such professional judgments but to determine what might be called their social basis and to call attention to certain consequences that follow.",

Sexual misfits experience frustration in relation to their sexuality due to a misfit between 1) the physical and social practices that might constitute a sexuality, 2) the language that might be involved in accomplishing those practices or in reflecting on them, and 3) the categories (both practical and theoretical) that structure the social world and provide it with intelligibility. Sexuality is understood to be both one sociological variable that we use to identify ourselves and others, and the effect of a cloud of other sociological variables. Misfits are people who discover that they don't belong to the class that they have been taken (by themselves or by others) to belong to, because it happens that some criteria that nobody had ever mentioned (or would ever think to mention) has not been satisfied, or because they either lack an essential secondary property or possess a disqualifying one. The absence or presence of such a hidden or secondary property may not even be apparent until a certain event or interaction occurs, until a certain context emerges, or until a certain situation arises.",

      "title": "Reply to “a non-paternalistic value theory for occupational therapy: a response to Dige”",
      "abstract": "Sandman makes it sound as if I am the one who defends a contentious theory whereas the alternatives, i.e. hedonistic or desire-fulfilment theories, are more uncontroversial or “minimal”. I fail to see this because I find it much more straightforward to say that certain elements of a human life, e.g. accomplishment, personal relationships, and understanding, have a direct or intrinsic value and therefore are something that it is good to enjoy or desire whereas others, e.g. monotony, isolation, and confusion, have a direct or intrinsic disvalue and therefore are something that is not worth enjoying or desiring. It is not entirely clear whether Sandman wants to challenge the view that activity is intrinsically better than passivity or the view that specific types of activities (e.g. those involving personal relationships, understanding, and accomplishment) are objectively better than others in the sense that they constitute genuine, intrinsic values. The first point is easily misunderstood. The claim that activity is intrinsically good does not imply an ideal of hyperactivity and extreme sports. Sandman’s examples of rather monotonous and mindless activities (playing Tetris and “ordering, reordering and ordering again a set of differently coloured pens”) are interesting only if they more or less take up all the person’s time. Most of us use a considerable amount of time on activities like that (for better or worse). It becomes a professional (OT) challenge only if the person seems incapable of enjoying or desiring anything else and I have a hard time imagining a responsible occupational therapist who would accept a life of total passivity (taking part in no challenging or social or self-involving activities whatsoever) as a possible ideal life. The second point is a matter of considerable philosophical controversy and it would be overly ambitious to try to settle it definitively. Hence, apart from what I have said in the original article, I will just offer an example for consideration. Imagine a child in an elementary school who exclaims: “But I do not want to come to understand maths or grammar or anything else at all and I do not want to interact with you teachers and the other children and I do not want to make school work my own accomplishment!” That would certainly be a pedagogic challenge but I think it would take a lot more than this to make it a challenge to our belief in these values. On the contrary, it would simply be unprofessional if the schoolteachers reassessed their mission and value commitments to the effect that they gave up on teaching maths to those who did not want it, allowed the antisocial children to be left alone, and so on. Quite another but very important consideration is that we sometimes have to settle for something short of the ideal. Imagine for example that the child suffers from social phobia and gets extremely anxious when",

Complaints that human beings are capable of expressing are not so many, there are only a handful, and this work intends to be exhaustive in its exposition. It is possible to complain against third persons. It is also possible to do so against oneself assuming either the intransigent attitude of a father who judges a son who does not fulfill his expectancies, or as a son who resents the paternal demands which he feels he cannot comply. Other kind of complaints include physical symptoms, either isolated (cephalea, dysnea, urticaria) or constituting syndromes or illnesses. Losses suffered are also a source of complaints, whatever the lost object might be (person, situation, material things or a part of oneself). It can be mourned because of its absence, or else by feeling guilty of the real or imaginary damage inflicted or else by feeling indisolubly linked to it with a phantom tie. Other types of complaints are the feeling of dependancy towards something oppressive, be it a substance, such as alcohol, smoking, drugs or overeating, or it may be a person or a situation.

Many people suppose that even if the egoist can be kind, charitable, or generous on certain occasions, his egoism undermines his capacity to enjoy deeper, more rewarding personal relationships. After all, isn't the egoist committed to always putting himself first? And as a consequence, won't he be too wrapped up in himself to care about others – or at least, to care in the way that a true friend would? Without a less calculated commitment to another person's well-being, the soul of love and friendship seems unavailable to him. Egoists cannot be authentic friends or lovers, the suspicion is, since, qua egoists, they can value others only instrumentally.",

If an individual’s behavior or motives are altruistic, one shows concern for the happiness and welfare of other people rather than just for oneself. One is selfless and not selfish. To express it in another way, altruism is the renunciation of the self and an exclusive concern and care for the welfare of others. It is a traditional virtue in many cultures and a core aspect of various religious traditions. Giving alms to the poor is often considered an altruistic action in many cultures and religions. Altruism is also a motivation to provide a value to a party who must be anyone but the self, while duty and loyalty are somewhat moral obligation of a person toward a specific individual (God or a king) or collective body (a government). Some individuals may feel both altruism and duty, while others may not. Pure altruism is an instinctively “giving” value without any regard to rewards or the benefits that recognition of the giving may bring. The term altruism may also refer to an ethical doctrine that claims that individuals are morally obliged to benefit others. Used in this sense, it is the opposite of egoism.",

      "abstract": "The research aims to highlight how Imru' al-Qays's feelings were directed at him in many of his defensive tricks in poetry, and to show what is behind some of his claims of alleged virility; By entering the psychological world of Imru' al-Qays, following the methods of Adler and others who wrote in this direction, the inferiority complex is manifested in a person's constant feeling of his lack of others; Which makes him look at himself far from the real reality in order to exalt him or reduce it, and look at others with a look of malice and hatred or say a projective look; because he sees himself undesirable from the group to which he belongs; It involves himself, and escapes from the responsibilities of life, and when this feeling settles in himself, he resorts to making fun of others, or claiming an alleged linguistic heroism that appears in the constant desire to be superior to others, and thus he adopts a form of aggressive behavior; In order to prove himself, and achieve psychological satiation, a feeling of inferiority overtook the Qais because of his impotence.Therefore, he was keen to suggest to himself, before suggesting to others, that his girlfriends are silk, and this is a claim denied by reality and rejected by Arab customs, their protection and fear for their women; So flirting with him became nothing more than a dream, and the research proved that the claim of sexual virility in Imru' al-Qays is nothing but a compensatory means and a psychological trick to hide the feeling of inferiority that controls him, because of his impotence, or at the very least his inability to communicate with women in a manner befitting his alleged heroism.I followed the artistic approach to studying the poet's poetry, and the psychological approach to its importance in illuminating the text.",

      "abstract": "… Do I have, not merely a self-interested feeling, but also a disinterested feeling of concern for others? Yes – the weal and woe of another touches us directly: the mere happiness of another pleases us in the telling: even that of fictional persons whose tale we know of, or in distant ages – this common concern is so great that it collides with the self-interested feeling. The sense of it is indeed a noble feeling, nobler than the self-interested one. Nobody despises it: everyone wishes for it, though not all have it in the same degree; in some it is great, and the greater it is, the more it is felt as a perfection. It is universal, though seldom so great that it inspires active exertions – in misers, for example, with whom self-interest has become very strong. As needy beings the creator gave us self-interest in our own perfection. As beings who have the power to be of service to our fellows, He gave us a disinterested concern for the perfection of others. The concern for others ranks high, since even the concern for self can be subordinated to it, but not vice versa. The more self-interested, the poorer (at least in thought), and hence the more to be despised. The disinterested feeling for the welfare, etc., of another has our own perfection, not as an end, but as a means.",

      "title": "Power Motivation in Sidonius Apollinaris, Eugippius, and Nonnus",
      "abstract": "Power can be thought of as the capacity to produce effects, consciously and unconsciously intended, on the behaviour and feelings of others. Power motivation arises when an individual experiences a need that can only be fulfilled by inducing appropriate behaviour in others. Ideals of service are an important means for taming or socializing power, rendering it more acceptable. This often means that a drive for power is marked by talk of duty and responsibility. The ranks of teachers, psychologists, clergymen, journalists, and urban planners contain above average numbers of people with a high power motivation. It can be hard to distinguish legitimate and necessary leadership from coercion and domination, for the latter may not be perceived as such by followers. People vary enormously in the degree to which they are prepared to challenge existing structures and norms to gain power, and they vary in their response to the attainment of power. The mere status of their position may be sufficient for some: power is not vigorously or selfishly exercised, nor is it conspicuously displayed. There may be present a fear of power, i.e., a fear of abusing it, which is defended against by maintaining that power is not one's own but a gift of grace to be used for the benefit of others. Charismatic or messianic leaders often make this claim. They are able to enhance the self-esteem of followers by providing a potent object of identification, and they lead by making their followers feel powerful rather than by commanding them. Identifying with any winner or hero, whether sporting, religious, or political, provides a vicarious experience of power. The need for power, therefore, is not only about a drive to influence others. Alcohol consumption induces a feeling of power. For those frustrated in their hopes of gaining real power, it offers a substitute, as do sex and violent behaviour. A drive for personalized power may be accompanied by high alcohol consumption, low inhibition of impulses, and, more so than socialized power, it has a present orientation, a moment-by-moment quality that has to be constantly reaffirmed. Gambling offers opportunities to impress and to win in the short run. A socialized power drive is characterized by low alcohol consumption and high inhibition, and may be advertized by dietary and sexual asceticism.",

      "title": "Inverse Psychological Projection",
      "abstract": "Potential competing interests: No potential competing interests to declare.Freud (1894) defined \"psychological projection\" as a defense mechanism in which one attributes negative aspects of their personality to others and is thus able to ignore their own flaws and problems.Its inverse form is defined as follows: when a person repeatedly (sometimes angrily) advises another person to ignore or pay no attention to either someone or something, it is usually because the person who advises this is experiencing inverse psychological projection; that is, if this person's needs have been disregarded in the past, their experience will be reflected in their reaction to the person they advise.However, such advice is relevant only when the type of hurt is a very specific case of banal mockery.If a mentally ill person tells somebody they are ugly, the best advice is to ignore them.However, if this person hurts someone in a way that has nothing to do with banal mockery of self-image (e.g., public humiliation, contempt, invasion of privacy, incitement, threatening behavior, discrimination, abuse, sexual or ordinary harassment, violence, annoyance) or if what was said had already hurt the other, then advising them to ignore or pay no attention to that mentally ill person disregards this damage.This defense mechanism can be activated in a person if they have been unable to cope with similar types of hurt in their own past and have been exposed to related mental damage, if their egoism is stimulated by the same matter, or if, due to this stimulation, it is either shameful for them to acknowledge their egoism because stimulated (or vulnerable) egoism is considered socially inferior or difficult for them to contain the other's hurt feelings or bruised egoism.Consequently, they deny the problem's existence and thus advise others to also ignore it due to their will to either stimulate (and unburden) their antagonism to others or to demonstrate their ability to rise above the same issue and \"win\" against it.Moreover, in contrast to classic psychological projection, in which a person attributes negative aspects of their own personality to others when they are unable to deal with these aspects (so they can ignore them), in its inverse form, a person attributes the quality that they would like to but cannot demonstrate/be able to succeed in (which relates to their ability to efficiently manage things or problems that stimulate their own egoism), so they can avoid dealing with these things or problems.In similar scenarios, inverse psychological projection may include saying things such as \"I don't care what you think (or say)/Who cares what people think (or say),\" \"Don't get excited by the background noise,\" I will not stoop to your level,\" \"Don't let them influence you,\" \"Don't give them the satisfaction,\" \"Don't give them a platform,\" \"They aren't worth it,\" or \"What do you expect from him?\" (one must distinguish between \"expected to\" and \"predicted to\" as these two possess different responsibilities).Alternatively, when discussing a television show, one may say, \"Who even watches it?\"and in",

      "abstract": "Human love can be either a passion of the sensible appetite or an act of the will. This second type of love, insofar as it is preceeded by a choice, is also called dilectio . This in turn may be of two types: love of possession (or of a thing), and love of communion (or of a person). By its very nature, the love of a thing is directed to the love of a person, and when this order is upset, certain aberrations make their appearance: either things are loved as if they were persons, or persons as if they were things, or finally persons are loved as persons but without wishing to do anything for them.\r\nThe three requirements for love are: good, likeness, and knowledge. The Good refers to the object of love, which is always some good, either a substance (person) or an adjective (thing). Likeness refers to the subject of love, and is either perfect (person) or imperfect (thing). Knowledge has to do with the relation subject-object, because nothing is loved if it is not first known.\r\nThe four principal effects of love are: union, mutual indwelling, extasis and zeal. Union, to a certain extent anterior to love, is also an effect of love, and the union is real to the extent to which it is possible: «two lovers wish to become one». The mutual indwelling is that by which the lover is in the loved one by knowledge and by desire and in the same way the loved one in the lover, so that each one can say: «I live, rather it is not I, but the other that lives in me». Extasis, or going outside oneself, is due to the fact that the lover is outside himself and lives in the loved one. And finally, zeal is a movement in defence of love, by which everything that threatens love is rejected.\r\nHuman love in the strict sense is the love between man and woman, and is a mixture of the love of a person and the love of a thing, because it refers not only to the souls but also to the bodies, and presupposes the characteristic of exclusiveness that is typical of the love of a thing. But it is also the love of a person and implies by its nature a constancy or endurance until death.",

      "abstract": "The word amae is generally used in the Japanese language with a variety of emotions depending on different interpersonal interactions. (1) When an adult identifies with an infant or a child and directs appropriate emotional availability, the affect of dependence and attachment that the adult recognizes in the child is called amae (the prototype of the word). (2) When an adult has little empathy with the dependency or attachment shown by the child, the adult negatively perceives that the child is \"amaeru-ing.\" Experiencing such discommunications, the child begins to test adults to see if they have empathy with him or her. In other words, he or she begins to formulate certain psychological functions linked with amae such as reading other people's expressions—hitomishiri (stranger anxiety) or enryo (hesitation or reserve). (3) When the child is good at actively manipulating the emotions of adults and creates such a state of affect as to satisfy his or her dependence or attachment, he or she is said to be an amaeru-ing child. (4) When the child, although he or she is actually dependent on or loved by adults, denies the fact and behaves innocently or defiantly, the child is said to be in a state of amae. The usage of the word amae described above can be observed in exactly the same manner in interactions between adults.",

For the hero himself it is constitutive of his self, so that it was very harmful to wrong it by undermining his reputation. The time allows one to evaluate and classify the men, giving them a precise place in the society, which must be determined both by superiority in birth, power or wealth and by the display of arete, Therefore a conflict is possible when there is only one geras for the King and for the best warrior",

It is important to clarify the concept of emotion that is to locate it among the concepts of the passions thus construed, and to describe the differences between emotions and other passions. This chapter describes the conceptual boundaries that distinguish the emotions from other affections, such as agitations and moods; from felt desires, such as urges and cravings; from obsessions and appetites; and also from attitudes. Emotions are classified as negative or positive, according as to whether one would (normally) prefer to feel such emotions (delighted, excited, overjoyed, contented, amused, affection), or prefer not to be subjected to them (feeling bored, envious, jealous, frightened, sorrow, embarrassed, humiliated).",

This is an incorrect understanding, because to accept is something less than to love. To accept another person means saying: be as you are!, whereas to love means treating another person in a way that that person might continuously develop and become ever more like Jesus, i.e. become the most beautiful version of itself. Love supports the development of the person loved, however, to mistake love for acceptance deprives one of the motivation to work on oneself. Experience teaches that the degree of development and maturity already attained suffices at the most for today, but not for tomorrow. The one who does not progress, is in danger of regression. One who loves, accepts the truth regarding the characteristics and behaviour of another person, supporting in it what is positive and encouraging it to overcome that which is immature in that person or which is immature in that person's relations with other people.",

Altruism does not require self‐sacrifice, although it generally has more moral worth when it does than when it does not. Altruism can bring about satisfaction in the agent. But such satisfaction is seldom the motive for engaging in beneficent action, and when it is, it is not a case of altruism at all. An altruist may fail to bring about benefit to the other, but built into altruism is a concern to discern the other's good, not merely to act on what one (perhaps mistakenly) takes to be her good. As humans, we have reason to care not only that other people's well‐being is enhanced, but also, about the motives for which people engage in actions that bring that result about, even though sometimes those motives are difficult to discern.",

Although it is commendable to try not to offend other people's sensitivities it is ajustifiable position to claim that people should accept the fact that, especially if their personal moral or cultural approach is far from liberal, their feelings will get offended by free expression. If desires are seen as something valuable to the holder and her identity, she should be free to voice them instead of nurturing them in secret. Any rational person understands that in a pluralist society, we do have desires that seem odd or even incomprehensible to others. Our aesthetic, hedonistic, social, religious, and other values are often contrary or even contradictory. A person who first and foremost desires to indulge in hedonistic pleasures is seen with dismay by his neighbor for whom physical pleasures denote abstinence and strongest possible self-discipline. Similarly an ardent churchgoer cannot really understand her neighbor for whom baseball seems to be the holiest of the holy. Pure and simple realism should show us that either only the tiniest societies can be culturally homogeneous or only an absolute tyranny reinforced by heavy sanctions will mold people into 80an obedient lot who do not cast a hungry eye to what is not to be desired. A reasonable demand in democratic and tolerant society is to accept the unavoidable existence of conflicting desires, opinions, and convictions.",

Usually, the ‘self’ in question is the individual person, but the concept has also been applied to corporate bodies held to possess a unitary identity. What constitutes the self’s ‘real nature’ is the key variable generating the many conceptions of self-realization. These can be grouped broadly into two types: (1) the ‘collectivist’, in which the self-realizing lifestyle, being either the same for all or specific to a person or subgroup of people, is ultimately definable only in the context, and perhaps with reference to the common purposes, of a collective social body; (2) the ‘individualist’, in which a person’s self-realization has no necessary connection with the ends of a particular community. As an ethic, self-realization can be proposed as the means to achieve a life identified as good by some criterion independent of the self-realizing process, or held to be that which actually defines the good. Its critics typically argue that human nature is such that any equation of ‘self-realization’ and ‘goodness’ is implausible or undesirable.",

The most classifying and best classified of these properties are, of course, those which are overtly designated to function as signs of distinction or marks of infamy, stigmata, especially the names and titles expressing class membership whose intersection defines social identity at any given time—the name of a nation, a region, an ethnic group, a family name, the name of an occupation, an educational qualification, honorific titles and so on. Those who classify themselves or others, by appropriating or classifying practices or properties that are classified and classifying, cannot be unaware that, through distinctive objects or practices in which their ‘powers’ are expressed and which, being appropriated by and appropriate to classes, classify those who appropriate them, they classify themselves in the eyes of other classifying (but also classifiable) subjects, endowed with classificatory schemes analogous to those which enable them more or less adequately to anticipate their own classification.",

      "abstract": "The word empathy has been used as a label for many different phenomena, including feeling what another person is feeling, understanding another person’s point of view, and imagining oneself in another person’s situation. Perhaps the most widely researched phenomenon called “empathy” involves an other-oriented emotional state that is congruent with the perceived welfare of another person. Feelings associated with empathy include sympathy, tenderness, and warmth toward the other person. Other manifestations of empathic emotions have been investigated, too, including empathic joy, empathic embarrassment, and empathic anger. As was the case with empathy, the term altruism has also been used as a label for a broad range of phenomena, including any type of prosocial behavior, as a collection of personality traits associated with helpful persons, and biological influences that evoke protective behaviors toward genetically related others. A particularly fruitful research tradition has focused on altruism as a motivational state with the ultimate goal of protecting or promoting the welfare of a valued other. For example, the empathy–altruism hypothesis claims that empathy (viewed here as an other-oriented emotional state) evokes an altruistic motivational state. Empathy and altruism, regardless of how they are construed, have important consequences for understanding human behavior and social relationships.",

      "abstract": "People sometimes suffer psychological trauma because they have been wronged. A victim of wrongdoing may be angry, afraid, hurt and resentful; as a result, the victim may feel violated. Perceived wrongs may also make a victim feel violated. One issue that victims often have difficulty in coming to terms with is why they were wronged. The question has to do with making sense of – that is, finding out the reason for – what happened to them. Those who already have low self-esteem (that is, a misplaced or diminished sense of self-regard, self-confidence and self-respect and an inaccurate perception of themselves as rational and relational human beings) may find it particularly difficult to forgive (Novitz 1998: 311–13) – or may ‘forgive’ all too easily out of a lack of self-respect. With some types of wrongdoing, the victim may feel that the wrongdoer is implicitly communicating that the victim is worthless, a ‘thing’ (not a person) to be abused at will. Being wronged can be a psychologically destructive experience for a person, and can have harmful effects on the lives of others and even on communities.",

It is a matter of experience that the sense of understanding other people's actions draws continually on familiar and subjective elements by which we attribute to others states of mind, desire, motive and purpose that we can recognise in ourselves, or feel we could. They help to make these other people's actions intelligible. We impute understanding of the purpose or feelings of the actors to them. It is often implicit and intrinsic in the verbs or words we use to describe human behaviour (e.g. ‘announce’, ‘give’, ‘feed’, ‘welcome’, ‘answer’, ‘punish’). This is generally so in the description of human behaviour, whatever the writer and his purpose – novelist, historian, anthropologist, journalist, psychologist or philosopher. Description and interpretation of human behaviour are often bound together. Wholly objective descriptions of human behaviour (and ‘pure’ descriptions of social actions a fortiori) are very hard to provide. We do not register human behaviour in a simple objective fashion but we continually seek to recognise and translate it as we perceive it into terms of understanding if we can. We do this without thinking in everyday life; many words we use to think or speak about human behaviour imply such understanding willy-nilly. But it is also a matter of everyday experience that we sometimes find other people's actions hard to understand. The effort of attempting to and failing makes by contrast the interpretative element, which is usually present but implicit, more explicit.",

On the one hand, to feel ashamed is to feel badly about oneself ; but on the other hand, it also seems to be a response to the way the subject is perceived by other people. So whose standards is the subject worried about falling short of, his own or those of an audience? I begin by arguing that it is the audience's standards that matter, and then present a theory of shame according to which shame is a response to the subject's perception that he is not thought of in the way he intrinsically values himself for being thought of by someone else. Then I go on to suggest some refinements to this basic view. First, the subject of shame is primarily concerned about his audience's attitudes toward him, not what they believe about him. And second, there may be one particular attitude which he values himself for inspiring. There is no very perspicuous term for this attitude, so I call it ‘proto‐respect’ – the attitude a social animal directs toward those it regards as valuable allies or bad enemies.",

To escape the social reality of possessive individualism, especially the conception of consequences, ends, habits, routine, the schizophrenic individual ‘withdraws’ or regresses into a psychic universe that contains a dimension unrelated to the consciousness and values of externality: the pursuit of wealth and things, the calculated regard of the other as an instrument for enriching the self. The schizophrenic is incapable of adapting his ‘ego’ to the necessities of the social environment; he cannot defend himself in ‘conventional’ or ‘normal’ ways from the demands of living in a social milieu where the expectations and judgments of others impose intolerable pressures on consciousness. Instead the individual undergoing the painful process of withdrawal constructs a set of psychic defenses that from the standpoint of the external world appear to be ‘strange’, ‘odd’, ‘bizarre’, or ‘demented’. The ‘mode of Being’ of the schizophrenic has nothing in common with the life‐style of the acquisitive, status‐conscious society. Some consideration is given to the political implications and meaning of the schizophrenic's withdrawal.",

In such a case Ronald Reagan is the intentional object of Robert's belief, and the existence of the state of affairs that Ronald Reagan is president is the condition of satisfaction of his belief.

      "abstract": "Whether at a coffee shop, in a waiting room, or riding the bus, people frequently observe the other people around them. Yet they often fail to realize how much other people engage in the same behavior, and that they, therefore, also are being observed. Because it is logically impossible that people, on average, are the subjects of observation more than they are objects of it, the belief that one watches others more than one is watched is an illusion. Several studies show that people incorrectly believe that they observe others more than other people observe them. We call this mistaken belief the \"invisibility cloak illusion.\" People believe that they observe others more than do other people and that they are generally observed less than are others (Studies 1-3, 5, 6). The illusion persists both among strangers in the same vicinity (Study 2) and among friends interacting with one another (Study 3), and it cannot be explained away as yet another general better-than-average bias nor is it the result of believing one has more thoughts, in general, than do other people (Studies 2-3). The illusion is supported by a failure to catch others watching oneself (Studies 1b, 4) and it is manifest in the specific contents of people's thoughts about one another (Studies 5 and 6). Finally, rendering a feature of one's appearance salient to oneself fails to interrupt the illusion despite increasing one's belief that others are paying more attention specifically to that salient feature (Study 6).

      "abstract": "Normative ethical theories today place enormous stress upon autonomy or agency and treat it as of the utmost significance to the value of human life. Some theorists understand agency as referring to personhood or to moral personality; some take it to involve such things as rationality and action upon reasons, self-awareness, self-critical control of one's desires, the application of norms to conduct, and deliberative choice. Some take it to be about making one's own decisions (in the important affairs of life) and directing one's life or about constructing a life of value for oneself or about adopting and living out a life plan or rational plan of action. On all these views, the effect is to set up agents or autonomous beings as a special or privileged class, against which the lives of nonautonomous beings – such as infants, young children, the irreversibly comatose or those in a permanently vegetative state, those suffering from senile dementia, the severely mentally enfeebled, some of the brain damaged, and animals – are assessed and valued. So privileged is this class that all kinds of notions are invented or assumed – such things as impaired autonomy, potential autonomy, interrupted capacity, unrealized capacity, trusteeship, and proxy agency come to mind – by which to try to squeeze as many beings as possible into it. The fear, obviously, is that, if some human being falls outside the privileged class, the protections that normally extend to one morally may possibly be in doubt.",

But, if a person has no sense of personal value, inner stability, or lasting internal identity, they desperately search for the elements in others. For the pre-psychotic or on the edge of psychosis patients, the motive seems to be one of controlling the analyst and discarding unwanted poisonous parts of self or object. The anxiety state is part of an internal collapse that is perpetuated by violent projective identification dynamics of demand and disappointment. If the patient is to mature and mourn the loss of control and love he demands in phantasy and projection, he must become his own container of acceptance and knowledge. Robert Waska has noted how primitive phantasies of dread, desire, loss, and demand within pathological cycles of projective identification leave some patients trapped in a very primitive and persecutory internal world of dead objects, broken promises, and unbearable loss.",

Law's emphasis is on generality and the sameness of people; for justice demands that rights and obligations be applied equally, often irrespective of particular circumstances.

Definitions of spirituality are elusive as are concepts of mind, meaning, and personhood—not least in the case of people with dementia.Spirituality is often described both as being about the intangible and immaterial aspects of life as well as being closely associated with a sense of meaning and purpose. It is particular to each person and yet, by virtue of its essential nature to all human beings, is shared with others. Some would say that spirituality is intuitive or even innate and, therefore, not easily susceptible to rational explication. Whilst it is sometimes described as being distinct from religion, arguably spirituality is essential to religion. One definition claims, people of all ages share basic human needs that include love (the giving and receiving of affection), faith (someone or something to believe in), hope (something to look forward to), peace (finding a measure of stability and tranquillity) and worship (a sense of awe and the attribution of value or ‘worth’ to whomever or whatever is deemed to merit it). (Jewell 1999, p. 10)Some of the circumstances of older age give a particular focus to these needs and values. Other definitions emphasize connectivity. Spirituality is an intra, inter and transpersonal experience that is shaped and directed by the experiences of individuals and the communities within which they live out their lives. (Swinton 2001, p. 20)Spirituality could be described as that which is essential to our humanity, embraces the desire for meaning and purpose, and has personal, social, and transcendent dimensions. The word ‘spirit’ comes from the Latin for breath and its equivalent in Hebrew and Greek, amongst other languages, similarly denotes that which is fundamental to life. To talk of spirituality, then, is to attempt to put into words things intimate and immanent as well as things other and transcendent.Spending time with people with dementia and their carers inevitably poses some basic questions about ourselves. Who am I and what is to become of me? What is the meaning and purpose of our lives? Such are the existential questions and dilemmas with which we are faced and which are often seen as funda mental to recent spiritual discourse. Historically, this discourse has taken place within the frameworks of faith traditions, where faith is both the means and the end of the spiritual quest. Clearly history bears witness to how religious faith, as the politics of spirituality, has not lived up to the ideals it has promulgated; fundamental concepts have been lost or diluted in practice. In a secular and post-modern environment, such history is often used as reason to cease taking underlying concepts seriously. Furthermore, post-Enlightenment philosophies have often rejected the premises of religious thought. That beliefs about who we are and what is to become of us can no longer be responded to in religious terms with any reasonable legitimacy or integrity is a notion we wish to challenge.The apparent renewal of interest in spirituality can be seen as indicative of a positive regard for the identity and personhood of people with dementia. We suggest it also reflects a sense of something essential that is missing from current theory and practice, which goes beyond specific considerations about people with dementia. Without understating the effects of dementia on either those diagnosed or their carers, it appears that people with dementia are showing us something of ultimate concern about the nature of personhood and creation. This is, perhaps, reflected in part by the recent focus on the personhood of people with dementia (Kitwood 1997).The way in which terms such as ‘individual’ and ‘person’ have been employed in both philosophical and religious thought over the centuries is being explored today, perhaps not so much to discover what has hitherto remained mysterious or unknown, but more in an attempt to recover that which has been lost in modern and post-modern thought, or indeed not developed adequately to sustain its case in the contemporary world of ideas.",

      "abstract": "Contempt is the feeling when one judges another person as an inferior human being, and is typically expressed through social exclusion. Feeling contempt thus implies rejecting others, considering others as unworthy of one’s attention. Contempt is often mixed with other emotions, such as anger, hatred, or socio-moral disgust. Often therefore, the expression of contempt can coincide with feelings of revenge or even attempts to attack the other person. I think contempt is a moral emotion, in that it is often elicited in response to transgressions that are considered as amoral. These include behaviors such as betrayal, theft, (sexual) violence, which go against our moral standards and therefore deserve only contempt. These types of transgressions are too awful to criticize, and therefore can only lead to rejection or exclusion. Although we may feel contempt towards people we hardly know, contempt often develops out of anger, especially when we have been confronted with others or other groups who have not changed their behavior in reaction to our anger. Anger therefore does not seem functional, and contempt emerges as a way of coping with the lack of influence or control we have over the other.",

      "abstract": "Abstract An asymmetry effect is known to exist in the estimation of interpersonal distance, depending on whether the point of reference for the estimation is the subject (‘How far are the others from you?’) or the others How far are you from the others?). It looks as though, through the effect of a self‐centring schema, subjects feel that others occupy their own space more than they occupy the space of others. A self‐centring schema has also been found in many other processes involving judgment or comparison of oneself and others. It is generally interpreted as a sign of the affirmation and defence of personal identity. The three experiments reported here attempt to relate the asymmetries in the distances perceived between persons represented on a map to the following three areas in which one's sense of personal or group identity is involved: (1) in the perception of one's own specificity with respect to others (or of the specificity of the group to which one belongs with respect to other groups) (experiment 1), (2) in one's ability to put oneself in the place of others (exocentrism) (experiment 2). and (3) in the individuation of oneself by others (experiment 3). The results of these three experiments lead us to believe that it is indeed the processes of identification and affirmation of personal and group identity ‐ along with the underlying categorization processes — that are the source of the asymmetries observed in interpersonal distance estimation. The consistency of the data obtained in different situations also validates the technique used for estimating interpersonal distance.",

      "title": "The Norse Concept of Luck",
      "abstract": "THE FICKLENESS OF LUCK is a standing motif in our culture. For many, is defined by unpredictability more than anything else. In Norse culture, the case is quite the opposite in that had nothing to do with what we would refer to as coincidence or chance. On the contrary, was a quality inherent in the and his lineage, a part of his personality similar to his strength, intelligence, or skill with weapons, at once both the cause and the expression of the success, wealth, and power of a family. Luck expressed itself partially in skills, beauty, and other desirable characteristics, but also in events shaping themselves according to the wishes of the lucky man. One might have in specified areas but not in others, such as fishingluck or weatherluck for example. But the so-called man of was the who possessed generally, not just in one specific area. People possessed in different measure and one was helpless against an opponent who had greater luck. Kings especially were great men of to the degree that they were able to send forth their to assist others. Luck was not a thing to be sought or found by coincidence; one had the that one was accorded by fate. Yet, in certain cases could be diminished or lost, a phenomenon on which I shall elaborate later. As to the more specific details of how the notion of was perceived, not much is known, and scholarship on the topic has been relatively limited. I find that the view of as part of a man's inherent nature sets the Norse concept of uniquely apart from a more modern conception, and it is this aspect of that I will investigate in this article. More specifically, I shall attempt to elucidate an aspect of that has only been touched upon by a few scholars and not for many decades: the view of Norse society on and the lack of it. I find that the concept of has certain implications for society's view of the luck-man and his counterpart, the luckless man. If is one of a man's personal qualities, it may possibly affect the judgment of his character. Luck may be considered not as a morally neutral factor as in modern Western society, but a requisite part of an ideal personality. Certain Norse texts seem to imply a degree of moral condemnation of the luckless man, and it is this aspect of luck--society's view of the lucky and unlucky man--that I will investigate. Was an essential and required part of the personality of the ideal or heroic male? Was the luckless correspondingly considered morally impaired? Was there an element of condemnation attached to lucklessness? The conception designated in modern English by the word luck is highly complex. This fact is reflected in the Norse terminology used to describe the various ideas of luck. The main terms are as follows: gipta, gofa, heill, fylgja, and hamingja. The words audna, sola, and hugr are also used in connection with but are less important to the central questions of this article. The meaning of these terms ranges from the abstract luck-quality, inherent in a man, which he may send forth for the assistance of someone else to a goddess of a certain family; a diversity that witnesses the complexity of the concept of luck. RESEARCH HISTORY The various terms for figure so frequently and widely in Norse literature--predominantly in sagas--that there is no reason to doubt that played an important role in the culture. The question is whether we may consider our sources, which are texts written in a Christian age, to be reliable sources of pre-Christian Norse thought and religion. In this case, one may conclude that the concept at least to some degree accurately reflects a pre-Christian mode of thought since large parts of its content and use clearly do not correspond to Christian ideas and thus cannot derive from them. Though the idea of guardian spirits might be borrowed from Christianity, the idea of as a force emanating from a person could hardly be. …",

      "abstract": "People are fundamentally social beings and enjoy connecting with others, sometimes reaching out to others—whether simply to say hello and to check in on how others are doing with a brief message, or to send a small gift to show that one is thinking of the other person. Yet despite the importance and enjoyment of social connection, do people accurately understand how much other people value being reached out to by someone in their social circle? Across a series of pre-registered experiments, we document a robust underestimation of how much other people appreciate being reached out to. We find evidence compatible with an account wherein one reason this underestimation of appreciation occurs is because responders (vs. initiators) are more focused on their feelings of surprise at being reached out to; such a focus on feelings of surprise in turn predicts greater appreciation. We further identify process-consistent moderators of the underestimation of reach-out appreciation, finding that it is magnified when the reach-out context is more surprising: when it occurs within a surprising (vs. unsurprising) context for the recipient and when it occurs between more socially distant (vs. socially close) others. Altogether, this research thus identifies when and why we underestimate how much other people appreciate us reaching out to them, implicating a heightened focus on feelings of surprise as one underlying explanation.",

      "title": "Prosocial primates: selfish and unselfish motivations",
      "abstract": "Non-human primates are marked by well-developed prosocial and cooperative tendencies as reflected in the way they support each other in fights, hunt together, share food and console victims of aggression. The proximate motivation behind such behaviour is not to be confused with the ultimate reasons for its evolution. Even if a behaviour is ultimately self-serving, the motivation behind it may be genuinely unselfish. A sharp distinction needs to be drawn, therefore, between (i) altruistic and cooperative behaviour with knowable benefits to the actor, which may lead actors aware of these benefits to seek them by acting cooperatively or altruistically and (ii) altruistic behaviour that offers the actor no knowable rewards. The latter is the case if return benefits occur too unpredictably, too distantly in time or are of an indirect nature, such as increased inclusive fitness. The second category of behaviour can be explained only by assuming an altruistic impulse, which—as in humans—may be born from empathy with the recipient's need, pain or distress. Empathy, a proximate mechanism for prosocial behaviour that makes one individual share another's emotional state, is biased the way one would predict from evolutionary theories of cooperation (i.e. by kinship, social closeness and reciprocation). There is increasing evidence in non-human primates (and other mammals) for this proximate mechanism as well as for the unselfish, spontaneous nature of the resulting prosocial tendencies. This paper further reviews observational and experimental evidence for the reciprocity mechanisms that underlie cooperation among non-relatives, for inequity aversion as a constraint on cooperation and on the way defection is dealt with.",

      "abstract": "Love Without the Obligation to Love1 Cindy Patton (bio) It’s frightening to feel so little attachment to a life that’s so full of the things other people long for—rightly long for, I think: a lot of intimacy, enough money, peace and privacy, intellectual stimulation, plenty of recognition, time for my own work, no violence, both parents living, mostly good health, a long, tender relationship with my fella, oodles of terrific friends. . . . It’s not that these things don’t seem miraculous. . . . I’ve the most acute sense that things not only could be infinitely worse, but actually are for most people. Though I can’t imagine why that’s supposed to be a cheering realization!2 [T]he naturalization of social arbitrariness causes it to be forgotten that, in order for this reality called “family” to be possible, certain social conditions that are in no way universal have to be fulfilled. . . . [T]he family in its legitimate definition is a privilege instituted into a universal norm: a de facto privilege that implies a symbolic privilege—the privilege of being comme il faut, conforming to the norm, and therefore enjoying a symbolic profit of normality. Those who have the privilege of having a “normal” family are able to demand the same of everyone without having to raise the question of the conditions (a certain income, living space, etc.) of universal access to what they demand universally.3 No reader—therapy fellow traveler, critic, homologously positioned academic or artist—can help but be moved by the eloquence with which Eve Sedgwick’s A Dialogue on Love conveys the gripping struggle with mortality, [End Page 215] not first in the face of her own cancer or others’ AIDS, but rather in the context of feeling out of place in the world. There is so much in the text and, yet, so few hints about how to be a worthy reader. In a classroom, one might be tempted to say, “What is Sedgwick saying?” But I remember a conversation with Eve in the late 1980s.4 I was grappling with how to write elegantly, recursively, but clearly in the then-popular deconstructionist High Style. I think I said, “I’m trying to communicate . . .” and she laughed in that high-pitched voice of hers, as delicate and tentative and unpredictable as a flat pebble skipping across the surface of a faintly rippled pond: “That’s the difference!” She described her writing process and explained that however much she shaped her prose through meticulous editing, it was the reader who would bend her works to their place and their meanings. Writing is poesis, not communication. From its title to its ending, through graphic design and shifts in voice and address, A Dialogue on Love is Sedgwick’s own high-water mark in this understanding of writing, blurring the line between forms of self-assertion and forms of listening, forms of intending meaning, and forms of not being heard. “Eve” plays hide and seek with the reader, offering various angles on her body and feelings, and then veiling these with (her therapist) Shannon’s words, perpetually grafting fragments of her poems onto fragments of therapy notes, sometimes Shannon’s official record, sometimes her therapy journals, in one moment her once estranged sister’s childhood diary accounts of Eve, in other places e-mail exchanges with friend Tim—any of which might be Kathy Acker–like plagiarism or faked autobiography.5 Although Eve did a great deal to make me smarter, I turned out to think like a busted-up social scientist, the bastard issue of qualitative empiricism and rhetorical deconstruction, a lost wild child from the literary turn in the social sciences (now passed, I note with regret). I therefore leave it to the literary critics to say how A Dialogue on Love works as a text and instead I open this particular iteration of Sedgwick’s corpus to a sociohistorical, or historicosocial, reading. I do not ignore her aesthetic devices, but recognize them as necessities for marking a place so personal and specific as sometimes not to communicate, as the techniques of a gifted mind that sprung from a quirky but quite...",

      "title": "PHILOSOPHY, ADVERTISING MYTHS AND MANAGEMENT",
      "abstract": "Being concerned with current matters, ordinary man is used to have a regular approach on life, by means of efficiency oriented skills. Carried out by worries and hopes, he does not allow himself to breed the taste for speculation. Usually, his horizon of questions regarding man and life is often mistaken for the sphere of immediate needs – in what concerns its level, contents and solutions. Raising questions – when it happens and inasmuch as it happens – appears attached to unusual events (either good or bad) and, most of the time, just inasmuch as these require a certain effort in order to be integrated into what is called habits. Ordinary judgement is in terms of action and utility. The meaning of life is neither obsession, nor a release of passion, since physical and soul energies are oriented towards goals that do not allow somebody to appeal to reflection. Playing with abstract arguments is frightening, distracts from those acts that are experienced as obligations, and this is why it will be avoided, as much as possible. Self preservation instinct works well enough. Man has the taste for relativity; daily activities witness for the weaknesses of humanity and the powers of hazard, shaping his wisdom; life is intuitively taken as a value, and it is worth living even if there are no strong meanings; thus, life is above all ideas describing it. Daily life receives a immediate link between theory and practice, between knowledge and action; we live under the impulse of satisfying needs; this is why choosing goals and means cannot be endlessly suspended in order to make room for deliberative reflection; one makes appeal to already given knowledge and value instruments that have a certified efficiency. This is why daily subjective life oscillates between decisions founded on momentary, passing and inconsistent reasons and decisions determined by rigid grounds, although they seldom conceptually clarified (tradition, habits). Ordinary consciousness behaves like a receptacle: the knowledge of reality – taken as a mirroring of reality by thought and senses – remains at the stage of noticing and uncritical description of some empiric correlations, of factual observations, of some modes of external phenomenal manifestation. Realism that is based on the “logic of senses” combines with the concern for normative aspect of life and action. “Common sense – says Lucian Blaga – is due to some ideas acquired by human spirit in time, by means of living together with the others.

      "title": "FALSE RECOGNITION OF UNFAMILIAR PEOPLE: \"SEEING FILM STARS EVERYWHERE\"",
      "abstract": "Abstract A patient (MR) is reported who is able to correctly recognise famous people as being familiar but has a strong tendency to falsely recognise unfamiliar people as being familiar. False recognition does not depend on the type of person involved (contemporary, historical, fictional) or the modality in which it is presented (face, spoken/written name). False recognition does not extend to vocabulary knowledge, to other proper name categories (e.g. places) or to news events. Several hypotheses are considered but discounted. False recognition does not reflect reliance on familiarity associated with parts of the stimuli as opposed to the whole. False recognition, instead, depends critically on the nature of the referent (i.e. whether it refers to a person or not) and not on the nature of the stimulus material. Thus, MR will not produce false recognition when asked to search for names that refer to song or book titles even when, in all other respects, the stimuli resemble the names of people (e.g. Eleanor Rigby, David Copperfield). It is suggested that this disorder stems from a top-down failure to regulate the person recognition system, such that inappropriate information is retrieved. The category specificity may reflect inappropriate use of meta-memory knowledge concerning the rate of potential new exemplars from the category of \"people\" relative to other categories.",

      "abstract": "The people in this situation were faced with an option to help someone in distress, and they did not choose to offer aid. This is a dramatic example of a situation that people face every day. An encounter with a beggar on the street, a request to give blood, or a call from a friend who is lonely or depressed—each is a situation in which someone can do something to benefit someone else. Such activity may be termed positive social action. Such acts as donating money or goods to charity, cooperating with others in carrying out a project, and doing favors for a person in need are typical examples of positive social action. Behavior of this kind may be contrasted with antisocial action, such behavior as aggression, destruction, and selfishness. Some theorists use the term prosocial behavior to stress the contrast with antisocial behavior. Other theorists prefer to use the term altruism, to emphasize the element of selflessness that exists in many helping situations. Altruism is action that benefits other people and is carried out with no expectation of external reward. Whatever words are used and with whatever emphasis, however, such action is worth investigating because it is deemed morally admirable and also contributes to the survival of society (Poplawski, 1985). Most people admire the individual who makes sacrifices so that others may benefit, and probably everyone agrees that society would be better off if everyone were less self-centered.",

Someone is self-interested in a broader sense if she regards her aims and aspirations, whether selfish or not, as “worthy of recognition” and “deserving satisfaction” (TJ 110). More specifically, Rawls proposes that the interests of a self, which are not necessarily interests in oneself, are not merely determined by her tastes and preferences or her pains and pleasures. Her interests are instead determined by her conception of the good, which is the consistent and coherent plan of life she would choose under favorable conditions, with full information after careful reflection (TJ 358).",

      "abstract": "Human beings are unique in their ability to think consciously about themselves. Because they have a capacity for self-awareness not shared by other animals, people can imagine themselves in the future, anticipate consequences, plan ahead, improve themselves, and perform many other behaviors that are uniquely characteristic of human beings. Yet, despite the obvious advantages of self-reflection, the capacity for self-thought comes at a high price as people's lives are adversely affected and their inner chatter interferes with their success, pollutes their relationships, and undermines their happiness. Indeed, self-relevant thought is responsible for most of the personal and social difficulties that human beings face as individuals and as a species. Among other things, the capacity for self-reflection distorts people's perceptions, leading them to make bad decisions based on faulty information. The self conjures up a great deal of personal suffering in the form of depression, anxiety, anger, envy, and other negative emotions by allowing people to ruminate about the past or imagine the future. Egocentrism and egotism blind people to their own shortcomings, promote self-serving biases, and undermine their relationships with others. The ability to self-reflect also underlies social conflict by leading people to separate themselves into ingroups and outgroups. Ironically, many sources of personal unhappiness — such as addictions, overeating, unsafe sex, infidelity, and domestic violence — are due to people's inability to exert self-control. For those inclined toward religion and spirituality, visionaries throughout history have proclaimed that the egoic self stymies the quest for spiritual fulfillment and leads to immoral behavior.",

Most robust assumed similarity effects are, however, apparent for characteristics that are closely linked to values.

That we often derive sorrow from the sorrow of others, is a matter of fact too obvious to require any instances to prove it; for this sentiment, like all the other original passions of human nature, is by no means confined to the virtuous and humane, though they perhaps may feel it with the most exquisite sensibility.

      "abstract": "Aggression in the sense of a grasping interest belongs to man so intimately that he wouldn't have reached these performances, these accomplishments and this power he has reached today on the vivid and unvivid nature. If the individual would not interest himself \"aggressively\" for the human beings surrounding himself, if he would not be \"hungry\" for human contact he would not associate himself for pairing and groups. He would not look for individuals who are of the same mind. This existential hunger, which is laid down in his nervous system seeking for stimuli, contains always an \"aggressive\" interest and leads man also towards searching scientifically his own psychosomatic conditions and the whole world. But this hunger can lead in certain men and under favouring conditions in whole groups and peoples to dimensions which endanger individuality and the human pride. This aggression then does not any longer serve communication but further incorporation and power. It is the beginning of the way leading to destruction of human values and human life. The responsibilities of our society should keep in mind that the human readiness for aggression does not drive further in the direction of violence and should rather be developed in the sense originally inherent to her: of an interest in the surrounding human beings and in nature.",

      "title": "Self-Transcendence",
      "abstract": "Abstract Self-transcendence is the process by which a person becomes aware of their participation in something greater than their individual self. The conscious realization of participation in something beyond yourself, such as union with nature, humanity, or God, evokes positive emotions, particularly joy and awe, which are often combined with attitudes of humility and reverence. The cultivation of self-transcendence provides a coherent perspective on living that promotes physical, mental, and spiritual well-being. If we accept that virtue involves respect for the dignity of others and not just one’s individual self, then the cultivation of self-transcendence is essential to all aspects of virtue. In this chapter, we provide several lines of empirical evidence about human nature, ecological systems, well-being, and virtue that provide a solid foundation to guide clinical practice in promoting health. Prospective studies indicate that the cultivation of self-transcendence and well-being involves the dynamic interplay of three processes: the awakening of plasticity (i.e., being able and willing to change); virtue (i.e., having intuitive insight into what is good for a person’s self and others); and creative functioning (i.e., being innovative, purposeful and responsible so that our habits are congruent with our goals and values). The cultivation of self-transcendence by these three processes describes the essential features of the path to a life that is healthy, happy, and good. We describe evidence-based practices that are effective in motivating people to create opportunities for their own well-being and that of others by cultivating self-transcendence.",

But a truly meaningful life, one whose meaning (direction) is determined in regards to man's true end -- which is the knowledge and love of the greatest good -- does indeed require a host of virtues belonging to fortitude. The virtue of temperance is thus not enough for emotional well-being, since temperance deals with the greatest pleasures, not the greatest difficulties. Rather, it belongs to fortitude to remove the obstacles that withdraw the will from following reason on account of difficulties that give rise to fear and/or daring.",

      "abstract": "Abstract An agent will count as a person, by traditional theories, to the extent that they can reason, are fit to be held responsible, enjoy claims of dignity, and can live up to certain ideals distinctive of personhood. The humanoids will meet those connotations of personhood insofar as they make commitments to one another on an open front, projecting a persona that they effectively invite others—and, interiorizing, invite themselves—to rely on: ‘this is who I am’. In order to ‘personate’ in that sense, they must be able to reason, to ascribe and assume responsibility, to be able to claim rights against one another, and to live up to the ideals of the persona they project. The person or personating agent will enjoy an important form of self-identity over time, even as they change and recognize that they change in their public profile. Not only will they be intertemporally connected in the sense that their states at any time—say, of memory or intention—reflect their states at others: say, of experience or performance. They will also be generally connected by sustaining a commitment to a certain stable or evolving persona. In this richer construal of what they are as a self, it will make sense for them to embrace an ideal of knowing themselves and being true to their self.",

      "abstract": "People are fundamentally social beings and enjoy connecting with others. Sometimes, people reach out to others-whether simply to check-in on how others are doing with brief messages or to show that they are thinking of others by sending small gifts to them. Yet, despite the importance and enjoyment of social connection, do people accurately understand how much other people value being reached out to by someone in their social circle? Across a series of preregistered experiments, we document a robust underestimation of how much other people appreciate being reached out to. We find evidence compatible with an account wherein one reason this underestimation of appreciation occurs is because responders (vs. initiators) are more focused on their feelings of surprise at being reached out to. A focus on feelings of surprise in turn predicts greater appreciation. We further identify process-consistent moderators of the underestimation of reach-out appreciation, finding that it is magnified when the reach-out context is more surprising: when it occurs within a surprising (vs. unsurprising) context for the recipient and when it occurs between more socially distant (vs. socially close) others. Altogether, this research thus identifies when and why we underestimate how much other people appreciate us reaching out to them, implicating a heightened focus on feelings of surprise as one underlying explanation.

It may be understood as a precondition of human cooperation and a distinct policy available in specific circumstances. Trust may be inspired by the speaker or the speech, by character or action; as a feature of public institutions whose rules are open to alteration, trust may be construed as an artifact, a device that human beings can control and adjust to changing needs and demands. Trust may be a conditional value, justifying praise only on specific occasions, or it may express an unqualified trustworthiness signifying fidelity or mutual faithfulness. Love, an exclusive loyalty or affection, may make trust blind; equally, trust can attract trust in return. Hobbes takes an uncompromising view of these ambiguities and equivocations. To the man who thinks himself confident of the trustworthiness of others, he asks “what opinion he has of his fellow-subjects, when he rides armed; of his fellow citizens, when he locks his doors; and of his children, and servants, when he locks his chests. Does he not there as much accuse mankind by his actions, as I do by my words?”",

      "title": "Analysis of the Different Types of Altruistic Behavior and Its Reason",
      "abstract": "There are some dimensionalities of altruistic behavior: Purity, whether the motivation is pure altruism or self-regard; Degree, whether the help is of his all or not; Extent, whether he supplies help for all men or not; Frequency, whether he does often or not. From the point of purity, there are two types of altruistic behavior, one is soft altruism, whose genuine motivation is wishing to get the benefaction for the future from the one who had received help from himself ago, and it results in building a mutual-benefit system of cognation or non-cognation between men. The other is hard altruism, that’s to say, people gain satisfaction not from the someone’s benefaction who was once received help from himself but from the altruistic behavior itself. From the point of degree, hard altruistic behavior can also be separated into two types: limited (moderate) hard altruistic behavior and infinite (thorough) hard altruistic behavior. The former obey the rule of descending marginal utility, therefore, from the point of evolvement, it can’t decrease does’ existent adaptability. The latter does not obey the rule of descending marginal utility but increasing one, then the condition of maximum utility lies on putting all his scarce resource to altruistic behavior. So it will descend individual adaptability, even victimize individual survival, and it results the Darwin-Jam. How can it come into being, come through and evolve by the process of natural selection? Altruistic behavior is often considered to have relationship with sympathy and moral culture. Father, someone’s sympathy and moral culture often point to special kind of human not to all. So from the broad sense sympathy and moral action have relation with self-identity. From the point of extent, the man who gives the benefaction generally thinks that the man who receives his benefaction is of the same category. Why do men have the self-identity based on the sympathy and moral culture? From the point of individual, may be it has relation with gene. As infest animal, if he doesn`t have any self-identity and will not do any victimization for anyone, it has much difficulty to inherit his gene probably in the process of evolvement, because no one will become his consort. In the other extreme, if he has self-identity too extensive and too strong and helps everyone of his all, the rate of survival must be very low and it also has difficulty to inherit his gene probably. Most of the people have certain scope of self-identity, and the extent of altruistic behavior depends on the scope and object of self-identity, which often has the most strong core and then descends as scope broadening step by step. The degree of altruistic behavior lies on the degree that the one received benefaction is identified by the one gives the benefaction, and they have positive relation. The descending sequence of different people’s self-identity from strong to weak is often different, many people put relative and friends in a more important position, then neighbor, estate, class, nation, country, race and so on.Considered from the point of extent, the most frequently altruistic behavior is to relative first, then to special beneficial non-relative, and last to universal men.Considered from the point of degree, the most frequent relative altruistic behavior is infinite hard altruistic behavior, then to special beneficially non-relative, and last to universal men. The scope and object of self-identity, the descending sequence of self-identity and the degree that he will do for the object he approbated have relation with the culture and tradition of his living environment, that`s to say, it has relation with family education that he received from childhood, school education, social living record of himself. From the point of society, what needs answer is why it can form such culture and tradition, family education and school education, which enable some one to come into being self-identity, sympathy and moral culture. And in the living culture of every nation, there is praise for non-relative altruistic behavior, which will cause the altruistic behavior of someone with self-identity, and the different scope and degree has relation with his different living record. The culture and tradition of such praise for non-relative altruistic behavior can explain individual hard altruistic behavior, especially infinite hard altruistic behavior; while competition and conflict between different nations can explain the form of such culture and tradition. So we need explain one’s non-relative hard altruistic behavior, especially infinite hard altruistic behavior from two lays: gene and culture. Gene lay determines that most of the people have certain self-identity and form the physiological basis of altruistic behavior, while the scope and object, descending sequence of self-identity and the degree of willing victimize for the people of the same category is determined by culture and tradition. The competition between individual and colony makes someone who mixes self-regard and altruism pro rate and his colony have more adaptability in multiple competition.",

      "abstract": "Two types of emotions can be distinguished: the affections (stable patterns of malevolence or benevolence toward particular others) and the passions (action-dependent responses to friendly/unfriendly acts). Either type may serve to induce cooperation from a self-interested party, subject to several limitations. Shakespeare's King Lear is examined as an instance where benevolence fails to elicit cooperation. To meet the necessary condition for evolutionary survival in competition with rational self-interested players, the emotional party must benefit not only in “feel good” utility terms but in actual material payoff. SILVER RULE, as an instance of reactive passionate behavior related to the familiar TIT FOR TAT behavior, is shown to lose out in evolutionary competition against RATIONAL play unless the SILVER RULE player has a sufficiently high probability of being able to detect when his opponent is a selfish RATIONAL player.",

It only means that, although he is at the centre of the play, neither his consciousness nor his experience comprehends all of its meaning; and further, that we cannot identify with him, or see him in a special, privileged way, or respond to him or his speeches with a different kind of sympathetic understanding and critical detachment from that with which we respond to anyone else. In fact, he is the hero for the same reasons as require us to acknowledge the reality, force, and limitations of the other characters in so far as they exist for us (in their varying degrees of density) as characters at all. His ‘heroism’ requires their specific selves as its very condition. The terms on which they enter into the action as characters are those examined most profoundly and thoroughly in Lear – in what is at issue in his self and his experience, in his particular ‘address’ or ‘stance’ towards his world, and what his transactions with it reveal about the world that he, and his world, and the other characters' transactions, constitute for us. Each of the other characters, being composed by the same creative activity out of the same material as he, though in a way that testifies to his larger stature and vitality, unfolds a kind of commentary on him – as he on them.",

      "abstract": "the history of man's struggle against death and deprivation. A man must live before he can act, either for himself or to help others. Therefore, 'unless each duly cares for himself, his care for others is ended by death; and if each thus dies, there remain no others to be cared for.'1 To the extent that a man is rational he will first address himself to his own survival and only then attempt to satisfy his less immediate needs, an attempt that usually exhausts his time and energy without providing as great a return as he would like. Even if he is fortunate and his resources are not exhausted, he may decide to save them to put things away for 'a rainy day.' In the former situation there is nothing to distribute to those in need; in the latter, kindliness ('helpfulness towards someone in need, not in return for anything, nor for the advantage of the helper himself2) does not seem to be consistent with a man's long-range self-interest. In either case, kindliness is not perceived as rational. To sum up : since kindliness is not rational in the face of death, and seldom rational when death is not imminent, it appears to follow that kindliness is generally not a rational act. At least four classic ethical traditions, Judaism, Christianity, Kantianism, and Utilitarianism (especially Mill's theory), reject this argument. Each maintains that there is a duty to help others and that this duty, the duty of beneficence, when properly understood is not irrational.",

      "title": "Xenophobia",
      "abstract": "Abstract Xenophobia is a concept that has not received a great deal of attention in the psychological literature. According to the Oxford English Dictionary , the word consists of two parts: xeno (referring to “guest, stranger, person that looks different, foreigner”) and phobia (“fear, horror or aversion”). Although there has been little research or writing focusing directly on xenophobia, as a concept it raises three important issues that are relevant for research on prejudice and which have received a good deal of attention in the literature. First, prejudice does not necessarily involve negative attitudes towards others (e.g., they are dirty or untrustworthy). Simply perceiving a person as foreign, alien, or strange is sufficient to produce aversion or a preference for reduced contact. Second, xenophobia highlights the fact that prejudice against others involves both cognitive and emotional elements: It involves not only viewing other groups as different along some socially important dimension, but also having an aversive emotional reaction towards that difference. Third, prejudice is often studied within the context of intergroup relations or as attitudes held towards specific social groups; however, prejudice can also involve an aversion to difference per se . Xenophobia highlights the fact that sometimes people show dislike for others simply when they appear different to one's own “kind.” This form of prejudice is anchored in a love of or preference for people who are similar to one's self and an aversion to anyone who differs from one's self. In what follows I will review research and theory that elucidates each of these three central components of xenophobia, therefore providing some grounding for a term that has itself received little empirical investigation.",

This does not mean, however, that we must accept the world as it is and do nothing, like a quietist or those who follow the ancient ‘lazy reason’ argument. Instead, we must endeavour to follow the ‘presumptive will of God,’ (borrowing the notion of presumption from jurisprudence), that is, our best estimation of God’s goodness and purpose. Also discussed is the meaning of love, which Leibniz defines elsewhere as ‘finding happiness in the perfection of another’. From this, the love we have toward God arises when we contemplate his perfections, and this in turn gives rise to our own happiness.",

Love can have different meaning and expression – for some people it is a nice, warm feeling, a way of action and behaviour, for others it is nothing more than a sexual attraction. As there are different perceptions of love, there also exist few common love manifestations: love can be maternal, childish, juvenile, sexual. Love can also be felt for a home land, own nation, home. Naturally love can be expressed through the particular rituals, symbols and signs. Folk songs introduce four main lover characteristics: beauty, sweetness, kindness and boon. The later feature means that a girl/ boy is supposed to be well-set, to be pleasant and comfortable to touch which is very important when choosing a wife or a husband. Love in folklore is expressed through the common metaphorical and allegorical symbols, it doesn‘t sound as explicit word – more like a metaphor or epithet. Love in folklore can be perceived and felt very differently. L ove like an action – love like... special person, essential possession. Prime personal characteristics, such as kindness, tenderness, humility, are the ones to light the love fire as well as beauty, artfulness, eloquence also help. Love is supposed to lead to the sacred sacrament of marriage. Love, if real, is a serious subject. Love is worth dying for. Strong love leads to self-sacrifice. Fairy tales satirize infidelity stressing that love is right only between a wife and a husband while other options are considered as inglorious and wrong. Love, as an incest, is also common in our folklore.",

He (or she) loses freedom of choice. Because of a deep emotional and physical need of addicts to get a drug, their basic activity is inclined to supply &amp;amp;ldquo;chosen&amp;amp;rdquo; substance. Repeating use of substance and its effects, affect their health and interpersonal&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;relationships. Addict denies that. His (or her) possibility to recognize it is limited or ruined. Incorrect pattern of life persists.&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;Cognition of real facts about substance evidently does not protect enough from addiction. In this work effectiveness of a&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;specific, emotional approach in the therapy of addiction has been analyzed. Dependent is faced with another emotion,&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;supposing competitive to those of consuming &amp;amp;ldquo;chosen&amp;amp;rdquo; substance it is. It is expected that strong emotion could activate&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;available, but unattended cognitive contents. Experimental confirmation of working hypothesis is based on emotional&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;approach to alcohol-dependents. They have been faced with an emotional (literal and /or painted) message of anonym child in the connection with children&amp;#039;s heavy firsthand experiences of alcoholism in the family. Facing consequences, marks and products of dependence (firsthand experienced children&amp;#039;s desperation), experiencing strong enough emotional answer, empathy with other child, alcoholic recognizes desperation of his own related. Faced those experiences, he recognizes their own parental role in their family as negative role. Skilled psychiatrist can use that empathy as significant therapeutic factor. This empathy makes dependent able to overcome fear of changes and face the necessity to change their pattern of life. Most of them, without any further explanations have been turned into insight of addiction and oriented toward the therapy and rehabilitation. Results encourage practicing physician to apply this approach, first of all in the initiation of the therapy (realizing contacts, insight into disease) and later in the psychotherapy of any kind of chemical dependence. The key task of the therapist could be to find out specific, strong enough emotion that could be in certain case competitive to those of pleasure connected to the misuse of substance and a strong challenge to initiate cognitive processes and to change executive behaviour.&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;",

Yes – the weal and woe of another touches us directly: the mere happiness of another pleases us in the telling: even that of fictional persons whose tale we know of, or in distant ages – this common concern is so great that it collides with the self-interested feeling. The sense of it is indeed a noble feeling, nobler than the self-interested one. Nobody despises it: everyone wishes for it, though not all have it in the same degree; in some it is great, and the greater it is, the more it is felt as a perfection. It is universal, though seldom so great that it inspires active exertions – in misers, for example, with whom self-interest has become very strong. As needy beings the creator gave us self-interest in our own perfection. As beings who have the power to be of service to our fellows, He gave us a disinterested concern for the perfection of others. The concern for others ranks high, since even the concern for self can be subordinated to it, but not vice versa. The more self-interested, the poorer (at least in thought), and hence the more to be despised. The disinterested feeling for the welfare, etc., of another has our own perfection, not as an end, but as a means.",

In phantasy, and sometimes in the patient's early developmental environment, the object and the ego demand more from each other than either have to give. Some patients cannot contain their urge to possess all and to be all, so it becomes a part of the interpersonal and psychological relationship with the analyst rather quickly. These patients feel something is owed to them, and they demand to be fed immediately. Other patients try and hide these greedy phantasies by being the opposite of greedy. They strive to be independent and charitable, while having great conflict over deeper desires to be dependent and in possession of an idealized giving object, an all-providing breast.

A's action is altruistic if and only if A's ultimate motive in performing the action is the furtherance of some other individual's (or individuals') welfare. A's action remains altruistic even if, as a matter of fact, the other individual receives no benefit (because of some unforeseen interference, say). And A's action remains altruistic even if, as a matter of fact, A (and A alone) benefits from the action, so long as that outcome was not A's ultimate motive. If A acts to benefit B but A's ultimate motive for doing so is that furthering B's welfare promises in turn to benefit A (via boosting A's reputation, say), then A's action is not altruistic but selfish. On the face of it, there is no reason to assume that this distinction is exhaustive. It seems possible that actions can be done for motives that have nothing to do with benefiting anyone, or can be done for mixed motives where benefits to both actor and other are important motivating factors but neither is ultimate.",

      "abstract": "Nature does things well, but sometimes it takes crooked paths... In psychoanalysis, the role of the psychoanalyst, as of any other therapist, is not only to set clinical goals, to understand the psychic work of the patient and to accompany him in his self-discovery. Above all, it is supposed to manage the internal conflicts of the suffering subject. To do this, he seeks to shed light on his unconscious journey and detect the vagaries of his psychic functioning. He try to act on his commitment, motivation and adherence to the values of the society in which he lives, without hindering his subjectivity. This human mission is often complex because individuals are free and autonomous beings. They should not be treated as if they were instruments of any society. These people are also specific: they each have a particular childhood and social background. They have a different history and heritage, do not have the same ambitions, the same responsibilities, or the same dreams or professional goals. In short, individuals are very heterogeneous. This increases the difficulty of supporting them therapeutically and requires helping them to flourish despite their traumas. However, the trauma and the emotional emptiness it causes, added to the pain it causes, create a strong internal uncertainty in the patient. The psychoanalyst must endeavour to take this into account. The effectiveness of the intervention depends on the psychoanalyst's ability to understand and analyze the patient's behaviour in light of the psychological evidence. In this article, we will look at clinical cases representing essential facets of human behavior as well as the theories behind them. The approach is quintessentially Freudian. These conceptual foundations provide the clinic with levers for action to heal people. We analyze human behavior according to the social environment with which it interacts and which will cause its pathology to evolve... thus forging one's own nature.",

(ii) is a condition on the self’s being capable of attributing experiences to itself or being introspectively aware of its experiences, which constitutes a third, higher‐order aspect of the self. I claim that it is a common sense assumption, enshrined in the use of ‘I’, that one’s body satisfies the first two aspects. I then argue that these two aspects are not really satisfied by one’s body, which is essentially a human organism. Nor are they satisfied by anything of any other kind. So we are not identical to things of any kind, since one can be identical only to that which is one’s self or is the referent of one’s uses of ‘I’.",

Mead goes further to argue that, not only are persons thus aware of their identities in others' eyes, but that they see their own identities as they perceive these others to see them: The individual experiences himself as such, not directly, but only indirectly, from the particular standpoints of other individual members of the same social group, or from the generalized standpoint of the social group as a whole to which he belongs. For he enters his own experience as a self or individual, not directly or immediately, not by becoming a subject to himself, but only insofar as he first becomes an object to himself just as other individuals are objects to him or in his experience; and he becomes an object to himself only by taking the attitudes of other individuals toward himself within a social environment or context of experience and behavior in which both he and they are involved (Mead, 1934:138). Self-Evaluation There have been a number of attempts to apply Mead's orientation to an understanding of the social process within which self-evaluations arise. The difficulty in making this application may lie in the problem of applying the open awareness assumption to the field of self-evaluations. When the social origins of personal identity or conception of the Who Am I? variety are being sought, the hypothesis that the person adopts the views of others toward himself as his own view of himself is not easy to challenge. Role-playing to audiences clearly generates identities that match the roles played.' But the idea I am a woman, and the idea I am a beautiful woman, are different in the sense",

This is the process of motivational imbalance or “prepossession”, a state wherein a given need becomes dominant to the point of inhibiting other needs. In the case of violent extremism, the dominant need is the quest for significance, the desire to matter and have self and others’ respect. Whereas the “hydraulic” domination-inhibition process that underlies extremism can be observed across levels of phylogeny, the motivational imbalance in those cases is typically brief in duration. In the case of humans, however, participation in violent extremism can be long lasting, due to its facilitation by a compelling narrative” that ties violence to the attainment of significance, and is embraced by a “network” of trusted others (individuals’ friends and relatives) who validate the narrative and bestow significance on individuals who implement its dictates.",

Where you know yourself better than do others, moreover, it’s through the richer bank of data derived from your closer and more steady proximity to yourself.

      "abstract": "Jealous love and morbid jealousy, although inextricably linked, cannot be considered the same: jealous love (trait jealousy) is the behavioral and cognitive-affective precondition of morbid jealousy (state jealousy). Love is jealous when it is devoured by the desire for the exclusive and total possession of the partner, whose unconditional and continued presence is avidly requested. This type of love, in addition, is permeated by the need to know what the other is thinking, in order to scrutinize every minimal flaw in the faithfulness of the partner even in his or her innermost thoughts and fantasies; in it, jealousy is virtually always present, even in the absence of a triggering event, because captative love, by its very nature, includes the expectation of a conflict which inevitably actually takes place in reality. Finally, jealousy emerges as an emotional event (jealous flash) in response to a more or less significant change in the behavior of the partner, and reveals to the jealous individual a dimension which was previously latent or inexistent. This intense and brief experience, leaves a more or less blurred memory behind, and tends to progressively repeat itself and take root as a feeling.",

Hate is often seen as “evil,” especially when manifesting as hate speech or hate crimes. Because people generally do not want to be seen as evil, haters are often reluctant to own the experience unless they can justify it—by labeling the target “evil,” for example. Hate that cannot be justified is sometimes disguised, as when intimate partner violence, stalking, and other mate retention tactics are labeled “jealousy” or even “love” by perpetrators (and sometimes victims). Whether disguised, or fleeting, or a means to some other end such as revenge or the temporary quashing of fear of abandonment, the desire for harm to befall another qualifies as hate.",

      "title": "Pride, Shame, and Group Identification",
      "abstract": "Self-conscious emotions such as shame and pride are emotions that typically focus on the self of the person who feels them. In other words, the intentional object of these emotions is assumed to be the subject that experiences them. Many reasons speak in its favor and yet this account seems to leave a question open: how to cash out those cases in which one genuinely feels ashamed or proud of what someone else does? This paper contends that such cases do not necessarily challenge the idea that shame and pride are about the emoting subject. Rather, we claim that some of the most paradigmatic scenarios of shame and pride induced by others can be accommodated by taking seriously the consideration that, in such cases, the subject “group-identifies” with the other. This is the idea that, in feeling these forms of shame or pride, the subject is conceiving of herself as a member of the same group as the subject acting shamefully or in an admirable way. In other words, these peculiar emotive responses are elicited in the subject insofar as, and to the extent that, she is (or sees herself as being) a member of a group – the group to which those who act shamefully or admirably also belong. By looking into the way in which the notion of group identification can allow for an account of hetero-induced shame and pride, this paper attempts to achieve a sort of mutual enlightenment that brings to light not only an important and generally neglected form of self-conscious emotions, but also relevant features of group identification. In particular, it generates evidence for the idea that group identification is a psychological process that the subject does not have to carry out intentionally in the sense that it is not necessarily triggered by the subject’s conative states like desires or intentions.",

The activity of reflection builds symbolic landmarks between which the metaphorical narrative myth about making and leading others can be organized. The conduct of men is not only organizational and methodological: it is spiritual. Self-knowledge that avoids recourse to defensive or aggressive mechanisms allows us to develop emotional accommodations, connecting practice and ethics without confusing them in “justastructure” (Seve 1966). We must all suspect ourselves and each other of hidden temptations disguised with legitimate reasons. Ethics is the unconditional authorization to become “someone else” in a space where knowledge, skill, initiative, and respect for shared values mean that freedom and limits must constantly be defined.

The hollow object, which it produces, now fills it, therefore, with the feeling of emptiness. Its activity consists in yearning, which merely loses itself in becoming an unsubstantial shadowy object, and, rising above this loss and falling back on itself, finds itself merely as lost. In this transparent purity of its moments it becomes a sorrow-laden “beautiful soul,” as it is called; its light dims and dies within it, and it vanishes as a shapeless vapour dissolving into thin air.73 However it is valorized, then, the so-called beautiful soul seems destined to remain alien to the state, either transcending it in the wishful futurity of final fiction imperfectly prefigured in a fantasized feminine self or failing to rise to the requirement of real self-renunciation, stuck in the hopeless impotence of things of the past. In sharp contrast, Arnold’s beautiful soul, perversely, claims citizenship of the state at the present time as an ungendered alien self, while stubbornly preserving its resistance to simple, practical, limited reforms. Yet precisely by performing this resistance in the name of the state, reclaimed from both Humboldt’s curse (by rewriting it) and Hegel’s blessing (by ignoring it), its alienated writing turns “fitted for social service” and underwrites the impure, historical (limited, indirect, unintentional) actualization of its “sentiment . . . for beauty and sweetness” (C&A, 74) in the simple, practical, limited, womanly sort of form of the welfare state. Now that the demise of the welfare state seems pretty much assumed by most of the Arnolds of our time,74 it is tempting to think we know all he can teach us. But we are still obliged to actually read him writing up unscripted feelings for a state fit for aliens that is yet to come. 73 G. W. F. Hegel, Phenomenology of Mind (1807), par. 658 of the 1910 J.

      "abstract": "Embodied Memory, Transcendence, and Telling: Recounting Trauma, Re-establishing the Self Roberta Culbertson (bio) Memory and Silence Naive public conceptions of memory, and the attendant assumption that memory takes certain forms and not others, contribute to a curious circumstance surrounding the victimized survivor of violence. The survivor most often, nearly invariably, becomes silent about his victimization, though the experience nevertheless in every case remains somehow fundamental to his existence, and to his unfolding or enfolded conception of himself. This silence is an internal one in which the victim attempts to suppress what is recalled (so as not to relive the victimization countless times), or finds it repressed by some part of himself which functions as a stranger, hiding self from the self’s experience according to unfathomable criteria and requirements. It is external as well: the victim does not tell what she recalls, in part because others do not seem to hear what is said, partly out of a conviction that she will not be believed, and more basically because she simply cannot make the leap to words: “If you were not there, it is difficult to describe or say how it was. It sounds very, very, very. . . . I don’t know if there is [a] word to describe the nightmare one go through . . . how men function under such a stress is one thing, and then how you communicate and express [to] somebody who never knew that such a degree of brutality [is] existing seems like a fantasy.” 1 Yet despite this silence, the momentous nature of threats and harm to the body dictates that violence and trauma nevertheless leave the survivor preoccupied with the memory of it, which itself seems both absent and entirely too present. Most disturbingly, bits of memory, flashing like clipped pieces of film held to the light, appear unbidden and in surprising ways, as if possessed of a life independent of will or consciousness. These undeniable presences nevertheless have an aura of unbelievability: though presenting themselves as clearly past, real, and fully embodied, they appear in nonnarrative forms that seem to meet no standard test for truth or comprehensibility. Survivor writings make it clear that to be a survivor of one’s violation [End Page 169] is precisely this: to live with the paradox of silence and the present but unreachable force of memory, and a concomitant need to tell what seems untellable. 2 The paradox is based in more than simply the difficulty of reporting events that listeners would rather not hear or believe, or which are too different to be grasped. It is the paradox of a known and felt truth that unfortunately obeys the logic of dreams rather than of speech and so seems as unreachable, as other, as these, and as difficult to communicate and interpret, even to oneself. It is a paradox of the distance of one’s own experience. No experience is more one’s own than harm to one’s own skin, but none is more locked within that skin, played out within it in actions other than words, in patterns of consciousness below the everyday and the constructions of language. Trapped there, the violation seems to continue in a reverberating present that belies the supposed linearity of time and the possibility of endings. It at once has a certain pastness, is a sort of “memory-knowledge” as Mary Warnock would call it, and is not past, not “memory”—that is, a personal, narrated account of something completed, locatable in time—at all. Perhaps it is not even remembered, but only felt as a presence, or perhaps it shapes current events according to its template, itself unrecognized. 3 The demands of narrative for their part operate in fact as cultural silencers to this sort of memory, descending immediately upon an experience to shape notions of legitimate memory, and silencing the sort of proto-memory described. We lose sight of the body’s own recall of its response to threat and pain, and of the ways in which it “speaks” this pain, because this wordless language is unintelligible to one whose body is not similarly affected, and because without words the experience has a certain shadowy quality, a paradoxical...",

      "title": "A Plea for Pity",
      "abstract": "A Plea for Pity Robert H. Kimball Introduction Does the ability to feel pity toward the unfortunate represent one of humanity's better instincts, on par with the capacity for love, compassion, and forgiveness? Or is pity actually one of our morally baser emotions, like jealousy, envy, or hatred, because pity can include contempt for its object and an attitude of morally reprehensible superiority on the part of the pitier? Surprisingly, there is little philosophical consensus on this issue, with informed opinion nearly equally divided. That the same emotion can elicit such contrary evaluations shows how elusive a clear understanding of pity can be. Furthermore, is there something wrong—either logically or morally—with attempting to arouse the emotion of pity in others when they do not already feel it themselves (or do not feel it as intensely as we want them to)? Should appeals to pity be rejected because any emotion is inimical to clear thinking or simply irrelevant to the justification of action? Or is there something particularly morally reprehensible about trying to manipulate another's emotions and actions specifically on the basis of pity? Alternatively, at least in some cases could an exhortation to pity be an acceptable, even desirable, aspect of moral education or an often-necessary reminder to care about the misfortunes of others and not just to pursue our own self-interests? Surprisingly, opinion (at least in the informal fallacy tradition) is remarkably unanimous about the undesirability of appealing to pity. But I think their reasons can be improved upon. Traditional analyses of appeal to pity do not seriously analyze the emotion being appealed to, and most treatments of pity as an emotion do not address its use in rhetorical manipulation. I claim that what is wrong with appeal to pity can be satisfactorily understood only if pity itself is adequately understood. I propose to proceed by combining these two questions: what is wrong with pity? and what is wrong with appeal to pity? [End Page 301] In answering the second question, the textbook tradition of informal fallacy analysis holds that when a speaker attempts to arouse pity in an audience in order to induce an action, this situation should be interpreted not under the rubric of nonlogical causal influence, manipulation, or rhetorical persuasion but rather as belonging to the domain of (informal) logic, and in particular as a failed attempt at argument in which a descriptive premise that A pities B does not entail the normative conclusion that B deserves A's help (or that A should help B). Thus in the informal fallacy tradition, experiencing the emotion of pity is never a valid justification for action.2 I believe this rigid reason/emotion distinction has little basis in our actual belief-forming and decision-making practices. Nor do I believe that emotion should be excluded from reasoning, since our emotions are often informative and are sometimes more reliable guides to action than argument. In Appeal to Pity, Douglas Walton (1997) presents a nuanced and considerably more subtle alternative to the textbook tradition, in which he evaluates epistemically the effect of the emotional state of pity on practical reasoning. Analyzing such cases as charitable appeals (e.g., for starving people and disaster victims, arguments for hardship exemptions from general rules, and alleged atrocities), he emphasizes especially the particularizing nature of pity and the way it overrides universal principles, especially of justice. Under Walton's epistemic evaluation of pity, it emerges as a reason-clouding emotion under certain conditions. Furthermore, he shows how the occurrence of pity is susceptible to manipulation; he emphasizes especially cases in which pity is not actually deserved or justified but is manipulatively made to seem so. But Walton looks at a very small slice of the landscape of pity and what might be problematic about it. So in order to evaluate pity fully—not just epistemically but also as a moral emotion and its role in a fully flourishing life—we need to expand our concept of pity. In fact, pity is a very difficult and complex emotion to analyze (Solomon 1993). Definition of \"pity\" In pitying someone, such as a homeless person, a starving child, or a mutilated...",

      "abstract": "Moral status is a characteristic that we human moral agents attribute to entities, by virtue of which they matter morally for their own sake, so that we must pay attention to their interests or integrity when we consider actions that might affect them, regardless of whether other beings are concerned about them. When an entity has moral status, I may not act toward it in any way I please, disregarding its well-being, preferences, or continued existence. I owe some moral obligations to that entity itself. As a moral agent, I must care to some degree about what it wants or needs, or simply what it is; this imposes some limitations on how I may act toward it. This is importantly different from having obligations in relation to some entity (e.g., my neighbor's house) that are actually owed to some other entity (i.e., my neighbor). It is the being to whom duties are owed that has moral status. Moral status is also importantly different from moral goodness; persons' intentional conformity to moral principles might be one of the characteristics that enhances their moral status, relative to persons who routinely act immorally and to beings who are incapable of moral action, but being worthy of consideration in others' moral reasoning is quite distinct conceptually from acting morally oneself.",

This paper defends this view by arguing that it is consistent with thinking of God as God's incorporeal, omniscient, immutable, and timeless.

      "title": "Consciousness: a neural capacity for objectivity, especially pronounced in humans",
      "abstract": "Consciousness tends to be viewed either as subjective experience of sensations and feelings, or as perception and internal representation of objects. This paper argues that neither view sufficiently acknowledges that consciousness may refer to the brain's most adaptive property: its capacity to produce states of objectivity. It is proposed that this capacity relies on multiple sensorimotor networks for internally representing objects and their properties in terms of expectancies, as well as on motivational and motor mechanisms involved in exploration, play, and care for vulnerable living and non-living objects. States of objectivity are associated with a very special phenomenal aspect; the experience that subjective aspects are absent and one is \"just looking\" at the world as it really is and can be. However, these states are normally closely preceded and followed by (and tend to be combined or fused with) sensations and feelings which are caused by activation of sensory and motivational mechanisms. A capacity for objectivity may have evolved in different species and can be conceived as a common basis for other elusive psychological properties such as intelligence, conscience, and esthetic experience; all three linked to crucial behaviors in human evolution such as tool making, cooperation, and art. The brain's pervasive tendency to objectify may be responsible for wrongly equating consciousness with feelings and wrongly opposing it to well-learned or habitual (\"unconscious\") patterns of perception and behavior.",

      "abstract": "Currently, we can observe a crisis of self and its respective weak ties with a group and lack of community bonds. All these make it that on the one hand there is a need for professional help, and on the other the effectiveness of such help is rated as low. The manners of empowering both he person, group and community are sought. We deal with such empowerment, among other things, at the level of self-help groups. Yet the source of that success should be sought not so much in the phenomenon of a group as in the very person and his activity. It is the person who thanks to his indispensable abilities can overcome biological and social limitations. Owing to self-help activity the person develops his abilities and frees himself from the sense of helplessness, powerlessness and hopelessness. The phenomenon of self-help activity requires that a new role and competence of the psychologist (and not only him) be defined in relation with self-help groups. On the one hand, he must be capable of arousing confidence in particular persons and groups to himself, to his own competencies, to use their own resources. On the other hand, he must be able to organize, facilitate and animate those social processes in which the division into the giving and the taking will be overcome. The reconstruction of a sense of community that is well underway in the self-help groups is an initial condition by which to join the broader trend of constructive social activities.",

As with demand, there may seem to be a problem in maintaining that it is possible for people to supply esteem in this way. After all, I cannot make a gift of my esteem, nor can I offer it in a trade with another person, nor can I pass on the esteem I receive from others. But while esteem itself may not be alienable in these ways, certain ‘esteem-services’ are: I can voluntarily offer you my attention, my testimony, and my company, and do so in a way that promises to increase your positive esteem. And I can do this without self-defeat so far as I can hide my motives or, more plausibly, can do so in a virtually but not actually strategic way: I give my attention, testimony or association quite spontaneously but will be led to think again if it fails to secure suitable reciprocation.",

I argue that the usual answer, self-government, fails once we recognize that selves can govern in spite of defects that prevent the realization of an agent's deepest personal ideals and values. Definitions of autonomy in terms of self-realization are also rejected. A close examination of the inhibitory effects of oppressive socialization reveals the centrality of the idea of liberation to autonomy or, more specifically, authenticity. The liberation is to engage with features of the world relevant to the agent's desires, values, and commitments. It is a transfer of control from alien forces from without or within to the world. An agent's authenticity is guaranteed once causal pathways, linking the agent's goals with relevant features of the world, are operating in the service of an informed and competent agent. It is argued that sudden radical conversions and (hypothetical) total value reorientations, induced neurologically, do not inhibit the autonomy of a self, but rather involve the creation of new selves.",

These characteristics, inherent to human person’s being, are derived of the substantial unity of spiritual soul and body, and they bestow human beings with a special dignity, which must be reflected in the way each one assumes his or her own existence, and how he/she is treated and respected by others. Indeed, the human person’s dignity confers personal rights and duties, among which is found, in a preeminent place, the unconditioned respect to every innocent human life (one’s one as well as others’). Therefore, the human being’s death and its surrounding period demand profound respect and to be treated according to such dignity, which allows every one to face this step with a maximum of decorum and integrity. While euthanasia represents a manner of facing death which disclaims human life’s inviolability and, hence, attempts against the human person’s dignity, on the other hand, palliative care counts nowadays with very efficacious tools to alleviate suffering and to attend human beings in this crucial step of life in consonance with the dignity of which they are endowed.",

      "title": "The Leader-Follower Connection",
      "abstract": "(Figure 1) The \"absence of leadership\"' has become a convenient excuse for all of the shortcomings of the nursing profession.Leadership is about power. And it may be that we have misread the nature of power, thereby misjudging roles and relationships and compromising our ability to take charge of our own future. Power has to be understood as the product of social relationships. Power is given or it does not exist. Sometimes it is given freely, sometimes coercively; often it is withheld as a demonstration of defiance. Power may be awarded by a system, it may be a personal attribute, or it may be shared by those who possess it with those they wish to empower. The underlying principles of power and its connection to leadership are abstract, but the proofs are within the personal experiences of each of us. We have known the manager who finds it difficult or impossible to move an agenda despite being in a position of authority with access to resources, or the bully who is far more successful in controlling the behavior of others than reality warrants. Each scenario depicts leadership, if only by its absence or in a negative form. The outcome is largely dependent on the choices of the followers. And then there are the leaders who motivate you to walk that extra painful mile, who wear their power comfortably but purposefully and convince you that there is an end beyond the means. The attributes of successful leaders have been well documented. As a class they are natural role models who convey the expectation that subordinates will emulate their values. Those values include a large dose of humanism and respect for people. People skills are their forte. They are very much part of the team, yet possess vision that sets them apart. That vision is shared openly and honestly, but in a restrained fashion so as not to overwhelm those that follow. The net result is security among followers based on the fact that someone is out front leading the way through uncharted territory. To accomplish the goals they share with their followers, these leaders surround themselves with the best and the brightest people for the challenge at hand and allow them to proceed, resisting any temptation to micromanage. They comfortably straddle the line between internal and external environments, acting, looking and speaking the part of leader, eclectically educated and polished. A sometimes inordinate faith is placed in the support of one's followers, and consequently they are comfortable taking risks. In fact, anything that does not entail risk in the acquisition is probably not worth having as far as they are concerned. Such are the characteristics of effective leaders, which may come to them naturally or through the cultivation of followers. With a leadership vacuum, there is little vision, even less risk-taking, and a parochialism that reduces work to drudgery. Communication becomes incomplete and guarded. Deception and insecurity begin to dominate and paralyze. Followers are restrained in their commitment, feeling an absence of direction. There is an uneasy sense among followers that they are being held to a higher standard than their supposed leaders. Today's challenge is to achieve practical application of these observations about leading and following and their relationship to power. Honesty also moves us to question whether a leadership vacuum is any more costly than a deficit of followers. Each role requires talent and strength. One is neither more nor less than the other, but simply aligned with different talents, personalities, and lifestyles. While the prescription for leadership seems clear, the qualities of an effective follower are less well defined. Are we comfortable with open and complete communication? Are we ready to buy into a vision when some pieces are imperfectly defined? Are we willing to assume ownership of our ideas, and to tear down the fences that are conveniently erected to maintain the distance between our professional and private lives? How much personal sacrifice will we endure and how much support and protection will we assure leaders when the going gets tough for them on our behalf? Those are neither leaders nor followers who find themselves marking time in place and going nowhere. Those who show the qualities of leadership should be empowered, and it is by this deliberate and conscious action that a cohort of followers is created.",

The repudiation of idols, the respect for God's transcendence, is what has led to relieving God from the task of being the ultimate explanation for the order of nature and the course of history. To explain something in terms of divine action or Providence always amounts to placing God among the finite causes we have already found or can imagine discovering. Once we have resolved to let God be God, we can no longer use God for our own cognitive ends. A similar unburdening of God seems appropriate in the domain of morality. When the validity of a moral demand is understood in terms of being God's command, the motive of the moral life becomes the desire to please God, as though we could help him or should fear him. Such a conception of God must appear as an all-too-human projection, if we assume that God must transcend such human needs and passions. We respect God as God when we learn to value the moral life for itself without appeal to God's purposes (though we may still believe that God loves what is good and right).",

Adulation is not necessarily indicative of charisma, nor is popular appeal.

In close relationships, we voluntarily make ourselves most vulnerable to another human being by linking the realization of our needs, aspirations, and hopes to the goodwill of our relationship partner (for related ideas, see chap. 17, this volume). Rendering ourselves vulnerable makes possible the profound sense of well-being that can be experienced in close relationships. But at the same time, the imperfection of any partner means that hurt or injury is virtually inevitable, and when it occurs, the hurt is particularly poignant precisely because we have made ourselves vulnerable.

There is a great human good in being properly related to God, in subordinating our wills to the will of an absolutely perfect being. But this good will be unavailable to us unless God takes a certain practical stance toward us. First, God must not will that we act contrary to the norms of morality that bind us. Second, God’s will must be a sufficiently good proximate standard for action, better than acting on our own discretion or on some other proximate standard. This chapter argues that God can indeed take on a contingent ethics that meets these constraints, either through forming discretionary intentions or through performing certain speech-acts (e.g. making promises to, or covenants with, us humans).",

The method used is a literature review, a comprehensive summary of several research studies determined by theme. Literature search using the Google Scholar database.Research methods : Literature Review. This research uses case studies, qualitative phenomenological studies, descriptive qualitative, normative law, cross-sectional and case reports taken from articles published from 2016 to 2020.Results and analysis: researchers found 6 articles that were appropriate and met the inclusion criteria for describing ideas when delusions occur in schizophrenic patients, namely having a magical item or tool, having supernatural powers or abilities, experiencing possession or being possessed by a creature, having a high position, feeling frightened by a creature, feeling empty or hollow in the heart, feeling hurt or physically harmed, fasting or certain rituals, feeling like receiving magic/witchcraft from other people, meeting supernatural beings, thinking that other people feel jealous/envy, feeling like they are going to be killed , feels physically disabled/damaged, claims to be God and is controlled by God. As for the aggressive ideas that arise, such as injuring other people, injuring themselves or having suicidal ideas when their delusions occur, even schizophrenic patients when delusions occur in the form of delusions of being chased have ideas about killing because they feel excessively suspicious and feel like they are being chased.

In this way, his outlook may vary radically, not only at different periods of his life, but from day to day, even from one hour to the next. It is a function of so many variables: age, experiences, present environment, current reading, current physical state are some of them. As for the ways of life that may thus present themselves at different times as each uniquely satisfactory, there can be no doubt about their variety and opposition. The ideas of self-obliterating devotion to duty or to the service of others; of personal honour and magnanimity; of asceticism, contemplation, retreat; of action, dominance and power; of the cultivation of “an exquisite sense of the luxurious”; of simple human solidarity and co-operative endeavour; of a refined complexity of social existence; of a constantly maintained and renewed affinity with natural things—any of these ideas, and a great many others too, may form the core and substance of a personal ideal.",

      "title": "The Inevitable Pursuit of the Will and the Problem of Merit According to Thomas Aquinas",
      "abstract": "Man's will necessarily pursues what is in accordance with its nature, and accidentally pursues what does not. Since the will pursues whatever it does in accordance with the good or ultimate purpose, it inevitably pursues formal good in general or the ultimate purpose. And the will inevitably pursues existence, preservation of life, social cooperation, and the pursuit of truth according to man's nature. The methods for realizing these goals are chosen haphazardly. However, when the ends according to these natures are in conflict with each other, the will chooses and pursues one by chance. In particular, in the case of the ultimate goal, it includes not only the aspect of self-completion but also the method of realization, and the will has freedom of execution regarding which method of realization the ultimate goal includes. The will can pursue or reject an ultimate goal whose method of realization is worldly values such as pleasure or wealth, or an ultimate goal whose method of realization is goodness itself. In this way, the ultimate goal that the will knows with freedom of execution is inevitably pursued. Because the will has freedom of action in knowing this ultimate end, these activities can be the object of moral merit. Obtaining faith by God's grace and achieving beatific vision in heaven are also inevitably accepted by the will when God's help is provided. When the grace of faith is given, it cannot be refused, and the will cannot be given freedom of action when preparing to accept it. The human will cannot exercise any freedom of choice or action under these conditions. So, although ‘free will in a broad sense’ can be recognized in the will, it is difficult to give merit to such activities. In heaven, the beatified person does not reject the beatific vision but inevitably pursues it because he has a firm inclination toward goodness. However, in order for the beatified person to have a firm inclination toward goodness, a person must have faith and make efforts in accordance with the correct ultimate goal in this life. The virtue achieved through such efforts in this life is not only the grace of God, but also the freedom of practice as ‘free will in a narrow sense’. These activities can be a contribution to the beatific vision achieved in the afterlife. The degree of supernatural virtue and beatific intuition of the beatified person in heaven varies depending on the grace given initially and the merits formed afterwards.",

      "title": "[The comparison of human reflex and instinct behaviour (author's transl)].",
      "abstract": "On the basis of characteristics of the exteroceptive reflexes and of the instincts it was shown that instinct behaviour developed from reflex characteristics (local characteristic of the stimuli, pos. and neg. taxis, habituation, conditioning). Most similarities are found between reflex and avoidance instinct behaviour (instincts for excretion, thermoregulation, body care, pain avoidance and safety). Except the safety instinct, all others react on stimuli, characterised by the localisation of the receptors. In the safety instinct the structure of the stimulus becomes important, together with the growing importance of the third dimension. This instinct shows also for the first time a variability of the threshold with spontaneous remaining low for some time after stimulation of the system. Inverse the gain instincts (nutrition, sex and social instinct). Here the threshold falls spontaneously, when stimuli are lacking and raises, when stimuli are found. The spontaneous motor expression of the lowering of the threshold is the appetite behaviour. It means seeking stimuli, which will be gained by elements of the initial and terminal success behaviour. The successfull nutritional and sexual behaviour is stopped by success inhibition, whereas the social instinct remains in the terminal success behaviour with group dynamic hierarchy, with imitating and helping behaviour. Overchanging of the gain instincts provokes avoidance behaviour with constant threshold. The neural systems of most reflexes lie distributed in the spinal cord and brainstem, the ones of the instincts in the limbic part of the brain, the nutrition and sex instinct with a hypothalamic pacemaker. Simultaneous activation of two or many instinct motivation systems result, not comparable with the direct reflex interaction, in interactions on the level of the global interaction, in interactions on the level of the global integration (summation, mixture, synthesis, rest, oscillation, intention) which projects the activity patterns via the motor cortex to the peripheral neurons. There it is completed by the reflexes. The hormonal and vegetative projection instead go directly to the end organs. The motivation is responsible for the subjective experience, the dominating integration with its motor projection for the instinct behaviour.",

We constantly apply it in interactions between people, organizations, animals, and even artifacts. We use it instinctively and implicitly in closed and static systems, or consciously and explicitly in open or dynamic systems. An epitome for the former case is a small village, where everybody knows everybody, and the villagers instinctively use their knowledge or stereotypes to trust or distrust their neighbors. A big city exemplifies the latter case, where people use explicit rules of behavior in diverse trust relationships. We already use trust in computing systems extensively, although usually subconsciously. The challenge for exploiting trust in computing lies in extending the use of trust-based solutions, first to artificial entities such as software agents or subsystems, then to human users' subconscious choices.",

      "abstract": "All investigative, expressive and creative endeavours—cate gorised as intellectual, artistic, scientific and so on—are ultimately attempts to search, seek or to rediscover one's relationship with the cosmos and find a place in the universe. These kinds of endeavours either arise out of some presumed—a priori— socially conditioned metaphysical assumptions or out of a recreation of new metaphysical truths, perhaps, directly perceived. At some point or points in one's life these attempts gain primacy, as in 'crisis' periods, when one needs to reaffirm a harmonious relationship between the self and the world in which one lives. (The falseness or truth of the duality of 'self and the world' need not be discussed at the moment.) The self in this case may be defined as the person (with a self-image) who projects and identifies himself with other persons and other non-human existence as also, especially, with various socio-cultural concepts such as family, society, nation and so on. Individual existence implies relationships, be it with nature or humans; whether this relationship exists in the person's mind or outside, he or she cannot do without it. The word 'person, synonym for self, is deliberately used because it means 'mask' (Latin derivative—persona). This particular use of the term 'person' is different from the category of 'being', or 'human being'. In fact, even the word 'individual' is derived from the root word 'whole' or 'complete'. In this sense, the same applies to the word 'alone'—all one (not to be confused with lonely), i.e. it is derived from the root of being One without a second—referring to a total, complete individual. In turn, whole-complete is the same as holistic, implying 'one-ness'. From this flows the idea of being holy, virtuous, and that is inseparable from the notions of beauty, goodness, love and creation. The experience of all these words may only be known within",

      "abstract": "There are a number of ways in which a person can share the guilt of another's wrongdoing. He might advise it, command it or consent to it. He might provoke it, praise it, flatter the wrongdoer, or conceal the wrong. He might stay silent when there is a clear duty to denounce the wrong or its perpetrator; or he might positively defend the wrong done. Finally, he might actively participate or co-operate in the wrongdoing. These various activities, apart from co-operation, typically occur before or after the commission of the wrong itself, only provocation being essentially before the fact. As such they fall into the categories of seduction or comfort, seduction being essentially pre-commission and comfort post-commission. In seduction (mutatis mutandis for comfort), the seducer typically leads another into doing wrong who has not definitely made up his mind. He does not assist in the commission, but he leads to its occurring. If the principal (as I will call the one who commits the wrong) has made up his mind, actions which might otherwise amount to seduction are best characterized as amounting to scandal, since they do not lead to wrong but reinforce the principal in his wrongful intent or provide to third parties a bad example since they connote approval of the principal's action. Closely related to the concept of seduction is that of solicitation, though perhaps these are best thought of as two aspects of the same kind of activity.",

      "abstract": "This paper addresses the nature of pathologization in general and the pathologization of love in therapeutic care in particular. “Pathologized or pathologization[u1] ,” means an event, person, action, thought, feeling, or circumstance that is de-valuated as “less than,” as compromised or broken, and unwittingly (ironically, in the name of love) demeaned, belittled, ignored, jettisoned or ostracized for its not-enough-ness, its incorrectness, or its inadequacy in light of rank-ordered scales of measured worth. The pathologist presumes an essentialist hegemony [ctsq2] should be healthy love, consequentiality, views any expression less than this prescription as a privation or pathologization of healthy love, and is thus immature, ill, or unethical. Common ways therapists pathologize love in therapeutic space include the use of a modified against nature argument; which today is reframed as an against the status quo argument. The use of inflection and body language that communicates disapproval are, enacting[u3] ideologies of deficit-correction that inherently stigmatize, interpreting expressions of love “as other than it is,” or, “as nothing but something else,” such as adoration interpreted as really dependency or teenaged pining as merely raging hormones. Essentialist rank-ordered scaling inherent in these forms of pathologization is deconstructed, then explored in terms of the impact of this deconstruction in therapeutic care. The essay is concluded[u4] with suggestions of how to care for expressions of love in non-pathologizing ways within therapeutic space.",

This study investigated the differences between how United States participants (N = 610) experience interpersonal gratitude and spiritual gratitude. Compared to interpersonal gratitude, spiritual gratitude experiences were less often attributed to human action, more often attributed to supernatural beings and circumstances beyond human control, and elicited significantly less feelings of gratitude, indebtedness, and admiration, but greater awe. Participants reported the highest feelings of gratitude when they also believed in a personal God with a benevolent mind. These findings demonstrate the importance of perceiving benevolent agency in evoking feelings of gratitude, whereas experiences that are attributed to more abstract, less personified, or less external entities elicit a different profile of positive emotional responses.",

      "abstract": "A philosophical question'What is happiness?'In these words one sometimes seeks a resolution of certain philosophical difficulties: Is happiness the satisfaction one obtains when one's desires are satisfied?Is it the capacity to be pleased with what one has and to enjoy what one does?Is the happy person one who enjoys life or one who has attained inner peace?How far does a person's happiness depend on his state of soul, his values and attitudes to things, and how far on his external circumstances.What can one do to be happy?Can the desire for happiness be anything other than a form of selfseeking?These and other questions come crowding in.Yet they do not come from ignorance.One who asks them knows well enough what the word means and what he or she is talking about.They are an expression of perplexity and seek for an order in one's appre- hension of what is familiar territory, for a clearer view of the application of the concept of happiness and its relations to a host of other concepts: enjoyment, pleasure, satisfaction, gladness, joy, doing what one wants, contentment, serenity, virtue, and many others.It is worth noting that the words 'What is happi- ness?' may also express a request for something dif- ferent: for one's conception of happiness to be made explicit.This involves bringing out what one considers to be of supreme importance in life.Here too one is called on to reflect on what one already knows, on 'what lies open to view'.But what is in question here is not the application of and the connections between concepts with which speakers of one's language are familiar.What is in question are one's own thoughts, attitude to life, desires and ambitions, beliefs and val- ues.The question this time calls for self-reflection, and this bears a certain resemblance to philosophical reflec- tion.It may even lead one to certain philosophical questions and so come to be intertwined with philo- sophical reflection.Two people can thus attach the same meaning to the word 'happiness' and yet have very different concep- tions of happiness.Consequently they may differ over whether or not someone is happy, as Socrates and Polus differed over whether Archelaus, the Macedo-",

Dugas calls intimidation, to distuinguish it from reflective timidity, is ' due to the distress arising from the realization of the lack of sympathy between ourselves and our environment.'Reflection is apt to create a certain exaggeration of this feeling, so that the person affected ' begins to despise himself, to exaggerate his perplexities, and to pet his anger.'He is apt to isolate himself intellectually.While his thinking may be original, it will lack social adaptiveness.On the affective side there is a tendency to conceal sentiments of his own, and to distrust the sympathy of others.Hence the reserve that is characteristic of timidity.He may be further affected by a certain maladie d'iddal, or tendency to despise the things of ordinary life in comparison with his fancies.On the volitional side his acts are apt to be impulsive, and are often incomprehensible to himself, mainly because he no longer has the power of deliberate judgment.Finally, in its spontaneous form timidity marks a normal state in mental growth, that stands midway between the pure reflex life of the child and reflective mental life.Between the more abnormal form and genius a possible relation is suggested.The exclusiveness which the timide seeks, while it cannot of itself inspire art, may give occasion for its development.",

For instance, if one is able to write one's own name, but unable to fill out a job application because he or she does not understand the words 'previous' or 'experience', is that person considered literate or illiterate? How much reading and writing ability must one possess before one can be considered literate? Questions such as this gave birth to the term functional literacy. Functional Literacy refers to one's ability to use language skills to cope with every day demands (IL Y, 1990). In other words, if one's ability to read and write is so limited that it prevents him or her from functioning in society, e.g. purchasing goods, reading a bus schedule or following instructions on a medicine bottle, then that person is by definition, functionally illiterate.

Only a tender soul is the store house of affection. A soul that has already been hardened seldom shows affection. Affection is guided by emotion. As such affection is a disease. It is one kind of mental state or a mental disposition. Thus it signifies a person’s natural qualities of mind and character. Mother is always affectionate but father may not be so. Indulgence is the state of being allowed whatever one wants. It overlooks faults. It is the action or habit of satisfying one’s own or other people’s desires. Indulgence allows oneself to enjoy the pleasure of something. It is to become involved in an activity, especially one that is illegal or disapproved of. It is to satisfy an interest, a desire, etc..Sacrament is any of several rituals in the Roman Catholic, Anglican and other Christian Churches through which Christians believe they are specially blessed by God. The sacrament of baptism is the striking example of it. Indulgence is the remission of unishment in purgatory, still due for sins even after sacramental absolution. Thus absolution is a formal declaration, especially in a Christian Church, by a priest that a person’s sins have been forgiven. Forgiveness is a great virtue. To forgive is divine. A sinner is rectified through pardon. Only a lucky soul can follow that immortal light.",

      "title": "Complicated Exchanges: The Handling of Authorised and Unauthorised Gifts",
      "abstract": "The early modern idea of gift-giving primarily involved binding exchanges of a wide spectrum of objects with varying degrees of value. As a rule, a gift either resulted in a gift or favour in return, or expressed gratitude for a service rendered. A 1735 German encyclopedia by Johann Zedler explained: ‘Giving gifts and to receive something in return is thus not wrong ... [although] ... wisdom is required if one wishes one’s gifts to achieve the desired effect.’. While the fiction of altruistic gift-giving — corresponding to the courtly virtue of generosity — may have been maintained, there were distinct rules of gift-giving, attesting to a multitude of presents and occasions. By today’s definitions, such gifts could be classed as awards or rewards, bribes or payments. They ranged from private, individual presents for relatives or friends to prestigious, highly symbolic public presents. Some of these were gifts of honour (Ehrengaben), acknowledging peers or persons of higher status; others were known as ‘gifts of grace’ (Gnadengaben) and presented to those of lower rank, usually in recognition of some service or event. Then there were ceremonially regulated diplomatic gifts, donations to churches, monasteries and convents, prizes for festivals and contests, testamentary donations and so on. As the exchange of presents occurred purposefully, with a specified goal, it was subject to certain standards and ceremonies similar to those governing other courtly behaviour patterns. These rules were probably implicit; they were rarely written down. Occasionally there were infringements of rules, and these instances are especially revealing. Focusing principally on paintings, this paper considers the rules and handling of authorised and unauthorised royal gifts.Schencken also, daß uns der andere wieder was dagegen erweise, ist gar nichts unrechtes (...)

Satisfaction with life implies a contentment with or acceptance of life circumstances. An individual who is satisfied with his or her life may also feel a fulfillment of needs for his or her life as a whole. In essence, satisfaction is a subjective assessment of the quality of one's experience. Because it is inherently an evaluation, judgments of satisfaction could be subjective and involve a large cognitive component. Subjective and relative aspects of satisfaction may not directly correspond to objective conditions. For example, poor people may report higher life satisfaction than rich people – people with more income may not feel more satisfied than people with less income.",

On the one hand depressives have the desire to incorporate and to possess in a compensatory-fusionary way objects and on the other hand, since the objects lose by this their object character, they fear them at the same time. Partners of depressives experience themselves often as being totally in their hands respectively \"devoured\" by them. How so ever the fusion of the depressives might be, they always suffer from the impression having lost their self as well as the objects. Submitted to their narcissistically uncathected archaic superego, depressives are strictly directed towards law and order. An individual who is not able to accept himself in such a way, has also no possibility for an object love since the basis of each object relation is always the enlargement of the self onto the object and only on this basis an identification can be realized. Due to a narcissistically insufficient cathexis of the body respectively of certain body functions, pains are often experienced, whereby it may happen that the pain experience represents the depression itself. Due to this narcissistic deficiency the depressive considers himself to be outside any social relationships. The depressive suffers therefore not only from the lost self but also from the object from which he feels estranged. In mania however the people concerned succeed to have the enthralling experience of a compensatory grandioe self and of the fusion with the object. Why this defense against the narcissistic emptiness respectively depletion is possible, even when admitting a genetic predisposition, must still be clarified.",

      "title": "Teatralidad en casa: la arquitectura doméstica y la diva",
      "abstract": "La diva o el divo es una persona publica, un sujeto cuya artistica condicion laboral lo convierte en un ciudadano diferente. La diva no es ni masculina ni femenina, es un hombre, una mujer; todo un personaje cuya personalidad publica se confunde y se funde con sus ser privado. La diva, en terminos arquitectonicos, no presupone una profesion concreta o un genero definido. Se incluyen todas aquellas personas que por su trayectoria y estatus esten envueltas en un halo de excepcionalidad, ficticio o no, merecido o no, que los lleva a esta categoria. Una diva como cliente es otro tipo de sujeto, que no incorpora necesariamente las expectativas y normas tradicionales sobre los papeles dentro del ambito domestico. La diva es aquel o aquella cuyo trabajo es ser otro, interpretando o asumiendo a otros, como los actores o los cantantes de opera, o incluso auto-interpretandose, como en el caso de otro tipo de celebridades. Ser diva es un estado psicologico. Los arquitectos de exito a veces son divos. Su actuacion, entonces, ha de ser siempre original y solo consideran adecuado un marco extraordinario. El estudio de sus viviendas o sus lugares de trabajo es revelador de una concepcion que entiende la casa como una prolongacion de su comportamiento. La tesis alcanza una serie de obras para ilustrar el conce`to de la casa de la diva, comenzando con la vivienda de la actriz Maria Guerrero, ubicada literalmente encima del teatro que en la actualidad lleva su nombre. A continuacion, tres casos permiten, a modo de introduccion, ver la metodologia empleada en la elaboracion de la tesis: las casas-estudios de la pareja diego Rivera y Frida Kahlo, la casa del matrimonio de Dolores del Rio y Cedric Gibbons y, finalmente, la casa de Billy Wilder. Son dos casos distintos a los ejemplos desarrollados con mayor profundidad en los cinco capitulos siguientes: son viviendas de matrimonios compuestos por dos divas. Por ultimo, la casa de Wilder permite el analisis del retrato hollywoodiense mas preciso de la diva, su vivienda y su contraparte en la vida del creador de este retrato. Todas las obras estudiadas, menos el ejemplo de la obra auto-construida por la Guerrero, emplean una arquitectura decididamente moderna dentro de su contexto historico. Manejan una arquitectura que cuestiona la definicion del hogar, la relacion entre espacio publico y espacio privado y reformula la composicion de la casa en su disposicion espacial. En el estudio de las casas ejemplares del as divas en los siguientes capitulos, el orden es cronologico y, salvo la primera, todas datan del siglo XX. La primera obra es el parisino Hotel Guimard, del arquitecto Claude-Nicolas Ledoux, construido en el siglo XVIII. Enlaza la investigacion con el origen de la arquitectura moderna, en el momento historico en que se codifico como disciplina. Las otras cuatro obras se analizan son: la casa para Josephine Baker de 1927 en Paris obra del arquitecto austriaco Adolf Loos; el atico para Charles de Beistegui en los Campos Eliseos de la misma ciudad, de 1930-1931 del suizo Le Corbusier; la casa para Josef Von Stemberg en Los Angeles, California en 1936 del tambien austriaco Richard Neutra y finalmente la Glass House disenada por Philip Johnson para Philip Johnson en New Canaan, Connecticut, construida en 1949. Estos cinco ejemplos siguen diferentes variantes de una arquitectura moderna, cada caso formula el concepto de un espacio domestico donde lo estrictamente privado deja de serlo, donde la cara publica del hogar toma un aspecto desproporcionado con las expectativas de la casa tradicional. Son cinco obras de arquitectos comprometidos con un concepto de modernidad, y permiten una lectura poliedrica que entrelaza una arquitectura que prima la representacion y no solo la funcion. Este analisis explicita la interrelacion entre la personalidad de la diva y la arquitectura dentro de un contexto sociologico y biografico, revelando tando sobre eltemperamento del ocupante como de la significacion de la construccion dentro de la obra del arquitecto. La construccion se nos muestra finalmente como una simbiosis entre personalidades, donde la teatralidad dinamiza y se convierte en signo del hogar.",

      "abstract": "Abstract How is it that pride has gone from being one of the traditional seven deadly sins to becoming, in recent decades, the banner under which social movements have declared their objectives (Black Pride, Gay Pride, and so on)? How are we to understand the shift from a theology of sin to a politics of self-assertion (and an accompanying psychology of self-esteem)? Is it simply that times have changed? That, God having died, attitudes have changed—so that what once was thought to precede a fall now seems a condition of rising? Or is it perhaps that the nature of pride is to be understood differently in the two contexts? There may be an inherent ambiguity in pride: associating it on the one hand with arrogance, conceit, egotism, and vanity, and on the other hand with self-respect, self-esteem, self-confidence, dignity. (On certain readings, these may all be seen as different kinds or degrees of self-love.) Thus at different times, different aspects of the nature of the emotion come to be given prominence. Or is the difference in the objects? One place to start is with the recognition that the object, and the subject, of the traditional sin was the individual. The social movements that argue for pride are concerned with groups. How do individual and group identity come together in pride?",

Rather than an opportunity for structure building, failure to achieve an empathic response intensifies the driven quality of self-pity, clinging behavior, and manipulation. Self-pity, dependence, and manipulation do not represent a retreat from forbidden sexual and aggressive wishes. Freud's work emphasized the negative transference to the analyst of what was hidden from and abhorrent to the patient. It is this which makes it possible to understand the meaning of self-pity, dependence, and exploitation not as defenses against aggressive and sexual striving but as a legitimate expression of needs and wishes for selfobject experience vital to growth.",

      "abstract": "The aesthetic appearance of beauty is intertwined with the experience of looking: and this opens up exciting paths for us to explore within the space of the complex dimensions of learning. The act of “taking something of beauty” (or something related to beauty, including its opposites) is driven by curiosity and desire but accompanied by a sense of fear and paralysis; that which attracts us may become monstruously or terribly beautiful, or – to draw on the lexicon of excess associated with beauty – “too beautiful”. There is a sort of unsustainability inherent in beauty. This text explores the dimension of envy, so understood, starting from its ethical declension, bordering with the dimension of justice; in this case, envious glance is rather a questioning look; it wonders, that's to say, how the merit of other's success happened. Envy produces questioning not as about the effects, as about processes. But often the destroying power of the envious glance reaches instead the need of an act of power (a visual one or trough the vision) of the action of other's beauty. It may be the subject of the educational relationship or the subject of learning. These declensions of the envious glance are analysed starting from literature, from myth and from the iconography connected to the power of looking.",

But the concept of mental health defined free from the disorders those are prolonged and panic in nature. As the concept of mental health is subjective in nature, it varies from person to person. Besides free from the disorders, a person should pose some of the other positive characteristics to deal with the society effectively.

Briefly, it can be said that positive mental health of the person make able to an individual to stand on his own two feet without making undue demands or impositions of others. In this regard the role of happiness in day to day life can make the individual more skilled to fight with different mental disorders. The present article is intended to find out the effects of happiness in day to day life in a social situation to deal with different mental disorders to make the individual mentally healthy and prosperous in life.",

There are, according to Sully,1different kinds of laughter, which may perhaps be classified into two general types: (1) the elementary type, unaccompanied by the perception of the ludicrous or laughable, and (2) forms accompanied by an intellectual discernment of the ludicrous or laughable in the object exciting laughter. The first type occurs mainly, though not entirely, in children.

It creates a problem in several ways. First,\nunlike body shame associated with disﬁgurements, skin diseases or body\nshape, it is experienced as an involuntary reaction. Second, awareness that one\nis blushing can intensify it; indeed, simply being told (correctly or not) that\none is blushing can induce a blush. Third, people can regard their blushing in\na negative light. Not only may they be anxious of how others evaluate them\nbecause they blush (external shame), they may interpret their dispositions to\nblush as a sign of personal weakness or evidence of social ineptness (internal\nshame). Both forms of shame can lead those who are susceptible to blush to\nengage in a variety of defensive or safety behaviours and avoid social situations in which blushing may occur. Such anxieties and defensive behaviours\ncan be heightened by the perceptions that blushing is beyond their conscious\ncontrol. Furthermore, as a blush begins attention can become more selffocused interfering with eﬀorts at social presentation and producing cognitive\noverload, which adds to anxiety, especially as other behaviours (e.g., speech\nﬂow) are interrupted (Rapee & Heimberg, 1997). As discussed below, these\nconcerns can lead people to seek professional help and there are a range of\npsychological and medical approaches to intervention.",

However, excessive earnestness is not necessarily repellent, and, as his biographer, I have adopted a neutral or non-critical approach when assessing his gestures at humour or his awkwardly playful relations with others. I have also tried to give him due credit for the successful construction of a personality open to feelings and sociability, qualities that were often missing in members of his family and in many of his acquaintances. While most people can be said to naturally possess a personality, Spencer consciously contrived one. This was a defensive move on his part; he was excessively sensitive and needed to fortify himself with the only capacity he possessed in abundance: the ability to scrutinize his own psyche and those of others. His personality, like his writings, was a creative achievement that gave him the standing to interact successfully with strangers. Since Spencer was aware of his limitations when relating to others, this also provided him with an analytical tool to compare the desires and sentiments of other individuals and societies with his own feelings. This was never cold; his psychological analysis did not reduce people to objective and impersonal data with no connection to himself.",

This essay attends to the ways in which what Peter Strawson first identified as the reactive emotions, including notably anger, resentment, and indignation, are key to making sense of both the shared and distinctive features of responsible human agency. Like human beings, other social animals express a range of reactive emotions in response to others’ conformity with or violation of implicit social expectations and norms; human beings sometimes reflect on these reactive attitudes and their justifiability, asking whether and when it is appropriate to hold others accountable, blame, and/or punish them. We should recognize that we often praise and blame others for attitudes and desires which they have not chosen and over which they have no direct control, and that this is appropriate.",

      "abstract": "Happiness is always a good for a person: even if a person lacks some other goods, material or spiritual, a person can be happy. We can say that happiness to some extent can compensate for the lack of certain goods. A person is unhappy not when one does not know his center and boundaries, but when one cannot have power over them. Happiness is not rather in the retention of goods, but in the free possession of them. This rule is emphasized by rare exceptions from it: these include a person's dependence on the good of communication with spiritually close ones, relatives, loved ones, friends. Happiness is not a constant escape, but rather a constant learning of happiness. Person uses his / her eccentricity to find his / her new center each time, not to lose it or lose faith in it. Changing one's borders is also not unlimited and completely arbitrary. All this must also be learned, because the loss of goods is also bitter, especially if involuntary or, moreover, against our will, and the loss of some goods is the loss of our very life – organic and / or spiritual. Happiness is in the unity of eccentricity and centripetal of some personality: in the constant rejection of the unchanging center and boundaries of one's personality and at the same time in the constant search and new discoveries that partially reaffirm this center and boundaries – but as a result of one's own choice.

      "title": "Discrimination Forms in the Professional Area 1",
      "abstract": "Relevant theoretical background for approaching the discrimination phenomenonDiscrimination (Latin discriminatio - separation) a concept closely related to the one of difference. The original meaning of separation has the significance of a neutral act, even a passive one of establishing a difference - which closely linked to the identification process. Territoriality the one determining individuals to notice the presence of a different being in their proximity and, in the identification process, to adopt an attitude against this being, either aggressive or non-aggressive. Hence, when a group, irrespective of the species, uses elements/signals of identification between its members and ones of differentiation against one or more individuals for adopting a certain delimitation attitude, we deal with discriminatory behaviour, which does not presuppose moral connotation. Thus, identity represents a posture adopted for the duration of an interaction, a possibility of an individual, (or of a group of individuals) to organise relationships against one another (...) From this perspective, the individual not perceived as determined by his belonging because he the one which gives a significance to the latter! (Ogien, 1987, p. 135)In the fifties, under the influence of social movements, the negative connotation developed with respect to the term of discrimination. The initial, neutral meaning, synonymous with the distinction, took over a pejorative connotation. Now, it about differentiation actions either abusively or illegally, by separating a social group and treating another in a disfavouring manner, one way or the other. At the same time, the term of non-discrimination emerges, with the entire associated conceptualisation.There are differences in the social contexts in which individuals practicing discrimination function. In the case of Europe, we might talk about a shared common definition of discrimination, and of its institutionalisation/regulation by laws, actions of repression taken by authorities against discriminatory acts. However, there are outside the democratic states, governments openly legitimising, in the name of morality, religion, or ideology, forms that we call discrimination. Examples therefore are the laws limiting fundamental liberties of women, or that deny the rights of indigenous people; it a type of discrimination depriving de facto individuals from the viewpoint of human rights. As result, defining discrimination related closely to the values of the societies. Some individuals may be discriminated based on the complex of elements constituting their identity, such as the case of an indigenous woman - she can be discriminated as woman, but also as person belonging to the indigenous populations.According to the sociologist Mihailescu loan (1993), discrimination represents difference, restriction, exclusion, preference or differing treatment which disadvantages an individual/group, as compared to others in the same situations, or the use of unequal treatment against a person or against a group of persons in relationship with other categorical features: racial, ethnic or religious belonging, or class attachment. The term is used for describing the action of a dominant majority in relationship with a minority and involves a prejudice caused to an individual or to a (Mihailescu I., in Zamfir and Vlasceanu, 1993, p. 177).The discrimination represents, consequently, the differentiated treatment applied to an individual by its inclusion into a certain social group. Discrimination an individual action, but if the members of the same group are treated similarly, then it represents a social model of collective behaviour (Banton, 1998). In social sciences, the term refers to the differentiated treatment against the large majority, with negative effects on the individual exposed to it.The United Nations Organisation includes in discrimination any conduct based on the distinction operated in relationship with certain natural and social categories and which not related to the individual capacities and merits, or to the actual behaviour of an individual. …",

But no matter how positive the response, his own sense of worthlessness means he cannot be satisfied, so he continues to seek new audiences who will give him the attention and recognition he craves. To become attractive to more and more people, our mean man works to convey a sense of grandeur, omnipotence, and strength and, in doing so, becomes attractive to those seeking this idealized source of power. In the follower's reaction, we recognize a complementary theory that explores how these men attract ideal-hungry followers. It may explain why so many of us are not only willing but eager to follow and idealize the mean man. If this makes the followers sound like they are under a spell, that's not entirely accurate.",

Although, at a first glance, focusing on leveling and affirmation of individualism may appear contradictory concepts, power of first one and utopia of second one get on together fairly well and for a long time. The condition of history may seem a serious matter only for one who pays too much attention human values, spirituality by which, as it is said, a person goes beyond any other form of life. Such a man is confused and disappointed in finding out how one who should like him becomes more and more opposite a subject, a weak self and unaware of real conditions of his existence, who wanders about without stability, without an aim, without specific features.1Quite often, a man has come identify himself with an image. He forgets that life means also privacy, that real way of living implies privacy. He has transformed himself into somebody placed under curious eye of public, used being somebody only in service of this public. Thus, his desire remain alone with himself diminishes and profound beliefs of existence do not tell him too much. The real individual neglects fact that, finally, each person has accept himself, with beauties he nourishes and with his personal frustrations, make peace with himself after having made his own choices, with meanness and goodness he transmits. Nobody can escape from himself, no matter how unconsciously and deeply absorbed he may by his image, by his celebrity. There will come, without doubt, some sporadic moments become conscious, draw balance sheet of regrets, remorse, joys, fulfillment etc.I come back say that everything that is most precious in a man's life are singular beliefs, values nourished and private experiences. To be and to have. To be is linked privacy and quality, to refers public space and quantity. Celebrity could understood as a to which replaces to be. Quite often, a person does not know any more that he has become an image, that he fails live in favour of mimicking living. Existence should placed under a question mark when the outside has tendency replace inside, when privacy of spirit with itself is no longer a need or has changed into something unknown, when, from point of view of value, there is no distinction between quality and quantity, when hollow individual is cultivated and not person, a substantial existence which takes care of spirit.Celebrity is looked for, is desired, envied by others, it is a fashion of present time, although its greatest risk is miss really important things. Being concerned polish your own image, you forget that you take care of an image and that any image is a limitation spiritual power. The few ones who value profound ego of privacy, with its crucial, extreme experiences, for whom there is no distance between theory and practice, who make an effort live in agreement with what they are thinking, being perfectly aware that only in this way they are honest themselves and life given them, on other hand, they dedicate themselves a troublesome and continuous struggle.It is much harder your own person or dominated by understanding and mentality of masses than yourself, evaluate yourself consciously, endeavor with honesty improve your ego, simply follow your destiny according your own singular beliefs. Neither intelligence nor culture can relevantly serve you if you have not previously assumed freedom and courage yourself in spite of anything else.Nevertheless, tendency existing in society leveling people's tastes, sticking a certain fashion are in a close interdependence with creation of illusion of individual freedom2. …",

Psychological and physical contact with the object of such communication is a self-sufficient goal for the subject. The emotional-dispositional basis of his motivation is all kinds of love and amicability. Deprivation of communication causes serious damage to the mental health of almost all people. Therefore, communication is a basic condition and a way of normal functioning of human conscious ability, the main factor of mental development of speech as a basis for this ability of infants and young children, who desperately need communication, full of expressive manifestations of love and tenderness. Children, who suffer from the deprivation of such communication, noticeably lag behind in development: their own speech and understanding of what is addressed to them, intelligence, self-awareness, adequate emotionality, social activity and adaptability. Mechanisms of social-psychological interaction are gradually “connected” to the process of intuitive “interiorization” of infants and young children, the essence of which is that in the noems of the subject’s conscious ability, the attitude to him, to other people, to the world of authoritative and referent for him individuals and groups is reflected. The most powerful subjective factor of the effectiveness of a child’s personal development is authentic activity through the volitional effort required to follow the rules of the game that attracts and captures it. Children benevolently accept the restrictions required by the rules of the game and are happy to follow them, because these are the conditions for testing their mental and somatic life potential, because in the process of the game «play» the vital forces of the child that please her. Such pleasure is the emotional-motivational basis of any real game and the deep foundation of the psychological affinity of game self-limitation and self-overcoming with the morality and spirituality of a personality, and thus a subjective factor in the development of his spiritual-moral conscious ability. At the same time, its aesthetic sensitivity develops due to the fact that the rules of the game form the harmonious system that gives the aesthetic impression of the beauty of the game. The deep basis of motivation of artistic-figurative activity (creation and perception of works of art) is a secret human desire – freedom of spirit, liberation from the shackles of its biological and social “handcuff”. Therefore, the ideological-emotional core of the images of high art is the freedom-loving human spirit, which is subject to the urges caused by the biological nature of human and social taboos and imperatives that oppress him. In the process of artistic-figurative activity, the subject empathically identifies with the struggles of the spirit of the art works’ heroes. These empathic shifts of one’s own spiritual-moral ability delight the subject, who develops the emotional-dispositional foundations of corresponding noems of his conscious ability. Cognition requires a serious attitude and hard work, which is most motivated by interest in its content. An effective way of such interest is the game psychological content of teaching. In general, the question of including the game into cognitive activity makes sense only as a fulfillment of the learning process with game psychological content. To organically combine the hard efforts of students, which requires knowledge and assimilation of scientific truths and spiritual values with game attractiveness - is not easy, but possible, especially concerning subjects of artistic-aesthetic cycle due to the semantic affinity of motivation of game and artistic-figurative activities. A necessary condition for the humanistic mission of sport is that it must be a noble competition, that is, a real game.",

The first is the distinguishing mark of the human being as a sensible or natural being; the second is the distinguishing mark of the human being as a rational being endowed with freedom. The man of principles, from whom one knows what to expect, not from his instinct, for example, but from his will, has a character. – Therefore in the Characteristic one can, without tautology, divide what belongs to a human being's faculty of desire (what is practical) into what is characteristic in a) his natural aptitude or natural predisposition, b) his temperament or sensibility, and c) his character purely and simply, or way of thinking. – The first two predispositions indicate what can be made of the human being; the last (moral) predisposition indicates what he is prepared to make of himself.",

      "title": "Emotional tears: What they are and how they work",
      "abstract": "Tears serve ophthalmic functions: They lubricate, nourish, and protect the cornea. Tearers produce tears non-permanently and at relatively low cost. And observers pay attention to the eyes of others and extract from eyes and faces a lot of information about others’ stable and transient characteristics, including their mental states. These background conditions may have led to the evolution in the human lineage of additional signaling functions in tears. Emotional tearing occurs during negative events (e.g., injuries) and positive events (e.g., achievements). Episodes of tearing appear to be united by tearers’ subjective imputation of negative or positive value to certain internal or external events. Knowing the degree to which things enhance or diminish one’s prospects—the value of things—is a pressing matter for humans and other organisms. Value information is produced for internal consumption, to be used by behavior-regulating mechanisms in the focal individual. But some value information is made available, in addition, to other people, through tearing and other forms of verbal and non-verbal communication. Tearing may function as an implicit plea for receivers to minimize the costs imposed on the tearer by nature, by third-parties, or by the receivers themselves—common when the tearer has lower formidability or wherewithal than receivers do. In addition, tearing may exhort receivers to infer and register which things the tearer values, positively or negatively. Here, we characterize tears, describe the game-theoretic logic of bargaining from a position of weakness, outline the computational systems that regulate the production of and responses to emotional tears, and review findings about emotional tearing that are relevant to the signaling hypothesis.",

      "abstract": "In ‘Virtue and Character’ A. D. M. Walker claims that kindness and justice are incompatible in certain important ways and that a person can be kind or just without possessing the other virtue. Walker argues that virtues must lead to ‘effective and intelligent action’ and that a virtue ceases to exist if ‘it leads to violation of the minimal requirements of any other virtue’. On this view kindness and justice function independently to produce effective action. Kindness requires a direct caring for the individual in particular circumstances, while justice involves a commitment to impartiality that abstracts from an individual's situation. Walker argues that, as long as the minimal requirements of other virtues are met, one can be kind without weighing considerations of justice. He cites with approval kind behaviour which human beings learn as young children. Such behaviour may be a deeply engrained personality trait, and the individual passing through different situations in life may have no need to consider questions of justice. ‘He will merely need to be able to recognize and respond to certain types of considerations as overriding the values promoted by kindness’.",

On the other hand, we wonder whether in this preoccupation we might be missing something of fundamental importance. Empirical scientists tell us that what we call “thinking for ourselves” is really just another causally determined process in nature; skeptics tell us that we have no reason to think that thought of this kind can give us access to reality; post-modernists tell us that the subject or the self, itself, is an illusion; defenders of “traditional values” tell us that there is nothing to deter a subject or a self that sets its authority above that of tradition from disregarding the rights and interests of others; and religious thinkers tell us that insistence on one's own freedom and independence may prevent one from experiencing the affiliation with reality as a whole, and the resulting meaning, value, and identity, that can be found through a relationship with God.

      "title": "Prosocial Behavior",
      "abstract": "Social psychologists invented the concept of prosocial behavior to characterize a range of voluntary actions that benefit the welfare of others. Because prosocial behavior is socially defined, its specific nature may differ across societies or by situations. For example, the widespread norm, “Thou shall not kill,” does not apply on the battlefield where killing may be rewarded with praise and medals. Prosocial behavior is consistent with social norms and provides a convenient antonym for antisocial behavior, or non‐normative behaviors such as crime and most forms of aggression. Helping is a prosocial subtype and refers to any behavior that has positive consequences for another. The helper's motivation may be altruistic or egoistic. Altruism is a special form of helping. The altruist is motivated by the ultimate goal of improving another's well‐being regardless of possible personal costs. Although the altruist may garner rewards in the act of helping, this does not preclude the altruistic intent. In contrast, egoistic responses are self‐serving and motivated by the desire to improve one's own welfare. The connection between altruism and prosocial behavior varies. Prosocial behavior will not always be altruistically motivated, and altruistic motivation will not always generate prosocial behavior (Batson 1991).",

One set of virtues which comes into consideration are generosity, beneficence, and justice, with the focus perhaps, on welfare and rights. In Hume's words, a mind will never be able to bear its own survey, that has been wanting in its part to mankind and society.' In less definite way, virtues benefit self too (as Hume himself argues), and some benefit self directly, even though those same virtues may on other occasions be directed toward others. An individual may act with courage in the face of horrible disease or in circumstances which threaten morale and make suicide seem an attractive escape. Non-deception, temperance, and respect each can focus on self in ways that are morally admirable and praiseworthy. Equally, virtues focused on others may be said to have indirect benefit to their possessors, in the sense that they enhance their moral perfection. Put differently, we tend to think of virtues as self and other-regarding, and indeed in general, think of morality as matter of how we attend to individuals, whether it be ourselves or others, and in the case of others, strangers or loved ones, sometimes with regard to numbers, sometimes not. The preoccupation in contemporary moral literature with self/other asymmetries, with perspectives that break away from the agent neutrality of consequentialism, presuppose the same general worries about what we owe self and what we owe other.2 Appeal to the importance of giving due regard, sometimes moral, sometimes prudential, to self in distinction from others again echoes that",

For one thing, thinking about affect can change what counts as material and what material might do. I am using word material in psychoanalytic sense to mean the patient's words and behaviour as a whole, in so far as they offer a sort of raw material for interpretations and constructions.1 Affect is part of what an analyst or critic considers in order to build a convincing interpretation (of a lived scene, of a literary or cultural text): one sign that I am performing a good reading or interpreting well is if this reading helps me to understand why I feel a certain way, or why a text makes me feel this way. This is especially case if a feeling is counterintuitive or perverse in sense that it undermines or is simply outside of what I recognize to be my own desires or wishes. Affects or feelings fit psychoanalytic bill perfectly when they are felt to be, as Laplanche and Pontalis put it, somewhat alien ... as far as conscious subject is concerned (246); when they are considered incommensurate with [a subject's] conscious motives (246), they become material for analysis, symptomatic of unconscious wishes, for example, or structures.",

      "abstract": "KING LEAR NOTORIOUSLY MAKES case that to be naked, unadorned, or unaccommodated is, literally, to not-be; like unreal number zero, such a is O without a figure.(1) Though this logic arguably covers anybody, Lear's own case in matter of investiture is special: as king he is invested with an or dignity, period's idiom for what we might call an official capacity. This essay will consider material relations (cloth rites as well as social interactions) involved in adorning a into--or out of--being.(2) In particular, it will assess early modern formulations of what we still term figures.(3) The person (often sense of term the great) maintains a juridical status apart from private persons. So instead of primarily viewing a public/private split as occurring within a single self, early modern English culture seems largely to understand it as separating categorically different forms of personage. Aemilia Lanyer, for example, construed the great as those who placed in ... Orbes of State, apart from others who might wish to be near them; Francis Bacon devoted an essay entitled Of Great Place to this status or class.(4) Public personage enjoys, of course, a special relation to clothing and costuming. In Twelfth Night, when Malvolio believes in his own sudden, apparent access to (some are born great, some achieve greatness, and some have greatness thrust upon 'em), he determines both to adopt fashions of going yellow-stockinged and cross-gartered and to spout arguments of state and read politic authors (3.1. 138, 148). Greatness, like clothes, is put in Malvolio's account. Ceremonies of investiture often establish an individual with marks of place. But it is not simply a matter of wearing the robes of office--we also see a fascination with social interactions that transfer robes and with their status as borrowed attire. Shakespearean examples abound and emphasize office-holding as temporary possession of a loaned garment. Lear himself compounds his divestiture of royal estate with Off, off, you lendings / Come, unbutton here (3.4.103); Duke in Measure for Measure, deputing powers to his substitute, has lent him our terror [severity], dressed him with our love [mercy] (1.1.19). Against our quotidian sense of dressing oneself, in one's own clothes, what does it mean to be formally dressed in or stripped of borrowed clothes--by someone else? Instead of reviewing an instance of political divestiture, I propose to assess an episode in John Foxe's Book of Martyrs: degrading of Nicolas Ridley and executions of Ridley and Hugh Latimer on same day in 1555 under Marian prosecution of Protestants. Foxe's narration of these cases provides special interest for three reasons. Ridley's divestiture(5) reflects originally ecclesiastical jurisprudence underlying the king's two bodies theory of relation between a mortal and perpetual office, a decretal known as Quoniam abbas.(6) But unlike this relatively esoteric legal rule, incident was public and theatrical; its dissemination in Foxe's martyrology further established story in, at once, both popular and national culture.(7) Perhaps most interestingly, though, we see ceremony of divestiture juxtaposed with other strategies and semiotics of dress. Specifically, Foxe's text stages a powerful, though ultimately incomplete, contestation of power of clothes either to confer or cancel personage. Against a doctrine of institutional and legal office materially effected by rites of dress, Foxe sets a Protestant semiotic of (only virtual) nakedness as a competing theory of relation of clothes to persons. But either way, personage is specified through events that are physically interactive and that depend on cloth transactions. Foxe's prose, like George Cavendish's Life of Wolsey or Edward Hall's History of Noble Houses of Lancaster and York, records an inventorying fabric sense that immediately notifies modern reader of poverty of his or her vocabularies for cloth. …",

      "title": "Unique cognitive and emotional profiles of interpersonal gratitude and spiritual gratitude",
      "abstract": "ABSTRACTGratitude is a prototypical emotional response when life's blessings come from the intentional goodwill of other people, but many also attribute good experiences to the intervention of God, gods, a Higher Power, or other benevolent spiritual forces. This study investigated the differences between how United States participants (N = 610) experience interpersonal gratitude and spiritual gratitude. Compared to interpersonal gratitude, spiritual gratitude experiences were less often attributed to human action, more often attributed to supernatural beings and circumstances beyond human control, and elicited significantly less feelings of gratitude, indebtedness, and admiration, but greater awe. Participants reported the highest feelings of gratitude when they also believed in a personal God with a benevolent mind. These findings demonstrate the importance of perceiving benevolent agency in evoking feelings of gratitude, whereas experiences that are attributed to more abstract, less personified, or less external entities elicit a different profile of positive emotional responses.KEYWORDS: Godspiritualitygratitudeexternal attributions Disclosure statementNo potential conflict of interest was reported by the author(s).Supplementary materialSupplemental data for this article can be accessed online at https://doi.org/10.1080/17439760.2023.2239781Data availabilityAll data and analysis code for this article is available at https://osf.io/5dyhg/Open scholarship This article has earned the Center for Open Science badges for Open Data, Open Materials and Preregistered.

      "title": "The Purpose of Personal Value",
      "abstract": "It seems as if there are things that have what we might call personal value—special objects, artwork by our children, etc. This term is meant to mark a difference between things whose value seems tied to a particular person, as opposed to things (like the Mona Lisa) that are valuable, period. The concept of personal value hasn’t received much focused attention, but I believe that it is of not only theoretical, but practical importance. In this paper, I explore the practical angle, arguing that personal value is important to our ability to make sense of ourselves. I give several desiderata for an account of personal value, and use examples to raise questions for Toni Ronnow-Rasmussen’s recent analysis of personal value. This practical stance leads me to offer an amendment to this analysis. It seems as though some things have what we might call personal value. That is, their value seems particularly tied to a specific person in a way that other valuable things are not. That is, the value of things like your favorite mug or your child’s scribbly drawing seems different from the value of the Mona Lisa and social justice. The former don’t have much (if any) value in the grand scheme of things, but the latter do. But we wouldn’t want to say that your favorite mug isn’t valuable; it might have quite a bit of value to you. This difference hasn’t received much concentrated attention in philosophical literature, but I think it is of not only theoretical, but practical interest. It is the practical angle I wish to explore in this paper. In particular, I want to argue that the purpose of a notion of personal value is to help us sort what is important to us from what is not—and that we need this concept in order to make sense of our lives. A sense of the practical significance of the notion should, then, shape an account of it, and at the end of the paper I offer some suggestions toward this end. To get directly to the point, I claim that the reason we need a notion of personal value is that impersonal value is pervasive and overwhelming and we can’t adequately respond to it all. One way to think of the problem that hoarders have is that they have difficulty letting things go because they not only recognize value in the most mundane objects, but also have an overdeveloped sense of responsibility to respond to that value—in particular, by possessing and keeping the objects. But hoarding is just an extreme case of clutter, which is (so I think) the result of a tendency most of us have: the tendency to appreciate value. This is a basic fact of life. Creatures as sophisticated as we are have cognitive and emotional capacities that are deeply intertwined, and which allow for a great deal of nuance in our perception, recognition, and 1 Cite Bennett Helm. 2 appreciation of value. We find value in things beyond those that satisfy our basic needs; we are uplifted by sunsets, we fight for freedom and justice, we care about other people. In this sense, we think that there are things that matter, period. This mattering doesn’t have to be grand; things can matter in minor ways, for instance by being useful for everyday life (as, for instance, can openers are). These things that matter have impersonal value, that is, value that is not specifically related to particular valuers, or that we value without reference to anything or anyone else. In addition to the many specific valuing attitudes, we are capable of a great many different actions in response to the recognition of value. For instance, considering just one example, recognition of the value of art can range from believing that art is a good thing, to visiting art museums, to collecting art, to lobbying for legislation to fund the National Endowment for the Arts. Given the enormous range of objects in the world (including abstract ones like justice), their manifold shades of significance, and the wide range of appropriate responses to this significance, the world should seem overwhelmingly full of value, much the way it is overwhelmingly full of light, color and noise to a newborn baby. But it doesn’t. Just as a baby learns to focus attention and differentiate objects from one another, we learn to focus our valuing and concentrate on just some of the value in the world, adopting it as our own. We take out a stake in it, so to speak. This attachment to some valuable things is what makes it possible to operate successfully in the world. So we can think of personal value as a kind of attention: it helps us to pick out of the “blooming, buzzing confusion” the things that matter most to us. This serves in contexts as concrete as clearing out the clutter in our living and working spaces, or as broad and abstract as the architecture of our personal lives, and on many levels in between. To begin to understand the idea of personal value, let’s look at a sample of things that seem, at least on the surface, to have it. My favorite example is my raggedy old stuffed pink rabbit Pete. He was my favorite toy when I was a child, and as a result his fur is worn off and his tail is hanging by a thread; surely no one who didn’t know me would find him valuable, and the only reason that those who do know me will value him is derived from my valuing him. He is something that has virtually no impersonal value, but a great deal of personal value. He has what we often term “sentimental” value. What else can have personal value? The laptop I’m using to write this has a great deal of personal value to me, but it is not at all like Pete’s sentimental value. This computer contains files that are important to me for both personal and professional reasons. Although my important files are backed up, the loss of this computer would be quite significant, because it is an important tool that I use nearly all the time. But unlike Pete, nothing hinges on its being this particular computer. I could, with reasonable ease, transfer all of the files that matter to me to another computer. Then that computer would take on the significance that this one has. What matters is that I have a computer, not that I have this computer. The photograph of stones under the rippling water of Lake Superior that hangs above our kitchen table also has personal value to me. There are a number of reasons for this, but the one I want to highlight has to do with the fact that I find it visually appealing. Again, unlike Pete, nothing",

      "title": "Modern Applications of Hibah in the Light of Shari'ah Objectives of Gift and Donation Contracts (Al-Tabarru'at)",
      "abstract": "TABARRU'AT (GIFTS AND CHARITABLE ACTS) The term tabarru' (pl. tabarru'at) is derived from the root b-r-', meaning excel. For instance, He excelled in knowledge, courage, or other qualities; or excelled his companions in knowledge; or was, or became accomplished; perfect or complete, in every excellence, and in goodness. (1) Tabarru' bil-'ata' means, he gave what was not incumbent or obligatory on him; gave supererogatorily; or gave gratuitously, unasked, or unbidden. The jurists, taking into consideration the basic linguistic meanings and the essence projected by wasiyyah, waqf, hibah, 'ariyah, qard and other similar contracts derive the technical meaning of tabarru' as, contract which extends wealth or its benefit to others, immediately or in the future, without desiring a compensation and with the intention of doing a pious deed (bi qasd al-birr wal-ma'ruf). This definition presents tabarru' contract as the genus and places wassiyah, waqf, and the like as its sub-contracts (anwa'). Tabarru'at, inclusive of its sub-contracts, are acts of piety and charity. (2) This is grounded in Q 5: 2: Help ye one another in righteousness and piety, but help ye not one another in sin and rancor: Fear Allah. For Allah is strict in punishment. The Qur'an commentator, al-Jassas al-Razi (d. 369/980) elaborates: The verse enjoins every Muslim to support another in all types of acts which come under piety. (3) Acts of charity that support each other either in kind or cash or in any other form of benefit are part and parcel of piety. Another verse (Q 2:180) states: It is prescribed, when death approaches any of you, if leave any goods, that make a bequest to parents and next of kin, according to reasonable usage; this is due from the God-fearing. Even though the verse is specifically on the topic of bequest (wassiyah), it sheds light on the essence of tabarru'at. The verse encourages the dying person to consider his or her parents and next of kin in the spirit of love. The person is advised to allocate certain amount for parents and next of kin from his or her property without asking for anything in return. The spirit in tabarru'at is to share wealth and benefit others because of love and not because of personal gain. Tabarru'at is about caring for each other. Another verse of the Qur'an emphasizes that righteousness is not about performing salutary regulations only, but it is also about caring for each other. With the salutary regulations, a righteous man should strive for love of Allah and the love for his fellow-men: It is not righteousness that ye turn your faces towards east or west; but it is righteousness to believe in Allah and the Last Day, and the angels, and the Book, and the Messengers; to spend of your substance, out of love for Him, for your kin, for orphans, for the needy, for the wayfarer, for those who ask, and for the ransom of slaves; to be steadfast in prayer, and practice regular charity; to fulfil the contracts which ye have made; and to be firm and patient, in pain (or suffering) and adversity, and throughout all periods of panic. Such are the people of truth, the God-fearing. (4) In this verse, extending assistance to kin, orphans, needy, wayfarer, beggars, and slaves are all considered as acts of piety, providing that the assistance rendered should proceed from love and no other motive. Hadiths also shed light on the importance of tabarru'at. Jurists present tahaddu tahhabbu (exchange gifts so that you may love one another) (5) as the principle source on which the legality of Hibah is based. This hadith touches upon the essence of tabarru'at, which is to give gifts to friends and relatives out of love. The legality of tabarru'at is established through consensus as well; the Muslim ummah agree on it to be a pious act. (6) In order to perform acts of tabarru'at as a contract, a Muslim has to deal with its components (arkan). …",

After preregistering key hypotheses, we did an Internet survey of 1078 U.S. adults focused on a recent positive event. Even when controlling religiousness and God belief, GTG was strongly related to divine attributions for the event, which seemed more plausible when God was seen as powerful and loving and when divine attribution made the event seem more meaningful. In addition to these cognitive judgments, divine attributions and GTG were linked with desire: wanting to see God as a cause. Relationally, GTG was associated with seeing God's intentions as positive (trying to help, love, comfort, encourage, or protect), with actually feeling loved, cherished, valued, or appreciated by God in response, and with seeing the event as a divine gift – a perception more likely when people saw God as a gift-giver: giving gifts often to many people, including themselves.",

The transcendental quest of establishing identity with the nonmaterial and the spiritual realm of experience sees life span and physical existence as a preparatory phase for the purpose of launching the soul onto the everlasting spiritual life. Even the devoutly faithful spiritual leaders are subject to varieties of deviation, doubt, confusion, denial, ambivalence, or vacillation in their sense of certainty.

      "abstract": "A man can't live with stability if he is isolated. Between himself and others, he has interactions, and through repetition of them he tries to be a member of a small group consisted of himself and others.When he finds himself in this group, he attains stability through the union of his true individual self with the group. With the stability of this base, he can face other new external objects in a positive way. In this sense, a small group is essential support to one's stability.It is the level of interactions between them that decides the degree of forming of a small group. One of the most primary interaction is, I think, the recognition and the perceptiveness between oneself and the others.There are four such levels:1) Self-need centered levelThe main purpose is to satisfy one's own wants mutually. When one's wants have been satisfied, interactions are finished. The most important point in this level is the result of the others action. Recognition and perceptiveness to others are not necessary. At this level there are interactions, but the group is not yet formed.2) Subjective levelThrough repetition of interactions, recognition and receptiveness are met. But, there is some subjective bias from which some confusion springs on the way to forming a group. This subjective bias results chiefly from the individuals self-defense and individuality synthesis.3) Objective levelUsually what is called the scientific method. It selects and catches from the others phenomena which can be reasonably applicable to a certain general standard. It is apt to neglect the synthetic function of the others as a whole. So they can't get sufficient recognition and receptiveness to others. As a result, forming a group is limited.4) Emphathetic levelThis is the method by which we recognize and recieve the whole synthetic function as it is, understanding the others not as the objects but as the subjects. When an interaction is done by this method, it will get deeper and it becomes more reasonable to understand each other as a human. The common domain of the Recognition and Receptiveness shows the maximum expantion. Here, the small group becomes the most mature one.In the practical formations of small groups, these levels are partly overlapped by each other. But this classification will give an effective method for the analysis and appreciation of a group and to the educational and critical direction to make a group mature. It also suggests that in studies about human, human-relations, and a group, the subjective synthesis function should be put at the center.",

      "title": "Mindful Belief: Accountability, Expertise and Cognitive Kinds",
      "abstract": "Abstract: It is sometimes said that humans are unlike other animals in at least one crucial respect. We do not simply form beliefs, desires and other mental states, but are capable of caring about our mental states in a distinctive way. We can care about the justification of our beliefs, and about the desirability of our desires. This kind of observation is usually made in discussions of free will and moral responsibility. But it has profound consequences, or so I shall argue, for our conception of the very nature of beliefs and other mental states. Suitably developed, it allows us to draw a line between two distinct ways in which a creature may possess a belief, represent a scene, and fall into error. The first way (which I shall call the ‘mindless’ way) involves little more than an encoding of information in some way designed to guide appropriate response. This is the common heritage of humans, and many other animals. The second way (which I shall call the ‘mindful’ way) requires that the creature be capable in addition of a special kind of second‐order reflection, and (importantly) be expert at detecting the kinds of situation in which such reflection is called for. The differences between these two ways of ‘believing that P’ are sufficiently deep and significant to warrant (or so I claim) our treating them as two distinct classes of mental states. For it is only courtesy of the second layer of complexity, I shall argue, that it becomes proper to hold someone accountable for their beliefs or other mental states, and it is this fact of (something like) accountability that in turn raises the most significant challenge for philosophical attempts to give naturalized accounts of meaning, belief, and mentality.",

      "title": "Reactions to Predictive Assumptions",
      "abstract": "D efinition. By the phrase are gathered together any and all expressions of attitude and opinion which have a predictive character, or represent a readiness to act on the assumption of some probability. There is a blending or linkage between various kinds of predictive assumptions, which makes almost interchangeable the terms used to describe them. Predictive assumptions include expectant attitudes, gestures (significant incipient acts), prejudices, curses, hypotheses, prognoses, reputations, stereotypes, epithets, conceptions of role, definitions of the situation, myths. Let us suggest further the common denominators of these states of mind. Analysis. It would seem that one of the earliest, because inevitable, effects of those modes of mentation which we call imagination, objectification, self-consciousness, foresight, etc., must have been to produce in human beings reactions to their own (or others' communicated) definitions of situations. Men responded to their own ideas or images of the projected future. These reactions would, of course, take the form of positive (accelerative) or negative (avoidance) responses-both attitudes and overt behaviorsaccording as the prospect predicted seemed desirable or undesirable; and the processes of evaluation and reaction toward their own (or others') expectations or curses would be a factor in the fulfillment or nonfulfillment thereof. For present purposes, it was realized that the significant points for distinctions and classifications are whether the predictive assumption is (i) in opposition to, or (2) in accordance with, the wishes of those who are to do the responding. An epithet always has its opposite. A reputation for doing something can always be rephrased as avoidance of something else. A prediction can be couched in negative or positive terms. The actual responses and results may similarly be described negatively or positively,' depending upon the emphasis in one's attention at the time. In either case behavior has occurred. Negative and positive are verbalized relativities. On the biophysical level (the unconscious) there is no negative or positive.2",

      "abstract": "According to a popular view charity is reduced to mercy and benevolence. Through an exploration of traditional, Christian, charitable acts – both corporeal and spiritual in nature – I set out to develop an alternative view. Why, for example, is the simple act of laying the dead to rest considered an act of charity? Feelings of pity and commiseration offer an insufficiently firm basis for justifying such an attribution. By adopting the burial of the dead as a sort of touchstone, I suggest that the (corporeally or spiritually) indigent other finds him- or herself in need of charity at the precise moment that he or she loses the ability to react as a person. Sometimes being charitable comes to expression in relinquishing one’s demands that the other behave as morally responsible people ought to behave. Charity involves the question of how to bear the other’s ‘transcendence’.",

Many animals (invertebrates, very young or very old animals) as well as some humans (infants, severely impaired individuals) do not conform to them. To provide an alternative model, animal ethics can be rooted in vulnerability as foundational ethical category. Instead of cognitive capacities that occasionally form a high threshold for a moral status, the universally shared dependency and injurability of bodily beings comes to the fore. However, vulnerability is not a mere fact but socially mediated. Any kind of perception of vulnerability – and of responsiveness to it – are predetermined by a selective moral infrastructure that reveals certain vulnerabilities (e.g. of companion animals) while concealing others (e.g. livestock animals). Yet we are not fully determined by this infrastructure and can criticize hegemonic frames of perceiving and treating animals though we are never outside those structures that frame animals.",

      "abstract": "Dignity highlights value, honesty, moral merits, the degree of appreciation as well as a person’s rank in society. In Christian teaching, human dignity is regarded as a divine gift that whatever the circumstances in which the person lives, takes God’s given Model as an example of life and attitude. Term form of dignity in a society can also be understood as the autonomy and freedom of thought as well as the behavior of an individual. Human dignity is very much linked to the sense of honor because a worthy man always inspires respect both to himself and to those around him, to his values and the values of others.1 Thus, the term dignity means the quality to be worthy, prestige, moral authority, dignified attitude, greatness and self–esteem. When talking about the esteem granted to a person we must understand the respect and consideration for human worth and dignity of each person in itself. Dignity cannot be represented without honesty, responsibility, fairness, courage, duty, honesty, etc., values which it integrates. The disregard of the human being, regardless of the reasons from which it springs, brings damages to human dignity, and as such must be regarded as inhuman and reprehensible acts. Human dignity requires the credit or trust that should be given to each person.  KEY WORDS: worth, dignity, human condition, humanistic conceptions, virtue, honesty, respect, responsibility, moral authority.",

Extrinsic final value, which accrues to things (or persons) in virtue of their relational rather than internal features, cannot be traced back to the intrinsic value of states that involve these things together with their relations. On the contrary, such states, insofar as they are valuable at all, derive their value from the things involved. The endeavour to reduce thing-values to state-values is largely motivated by a mistaken belief that appropriate responses to value must consist in preferring and/or promoting. A pluralist approach to value analysis obviates the need for reduction: the final value of a thing or person can be given an independent interpretation in terms of the appropriate thing- or person-oriented responses: admiration, love, respect, protection, care, cherishing, etc.",

In situations in which a person is deprived of the possibility of achieving a certain purpose he can, all the same, demonstrate his own moral attitude without being obliged to do so according to usual moral standards. Through such conduct he can, in a way transcending his duty, symbolize, on the one hand, his altruistic attitude, on the other hand, his personal ideals.",

      "title": "The Life Mission Theory II. The Structure of the Life Purpose and the Ego",
      "abstract": "Pursuing your life mission is often very difficult, and many frustrations are experienced along the way. Major failures to bring out our potential can cause us considerable emotional pain. When this pain is unbearable, we are induced to shift from one intention and talent to another that better allows us to adapt and survive. Thus, we become set on a course that brings out a secondary or tertiary talent instead of the primary talent. This talent displacement may be expressed as a loss of our true nature or true self. The new purpose in life now functions as the core of a new personality: the ego. The ego has a structure similar to that of the true self. It is anchored in a talent and it draws on subtalents. But the person who is centered in his or her ego is not as powerful or talented as the person he or she originally was, living the primary purpose of life. This is because the original personality (the true self or “higher self”) is still there, active and alive, behind the ego. Symptoms, disorders, and diseases may be explained by the loss of energy, joy in life, and intuitive competence because of inner conflicts, which may be alleviated or cured in the salutogenetic process of Antonovsky that helps patients find their sense of coherence or their primary purpose in life. Many cases of reduced ability to function, physically as well as psychologically, socially or sexually, can also be explained and alleviated in this way. When a person discovers his true talent and begins to use it with dedication, privately as well as professionally, his life will flourish and he may overcome even serious disease and great adversity in life. The salutogenetic process can also be called personal development or “quality of life as medicine”. It is important to note that the plan for personal development laid out by this theory is a plan not for the elimination of the ego, but for its cultivation. An existentially sound person still has a mental ego of course, but it is centered on the optimal verbal expression of the life mission. Such an ego is not in conflict with one�s true self, but supports the life and wholeness of the person, although in an invisible and seamless way. The more developed the person, the more talents are taken into use. So although the core of existence remains the same throughout life, the healthy person continues to grow. As the number of talents we can call on is unlimited, the journey ends only at death. Understanding the concept of the ego, it is very easy for the physician to motivate the patient to go through a lot of difficulties in order to grow and develop, and when the patient fully understands the concept of the ego and the true self (higher self), the patient gets a strong feeling of direction in personal development, and a motivation to fight the internal obstacles for quality of life, health, and the ability to function.",

      "abstract": "To possess the virtue of honesty or kindness, it is not enough to act sometimes in honest or kind ways. Virtues, like character traits in general, are standing properties of agents that explain their actions. Over the past decade or so, philosophers have debated whether the findings of experimental social psychology undermine the traditional confidence that people do indeed possess such dispositions. This debate has supposed that dispositions are states that generate a particular kind of output from a particular kind of input. The fragility of a vase, on this view, is the disposition to shatter when struck with a certain amount of force. Likewise, the virtue of compassion is, or includes, a disposition to respond to other people's suffering, or the prospect of it, with actions, or at least thoughts and feelings, that tend towards alleviating or averting that suffering. The disagreement has concerned whether people really can develop dispositions to respond appropriately to such a stimulus irrespective of the fine details of the context in which that stimulus occurs (see Miller, this volume, Chapter 37). However, there are many virtues and other character traits that are not properly understood in terms of stimulus and response. The virtues of constancy, fidelity and integrity form one cluster of such traits. These traits may be displayed in behaviour in difficult circumstances, but what seems essential to them is not the way in which one responds to any particular kind of situation.",

The self is not a phenomenon and is thus not accessible to the same kinds of scientific inquiry and measurement as are natural psychological constructs that are observable (e.g., human motor behavior). Self-esteem is nonsensical-cannot be measured through sensory data collection-and hence imaginary (Berlow, personal communication); as a result, an individual's self-esteem must be inferred, either by an individual's report of his/her sense of self (experienced self) or by reporting the individual's self-esteem (presented self). But the social science community has too readily accepted an individual's personal self-report of self-esteem as natural fact. The guiding, and unquestioned assumption has been that the individual alone has access to the self. Who are we as outsiders to question this source of data? Few self-esteem researchers have used others to infer self-esteem-and thus they have relatively little knowledge of the validity of their self-report data (Wells & Marwell, 1976).",

Absence relates to concepts such as void and nothingness, and is associated with a non-specific invisible and inaudible state. It may be wordlessly sensed or intuited. Identifying putative absences depends on the epistemologies at the disposal of the student of silences. Lack calls attention to a particular incompleteness that can be named. It entails the political unfolding of a process and possesses a teleological undertow. Silence as absence has a different order of inaudibility. As a form of elimination it is itself patently political. Lacanian radical lack has its own peculiarities. It too is non-specific, pertaining to an underlying Real that cannot be articulated or communicated, and for which inadequate terms of language must be substituted. The defective symbolic representation of the Real stands in for an ineluctable lack, a perpetually inexpressible voice. Removal relates to the erasure, loss, or entombment of what had previously existed and was perceptible—often hiding the act of concealment itself, most commonly found in the palimpsests of changing historical narratives.",

Were the social dangers posed by these transactions really a matter for concern, surely the attempt should first be made to understand the conditions that foster them. For unless interest in obscenity is assumed to be innate, a trait of human nature, there should be an explanation for it in the variable conditions (the repressions—or, perhaps, on the other hand, the creative impulses) that impinge on the more authentic and so non-prurient traits of human nature.

This deficiency, which is often resented by others and is initially misunderstood, rubs off on the person who is affected and risks of demoralizing and discouraging her. Strengthening of the ego and personality development of the deaf as a whole autonomous person increases her self confidence and helps her build a solid identity. However, the question often asked: what is the identity of a deaf person? Hearing, deaf or bicultural? What is her future? Before getting any recognition from others, the deaf person needs to know herself. This return to oneself requires her to have knowledge of her own abilities, cultural background and an important feeling of security (a place among his people). The motivation for a better future is a prerequisite for a healthy and balanced development, both from the relational and mental domain. Under what conditions does the deaf person live? Is it framed, loved, recognized? Is it informed, directed, monitored? What image does she have of her own body? What factors from an early age are put into play? What image does she have of herself or what image do we reflect on her? Why? The type of equipment offered, cochlear implants or conventional hearing aid, do they play a role? In this study several factors are being explored; they deal with the problems and issues of the deaf person, the experiences of the person as having a hearing deficiency, the nature and severity of the condition that affects the person and also how this person perceives her own image, consequently her identity and her future.",

      "abstract": "In our post-kantian world we are much given to pious talk about dignity, the dignity of the person. Everyone has it; it cannot be lost; it inheres in being human, like opposable thumbs (which, however, can be lost). Dignity is sometimes contrasted to honor, which can be lost or simply not acquired, there being no special presumption you were born to it unless your parents had it, and which, even if they did have it, was yours for the losing. Honor, unlike dignity, was also there for the taking; it could be captured from others. Kant himself opposed dignity to price: “In the realm of ends everything has either a price or a dignity. What has a price is such that something else can also be put in its place as its equivalent; by contrast whatever is elevated above all price, and admits of no equivalent, has a dignity.” Our talionic peoples, though, had a different way of talking about something very closely akin to dignity, and it had a price.",

      "abstract": "The significance of any claim that altruism plays a prominent role in human life depends on what is meant by altruism. If one means helping behavior, or helping in order to gain subtle self-benefits such as esteem enhancement or guilt avoidance—which is what most behavioral and social scientists mean by altruism—the existence of altruism cannot be doubted. But these definitions trivialize the centuries old egoism-altruism debate. Only by adhering to the notions of altruism and egoism that lie at the heart of that debate do we face head on the fundamental issues it raises about human potential and human nature. The question of the existence of altruism is, at heart, about valuing. Are we humans ever, in any degree capable of valuing the welfare of another, or is our capacity to value limited to our own welfare? It seems we do have the capacity to value another’s welfare.",

As a human experience, pattern recognition refers to a perceptual process in which patterns in any sensory modality (vision, hearing, touch, taste, or smell) or patterns in conceptual or logical thought processes are analyzed and recognized (or classified) as being familiar either in the sense of having been previously experienced or of being similar to or associated with a previous experience.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Imposing a norm-based, expectational discipline on one another, the humanoids will be motivated by the fear of anyone’s defection to manifest their expectations to that individual, exhorting them to conform. They will say, ‘You should and can conform’, ascribing but also reinforcing that capacity. Let the person fail, however, and in the absence of a (full) excuse—a failure of rationality, knowledge, or voluntariness—they will reaffirm ex post the ability ascribed ex ante in exhortation: ‘You should and could have conformed’. And viewing the breach of the norm in that way—as one that occurred in the presence of a capacity to conform—they will intuitively blame or censure the offender. They will be positioned to do this, moreover, by identifying with the ex-ante exhortation of someone else or even with the self-exhortation of the agent. Perhaps that agent’s active self-exhortation—‘I can conform’—or perhaps a standby variant: this will materialize when the individual manifestly commits to the norm and is positioned so that any temptation to defect will raise a red flag, alerting them exhortatively to its appeal. In the emerging sense of blame, they will be able to interiorize the exercise and blame themselves as well. To the extent that someone is self-exhortatively effective in holding themselves to shared norms and values—or more personal counterparts—they will be possessed of free will in an intuitively recognizable sense: in a sense in which it is constituted by willpower.",

Berdasarkan hasil riset dan observasi, mereka mengambil kesimpulan bahwa pada diri manusia terdapat semacam keinginan dankebutuhan yang bersifat universal. Kebutuhan ini melebihi kebutuhan yang lainnya bahkan mengatasi kebutuhan akan kekuasaan. Keinginan akan kebutuhan tersebut merupakan kebutuhan kodrati yaitu berupa keinginan untuk mencintai dan dicintai Tuhan. Karena adanya fitrah ini, maka manusia selalu membutuhkan pegangan hidup yang disebut agama. Rumusan masalah dalam penelitian ini adalah; 1. Benarkah kehidupan manusia dalam masyarakat banyak mengalami kegoncangan, 2. Sejauhmana peran agama dalam perilaku manusia serta pengaruhnya terhadap ketenangan dan ketentraman batin atau jiwa manusia. Analisa datanya menggunakan sintesa-analisa dan induksi-deduksi. Kesimpulan penelitian ini adalah; 1. Dalam kehidupan modern, terlalu banyak manusia yang membanggakan rasio, materi yang ada pada akhirnya dapat menjerumuskan manusia kejurang yang sangat dalam, yang mengakibatkan manusia memalingkan diri dari hal-hal yang bersifat supra natural. Dalam kehidupan manusia modern yang telah kehilangan jati dirinya, berjalan nyaris tanpa pedoman yang kokoh yang membuatnya sangat ringkih dan mudah terombang ambing dalam seribu satu krisis. 2. Agama mempunyai peran yang sangat penting dalam kehidupan manusia. Agama memberikan ketenangan dan ketentraman serta kedamaian batin. Dalam kaitannya dengan perilaku agama mengandung norma-norma dan etika yang akan mengarahkan manusia kepada jalan yang benar. Ketenangan dan ketentraman batin itu diperoleh dengan jalan dzikrullah",

By contrast, in psycho-neurosis the patient exists as a person, is a whole person, recognising objects as whole; the patient is well lodged in his or her own body, and the capacity for object relationships is well established. The child finds certain aspects of the anxieties intolerable, and so begins to set up defences. In perfectionism a hate of the world that would turn it upside down is dealt with in advance. This is a poor substitute for the sequence of health—destructive impulse and idea, sense of guilt, reparation or constructive activity—but for the neurotic it has to serve.",

      "title": "What AI Needs is a Theory of the Functions of Emotions",
      "abstract": "AI needs a formal functional theory of emotions to represent in computer programs our knowledge of emotions. In the theory we propose, emotions are a special class of Intentional states with structural components and properties similar to thos e of the traditional somatic appetites of thirst, hunger, and sex. These were originally part of a hardwired, phylogenetically adapted, nonverbal feedback system for implicitly conveying information about these states both among and within individual members of the species. A classification system provides two major functional classes of emotions, (1) those serving as Appetitive Wishes toward objects, and (2) those serving as Beliefs about the status of fulfillment of those and other significant wishes. Thus, emotions such as Anger or Fear indicate a wish to attack or escape from some object or situation, while Love or Surprise indicate wishes to care about or explore an object or situation. Emotional wishes, like their somatic brethren, require Consummatory Acts for their fulfillment. The result of these acts are emotions such Anxiety or Depression, which indicate Beliefs that the relevant wishes will be hard or impossible to satisfy, or Contentment or Elation , which function as Beliefs that the wishes have been or are being fulfilled. Together, emotional wishes and beliefs form a comprehensive wish-belief information feedback system with manifold causal consequences. Potential applications include agent-oriented problem solving, animation, and human-computer interaction.",

The causal ancestry must be traced back to some kind of intentional state (or combination of intentional states) in the agent, such intentional state (or states) must have the right kind of content, and it must cause the bodily movement (or other effect) in the ‘right’ way. Causal accounts differ on the nature of the intentional state, the nature of the content it must have, and the specification of the ‘right’ kind of causal connection to bodily movements or other effects. Causal accounts also differ on the identification of the action itself. Some acounts say that the action is the bodily movement, provided that it was caused in the right way and had the right kind of effects. Others identify the action with the triggering intentional state (called a volition or trying), provided that it has the right kind of effects. Yet others identify the action with the composite event of the intentional state's causing the appropriate effects. Finally there are those which fail to identify the action with any of these events or combinations of them.",

This constellation of symptoms is sometimes described as solitary confinement psychosis. It is argued that in addition a variety of positive effects accompany successful adaptation to harsh circumstances. These include clarity of thought, heightened feelings of personal accomplishment, and enhanced status among other prisoners. Not all prisoners are destroyed by prolonged aloneness and there are lessons to be learned from the resilient few. The virtues of solitude include reflection, freedom from the constraints of society, and creativity.

The evolution of altruism across species is linked to the preservation of offspring, and the most hard-core manifestation of this is the occurrence of maternal altruism. The altruist is someone who does something for the other and for the other's sake, rather than as a means towards self-promotion or internal well-being. The altruist no longer sees the self as the only center of value but discovers the other as other. Altruistic love adds the feature of deep affirmative affect to altruism. Agape is altruistic love universalized to all humanity as informed by theistic commitments. Altruistic love in humans is expected and nearly ubiquitous on the parent-child axis.",

For adults, objects’ intrinsic properties matter more than their locations in most action contexts. Whereas 5-month-old infants privilege objects’ intrinsic properties in attributing goals to people reaching for objects, 3-month-old infants do not. Do younger infants fail to view reaching as goal-directed, or are they uncertain which properties of objects are relevant in different contexts? Here we show that 3-month-old infants attribute goals to others’ reaching actions when given information that their actions depend on what, not where, an object is. Our findings suggest that 3-month-old infants can learn about others’ object goals, before they reach for objects themselves.",

For adults, objects’ intrinsic properties matter more than their locations in most action contexts. Whereas 5-month-old infants privilege objects’ intrinsic properties in attributing goals to people reaching for objects, 3-month-old infants do not. Do younger infants fail to view reaching as goal-directed, or are they uncertain which properties of objects are relevant in different contexts? Here we show that 3-month-old infants attribute goals to others’ reaching actions when given information that their actions depend on what, not where, an object is. Our findings suggest that 3-month-old infants can learn about others’ object goals, before they reach for objects themselves.",

Except as a bribe to popularity, money is of very limited value. Avarice is (oftener than we might at first suspect) only vanity in disguise. We should not want fine clothes or fine houses, an equipage or livery servants, but for what others will think of us for having or wanting them. The chief and most expensive commodity that money is laid out in purchasing, is respect. Money, like other things, is worth no more than it will fetch. It is a passport into society: but if other things will answer the same purpose; as beauty, birth, wit, learning, desert in art or arms, dress, behaviour, the want of money is not felt as a very severe privation.",

Anything that more or less satisfies these conditions I call a secondary mental entity. Secondary mental entities fall into three moderately distinct subcategories. They are (i) sensations proper such as pains, tickles, and itches; (2) emotions proper such as anger, fear, and exhilaration; and (3) perceptionrelated entities such as sense data, images, and afterimages. Those of the third category are obviously more theory-dependent notions than those of the other two; and my calling the members of all three categories entities should be taken initially as only a convenient way of speaking and not as an endorsement or denial of any particular theory as to their nature or existence. In the empiricist tradition in the philosophy of mind, secondary mental entities have usually been taken to be the very essence, or at least paradigmatic, of the realm of the mental while states of consciousness have been largely ignored. (Or, perhaps it would be more nearly accurate to say that many have supposed that states of consciousness can be exhaustively analyzed by secondary mental entities.) For this lamentable state of affairs there are very good historical and very poor philosophical reasons; or so at least I have argued in detail elsewhere.'

Many have died for an emotional commitment, including officials who remained loyal to a defeated country, martyrs who refused to bow in the face of intimidation, chivalrous knights-errant, elopers who defied society (1), in short, people who sacrificed their lives for an ideal, making no calculation of personal gain or loss in the process. Others lean toward rationality, examining principles and analyzing nagging questions, evaluating the appropriateness of names and their correspondence with the realities to which they are attached. Such people are exemplified by the rational approach to principle and [the Classics taken during the Sung] and by philosophers. If one follows pure emotions. then all matters might be honorable and virtuous, but implicit is the defect of stupidity.

      "abstract": "Abstract Animals are usually considered to lack the status of autonomous agents. Nevertheless, they do appear to make ostensible choices. This article considers whether, and how, I should respect animals' choices. I propose a concept of volitionality which can be respected if, and insofar as, doing so is in the best interests of the animal. Applying that concept, I (we) will argue that an animals' choices be respected when the relevant human decision maker's capacities to decide are potentially challenged or compromised. For example, it will be best to respect the animals' choice when the human decision maker: (1) lacks accurate knowledge of the animal's subjective experiences; (2) does not know what will lead to desirable experiences or allow for the avoidance of undesirable ones; (3) is biased; (4) is less aware of the animal's specific situation; (5) cannot appreciate all elements comprehensively, including considering any (content‐neutral) value to the animal being allowed to make and implement a choice, such as where a lack of control or liberty would be unpleasant or where an animal would usefully learn from the process of choice‐making; and (6) when the animal's choice is achievable. This additionally suggests that we may often beneficially choose to set up situations that empower animals to make better choices.",

In psychoanalytic practice, analysts encounter a variety of patients who operate at different levels of anxiety or desire in regards to their objects. Some patients who exhibit control and conviction about self and object demonstrate borderline and narcissistic disorders that revolve around more persecutory phantasies. There are also patients who face a constant depressive and persecutory threat to themselves and their precious objects. They rely heavily upon idealization and projective identification to traverse their psychological standoff against these overwhelming anxieties. The subsequent defenses that are always in overuse to sustain the brittle ideal self or object and to prevent the aggressive, envious self from breaking through actually cause either the death/damage of the object or the rise of a persecutory object. Often it can be both, creating a dual fear and phantasy of loss and persecution.",

      "abstract": "Patriotism is to a nation what egotism is to a person. One has a passionate attachment to one’s idea of oneself, believes virtues arise from that passion, and seeks to act consistently with those imagined virtues. Patriotism is a similarly complex concept that presumes the same three kinds of things have a necessary relationship and together form a unique totality. A passion, love of one's country, is held to produce a virtue, a consistent commitment to an ideal image of one’s country, which in turn produces a pattern of actions, often self-sacrificial, intended to benefit one’s country. Many might feel the passion, but those who most attest to it may not feel it most. Many might give evidence of the virtue, or seek to, but those considered most exemplary may not possess it most securely. Many might act to benefit their countries, but what counts as a benefit, whether an action is to be judged by its intentions or its effects, who is to judge, and by what means are all issues contentious in proportion to the extremity of the circumstances that prompt the action and the drama of the deed. The complexity of the concept cannot be avoided. Conventional use of the word “patriotism” assumes that the action is founded on virtue and that the virtue necessarily arises from the passion, so that if one has the passion, one will have the virtue, and if one has the virtue, one will perform deeds of actual bene.t to one’s country. This complexity of these covertly asserted assumptions makes the concept intrinsically ideological.",

Individualism has, indeed, many spectral qualities: indeterminate shape, evocative power, and a myriad of other qualities attributed to it and which allow it to take many forms on a scale which ranges from benevolence to terror according to perceptions of it. Perhaps the most important quality ascribed to it when it appears (or reappears) is its power of annunciation: annunciation of historic changes which have taken place or are in the making, and which will shake the fragile foundations of our knowledge and our existence. Hence its incantatory use by visionaries, who are usually more concerned with invocation than with understanding. Conversely, it is the spectral quality ascribed to individualism which tempts many to refute it without due consideration or to reduce it to a ‘pre-notion’, or else to abandon it altogether to ideologues and (false) prophets.",

But it is also possible to be alienated from experiences of non-human targets, such as buildings or natural landscapes. And it turns out moral self-reproach plays a role in those cases, too. Exploring experiences of non-human targets helps reveal how we can be alienated from experiences in which we aren’t, strictly speaking, misperceiving the target of our experience at all. It also helps clarify the role of distinctively moral self-reproach, as against self-reproach of other types, in driving alienation.",

First, there is a wider range of types of aesthetic pleasure. Those best known and most influential in the West include aware/mononoaware (an awareness of the poignance of things, connected to a Buddhist sense of transience and to passing beauty); yūgen (deep or mysterious and powerful beauty, especially in Noh theater); wabi (powerlessness, loneliness, shabbiness, wretchedness); sabi (the beauty accompanying loneliness, solitude, quiet); and shibui (an ascetic quality or astringency, literally the sensation afforded by a pomegranate, which also imparts a rich but sober color to wood stains, etc.). Second, Japanese aesthetic experiences and activities are employed in the service of a wider range of objectives. These include (aesthetic) pleasure and the revelation of truth; self-cultivation that is not only artistic but also physical, social, emotional, psychological, and spiritual; the construction of personal, group, and national identity; and the formulation of relationships. This article begins with an overview of the uniqueness of Japanese aesthetics. It then examines several of the unique objectives of Japanese aesthetics in further detail.",

I systematize the standards for humanoid robots as follows: minimally humanoid (teddy bears); bottom of the Uncanny Valley (repulsive sex dolls); Silver Standard (almost human-looking), Gold Standard (hard to distinguish from humans at the right level of granularity); Platinum Standard (slightly improved on humans); the Uncanny Valley of Perfection (too much better than humans); the Slope of the Angels (no longer humanoid, viewed with awe).",

Seeking God means willing nothing and desiring nothing except what he wills and arranges by his providence.

Evolutionary theories propose that gratitude is an adaptation for reciprocal altruism (the sequential exchange of costly benefits between nonrelatives) and, perhaps, upstream reciprocity (a pay-it-forward style distribution of an unearned benefit to a third party after one has received a benefit from another benefactor). Gratitude therefore may have played a unique role in human social evolution.",

The fact that man does not need or lack the Creator, associates them with himself without being grateful for the blessings and opportunities given, and sees himself as absolutely sufficient. Arrogance as a demonic attitude; includes cruelty, worship of desire, envy and ignorance. Boasting against the truth and truth causes frustration for people as well as in the example of the devil. &#x0D; In this study, arrogance, concepts related to arrogance, the relationship of arrogance with obedience will be discussed.",

In malignant trauma, cure is not attainable because the core of traumatic experience remains in part untouched by symbolic expressions, leaving a person with a sense of inarticulateness and isolation. Malignant trauma is the result of five interrelated experiences of loss: (a) shock associated with the loss of the expectation of help; (b) loss of control over the integrity of one's body; (c) loss in the belief that the other is obliged to respond to a cry; (d) loss of trust associated with the experience of betrayal; and (e) loss of an other's commitment to recognize, respect, and respond to one's desires and needs.

Appeal, in turn, depends on tastes, which in contrast to goals and standards, tend to be unanalyzable, Hence, the Attraction emotions are the least cognitively complex of all emotions. Tastes are treated broadly and include attitudes and preferences, and the notion of an object is also broad, including anything that is evaluated qua object, meaning that even events or agents’ actions can be viewed as objects. Although issues pertaining to aesthetic judgment are raised, they are not the focus of Attraction emotions. The Attraction emotion identified depends on whether an object is evaluated as being appealing or unappealing and whether it is viewed as itself being capable of emotion. Crossing these dimensions leads to four emotion types: “Affection” and “Enmity” emotions, which pertain to emotion-capable (generally animate) objects, and “Appreciation” and “Distaste” emotions, which pertain to emotion-incapable (generally inanimate) objects.",

Indeed, they should resist any attempt to take them as such on the grounds that seeing athletes (or other celebrities) as role models abrogates the existential and ethical responsibilities of both parties. Whether one takes on the role of being a model to others or whether one chooses to model one’s own behaviour on that of another, except in respect of the development of technical skill, one engages in bad faith and fails to act in an existentially ethical way. To this end, I consider the inclination to influence and admiration, as well as self‐respect, agency, motivation, and envy. I argue that while celebrity sportspersons and similar others do not have duties that others do not have just by virtue of their notoriety alone, they may have situational responsibilities commensurate with their social reach. More importantly, however, since social influence is not a transformation of inert matter, there are also responsibilities belonging to their audiences, those who merely observe and those who choose to imitate",

Recently, I think, this view has been very much out of favor. Those who have rejected it have not, in general, denied that there is something that might be called a \"special access\" to one's own mental states. Usually they have not denied that normally a person knows of his own beliefs, desires, sensations, thoughts, etc. in a way that is utterly different from that in which one person knows of such mental states in another person. And in the case of at least some mental phenomena, in particular sensations and occurrent thoughts, it would generally be allowed that a person's access to those phenomena in himself is both more comprehensive and less subject to error than his access to the same sorts of phenomena in other persons. What is denied, when this Cartesian doctrine is rejected, is, first, that the special access a person has to his own mental states is necessarily infallible or \"incorrigible,\" or at least yields knowledge having a kind of certainty which empirical knowledge about other matters cannot attain, and second, that it is in any way constitutive or definitive of mental states, or of minds, or of the concepts of these, that these states intimate their existence to their possessors in a special and direct way.",

      "title": "Prurigo: Where are you?",
      "abstract": "The definition of moral qualities, merits, virtues, defects, failings and deficiencies is not precise and words do not allow us to evaluate properly these characteristics. It also happens with many human and animal perceptions and sensations. We can physically define and measure accurately ocular and auditory sensitivity and discernment. Colour and tones may objectively be evaluated and quantified. However, we do not have the same possibilities with the other senses. Smell is defined comparatively to other more or less precise and distinct odours that, in fact, are variable, complex and composite. Taste has also the same imprecise characteristics. And touch is probably the less developed sense, particularly in humans, in spite of its crucial role in the relationship with other individuals and the development and expression of affection, love and sex. Smell, taste and touch have also the same imprecise possibility of quantitative evaluation, from mild to strong, without a valid and objective scale of measurement. It is in this field of imprecise sensations where we can place itching (pruritus). Pruritus is a subjective manifestation, almost specific to skin and some stratified mucous membranes, which could be described as a feeling that provokes an imperious need for scratching (what a failure of concretion!). Pain, itch, burning, tingling and tickling are some of these diverse tactile or soreness-related sensations often associated with skin diseases. Itch is a characteristic of multiple skin disorders, from atopy to allergic reactions, from lymphoma to lichen planus and scabies. And there are individuals who, due to one of these conditions, suffer itch over a long period and, because of it, develop severe psychological alterations. It is well known that chronic pruritus is associated with loss of quality of life. However, scratching a pruriginous area is so satisfying that it has been supposed that Henry VIII said that itch must be kept for the King of England, to maintain the pleasure of rubbing for the Royalty. Pruritus is a non-specific manifestation but, often, its chronology, rhythm, location or other characteristics permit a precise diagnosis of the cause. Although, from the beginning and for more than a century, dermatologists recognized skin diseases by their morphology and associated subjective manifestations, in recent times the enlarging knowledge of aetiopathogenic mechanisms changed definition and even the terminology of many skin disorders. And dermatologists are now much more interested in the accuracy of their language.1,2 The term T-cell lymphoma has progressively replaced the old mycosis fungoides. We do not any more call ‘herpes’ a fungal disease and ‘mycosis’ a malignant proliferative condition. Therefore, if in some fields the old morphological terms have been changed to new ones related to the origin or mechanism of the disease, it would appear suitable to try to eradicate others as prurigo. The term prurigo has been largely used in the past and still persists in dermatological literature. However, prurigo only means ‘undefined cutaneous reaction associated with variable itching and usually of unknown origin’. At the time when the physiopathological mechanisms and the causes of pruritus are much better known than in the past, it appears archaic still to keep this name in our books and journals. Of course the cause of the very curious prurigo pigmentosa nicely reported in this issue by Matsumoto et al. is not clear and, by now, this very peculiar reaction has not been identified with other diseases as dermatitis herpetiformis or erythema multiforme. Maybe for these special cases it would be preferable to use a descriptive term (as recurrent reticular pruritic pigmentary eruption, as we do with the pruritic urticarial papules and plaques of pregnancy) or the name of the first author who described the disease (in this case it would be Nagashima’s disease). Until the identification of the aetiology of the disease or the mechanism responsible for this peculiar reaction is reached, a descriptive/mnemonic designation or one related to the first report would be temporarily more adequate than to maintain the old word prurigo that appears as old fashioned as if we still used the term noli me tangere for ulcerated basal cell carcinoma. Or … we can continue with the very peculiar terminology of dermatology, using in the twenty-first century, botanical names, such as lichen, for cell-mediated immunological reactions. It is also a poetical and a delicious fashion.3,4 Why not if, at the time of revolutionary technology, black and white films (The Battleship Potemkin, Un chien andalou, The Seventh Seal, Casablanca, and many others) not only persist but still represent some or the main achievements of motion pictures?",

We examined how individual differences in imaginative involvement (fantasy proneness, absorption) and magical beliefs (superstitiousness and religiousness) uniquely related to desire for 12 supernatural powers (final N = 143); participants also rated the supernaturalness of each power and how much they believed humans possess/will possess each power. These individual differences, as predicted, consistently correlated with the desire for supernatural powers and the belief that humans may possess these powers in the future.

      "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) systems paradoxically combine high levels of certain types of intelligence and cognitive capacities (pattern recognition, reasoning, learning, memory, perception, etc.) with an absence of understanding and sentience (feeling, emotion). Apparently, it is possible to make great progress in modeling smartness without making progress towards genuinely understanding what all the clever reasoning is about. This is relevant when dealing with AI programs that produce potentially convincing propositional output on religious topics. This article suggests that smartness without genuine understanding cannot amount to authentic religiosity. Comparing ourselves with other entities, (in)animate or (super)natural, has always been a way for humans to understand ourselves better. Throughout the ages, many different types of beings and agents have functioned as tools for self-examination, presenting us with mirrors that reflect at least some of our characteristics, capacities, and (im)perfections. The recent progress in AI provides exciting, though sometimes worrisome, cases for a newly informed look at ourselves. Thus, AI may have profound effects on how we regard others and ourselves. The proud claim that humans are the smartest species on the planet may turn out not to mean all that much. Inspired by the example of Thomas Aquinas, the comparison of humans to our nearest neighbors in a newly extended great chain of being—namely, animals, angels, and AI—may deepen our appreciation of the features of homo sapiens that we share with many other organisms.",

      "abstract": "Both folk and scientific psychology assume that mental events and properties participate in causal relations. However, considerations involving the causal completeness of physics and the apparent non-reducibility of mental phenomena to physical phenomena have challenged these assumptions. In the case of mental events (such as someone’s thinking about Vienna), one proposal has been simply to identify not ‘types’ (or classes) of mental events with types of physical events, but merely individual ‘token’ mental events with token physical ones, one by one (your and my thinking about Vienna may be ‘realized’ by different type physical states). The role of mental properties (such as ‘being about Vienna’) in causation is more problematic. Properties are widely thought to have three features that seem to render them causally irrelevant: (1) they are ‘multiply-realizable’ (they can be realized in an indefinite variety of substances); (2) many of them seem not to supervene on neurophysiological properties (differences in mental properties do not always depend merely on differences in neurophysiological ones, but upon relations people bear to things outside their skin); and (3) many of them (for example, ‘being painful’) seem inherently ‘subjective’ in a way that no objective physical properties seem to be. All of these issues are complicated by the fact that there is no consensus concerning the nature of causal relevance for properties in general.",

The required turning toward God and away from everything that He is not means flight from everything and a search for refuge in God. The will is a necessary, but not also a sufficient condition for that turning. Serenity and the embracing of the spacious view of reality in the human consciousness do not exclude the contingent self and its insecurity. From this state of relaxation and from the level it has attained, the self endeavors to step out into what is embraced by its serenity. Duality is manifested as melancholy, sorrow, and pain in the self. Love is the aspiration that unity should be attained out of divergence.",

      "title": "Moral Self-Orientation in Alzheimer's Dementia",
      "abstract": "People with Alzheimer's dementia experience significant neuropsychological decline, and this seems to threaten their sense of self. Yet they continue to have regard for their moral standing, especially from the feedback they receive from others in relation to such things as pride in their work, retaining a valued role, or acting out of a sense of purpose. This continuing self-regard is based on a self-image which often persists through memory loss. I will argue that in care settings the self-image ought to be assumed to remain intact. Treating a person with Alzheimer's dementia supportively and respectfully as the person with a certain role or identity—say as scientist, musician, janitor, parent, or friend—fosters an environment in which they are best able to retain what I call moral self-orientation. The latter notion is central to the well-being of social persons, and so it takes on special significance for people with dementia because, although their remembering selves are fragmenting, their self-image persists. Normative aspects of the self-image, I argue, require a social framework of support to sustain the self-image.",

      "abstract": "I have tried to make sense of the idea that love is a deep part of human life. In doing so I have advanced a number of discrete but interrelated claims, such as: the claim that sexualized intimate love is a good exemplar of love in general; that love involves seeing others as unique but doing so in the light of our own history; and that, for our own well-being, we need at some time in our lives to be loved because nothing else discloses our value and worth in quite the same way. The guiding, but so far unstated, assumption behind this rather piecemeal approach is that nothing works as a complete theory of everything that we are inclined to call “love”. Another way to make the same point would be to say that love is, in some respects, mysterious. The elusiveness of a complete theory may have something to do with the absence of any plausible and complete account of the emotions in general, or with the fact that, if we think of love as an emotion, it will turn out to be an emotion that is somewhat anomalous. The elusiveness of a complete theory of love may also be related to love's depth. There are deep aspects of ourselves that humans have always found uncanny or slightly beyond our comprehension.",

      "abstract": "What is the slave’s relationship to the master and what is the master’s to the slave. It is hard to ignore Hegel’s model, bizarre though it is in seeing agency and subjectivity being possible for the slave more than for the master. The master, according to Hegel, depends on the slave’s acknowledgment of the master’s position for the master to recognize himself. The slave does not and is not in need of the recognition of the other since, having resigned himself, herself, to obedience, docility, labor, servitude, there is no point in seeking recognition from the other who sees the slave only as a thing compelled to obey. For Gikandi, this being is chattel, lacking subjectivity. But how does subjectivity come about for master and for slave? If the master depends on the slave, and not other masters, for her subjectivity, then it is framed by a relationship that is marked by all or nothing: the master has all the agency, the slave none due to the obligation to obey the will of the other, the master. But the master as other is not only dependent on his dependencies, his slaves, for labor and recognition; the master, as other, depends on the slave for a relationship in which the master can recognize himself. If the slave refuses, the master becomes decentered. There is a development Hegel envisions whereby the slave moves toward self-recognition by her work in which she sees her labor mixed in with her products, with her sense of herself as a person, an agent, a producer, a maker, thus emerging. The master fails to accomplish this position, having produced nothing with his own labor and seeing the products as having been made by the slave. It isn’t enough to own the slave and the products of his labor for the master since there is no recognition of himself in those products. “Through this rediscovery of himself by himself, the bondsman realizes that it is precisely in his work wherein he seemed to have only an alienated existence that he acquires a mind of his own” (Hegel 118–19; par. 196).1 The lord enjoys the object, but his enjoyment stops short of any recognition of a consciousness involved in the object and the work in creating it. Simultaneously, the slave cannot extend control over the object to the point of establishing total independence of it: “[the bondsman’s] negating of it . . . cannot go to the length of being altogether done with it to the point of annihilation; in other words, he only works on it” (par. 190), in contrast to the lord whose relationship to the object is always mediated. In the work of the slave comes the possibility of self-consciousness; the lord fails to achieve this. “. . . the lord, who has interposed",

As Levinas pointed out, relationships cannot be considered as a group of artificial or technological certainties anymore; they become open and real and they are based on the understanding of the Other. This Other, who pre-exists us, should be reconsidered in an appropriate way: we should start by considering his story, environment and habits, in order to truly understand him.

      "abstract": "Traditionally, the author of a history or saint's life identifies him or herself in such a way as to authenticate the truth and quality of the material. Positioning counts: that of a courtier or family member or disciple or army-follower. The writer claims to know the subject but modes of asserting this may vary: education, intellect, access to written sources, may count or, in the case of hagiography, may be discounted in favour of a different familiarity. The claim may of course be tacit, as when a writer continues someone else's work and inherits his authority by default. In a well-functioning work, the self-identifying trope is tacitly or overtly matched to need, and this remains largely true of those sophisticated eleventh-century and twelfth-century histories where the historian freely writes himself or herself into events. The difference is that options have increased; the self-identifying can take as many forms as phases of the narrative require and any of these may function in more ways than one. Of course, some functions may be extra-textual: they may be personally or politically driven, as when Michael Attaleiates lauds Botaneiates, or Michael Psellos idealizes Michael Doukas and his son, or when Anna Komnene shakes her fist at Alexios's successors. In this chapter, I shall leave those to one side and consider modes of self-identification in these Middle Byzantine authors, which work towards a larger textual purpose.",

Infants endow people and other animate beings with the capacity to act: They cause their own motion, interact with objects on contact, detect objects and obstacles at a distance, direct their actions to distant objects, and act efficiently. Even before infants begin to reach for objects, pick them up, or manipulate them, they view other people’s actions on objects as causal, costly, and goal-directed. Based on these findings, the author hypothesizes that infants have an early-emerging system of core knowledge of people as agents. This system supports infants’ learning about other people’s actions and mental states, as well as the development of their own motor skills and action plans.",

Following synchronous, but not asynchronous, stimulation, and when asked to judge the identity of morphed pictures of the two faces, participants assimilated features of the other's face in the mental representation of their own face. Importantly, the participants' autonomic system responded to a threatening object approaching the other's face, as one would anticipate a person to respond to her own face being threatened.

      "title": "Individual Autonomy and a Culture of Narcissism",
      "abstract": "Autonomy, self-determination, self-affirmation, emancipation: all these words refer to an ideal that orients the way in which our contemporary culture speaks about many moral and political problems. The importance of this ideal for us can be seen in the way we accept as obvious a number of ideas that follow from it. Most of us would certainly tend to accept that no universally valid answer can be given to the question of what kind of human life is truly meaningful or valuable and that, because of this, people should be granted as much freedom as possible to pursue a life that best corresponds with their own personal tastes and preferences. Many would go a step further and claim that people should also be encouraged to live as much as possible according to what they have themselves chosen, and that they should give up traditional forms of life and role patterns. One aspect of this cult of individual freedom or autonomy is the idea that we should develop a critical attitude towards anything established, accepted or traditional: every form of power or authority, prevailing moral norms and educational customs, traditional role patterns, etc. A further feature of this is the tendency to describe any improvement in the fortunes of the weak, the vulnerable and the less well off as an ‘emancipation’. The idea that the poor, the handicapped and the elderly should receive more support, assistance, respect and attention is translated by the assertion that they, too, should be ‘liberated’. The ideals that we associate with words like ‘emancipation’ or ‘self-affirmation’ were at one time innovative and revolutionary, but they gradually became established as accepted ways of thinking and thus became part of a new common sense. Nowadays, anyone wanting to be provocative will attain their goal more easily by scoffing at everything falling under the rubric of emancipation than by speaking out in its defence. This fact is characteristic of an ambiguity in our culture. While the ideals of self-affirmation and emancipation enjoy enormous popularity, in certain intellectual circles they are treated with suspicion. At stake here is the general image of humanity associated with these ideals. Thinkers such as Wittgenstein, Heidegger, Lacan, Derrida or Baudrillard have, each in their own way, attacked the idea of the autonomous subject and stressed that people’s most intimate thoughts and desires are determined by something that transcends them: by the language they speak or the culture to which they belong. Rejecting the idea of the autonomous subject is usually one aspect of a more general critique of ideas inherited from the Enlightenment. The question whether and to what extent this critique is justified occupies a central position in many contemporary philosophical discussions, and much of what goes on in contemporary philosophy can be described in terms of the opposition between those who would defend Enlightenment ideals (often indicated by the terms ‘humanism’ or ‘liberalism’) and those who would reject or cast doubt on those ideals. What I would like to discuss here undoubtedly fits into a framework that could be called ‘antiliberal’ or ‘anti-humanist’. However, it is certainly not my intention to criticize humanism or liberalism directly and systematically. In what follows, I will attempt to show that the unity or cohesion suggested by the term ‘autonomy’ does not in fact exist. It will turn out that this term is actually associated with three ideals which are not only distinct, but which are in relations of mutual opposition or tension. In addition, I would like to develop the idea that at",

We suggest that understanding the factors that engage our ability to reason about the minds of others helps to explain anthropomorphism: cases in which people attribute minds to a wide range of nonhuman agents, including animals, mechanical and technological objects, and supernatural entities such as God. We suggest that engagement is guided by two basic motivations: (1) the motivation to explain and predict others' actions, and (2) the motivation to connect socially with others. When present, these motivational forces can lead people to attribute minds to almost any agent. When absent, the likelihood of attributing a mind to others, even other human beings, decreases. We suggest that understanding the factors that engage our theory of mind can help to explain the inverse process of dehumanization, and also why people might be indifferent to other people even when connecting to them would improve their momentary wellbeing.",

      "abstract": "The basis of human creation lays the foundation for altruism. Babies, be they human or animal are born helpless. Their very survival depends on the love and affection that are already embedded in the hearts of mothers. No amount of selfish attitude of mothers, not at least from short life span, can help in the growth of their off‐springs. One can argue that it is the self‐interested motive of the parents and most particularly the mothers of getting supports in their old days that drives them to be altruistic rather than selfish. Being altruistic means undertaking a lot of sacrifice in terms of personal pleasure and happiness merely for seeing pleasure and happiness in others regardless of any human bondage. An egoistic person, on the other hand, would never care for others. Personal level satisfaction only dominates the mind of an extremely egoistic or self‐centered man.",

      "abstract": "Looking beyond the materialistic boundary of the conventional development paradigm, it is very important to keep a balance between the external changes and the changes which needs to be done within. Unfortunately Conventional development’s overemphasis on external changes, and it ignores inner changes, it may be because of the reflection of the prevailing general belief. Now a day the sense of ‘I’, self-centeredness and greed which is actually an inherent human characteristics common to all human beings is seen to be taking the charge of the personality and becoming dominant. As we all are talking about the Globalization, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Robotics all this put together will definitely create a competition where the human beings will have to prove themselves better than the machines, this may lead to various problems such as stress, anxiety, depression, performance anxiety so forth and so on. The fundamental differences between the machines and human beings can be explained as; human beings are having (1) Empathy – the capacity to sense others’ feelings, (2) Loving kindness – the wish of others’ happiness, (3) Compassion – the wish to alleviate others’ suffering and (4) Generosity – the willingness to share one’s wealth with others in order to reduce their suffering. In other words we can say that the human beings are having thought ware. There is a need to understand that merely achieving money or position cannot be the sole measure to decide the success or failure of a person. Currently various initiatives are taken on design thinking, positive thinking and meditation. Even the school children are also having meditation as a part of their daily routine. It is seen that many of the youngsters are becoming victim of depression and fail to maintain their mental balance. The researcher strongly feels that for having a sustainable development people need to be spiritually ignited. In this paper the researcher has tried to relate the sustainable development with spirituality. For material development to be sustainable, spiritual advancement must be seen as an integral part of the human development algorithm.",

      "abstract": "Inauthenticity, whether in a person's character and attitudes, or in the arts and crafts, invariably marks a flaw or failing in whatever it characterizes. In a person's life, one manifestation of inauthenticity is that of insincerity: not meaning what one says or feels, pretending to have sentiments (I use the term in a Humean sense, to include beliefs and desires as well as less obviously cognitive feelings and emotions) that one does not in fact have. And it is sometimes said that there is an analogous case in the arts: that one way in which a work of art may be inauthentic is in virtue of being insincere, of expressing or articulating sentiments which are or were not in fact those of the artist. In what follows, I wish to consider whether this is correct; whether insincerity may indeed be a manifestation of inauthenticity in the arts, and in particular in poetry. Can the fact that a poet is insincere, in the sense that her poems express sentiments which she does not feel, make those poems inauthentic?",

I argue that schizophrenic depersonalization/derealization is based on a disorder of common sense epitomized by the hendiadys “deanimated body”—the experience of feeling distant and lifeless—and “disembodied spirit”—the sharp awareness of observing that appears separated from the experience of existing. This basic disturbance is sometimes experienced by persons with schizophrenia, some other times it may pass un-experienced, and can be rescued via phenomenological analysis. This basic disturbance is typical of persons with schizophrenia in the sense that it contributes to a clear-cut differentiation—better than surface signs and symptoms—between schizophrenia and other forms of psychotic existence.",

How well things go for someone depends on whether, and to what extent, the things that happen in her life are good or bad for her. A theory of well‐being purports to tell us how to identify the things in a person's life that are basically good or bad for her – good or bad for her in their own right, and not merely on account of causing things that are good or bad for her (as money does), indicating such things (as the results of a blood test might), having such things as parts (as the person's entire life might), or being otherwise related to such things. Roughly speaking, an objective theory of well‐being is one that claims that something can be basically good for a person even if she has no favorable (or “pro‐”) attitude toward it or basically bad for her even if she has no disfavorable (or “con‐”) attitude toward it. Examples of objective theories include theories on which knowledge, moral virtue, or the exercise of distinctively human capacities is a basic good.",

In some languages the word for ‘shame’ and the word for ‘wound’ are the same. A wound exposes and can thereby advertise vulnerabilty and a cause for shame. Hiding or covering may seek to guard against wounding, humiliating exposure. Shame is self-evidently an important human emotion. Insofar as animals are innocent of shame, experience of it is a mark of humanity. Much human behaviour is influenced by fear of shame and embarrassment. Living in the face and eyes, shame is very close to the experienced self. Self-image and self-esteem are heavily determined by one's susceptibility to shame. Experience of shame is impossible without a sense of individuation, without a sense of discreteness from the world and of being an object in the eyes of another. Study of shame sensitivity therefore offers many clues to an individual's or a culture's behaviour, sense of identity and relationship to the environment.",

To identify is to allow discrimination – friend or foe? – the former classification being non–dangerous (potentially unharmful), the latter classification being dangerous (potentially harmful). For this, friend and foe must have distinguishable characters and the organism must both detect these characters, and know which characters are likely to associate with non-danger (friend) and which characters are likely to associate with danger (foe). After this discrimination, there must then be a response (either non–alarm, or alarm) that, in turn, would lead to a variety of other responses of an adaptive nature (e.g. escape from, or destroy, the foe).",

      "abstract": "In this paper I would like to describe, even if in broad terms, certain ways, more or less adequate, in which it is possible to experience our own or others’ subjectivity and to acquire from it, in less unhappy cases, a more or less deep knowledge. In particular, I present an ecological model of the Self, which is capable of constituting, in the specific “sense” in which it manifests itself – the self-sense, the sense of our own embodied and embedded being – a fundamental presupposition of an eventual self-knowledge and knowledge of others. The self-sense or sense of our own living bodyness, evident, for example, in feeling good or bad in one’s own body, in the hunger or in the pain, in the attunement (or non-attunement) of the subject involved with its own environment and with other animals (human and non-human), points out, in other words, in the contextual perspective that is outlined, the minimal form that can assume self-knowledge and knowledge of others. In an indirect route, that is to say, turned towards the recognition of possible failures and pathologies of self-knowledge and knowledge of others, of “unhappy knowledge” so to speak, I uncover the role that self-sense and its eventual failure play in the possible conquest or failure of second-order self-knowledge and knowledge of others (social cognition, personal and interpersonal knowledge). Above all, I turn my attention to axiological-affective self-deceptions and to delusions and affective “blindness”, suggesting a possible alternative route, or at least an integrative route, in comparison with standard theories of self-deception and delusion, essentially characterized in a propositional sense. I show in the end the formative and transformative power of art, its expressive and material dimension and its therapeutic relevance or dis-illusory, absolutely antithetical, as such, to anaesthetizing or simply protective (of a would-be equilibrium of one’s own self) and adaptive power that certain self-deceptions can have.",

Humans inherit an ability to acquire language, but no one language is more natural or adaptive than another. Altruism focuses also on the network that emphasizes the helping agent's awareness of the need of another and the intention to be of assistance rather than the network favored by behavioral biologists that refers only to behaviors of an agent that benefit another. The concept of love refers to an emotional state rather than to an intention, action, or moral judgment.

      "title": "Edytorial: Samotność a kreacja",
      "abstract": "Ladies and Gentlemen, Reflecting on a possible positive dimension of loneliness in the context of creation, it is necessary to consider the ethical aspect. Being lonely should be understood as being separated, ‘self being’, without others or next to them. Why does an individual decide to be separated? A positive aspect of loneliness must be considered as a person’s independent decision. Being lonely against one’s will cannot be considered as a self-imposed act, as a positive dimension of loneliness. History, literature and religion provide numerous examples of creative and positive dimensions of loneliness, of being alone. However, loneliness in these examples means being lonely for a cause. Being lonely for a cause can be analysed within the ethical aspect. Sacrifice, devotion can also be considered here. On the other hand, contemporary transformations call for viewing loneliness from yet another perspective. Maybe it should be re-evaluated. Being lonely may not result from ‘bad luck’, wrong choices or a desire to sacrifice oneself, but from commonsensical calculations. I am alone because it is more convenient, more practical, it allows me to focus on my goals only. Modern societies do not require forming couples nor joining communities because one is a part of a huge web and may cooperate with others to obtain a particular aim without the necessity to abandon ‘one’s oneness’, one’s separation from others. Maybe such ‘oneness’ should be used as the term describing the contemporary world, in which being in a lasting relationship can be perceived as a nuisance, because it does not permit to form various co-operations in order to achieve various goals. The durability of being together, abandoning one’s distinctiveness may be perceived as something more and more anachronic. Even the traditional attitude to family life may undergo erosion. A futuristic vision of defining one’s share in being together may become a frequent occurrence. For example, who are full-time wives and husbands? Maybe, taking into account cultural and social transformations, it necessary to redefine the identity of marriage, of being a wife, a husband a parent. ‘Oneness’ in relation to a family life is only one aspect of transformations taking place nowadays. Loneliness can take various forms. New media, through which we get to know other people, can also become the source of alienation. Contacts obtained and maintained through them do not seem to be inconvenient in any way – one can always give them up. Zygmunt Bauman draws attention to a limited number of active relations, which does not exceed 150 persons . Thus, everyone can create his ‘own primal village’ with lively relations. This village is not geographically and spatially restricted, and its centrer is ‘me’. ‘Oneness’ will be the result of contemporary civilisation, in which relations are defined by subject’s creation. Everyone can create their own village and their own ethical standards resulting from an adopted philosophy of life. This issue of ‘Horizons of Education’ is devoted to multidimensional analysis of loneliness in the context of creation. Here the readers can find reflection on its psychological, philosophical, educational and semantic aspects. The issue opens with an article written by Beata Balogova and Martin Lacný. It deals with loneliness in the positive context of contemporary person’s social life and considers the meaning of life. The authors analyse experiencing difficult life situations resulting in post-traumatic stress. The experience of such stress offers to an individual a higher quality of life with greater resilience, the result of which is a new dimension of life, a new meaning of life. The articles written by Wieslaw Wojcik and Marek Rembierz also seem interesting: they focus on loneliness in intellectual activities, which require a lot of intellectual effort. Intellectual effort flourishes on loneliness, requires unlimited time, uses it up but gives joy in return. Loneliness of a creator, a genius can yield wonderful fruit. Janusz Miąso discusses the issue of interpersonal communication in the context of loneliness. According to him, at the beginning there is no loneliness but intrapersonal communication, which transform loneliness into a desire for interpersonal communication. Experiencing another human being leads back to one’s inside, where one experiences, enriches and enhances a desire to turn to others becoming permanently more creative. Marek Studenski writes about loneliness with reference to the life of priests and consecrated people. He believes that experiencing loneliness in a creative way is a chance but also a source of problems which might be difficult to overcome. Difficulties faced by priests or monks are often completely different from the ones imagined by those preparing for such life. The necessity to face situations which must be accepted and experienced after the formation period reveal the validity of the decision taken. Bozena Sieradzka-Baziur analyses a semantic dimension of the concept of loneliness. She points at three thematic categories: social contacts, emotions and the number and quantity. Language users assign various, unlimited in number, language signs to those three categories. It results from the fact that languages are alive, they develop and undergo changes together with their users. In her considerations on loneliness, Joanna Sztuka presents volunteering as an active form of adaptation to old age and the strategy of coping with this period of human life. She points at the fact that from a pedagogical perspective, the elderly can and should constitute an important link of the social capital. Thematic considerations on loneliness in this issue of ‘Horizons of Educations’ end with the article written by Justyna Kusztal. We strongly recommend those highly interesting reflections on creative aspects of loneliness. The authors from various academic centres in Poland and abroad have contributed material which is definitely worth thinking over. It should be noticed that loneliness is also closely connected with ethical considerations, as the essence of ethical struggle is to reveal the art of life.",

      "abstract": "DUNS SCOTUS ON THE WILL* (I made them) . . . . . . authors to themselves in all, Both what they judge and what they choose; for so I formed them free, and free they must remain TUl they enthrall themselves. Milton, Paradise Lost, III 122—25 For Duns Scotus, the wiU has no example or analogue in the rest of nature. He takes it to be an elementary, simple self-activity, not derivable from anything else, and distinct from every sort of activity that is not the wiU. Its distinctive characteristic is its complete freedom with respect to action of opposite kinds. Since it is unique, it is not capable of being defined; but anyone can obtain an immediate awareness of the will as free. \"Whoever makes an act of wiU experiences in himself that he can also not wUl.\"1 \"Anyone can experience this in himself: when someone else presents to him something as good and even shows it as a good to be considered and wiUed, he can turn away from it and refuse to elicit any act of wiU towards it.\"8 That such extreme contingency , taken as an example of contingency in general, is underivable from any prior principles can be shown by the following argument: Inference is possible from the less perfect, i. e., the contingent, to the more perfect, i. e., the necessary, but the reverse is not possible. \"Therefore, it cannot be shown by means of some prior and distinct middle term, that being is necessary or contingent, nor could that part of the disjunction that is contingent be demonstrated, given that something is necessary. Thus, the statement 'Something is contingent', appears primarily true and not deductively demonstrable (demonsirdbilis propter quid).\" Scotus concludes at this point with a paraphrase of Avicenna's mUd witticism: \"So, those who deny 'something * A paper read before the Southern Society for Philosophy of Religion, Tallahassee, Florida, 5 March 1953. 1 Q. in Met. IX, q. 15, n. 15. Experitur enim qui vult se posse non velle. 8 Op. Ox. IV, d. 45, q. 10, n. 10. Hoc potest quilibet experiri in se ipso: cum quis offert sibi aliquod bonum, et etiam ostendit bonum ut bonum considerandum et volendum, potest se ab hoc avertere, et nullum actum voluntatis circa hoc elicere. 147 148/. R. CRESSWELL is contingent' ought to be exposed to be tormented, until they admit that it is possible not to be tortured.\"8 \"The wül in the act of willing is an immediate datum ... to demand proof (in this connection) is the mark of an Ul-educated man.\"4 Though the passages on contingency just quoted are concerned with contingent being as such, they obvioulsy provide the basis for his appeal to experience in any attempt to examine the nature of the wUl. Indeed, a chief emphasis in his whole phüosophic exposition is on what is or can be experienced. Let us now proceed to characterize the free will. In the Opus Oxoniense I, dist. 39, article 3, Duns Scotus says that the freedom of our wiU consists of three things: First, the will is free in regard to contrary acts; it can wiU or refrain from wUUng the same objective. Second, the wUl is free in regard to contrary objects; it can tend towards opposite objects. Third, the wiU is free in regard to contrary effects; it can choose among opposite objectives, and to be able to choose thus is to be able to produce opposite effects. Freedom of wül as such is found particularly in the second feature. If this second point is considered, we can see that the wiU can exercise successively two contrary acts. Can it also be true that it has this potentiaUty towards contrary acts simultaneously ? Suppose further that, in this single instant, it exercises a particular voUtion. To aU appearances, its freedom of choice would be exhausted in this single act, so that one could say that the act would fill its whole existence. However, this single voUtion would not be a necessitated one, and here is the proof. If the wül necessarily exercised this voUtion and since it would be a cause only in the single instant...",

      "abstract": "The moral sense is a quintessential part of human nature. As such, empathy is one of the most important instruments in the toolbox of the human mind. It is the trigger of altruistic motivation. However, from an evolutionary point of view, altruistic behaviour is costly. Kin altruism is worth the effort when it adds to the individual’s indirect fitness. In contrast, the benefit of altruistic behaviour towards strangers depends on the reciprocation of the other person. Helping a non-reciprocator lowers fitness. Therefore control mechanisms should be in place to fine-tune the amount of empathy displayed towards strangers, whereas this is less necessary for kin. I propose that two types of altruistic motivation occur. The first is primarily based on (maternal) attachment and affective empathy and is observed in many social mammals. The second depends on cognitive empathy and is only observed in primates and humans.",

      "title": "[The challenges of the ethics of personalism to clinical toxicology].",
      "abstract": "The fields of philosophical anthropology and the ethics of personalism overlap in the area of many difficult personal situations involving clinical toxicology. These therapeutic situations need an integral, multidimensional, and personal approach for both the patient and the toxicologist. This means that man is treated not only as a physical (biological) being but also there is an appreciation for the mental sphere, which includes rational, emotional, and spiritual elements while not forgetting that the human person is also part of the human community. Studying such an individual's personal decision as suicide, we must realize that it's not just physiological or biochemical poisons but also includes the poisoning of the psyche, as well as poisoning relationships with loved ones (family), poisoning social relations (in school or the workplace) and poisoning the spirit, in other words, there is no meaning in life itself, nor the meaning of God's existence, nor the meaning of faith, hope and love. Not only is there a greater \"variety of poisons\" than before, they are much more extensive and deep. For example, we can name environmental pollution, industrial poisons, chemical waste, genetic modification, powerful medications, or even the toxic social environment of evil ideas, malicious manipulation of the human mind (destructive religious sects). In approaching the challenges of clinical toxicology, the doctor must not only be a specialist in chemistry, biochemistry and pharmacology. What then is of future of toxicology because of this human dimension (anthropological, ethical and spiritual) of this teaching? As today marks the occasion of the 45th anniversary of the Clinic of Toxicology CM UJ, should we shape the ethos of young doctors who want to deal with toxicology seriously?",

      "abstract": "As long as we are awake and even while dreaming, a sense of “I am seeing, hearing, or doing, etc.” seems to be an inevitable content of any conscious experience. One may wonder whether it is ever possible in our ordinary lives to have an experience where the “I” is not present, or briefly, have a self-transcendent experience.  I describe below a few of my experiences of short duration that are quite ordinary with nothing mysterious about them and argue that they are all self-transcendent.  To explain how the self (ego) is present or not in an experience, I describe some properties characteristic of the self such as its sense of personal identity and ownership of action.  Manifestation of these properties in an experience indicates the presence of the self and absence of these properties indicates its absence.  In an act of observation, full attention paid to what is being observed seems to push every thought, including the self, out of the conscious mind and keep it fully occupied with the act of observation.  A characteristic property of the self-transcendent state seems to be that one can only recognize such a state as being free from the self, but one cannot prove that it is so because the outward effect of the state may be the same as that of an alternative state where the self is present.",

Moreover, they will each manifestly want others to conform to such beneficial norms and so each may aspire without fear of contradiction to speak for all in regulating another, whether in educating them, in enjoining conformity, or in correcting offenders. This will give the demands of their social norms a categorical, if still overrideable status. With those norms manifest—and their acceptance by everyone also manifest—they will each be disposed to commit to conforming and upholding those norms: to bet on themselves to do so, at risk of not being able to excuse a failure by invoking a misleading mind or a changed mind. Indeed, they will be committed to this line just by acquiescing in the expectations of others. Among the attitudes to which they will commit in this active or virtual way is the intention to obey and uphold relevant norms: in effect, to value universal conformity in a decisive way. In that case, they will treat the desiderata that explain the commitment as impartial values. And as they may recognize and commit to such values, so they may do so with more personal or sectional values as well.",

A man who takes up a system of divinity with a previous opinion, that either every part must be true, or the whole false, approaches the discussion with great disadvantage. No other system, which is founded upon moral evidence, would bear to be treated in the same manner. Nevertheless, in a certain degree, we are all introduced to our religious studies under this prejudication. And it cannot be avoided. The weakness of the human judgement in the early part of youth, yet its extreme susceptibility of impression, renders it necessary to furnish it with some opinions, and with some principles or other. Or indeed, without much express care, or much endeavour for this purpose, the tendency of the mind of man to assimilate itself to the habits of thinking and speaking which prevail around him, produces the same effect. That indifferency and suspense, that waiting and equilibrium of the judgement, which some require in religious matters, and which some would wish to be aimed at in the conduct of education, are impossible to be preserved.

      "title": "It might be supposed that the presence, in the same man,",
      "abstract": "It might be supposed that the presence, in the same man, of more than one intellectual element would facilitate his immediate celebrity. To a certain extent this is so, but it is so to a lesser extent than might be conjectured in the idleness of hypothesis. A man who has jointly great genius and great intelligence (like Shakespeare), or great genius and great talent (like Milton), does not accumulate in his time or in the next time the results of genius and the results of the other quality. For these different intellectual elements are interfused because they coexist in the man, and there is poured into the substance of intelligence or talent the sacred poison of genius; the drink is bitter, though it retain something of its common taste. The ancients mixed honey with wine and found it pleasant; but nectar cannot make any wine pleasant to the taste of the commonalty. A man who might have in himself, in some degree, genius, talent and intelligence, would be prepared to strike his time with his intelligence, his age with his talent and the generality of future times and ages with his genius. But as his genius would affect his talent and his talent and genius his intelligence — for things which coexist in the mind coexist by interfusion and not by simplesideness — the less would his talent be pure talent and so attract the wider generations, and the less would his intelligence be pure intelligence and so caress the simplicity of all presents. Any example will make this clear to all who understand by examples. A man of wit who makes, among his common fellows, a joke such as a wit of talent might cleverly devise, raises a general and appreciative laugh. This impure thing is pure intelligence. The man who will make, in the same company, a joke with a classical allusion, or with a stretch of intellectual wit, may show to the analyst that he has added something to intelligence, but, in his subdued effect on the hearers, he will have subtracted something from it. If the same man be furthermore a genius and happen to make such a joke as will clearly contain his genius and suffuse his intelligence with its colour, he will get upon the daltonism of every man before whom he makes a fool of his wisdom. It will be something like making a joke in a foreign language. The present has no second-sight, and the point remains in the scabbard.",

      "title": "The “Mark of Cain”",
      "abstract": "Abstract Chapter 3 focuses on the lengths to which people go to avoid seeing themselves, or being seen by others, as evil. This is rooted in people’s hard-wired need to belong: Just as murderous Cain was “marked” and banished by God in the ancient Hebrew story, being labeled an “evildoer” is the ultimate signifier of social exclusion. Thus, denial of one’s role (e.g., motivated forgetting), minimization of harm or intentionality (e.g., automatism, dissociation), and offering “good” (e.g., a moral mandate) or “good enough” (e.g., revenge) justifications for one’s behavior can all be used to deflect the label. Alternatively, people may try to neutralize the label by pointing to their moral credentials prior to the incident in question (moral licensing), insisting that they are no worse than those who judge them (a form of normalization), or declaring that they are immune to others’ judgments (asserting interpersonal power).",

      "title": "The Concept of Progress: III. The Scientific Phase",
      "abstract": "CIENCE begins when man learns to S measure his world or any part of it by definite objective standards. Theological and metaphysical explanations are the earlier and less critical analogues of the scientific explanations of phenomena. Science views processes from within; it studies relationships among the things themselves. Theology and metaphysics look upon concrete phenomena as extensions or consequences of a personality or of a principle which dwells or obtains outside of the phenomena themselves. Relationships among phenomena are viewed merely as secondary relationships derived from and dependent upon the primary relationships between the phenomena and the external causative personality or principle. Metaphysics and theology do not recognize primary relationships among mere phenomena, that is, the concrete perceptual objects of every day occurrence. Science grew up as an attempt to explain what appeared to be merely secondary and relatively inconsequential-to measure these interrelationships of things. Primnitive man was under the spell of the power of nature; it overwhelmed, oppressed, frightened, or inspired him. It was for him a mystical thing which he felt in the large, but which he did not comprehend in the concreteness of detail. He made his peace with the unseen powers of nature through attempts at propitiation, bargaining, mastering, intimidation, supplication, service-all of which were the methods used by one personality towards another. This was magic. But in it lay the seeds of scientific control. Magic could not give way to science until analysis of the relations of objects had reduced the personality concept of the world in some measure to a mechanistic or quantitative and intellectual, instead of a qualitative and affective, conception of relationships. Magic was based primarily upon a personality conception of the world. Science, or intellectual analysis and quantitative measurement of phenomena, is based primarily upon a mechanistic view of the world and its phenomenal relationships. Thus the growth of science is synonymous with the abstraction of a world of things away from a world of attitudes, or of personalities, of spirits and of powers. This abstraction and isolation of impersonal data away from personality attitudes naturally first came in the world of physics or relatively inert masses. We are just now learning to abstract complex human personalities into quantitative and intellectualized explanations, or to proceed from the qualitative personality to the quantitative mechanistic explanations of human organisms. This same kind of substitution was made rather impersonally for animal organisms below man at a somewhat earlier date, and physiology became a definite biochemical and biophysical science. A quantitative science of human psychology is just being established as behaviorism and sociology is now beginning to emerge from the limbo of affective attitudes and emotional values into the measurement of causes and consequences, or of quantitative correlations. The Greek philosophers of Asia Minor, and later those of Athens and of Magna Graecia, began the process of mechanistic abstraction in announcing quantitative causal relationships among the phenomena of every day life and in the fields of the organization of matter and of astronomy",

      "abstract": "The received view holds that to judge something or someone as sentimental is to condemn. This account holds that an emotion is sentimental where it is excessive, misjudges its object and involves savouring a positive self-image. This paper presents two different challenges to the received view. First, the positive idealizations of sentimentality are no worse than other cognitive biases pervasive in our ordinary mental life. Moreover, where, as is often the case, sentimentality is good for our well-being, sentimentality looks broadly rational. Second, and more radically, sentimentality is not always to be evaluated in epistemic terms. Rather, sentimentality, often at least, is a matter of reminding us of or re-orientating our non-cognitive affective attachments. Sentimental works can renew or revolutionize our affective attachments for the good, whether that be towards love, family, causes, or the oppressed. Hence, in both art and life, sentimentality is sometimes a very good thing.",

Despite this state of affairs, not everyone will experience a sense of aloneness, especially if other people are imagined or if the person has no desire to be with them at that moment. Similarly, a person may be surrounded by other people and still experience an uncomfortable sense of being alone, particularly if he or she feels excluded from participating with them in a meaningful way. Aloneness does not refer to an objective circumstance but to a psychological mode of being, and whether it is experienced as pleasurable or painful, problematic or liberating, always depends upon the meaning that each specific situation has for the person undergoing it.",

Let any man, even of the coldest head and soberest industry, analyse the idea of what he calls his interest; he will find that it consists chiefly of certain images of decency, beauty and order, variously combined into one system, the idol which he seeks to enjoy by labour, hazard, and self-denial. It is on this account of the last consequence to regulate these images by the standard of nature and the general good; otherwise the imagination, by heightening some objects beyond their real excellence and beauty, or by representing others in a more odious or terrible shape than they deserve, may of course engage us in pursuits utterly inconsistent with the laws of the moral order.",

The study of motivation should stress ultimate rather than partial goals, ends rather than means to ends. a) not only conscious but also unconscious motivations must be accounted for in a theory of motivation. There are, customarily, different cultural paths to the same goal. Therefore, conscious, specific, local desires are not so useful for motivation theory as fundamental, unconscious goals. Motivated behavior, either preparatory or consummatory, must be understood to be a channel through which many needs may be expressed or satisfied. Usually acts have more than one motivation. Practically all organismic states are to be understood as motivated. Man is a perpetually wanting animal; the appearance of a need rests on prior situations, on other prepotent needs; needs or desires must be arranged in hierarchies of prepotency. Lists of drives will get us no place for various reasons. Any classification of motivations must deal with the problem of level or specificity of classification. Classifications of motivations must be based upon goals rather than upon instigating drives. Motivation theory must be anthropocentric, not animalcentric. The situation or the field in which the organism reacts must be taken into account but it must be done with a dynamic interpretation of the situation or the field. Not only the integration of the organism must be taken into account but also the possibility of isolated, specific, partial or segmental responses must also be included.12",

      "abstract": "Abstract The striving for and experience of freedom are of central importance in human life. Our concern here is not freedom as a characteristic of a social (political) system or as a social value, but the experience of external and internal freedom in the natural surroundings of everyday life. There are situations that offer little restraint, in terms of both physical obstacles and social pressures. In such a situation a person experiences external freedom: If one wanted to, one could leave the situation or do something different within the situation without an effort to overcome physical obstacles and/or without being blamed (punished) by social agents. Thus, the concept of external freedom implies both being able and being allowed to do what one wants to do. There are, on the other hand, situations or activities that one can leave or change without acting against one’s personal norms, and feeling guilty. In this case we speak of internal freedom. In this sense, a person, even if experiencing an irresistible impulse to act in a certain way, is internally free to act if the desire is fully compatible with his or her values, that is, if he or she does not have to overcome anticipated feelings of guilt.",

      "abstract": "This text explains the importance of the concept of \"Being Me\" in the family and what needs to be done about it. \"Being me\" is possible when the individual knows himself, is spiritually strong, determines his priorities, knows and fulfills his limits and responsibilities, and is also aware of the psychological wounds he has experienced in the past. This process begins with the individual’s increasing deep awareness of self-knowledge. The process of self-knowledge enables the individual to explore his inner world and understand emotional states. “Being me” requires being spiritually strong. Spiritually strong people manage their emotions, thoughts and behaviors in a way that provides them success in life. Determining priorities means understanding what the individual values in life and acting accordingly. Likewise, knowing responsibilities and boundaries allows for a healthy balance in social relationships and maintaining the necessary space for personal growth. Recognizing wounds means recognizing past traumas and taking steps towards the healing process. It refers to the individual’s selfishness of prioritizing his own needs in the process of \"being me\" as \"not being able to break away from me\". On the contrary, it refers to situations such as being unable to protect one’s own freedom and personal identity and creating one’s own happiness through the happiness and preferences of one’s partner, as \"getting lost in you\". In this context, the process of \"Being Me\" is an important journey for the individual to discover himself and become spiritually stronger and mature. When spouses who have completed this process come together, a family that is happy, healthy and knows what it wants is formed.",

Adults are “such moral creatures,” he wrote, “that we invariably react to any generalization regarding human behavior … with questions of immediate applicability to conduct.”1 Judging others quickly, adults neglect to ask what human needs they might understand if, on witnessing others’ behavior, they would first try to understand the meaning of such behavior. Instead, they draw conclusions, assign blame, and prescribe remedies. By middle age in particular, superego development has taken its adult as prisoner, leading adults to fear that in their expected-to-be-perfect state, they are far from being as good as they should be, as far as childhood is now distant from the self. As Erikson had illustrated in his prejudice imagery, this leads to self-judgment, to the magnifying of others’ quirks, and to the defensive projection of real or feared flaws onto others. Observed flaws are one’s negative identity; they come from and are deflected backward onto the accusing self.",

If we have suffered or expect to suffer some willful injury from a man, or if he is in any way offensive to us, we dislike him; and dislike easily rises into hatred. Such feelings, if experienced in a moderate degree, are not clearly expressed by any movement of the body or features, excepting perhaps by a certain gravity of behavior, or by some ill temper. Few individuals, however, can long reflect about a hated person, without feeling and exhibiting signs of indignation or rage. But if the offending person be quite insignificant, we experience merely disdain or contempt. If, on the other hand, he is all-powerful, then hatred passes into terror, as when a slave thinks about a cruel master, or a savage about a bloodthirsty malignant deity. Most of our emotions are so closely connected with their expression, that they hardly exist if the body remains passive the nature of the expression depending in chief part on the nature of the actions which have been habitually performed under this particular state of the mind. A man, for instance, may know that his life is in the extremist peril, and may strongly desire to save it, yet may exclaim as did Louis XVI, when surrounded by a fierce mob, ‘Am I afraid? feel my pulse.’ So a man may intensely hate another, but until his bodily frame is affected he cannot be said to be enraged.",

      "abstract": "Personalism is the thesis that only persons (self-conscious agents) and their states and characteristics exist, and that reality consists of a society of interacting persons. Typically, a personalist will hold that finite persons depend for their existence and continuance on God, who is the Supreme Person, having intelligence and volition. Personalists are usually idealists in metaphysics and construct their theories of knowledge by inference from the data of self-awareness. They tend to be nonutilitarian in ethics and to place ultimate value in the person as a free, self-conscious, moral agent, rather than in either mental states or in apersonal states of affairs. Typically, holding that a good God will not allow what has intrinsic value to lose existence, they believe in personal survival of death. The term ‘personalism’, even as a term for philosophical systems, has myriad uses. There is said to be, for example, atheistic personalism (as in the case of McTaggart, famous for embracing both atheism and the immortality of the soul), absolute idealistic personalism (Hegel, Royce, Calkins), and theistic personalism (Bowne, Brightman, Bertocci). Leibniz and Berkeley are seen as early personalists; both were theists and idealists. Kant, while not strictly a personalist, was influential in personalism’s history. In particular, B.P. Bowne (1847–1910) borrowed freely from Kant, while refusing to accept a Kantian transcendentalism in which our basic concepts or categories apply in a knowledge-giving way only to appearances and not to reality. R.H. Lotze made personality and value central to his worldview, and was a European precursor of American personalism.",

If humans are to survive in a way that has any similarity to what people have prized up till as being the essence of human life, the narcissistic motivations, psychoanalyst believe, must come into the ascendancy. Classical analysis would have answered by pointing out that the absence of a visible genital in the little girl is of crucial importance in psychic development and leads to a severe wound in self-esteem that later self-confidence remains low and idealizability therefore lessened. Psychoanalyst discuss psychic development, and he speak instead of the \"empathic responsive matrix\" which the child needs for psychological survival and growth.",

The behaviorist's psychology is based on reflexes—<i>your reflexes</i>. A great many years ago, I took rather seriously the often expressed hope of my friends in physics, my friends in physiology, and even in psychology, that we ought to have an<i>objective</i>psychology.

      "abstract": "It would widely be agreed that the question of the significance and value of tolerance can usefully be considered by seeing tolerance as one central aspect or component of affording due respect to others. Of course being tolerant of others and rendering due respect to them are not equivalent. The latter comprehends a far wider range of attitudes and actions towards others than the former does, but I am inclined to think that all that having a tolerant regard towards others involves will be part of granting them the respect which is their due. That is, all failures in tolerance will be failures in respect, but not vice versa. I am not able to say clearly what subclass of, loosely, attitudes and actions constitutive of respect for others comprises being tolerant of them. Tolerance appears largely to take as its target beliefs and attitudes of others which form their conception of the great ends and proper conduct of life, and actions so far as these are exhibitive of or consequent upon these beliefs and attitudes. Respect clearly extends additionally to cover for instance respect for the physical integrity of another as such. This indicated demarcation is, of course, extremely vague, but, fortunately, nothing in what I want to go on to consider depends upon getting this more precise.",

It suggests to please to appease, to be seductive to shape minds, to make other people share your values, to get international support...or the contrary. The success of the concept, in economics and geopolitics is symptomatic: the idea that you could gain power - that is, increase the probability that the other will behave in the way you wish - softly, without using violence or giving counterparts has everything to please the occidental elites. The soft power and the hope of expanding it to the rest of the world are appealing to those who have already tasted success from their political and economic position and to those who are not too dissatisfied with the world as it is. When a single word serves so many purposes, it legitimately raises ideological suspicions. Such ambiguities have a relationship with the evolution of the meaning of the word itself but also with its semantic ecology (the other words it replaces or generates) and with its mediology; that is, the material ways and means of such a spiritual process.",

This mental element consists of three types, namely reason, sense, and will. As individual beings, human beings trying to fulfill their own interests or the pursuit of happiness.

      "abstract": "The social inferiority of an elderly person stems from his physical inferiority--actual or alleged but always possible. And yet this \"inferior\" body is paradoxically hypertrophic: at first it masks the person, then takes up its space until it negates it. Hence, an elderly person is not only a body but a lonely body. In his relations with other people, his body becomes a receiver, a receptacle and a source of communication. Social violence underlies relations with elderly people: such violence may be deceptive, widespread and continuous or, on the other hand, manifest, episodic and conspicuous. In the first case it may be a way of assigning subalternate roles to them in relation to the efficiency expected of them or a way of mythologizing their condition as one of pseudo-happiness. In the second case is generally relates to assaults, thefts, bag-snatching, etc. In any case, however, communication with them entails violence: their body perceives this and reacts to it. This is why their body's language is violent: their body cries out, it is stunned and it is acted upon (even--and unavoidably--in relations with a therapist).",

Status is both achieved and ascribed, and the degree to which one or the other contributes more draws the thin line between the real and apparent. To achieve means \"to carry out successfully (accomplish);\" \"to get or attain as a result of exertion (reach),\" or \"to attain a desired end or aim (to become successful).\"2 To ascribe, on the other hand, comes from the restored spelling of the Middle English ascrive, etymologically derives from the Old French. ascrivre, \"to attribute, inscribe,\" and the Latin ascribere \"to write in, to add to in a writing,\" from ad- \"to\" + scribere \"to write.\"3 To ascribe is to refer to a supposed cause, source, or author, and \"suggests an inferring of cause, quality or authorship\" as in the case of \"forged paintings formerly ascribed to masters.\"4 Achievement rightfully bestows an earned \"headship,\" implied in its etymology from the Old.French. achever \"to finish,\" from the phrase à chef (venir) \"at an end, finished,\" the Vulgate Latin *accapare, from the Latin ad caput (venire). Literally, both the Old.French and Latin phrases mean \"to come to a head,\" from the Latin caput \"head.\"5 Ascription is flattery at best; but worse when self-generated and perpetuated. Are vicarious experiences that become \"personal accomplishments,\" casual visits and observations that become \"further training and fellowships,\" comments and editing (even supervisory positions) that metamorphose into \"research and co-authorships\" any different from the fictitious medals of a dictator? Awards beget awards. Those who are thus preceded by reputation may loom \"larger than life.\" Do such giants stand on feet of clay? Our circles are a microcosm of the nation and world around us. Public servants who believe the fictions crafted by themselves and their coutillons continue to claim the right to rule (rather than the obligation to serve). Are we dazzled by the dream?

Et tu? _________________________ The first meeting of the Asia Pacific Association of Medical Journal Editors (APAME) was held in Seoul, the Republic of Korea last May 4-5, 2008 co-hosted by the World Health Organization Western Pacific Regional Office.6 APAME's vision, it was agreed, would be to promote health care through the dissemination of quality health information in the Asia Pacific Region. The association also established the following aims: To upgrade publishing standards of health journals and books, paper-based or electronic; To develop an aggregated indexing system for health articles published in the Asia Pacific Region; and To enhance optimal access to health articles. The development of the Western Pacific Region Index Medicus (WPRIM) and the Global Health Library (GHL) are much-needed efforts to ensure the dissemination of and universal access to reliable health information essential to health development. These efforts will level the playing field for authors, editors, peer reviewers, publishers and subscribers in developing countries, elevating loco-regional research and publishing to the global arena. Following our continued compliance with established standards, we anticipate inclusion of the Philipp J Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg in the WPRIM. Through its President Gil M. Vicente, and the Board of Trustees, our Society blazes new trails to lead us beyond the confines of self-directed concerns toward new horizons of hope for our various publics, present and future. Efforts aimed at health-promotion and disease-prevention, side by side with involvement in ecological and environmental concerns may prove to be as, or even more important, than the equally quixotic pursuit of cutting-edge diagnostic and therapeutic advances. What use are these when they are beyond the reach of most? \"When the time of our particular sunset comes, our 'thing,' our accomplishment, won't matter a great deal. But the clarity and concern with which we have loved others will speak with vitality of the great gift of life we have been to each other.\"7 &nbsp",

Causes and occasions are of the most various types, difficult to compare between persons, often moulded by the currents of the day, inherited ways of thinking, experiences and environment. Querulants are personalities, who, after colliding with the legal system and having had their own claims dismissed, suffer from an often chief and irremediable feeling of being victim of an injustice. They cannot understand that, what is in due form valid can, when, scrutinized with the greatest sense of justice and practical common sense, impress upon someone as injustice. The submission to the unattainable, the parting from hopes, expectations and claims do not materialize. The step by step stiffening readiness for action can be confined to the lawsuit matter, it comes however about, that it extends to further spheres of life. Escalations occur in particular then, when the authorities course of action, courts of justice and opponents are felt as tyrants or mortal threat. A person deriving a meaning from his entire life or events, which he interprets for himself, makes his relations to the community and Law fragile [90]. Are presented within the framework of differential diagnostic distinctions, manifestations of querulous behaviour among abnormal personalities, neurotic disorders and schizophrenic psychoses under psychiatric aspects. Brought into sharper focus are the psychogenic psychoses, which became manifest in the USA, GUS and scandinavian countries in connection with serious querulous evolutions. Hints to decision of the supreme court and forensic psychiatric expert opinion conclude the article.",

The results of the investigation were that some Others were viewed with fear and some rather neutrally, but only very few with disregard.

      "abstract": "Predefinablessense: Things can be held or beheld, defined or dealt with, because they inhabit a sense-dimension. To see things is to see past them. The here and now are meaningful only in a distance and a span. The apparently immediate needs a medium in which to appear.excess: Things surpass their sense. They are more than the mediating dimension in which they are met. Their excess can elude definition, resist visibility, and solicit reinterpretation.Definitionsbeing: the sense of excess and the excess over sense. The concept of being indicates nonconceptuality: to grasp a thing as something that is (an entity) is to acknowledge that it surpasses the grasping. To recognize something as an entity is to experience it, within a sense-dimension, as exceeding that dimension.Being as such pertains to any entity that can be met in any way. Particular ways of being pertain to particular kinds of entities, with their characteristic senses and ways of exceeding sense.Scholium: As excess, being is often called existence. As sense, being is often called essence. The distinction is useful, but the experiences of existence and essence are normally interdependent.From a logical point of view, being appears as the separate functions of existential quantification and predication. But the capacity to make existential assertions (more broadly, to recognize excess) is tightly linked to the capacity to assign predicates (more broadly, to make sense of entities).emergency: a clash between sense and excess. An event in which excess challenges sense and resists being interpreted, so that sense has trouble getting a purchase on entities.The Emergency would be the primordial clash between sense and excess, the contest that generates the contenders as such, first establishing sense with excess as its counterpart.Unsettling emergencies are non-primordial emergencies, events in which some settled sense is unsettled by some excess.To emerge as emergent is to originate in a clash between sense and excess and call for an interpretation-to issue from an emergency and become an issue, hovering, unresolved and dissonant, demanding to be addressed.Scholium: What is most often called an emergency, the irruption of a threat that demands an immediate response, does not necessarily challenge sense, since the interpretation of the irruption may follow well-worn paths. But such an irruption always has the potential for trauma and surprise, so it can become an emergency as defined here.Emergencies as defined here are not necessarily threatening; they can bring pleasure and delight. Sense can be unsettled by an experience of wonder or rapture.Unsettling emergencies range from a passing confusion to a conceptual revolution to the shattering of a world. The degree to which an emergency can be understood within established sense-dimensions is a matter for judgment. Mature judgment develops through experiences of emergencies of various scopes.An emergent issue may hover in the background, even though it seems to have been resolved. The emergent is pacified when it takes the form of an answered question. It is dormant when it is not even recognized as a question.The Emergency can be defined in terms of sense and excess, as their origin; but it itself would be neither sense nor excess. To define it is not to understand it, nor to reduce it to the terms of the definition.Postulates 1. There are entities whose own being emerges for them. Call them we.1.1. Our excess over sense emerges for us. That we are here, that we exist and may not exist-regardless of how we may interpret our existence-has become an issue for us. We are faced with death as the ultimate excess, the extreme withdrawal from the sphere of sense. This issue can fade into the background as we take our existence for granted.1.2. The sense of our excess emerges for us. We are faced with the question of who we are, the demand to interpret ourselves as entities. …",

But these are <italic>actions</italic> nevertheless, in the sense that they are not mere happenings. While agents may be passive in an important sense when acting spontaneously, they are not thereby necessarily victims of forces acting upon them (from either “outside” or “inside” their own bodies and minds). The central claim of this chapter is that spontaneous actions can be, in central cases, “attributable” to agents, by which I mean that they reflect upon the character of those agents. This claim is made on the basis of a care-based theory of attributability. Attributability licenses (in principle) what some theorists call “aretaic” appraisals. These are evaluations of an action in light of an agent’s character or morally significant traits.",

In all living things there is an ebb and flow this is found in the spiritual and life in very great measure. The growth is not necessarily maintained for long, it has setbacks. It is not necessary that one should notice growth. “The Kingdom of God cometh not by observation’. We may notice it or we may not. In the lives of the saints from their own words it would seem they were often not conscious of it, did not seem to themselves to have seen any improvement, sometimes quite the reverse. St Francis of Assisi says many things that suggest that he saw no increase in his knowledge or love. So to notice the growth is not necessary to us; that other people should notice it—yes, but that we should—no. It is not ordinarily evident to the individual himself.",

      "title": "Self-Consciousness and Intersubjectivity",
      "abstract": "NOTHING APPEARS LESS PROBLEMATIC than self-consciousness. Without it, no inquiry seems possible, for how can one seek knowledge unless one is aware of undertaking that quest? Moreover, consciousness of anything other than the self is always plagued with knowing something whose existence cannot lie in the consciousness of it. As Descartes observed, whenever one represents an object different from one's consciousness, it is always doubtful whether that object exists or corresponds with its representation. (1) By contrast, insofar as consciousness of one's self-consciousness is the very being of self-consciousness, the gap between object and representation here seems uniquely absent. Not only is my representation of myself as self-conscious constitutive of my being self-conscious, but nothing prevents that representation from corresponding to what it is about. This privileged certainty, however, generates skepticism regarding knowledge of anything other than one's own consciousness, including other minds. If knowledge of self-conscious is secured by its identity of subject and object, of knowing and what knowing is knowing of, wherever that identity is lacking, cognition confronts the dilemma of bridging a gap that is insurmountable if knowing has no access to its object other than by representing it. The yawning solipsism that attends the privileged self-certainty of self-consciousness is not mitigated by the oft alleged dependence of consciousness upon self-consciousness. To paraphrase Kant, consciousness of any object is possible only if consciousness relates itself to its own representation of the object. Otherwise, the putative knowledge belongs to no one and there is no consciousness of the represented object. If this relation of consciousness to its own representation is self-consciousness, then there can be no consciousness of an object without a simultaneous self-consciousness. (2) The problem with securing this dependency is that the privileged certainty of self-consciousness renders suspect whether consciousness can ever relate to anything but itself. So long as self-consciousness is construed to be primary, it remains doubtful whether there can be any consciousness of a non-self to accompany self-consciousness. The solitary primacy of self-consciousness, however, is just as questionable as is how consciousness can be aware of itself. II To begin with, self-consciousness must presuppose consciousness if to be self-conscious is to be conscious of one's consciousness. In that case, consciousness must be present, relating to an object it distinguishes from itself. Consciousness may always involve self-relation in that consciousness relates to an object only by relating to its own mental content. Nonetheless, in order for this self-relation to involve intentionality, to be about something objective rather than subjective, consciousness must treat its own mental content as the determination of something independently given from which it is disengaged. Without disengaging itself from the same content to which it stands in self-relation, consciousness reverts to a preconscious psyche that feels nothing but its own feeling self, never attaining an opposition of subject and object. For this reason, the relation of consciousness to its own mental content is not equivalent to consciousness of consciousness. Consciousness's relation to its own representation is only part of consciousness, a part that must be accompanied by a relation to that content as something other to consciousness. Accordingly, consciousness does not collapse into self-consciousness. Because mind is enabled to be conscious of something other than itself only by detaching itself from its own mental content, neither self-consciousness nor consciousness can be primary. Just as consciousness depends upon the disengagement by which self-feeling becomes sensation of something objective, so self-consciousness depends upon consciousness as the object of its own disengaged awareness. …",

      "abstract": "Feeling left out has been shown to trigger primal, automatic responses in an attempt to compensate for threats to social belongingness. Such responses typically involve reconnection with other human beings. However, four experiments provide evidence that exposure to or interaction with anthropomorphic consumer products (i.e., products featuring characteristics of being alive through design, interaction, intelligence, responsiveness, and/or personality) can also satisfy (at least partially) social needs, ultimately mitigating previously documented effects of social exclusion. Specifically, interacting with anthropomorphic (vs. non-anthropomorphic) products following social exclusion reduces 1) the need to exaggerate the number of one’s current social connections, 2) the anticipated need to engage with close others in the future, and 3) the willingness to engage in prosocial behavior. These effects are driven by a need for social assurance, rather than positive affect. Moreover, an important boundary condition exists: drawing attention to the fact that an anthropomorphic product is not actually alive (i.e., the product does not provide genuine human interaction) limits its ability to fulfill social needs. Thus, in a time when consumer products are becoming increasingly anthropomorphic in design and function, the results reveal potentially important consequences for human-to-human relationships.",

More comprehensive insights into the Oedipus myths than those offered by Freud reveal that they epitomize not only superficial incest fears, but also more devastating uncertainties as to dependent, survival, and other relationships among parents and offspring, later \"identity crises\" in all concerned, the<i>hubris</i>of asymptotic human aspirations after unattainable \"truths\" and man's ultimate defiance of Fate itself. Animal experiments also demonstrate the devastating effects of stressful unpredictabilities. The clinical relevance of the Uncertainty Principle is that all therapy (Greek—<i>therapeien</i>, service) is effective only insofar as it increases the recipient's confidence as to his physical well-being, alleviates his concerns about his interpersonal securities and fosters comforting theophilosophic beliefs.",

      "abstract": "When looking at other people, we can readily tell how attentive (or distracted) they are. Some cues to this are fairly obvious (as when someone stares intensely at you), but others seem more subtle. For example, increased cognitive load or emotional arousal causes one's pupils to dilate. This phenomenon is frequently employed as a physiological measure of arousal, in studies of pupillometry. Here, in contrast, we employ it as a stimulus for social perception. Might the human visual system be naturally and automatically engaging in \"unconscious pupillometry\"? We demonstrate that faces rendered invisible (through continuous flash suppression) enter awareness faster when their pupils are dilated. This cannot be explained by appeal to differential contrast, differential attractiveness, or spatial attentional biases, and the effect vanishes when the identical stimuli are presented in socially meaningless ways (e.g., as shirt buttons or facial moles). These results demonstrate that pupil dilation is prioritized in visual processing even outside the focus of conscious awareness, in a form of unconscious \"attentional contagion.\" (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved).",

The need to be aware of the beauty of the earth, of the smallness of man in the infinity of heaven, to recognize an unknown power greater than he, which he has called God, creates in man a desire to share this beauty, this power, this grandeur with someone. The loneliness of spirit is a part of man and it cannot be erased from his memory. It can be allayed, however, by a spiritual communion with others. It acts as a motivation for man to find reassurance that he is not alone: he needs the security of the knowledge that there are those who believe in him and love him. He also needs to try to understand his relationship to them and to God.",

      "abstract": "Search activity (SA) is the behavioral and mental activity that is oriented to changes of the environment or of the subject's view and approach to the environment according to personal needs without the definite probability forecast of the outcomes of such activity, but with a regular consideration of the outcomes in the process of active behavior. Dream's lucidity (the subject's realization that he/she is dreaming) protects dreamer from awakenings during emotionally disturbing or frustrating dreams, because lucid dreams allow subject to feel separated from the dream events that may cause a feeling of helplessness. Due to such a protection from awakenings that can bring subject back to the frustration in wakefulness, subject can turn in the further sleep to normal non-lucid dreams that are restoring subject's SA in the subsequent wakefulness (activity in the uncertain situation with the feedback between behavior and its outcome). It is the advantage of lucid dreams. Their disadvantage is that due to the separation from the dream events that are in lucid dreams accepted as rationalized dreams, not as real stories where the dreamer acts like in wakefulness, their ability to restore SA is decreased until they are not displaced by the normal non-lucid dreams accepted as real stories.",

      "title": "Spirituality and Religiosity as Correlates of Happiness among Elderly : a Gender Study",
      "abstract": "Happiness is a multidimensional construct comprising of emotional and cognitive elements. It is related with positive emotions whereas intellectual, emotional and spiritual growth balance our material pursuits and make us happy. Happiness can be achieved provided one has the wisdom of discovery, the wisdom of contentment, the wisdom of gratitude, the wisdom of giving and wisdom of self-actualization. Spirituality is to some extent an one-to-one communication with the divine without the influence of any organization or a set of dogmatic views. It is based more on personal experiences rather than the experience of others. Religion may be defined as a way of life revealed in emotional expressions and inspired by faith in God or in a supernatural power which controls and guides the action of man and the destiny of world. Man often feels that his life is incomplete and imperfect. He longs for perfection. This longing makes him to seek the help of some supernatural power which can do for him things that he cannot do for himself. Hence, the objectives of the present research were framed to study the state of happiness, spirituality and religiosity among male and female elderly and to study the relationship and contribution of spirituality and religiosity towards the state of happiness. The sample comprised of 360 elderly persons (180 males and 180 females) in the age group 65years and above, only those elderly were selected for the sample who were leading a retired life, were not suffering from any deadly disease and belonged to middle socio-economic status families. The sample was equally distributed over the three cultural zones of Punjab naming Malwa, Majha and Doaba. Data were collected through questionnaire-cum-interview method. Results revealed that significantly more happiness was perceived by elderly males as compared to their female counterparts. Positive and significant relation between spirituality and state of happiness but non-significant relation between religiosity and state of happiness among elderly were found. Correlation analysis showed positive and significant relationship of happiness with spirituality but negative and non-significant relationship of happiness with religiosity among elderly.",

      "title": "Pre-Reflective Self-Awareness in Psychotic Disorders",
      "abstract": "Disorders of the self figure prominently in psychotic experiences. Subjects de­scribe that “alien” thoughts are inserted in their mind by foreign powers, can sometimes hear their thoughts aloud or describe complex voices interacting with each other. Such experiences can be conceptualized in the framework of a Philosophical Anthropology, which suggests that human experience is characterized by centric and excentric positionality: subjects experience their environment centered around their enlived body and at the same time can reflect upon their place in a shared lifeworld from an excentric point of view. Pre-reflective self awareness has been suggested to ensure that subjects can identify their own thoughts or actions as belonging to themselves, even when they reflect upon them from an excentric point of view. This pre-reflective self awareness appears to be impaired during psychotic experiences, when subjects no longer identify thoughts in their own stream of consciousness as belonging to themselves and instead attribute them to an outside agent. Among several potential causes, it is suggested that such impairments can be due to discrimi­natory or traumatic experiences, which affect the enlived (centric) position of a person and make her feel encircled and deeply threatened by aversive powers. As a consequence, the afflicted individual may fundamentally distance herself from her current centric position in a hostile environment, at the price of experiencing her own thoughts or actions as alien. Philosophical Anthropology may thus help to explain how social exclusion, discrimination and traumatization can promote psychotic experiences and why social support is of primary importance for any treatment of psychosis.",

      "title": "Speaking of Elves, Dragons, and Werewolves",
      "abstract": "Abstract Much has been written on how individuals construct and maintain their identities through the stories they tell about themselves and the stories others tell about them. Often, but not always, there is enough convergence between these inner and outer stories not to cause significant conflict. However, it is also the case that certain identities are deemed more acceptable than others, and, while such acceptability may wax and wane for some identities, others remain very much marginalized and excluded. Such is the case of Other-than-human (OtH) identities—Otherkin, therians, vampires, and the like: How is it possible, and what does it mean, for an individual who is human in appearance and acting in the human world to self-identify as Otherkin—that is as an other-worldly, mythical, or fantastical creature such as an elf, dragon, or werewolf—or as therian (i.e., a this-worldly animal such as a dog, wolf, bear)? The visible disjunction between individuals’ experienced identities and the perceived reality of others raises hermeneutical issues. Following general reflections on narrative hermeneutics this chapter explores the process of “awakening”—the realization or coming to understand oneself as Otherkin or therian—and origin stories. The authors discuss OtH identities as “believed-in imaginings,” the limits of narrative acceptability, and how features of unnatural narratives might help in interpreting OtH identity narratives.",

      "title": "Problems of Corporate Culture",
      "abstract": "Abstract If respect for autonomy is a moral requirement, then it is good, other things being equal, to permit people to do what they want to do. Other things are not equal in an organization, which almost by definition creates relationships that entail obligations and other limits on autonomy, but organizations can also increase one’s autonomy, which in any case remains an important moral consideration. Autonomy is not simply a matter of doing what one wants: if it were, then the weak-willed person, the addict, and the victim of brainwashing would all be autonomous. The threat to autonomy in the organization comes in part from the organization’s power to compel people to do what they do not want to do and have no legitimate obligation to do and also from people’s doing exactly what they want to do; people may act on desires they prefer not to have or would prefer not to have if they thought about them. Chapter 5 argued that to do what one wants to do when one wants to do something that is not the object of a rational desire is to act less than fully autonomously. The distinction between first-order and second-order desires provides us with an insight into human motivation but does not by itself enable us to distinguish between autonomous desires and others, since second order desires too may result from addiction or brainwashing. If an organization affects Smith’s second-order desires in a way that serves the interests of the stockholders or managers but not of Smith, then we surely have some reason to say that her autonomy has been violated. Defining autonomy, Chapter 5 showed, is a difficult philosophical problem; there is a practical difficulty, too, for the manager who wants to do what every manager has a moral obligation to do, which is to manage an organization that respects autonomy in a way that is consistent with effectively achieving legitimate corporate objectives.",

We would not be inclined to recognize rights were it not for the conviction that individuals genuinely are owed some measure of sovereignty over their own lives, that a person’s life is deficient unless it is directed by his own will. Self-direction as an essential component of human good is one postulate of an ethic with an individualistic core. It is not the only postulate, however; a person’s path to perdition can be one he consciously and deliberately chooses for himself. Perhaps Socrates is persuasive in arguing that the person who so chooses must lack some element of knowledge concerning the badness of the condition toward which he guides himself, but lack of omniscience is the common human condition, not a myopia that blinds a wretched few. At any rate, there is no reason to think that self-direction is incompatible with ignorance, viciousness, bad luck, or any of the numerous other shortcomings that can debilitate a life.

      "title": "What Is General Semantics?: A Personal View.",
      "abstract": "Sometimes when people ask What General Semantics?, don't want to answer. My reluctance to categorize general semantics arises from the general semantics principle of non-identity. This postulates that no two things are identical in all respects. Suppose say, a Such a sentence uses a form of is called the is-of-identity. It violates the non-identity principle. In effect, I've said, individual noun (Pat) equals class noun (politician), X identical to Y, identical to This seems harmless, you say. Not so! Tunnel Vision I've confused the specific with the general, confused things with words, and imposed linguistic limitations that do not reflect the rich diversity of a living human who has personality, hopes, habits, a certain physique, etc. I've reduced Pat to a label, politician. My self-imposed tunnel vision will prejudge and damage my relationship with Pat. By treating this individual as identical to a class, category, or group, can't help but think and act as if all politicians are alike. If a particular politician has disappointed me, will probably react badly to all. Labels That Limit Suppose we have a task to do, and we only have a We can say, I can't do it, only have a screwdriver. In practice, we can use a screwdriver to drive screws, to hammer, chisel, lever, wedge, garden, open cans, crack ice, stir liquids, etc. Similarly, we can use the numerous tools of general semantics to achieve diverse goals. Hence my reluctance to limit general semantics with is-of-identity labeling. Yet to describe, we must focus, select, abstract. Incidentally, a key formulation of the system of general semantics says that we process information at biological and verbal levels by abstracting, by leaving things out. We've chosen not to describe the system by means of the is-of-identity, by what it is. We can describe something by what it does. Success and Survival think of general semantics as a system for making evaluations vital to success and survival. By evaluating, mean our processing of perceptions and inferences as influenced by existing conscious and unconscious assumptions. Evaluations, not necessarily conscious ones, involve our thoughts, feelings, judgments, decisions, etc. Generally we do something as a result. Evaluating leads to appropriate or inappropriate action. We might describe general semantics as an integrated system for improving our thinking, evaluating, communicating, etc. Of course, in doing so we've only just begun. Alfred Korzybski formulated general semantics in the first half of this century in his major work, Science and Sanity, and he continued to write and lecture about general semantics until his death in 1950. Numerous educators, writers, and editors have continued to develop and disseminate his work, including Irving J. Lee, Wendell Johnson, Harry Weinberg, Francis Chisholm, Kenneth Johnson, S. I. Hayakawa, Elwood Murray, Russell Joyner, Robert Pula, Anatol Rapoport, Mary Morain, D. David Bourland, Jr., Susan Presby Kodish, Bruce I. Kodish, Earl Hautala, Jeremy Klein, and Gregory Sawin. Beyond Aristotle Korzybski called general semantics a non-Aristotelian system because its many-valued logic goes beyond the two-valued, either-or logic attributed to Aristotle. Two-valued Aristotelian logic says either X Y, or X not Y; it offers no middle choices, and it often leads to either-or evaluating. Non-Aristotelian logic employs multiple values, a range of choices, more in keeping with the diversity of lived experience. It adheres to the principle of non-identity by allowing degrees of difference or similarity. Separation of Word and Thing Korzybski recognized that language and lived experience consist of two distinctly separate realms. He said The word not the thing, and Whatever you might say the object 'is,' well, it not. …",

      "abstract": "A self-report instrument yielded two separate factors: private body consciousness (awareness of internal sensations) and public body consciousness (awareness of observable aspects of body). For each factor, norms, test-retest reliability data, and correlations with other personality measures are presented. An experiment on reaction to ingestion of caffeine revealed that only subjects high in private body consciousness or high in both private body consciousness and private selfconsciousness were stimulated by caffeine; individual differences in public body consciousness and in private self-consciousness alone had no impact. These findings have implications for biofeedback, false physiological feedback, and excitation transfer. When we attend to ourselves, what do we observe? Though there may be various answers to this question, one is to classify the diverse components of the self into private and public aspects. The private aspects can be observed only by the experiencing person: thoughts, images, memories, motives, and feelings—all concerning oneself. The public aspects can be observed by anyone else: appearance, manners, and style of behavior. People differ considerably in the extent to which they attend to the private aspects of themselves, and there are marked individual differences in consciousness of the public or social aspects of oneself. These two dispositions, private and public self-consciousness, are measured by the Self-Consciousness Inventory (Fenigstein, Scheier, & Buss, 1975). Among the highest loading items on the Private Self-Consciousness Scale are, I reflect about myself a lot, I'm generally attentive to my inner feelings, and I'm alert to changes in my mood.

Although terms such as self‐mutilation and deliberate self‐harm have also been used for this behavior, NSSI has increasingly become the term of choice. Common examples of NSSI include skin‐cutting, burning, scratching, needle‐sticking, rubbing against rough surfaces, hitting or banging body parts, and interfering with wound healing. In general, behaviors associated with eating disorders (e.g., binging or purging) and substance disorders (e.g., alcohol or drug use) are not considered NSSI, because they are not accompanied by specific intent to physically damage one's body tissue. Similarly, most cases of tattooing and body piercing are not considered NSSI, because they are socially sanctioned forms of body decoration or artistic expression. Importantly, NSSI can be distinguished from suicidal behavior. Unlike suicide attempts, NSSI is not performed with the intent to die, and the injuries caused by NSSI are rarely life‐threatening or medically severe (Klonksy &amp; Muehlenkamp, 2007).",

As for intelligence, this was not defined by the esoteric knowledge you possessed any more than wealth was defined by the money you had in the bank or the amount of rice in your granary.

Like the dream, a mood has a kind of necessary autistic structure to it: people who are in a mood, like persons who are asleep, are inside a special state where a temporal element is at play. They will emerge, like the dreamer, after the spell is over. Some moods, particularly those that are a part of a person's character, are occasions for the expression of a conservative object, as a conservative object is that internal self state that has been preserved intact during childhood often upon some breakdown between the child in relation to his parents. When a person goes 'into' a mood he becomes that child self who was refused expression in relation to his parents for one reason or another. As such, moods are often the existential registers of the moment of a breakdown between a child and his parents, and partly notate the parent's own developmental arrest, in that the parent was unable to deal appropriately with the child's particular maturational needs. What was a self experience in the child, one that could have been integrated into the child's continuing self development, was rejected by the parents, who failed to perform adequately as ordinary 'transformational objects', thereby destining a self state to be frozen by the child into a conservative object that fated such a state of being to be subsequently represented only through moods.",

      "title": "Dysphoria: a Desperate Vitality",
      "abstract": "'Dysphoria' is often used as the most generic word for any kind of negative emotion. It can be better defined as an unmotivated and quasi-ineffable constellation of feelings that convey a nebula of vague sensations and impulses, an uncomfortable feeling characterized by being sorrowful and indignant. The intentional structure that characterizes much of human emotional experience is absent in dysphoria. Emotions are fluxes of intentionality that innervate the flesh and connect it to the world. Dysphoria is an emotional state saturated with a brimming constellation of feelings without any explicit object or target, a state of tension that may lead to spontaneously vigorous outbursts as well as to pale stagnation or emotional depletion. Dysphoria is empty intentionality devoid of the moderating power of language and representation which fragments the person's representations of herself and of others and inducing painful experiences of incoherence and inner emptiness, threatening feeling of uncertainty and inauthenticity in interpersonal relationships, and excruciating sense of insignificance, futility and inanity of life. Dysphoric persons experience their own self as dim and fuzzy, and feel deprived of a defined identity and unable to be steadily involved in a given life project or social role. But it also entails a sense of vitality, although am aimless and explosive one – a desperate vitality. Dysphoria is felt as a disordered, overwhelming flux which is at the same time a disorganizing and compelling source of vitality. Dysphoria is felt as creative and destructive – a vigour that brings life as well as annihilation: a violent spasm that takes control of the body and a power that expresses vitality in touch with the source of all sensations.",

      "abstract": "Empirical and observational studies of animal cogni-\ntion will truly benefit if different behavioural manifes-\ntations of higher cognitive processes can be defined\nfunctionally. This is vitally important because, when\nstudying animals, cognition has to necessarily manifest\nin behaviour for it to be tractable, and the performance\nof such behaviour, in turn, needs to be unambiguously\nascribed to an effect of particular cognitive processes.\nOne theoretical framework to investigate cognition in\nanimals in terms of mentalistic notions is that of the\nintentional stance, which assumes that each individual\nis an intentional system capable of mental states like\nbeliefs, desires and emotions. To attribute such mental\nstates to both oneself and to others is to have what has\nbeen termed a theory of mind. Social primates appear\nto be knowledgeable about one another's behaviour to\ndifferent extents. But do they know as much about one\nanother's beliefs and intentions? Are they adept at\nrecognizing the similarities and differences between\ntheir own and others' states of mind? Attribution of\nmental states to other individuals could manifest itself\nin diverse situations as, for example, when individual\nanimals closely observe the actions of others, when\nthey interact competitively, or when they deceive each\nother in the social sphere. Such behavioural constructs\nneed to be analysed carefully in order to ascertain\nwhether true higher-order intentionality can indeed\nbe invoked as underlying mechanisms governing these\nacts.

A voyeur may observe others without them being aware of it by a number of strategies. The voyeur may observe the subject from a distance, or use stealth to observe the subject with the use of peep-holes, two-way mirrors, hidden cameras, secret photography and other devices and strategies. Secret photography may involve the use of normal cameras, but with the photographer being concealed. Sometimes the camera itself is disguised or concealed. The use of telephoto lens enables the distance from the subject to provide concealment.

When they are considered as his own, then is he called a natural person: and when they are considered as representing the words and actions of another, then is he a feigned or artificial person. 1 Hobbes' distinction between the two forms of personation may serve set forth the common ground, as well as mark the boundary, between two modes of theatricality: the sustaining of a feigned person-or mimicry-and the emphatic maintaining of one's own person, or self-manifestation. The Oxford Dictionary supplies similar coordinates for the verbs and act, which may mean either sustain a feigned character, make a pretence, act deceitfully -i. e., engage in mimicry or hypocrisy -or, more neutrally, pursue a course of action, to perform a function -to go about one's business in a normal manner. A man who has played his part has done what was expected of him; he has fulfilled the obligations contracted by performing similar actions in the past. But most men play their parts somewhat inexpertly; they fail coincide exactly with their assumed roles. And our language contains various expressions of disapproval for those who too grossly misplay themselves. Terms like showing off, playing the gallery, upstaging, making a scene, making a spectacle of oneself, all refer an insistence on being at the center of attention. The same notion appears in other languages: in Italian, for example, sta sempre sul podio -he's always on a platform -refers bitingly the man who cannot do without an audience.

      "abstract": "Part 1. There exists a minority of individuals who report that they have never, in their lifetimes, formed an extremely close personal and emotional relationship with another human being. Psychological research indicates that, compared with persons who report that they have at some time entered into such a relationship, these .non-close-relaters. tend to be more shy, more lacking in trust, more introverted and more lacking in social skills. In addition, non-closerelaters are less likely to believe in ESP or to report personal experience of paranormal phenomena; that is, they are more often than not intellectual and experiential .goats.. This paper explores a number of possible explanations. normal and paranormal.for this attitudinal difference: it is suggested that while ordinary psychological processes do play a r le, the difference can best be understood if one additionally postulates the bidirectional operation of the paranormal: in particular, it is proposed that certain .extraverted. personality types will manifest hitting, in order to further the development of desired relationships; while certain .introverted. personality types will miss, with the effect of reducing intimacy in their dealings with other people. If it is assumed that instances of .negative ESP. in everyday life usually fail to be recognized as constituting ESP, then this would account for the non-close-relater.s failure to report paranormal experiences. Part 2 explores possible instances of significant missing in everyday life. It is concluded that invocation of the paranormal hypothesis will enrich our understanding of the mechanisms of interpersonal interaction.",

The narrow band is more fitted to inescapable outward fortune or to hampering of body or mind, the wide band or cloak, wrapping, to more pervasive states of body or mind. When a man's hands are stricken with weakness, or his limbs are paralysed, they are ‘bound’ by a god; he who is deluded in mind is ‘bound’ with ἄτη or ἐλπίς.

It contributes to the identification and recognition of food or food products, to their appreciation (pleasant/unpleasant), to the associated pleasure/displeasure and desire to eat, and therefore to the evaluation of their qualities (freshness, healthy character, caloric level, etc.). The sense of smell is also involved in overall perception – in particular, by aromas developed in the mouth that activate olfactory receptors through the retro-nasal pathway – and in other functions such as sensory-specific satiety. However, one of the most enigmatic properties of the sense of smell is undoubtedly the variation of its sensitivity according to our state of hunger or satiety. Obviously, smell is not the only sensory modality involved in food intake. In a state of satiety, sensitivity to bitterness was better than in a state of hunger.",

      "abstract": "Listening is a behaviour, it is also an attitude implying for the subject a disposition and receptiveness of the body, as well as a sustained attention of the mind, concerned with logic and coherence, but also stimulated, provoked and motivated by a form of affectivity which is inevitably more unpredictable. These behaviours give evidence to the explicit hypothesis of the other as distinct from the self, and also as the source of intentionalities and abilities (needs, desires, plans, rationality). From these meanings, listening implies thinking. We can then represent it either in terms of procedures (how to create, obtain, establish, maintain, optimize, show the accurate attitude) – these procedures then become techniques, tools or methods – or in terms of process (what do we feel through such psychic moves ?) The processes develop in a temporality which provides their slow elaboration and maturation in obeying a more biological than mechanical future, whereas the procedures are more elaborate, rational, technical, modelized and segmented, thus more spatialized. The former are ways of acting, the latter are ways of existing. Of course these forms of representation seem heterogeneous, translating very different ways of seeing the world and very different philosophies. They can even claim to be antagonistic, which roughly corresponds to the classical distinction between Homo faber and Homo sapiens. The former is, at least partly, a matter for comprehension, in our acceptation of Dilthey’s terms, whereas the latter is a matter for explanation. The subtle intelligibility of the notion of listening is linked to the distinction between, as well as the contrasted articulation of the two heterogeneous readings.",

The cognitive capacity, relevant for religiously relevant perceptions, could probably have emerged in the Early Upper Paleolithic era (c. 50.000–40.000 BP). Abstract signs allowed humans to refer to a dead human, a permanent ‘absentee,’ or simply, an ‘absent’ – a certain former member of the group. Thus, they signify absence of a formerly present individual, and allow to externalize complex emotions. These abstract sings for absence, possibly rocks and stones, and respective emotions such as collective mourning became on their part, it is argued, the basis for religious perceptions such as memorial practices.",

The violator is the central, most intense contaminant. The basis of the contamination is obscure and perplexing because it is not obviously linked to common sources of dirtiness, and the human origin of the disorder is not recognized. The feelings of contamination are unique to the affected person. Objects and people can appear to be clean but feel dirty.

      "title": "The ethics of suicide",
      "abstract": "There are well established criteria for what constitutes a homicide and under what conditions it is permissible. Since suicide is etymologically and semantically similar to homicide, I argue that deploying the structure of a homicide taxonomy to classify and characterise suicides arrives at a more robust understanding of suicide than alternatives, one that is intuitively plausible, and has the pragmatic quality that it is compatible with clinical assessments of suicide and suicidal behaviour. I show that while suicide may not be the moral equivalent of killing another person, types of suicide can be differentiated according to the same criteria as homicides: intention, mental capacity, diminished responsibility, and foreseeability. Suicides can then be subclassified similarly to homicides according to type: self-murder, justifiable self-manslaughter, voluntary self-manslaughter, involuntary self-manslaughter, and accidental suicide. Some suicides have elements of both homicide and suicide, such as when someone contributes to or encourages a person’s suicide, or when someone kills others when she kills herself, such as a suicide bomber. My view entails that deaths caused by a sublimated death-wish may be a type of suicide, and someone’s behaviour may be suicidal by a matter of degree. \r\n\r\nTo determine whether an act of suicide is wrong, we must consider the sorts of reasons that people have to kill themselves. I argue that even if we consider that human beings have intrinsic value, it does not follow that all suicides are wrong. On Kant’s view, the maxims that underlie actions, rather than the actions themselves, are fundamental to moral assessment. I show that Kant’s overall moral framework supports subcategorising suicides similarly to homicides. I apply Kant’s distinction between duties to selves and duties to others to show that agents’ obligations pertaining to suicide are only weakly symmetrical to their obligations pertaining to homicide. Kant indicates that duties to oneself and duties to others are not exactly equivalent. We have a duty to respect others’ autonomy, and this means that we do not act upon them as we might do to ourselves, and duties to oneself are not enforceable where duties to others may be. Kant’s position supports the idea that even if a given suicide is wrong, others may not be permitted to forcibly prevent it, and that is not the case with some weakly symmetrical homicides. \r\n\r\nEven if we accept that suicide sometimes honours one’s intrinsic value, this may not give adequate weight to the impact that suicide has on others. I argue that role-related special obligations, such as those that parents have towards their children, have contractual elements that preclude permissible suicide. If someone has a role-related obligation to provide continuing care and support, then normally there are strong moral reasons against that person committing suicide. This understands roles as having normative parameters that consist of contractual, voluntarily acquired special obligations. I deploy the conceptual framework of contracts to provide guidance on cases of suicide with respect to role responsibilities. I propose that as we have established criteria for morally acceptable reasons for cancelling, voiding, or amending a contract, we can apply these to the roles to establish grounds for releasing a parent from his role-related and contractual obligations. A parent who is terminally ill, for example, or has other legally and morally compelling reasons for failing to fulfil her role-related contractual obligations, may permissibly kill herself, though she may nonetheless have obligations to her child to find another suitable parent. I argue that the factors that determine culpability for homicides are also relevant for establishing culpability in contractual role-related obligations.\r\n\r\nI argue that the conceptual framework of contracts also provides a moral basis for honouring advance decisions to refuse life-saving medical treatment, where a decision pertaining to one’s eventual death as a self-killing takes place over a significant time. This is so, even though metaphysically the moral distinction between killing oneself and killing another person, including a future self, may sometimes break down. I argue that in suicide the agent who kills must be the same agent who dies, or it is not a self-killing at all, but rather a homicide. Nevertheless, we have social and pragmatic reasons for ascribing persisting ‘personal identity,’ and for regarding a psychologically discontinuous self as the same ‘person’ who issued the advance decision, despite metaphysical complications. \r\n\r\nThe symmetry between homicides and suicides shows that there can be very good reasons for suicide, such as to defend others, or because we value what makes ourselves distinctive and our lives meaningful. Even when suicide is not permissible, it is often not blameworthy, given the extenuating circumstances underlying an agent’s suicide. While classifying suicides may not give comfort to loved ones any more than classifying a homicide as vehicular manslaughter would, it does show that there are many types of suicide, and not all suicides are selfish, senseless, or shameful.",

      "title": "ELDERLY ALIENATION, SATISFACTION, AND SOCIAL CLASS",
      "abstract": "BACKGROUND Alienation usually refers to certain perceptions and feelings that individuals have about themselves and aspects of their social environment. According to Seeman (1959), alienation is characterized by five symptoms: social isolation (real or perceived), meaninglessness normlessness. powerlessness, and self-estrangement. Alienation is typified more accurately by degree and direction. Social structures and institutions often attribute to the aged feelings of having little if any aontrol over their life situation. Ambivalence and existential meaning loss occur. Frankl (1963), held that man is a spiritual being motivated not by the will to pleasure or the will to power but by the will to meaning. Aged persons find themselves in a state of melancholy where they become desensitized to the inherent values In their own being and subsequently to the values outside themselves. Reisman (1971), maintains>that alienation is genesis of loneliness. He set forth a typology of man as inner-directed and man as outer-directed as a function of the social structure. A social structure imposing direction consists of increased personal mobility, rapid accumulation of capital, technological shifts and constant expansionism. The source of direction for the individual is inner in the sense that it is implanted early in life by the elders and directed towards generalized, inescapable goals. Inner directed persons receive more input to the self with no opportunity for, reciprocity. The other directeGl individual has as its source others on whom s/he depends on for validation and unlike the directed person who is acted upon, ~s engaging in activity. Park's notion (1959), of marginal man emphasizes that while an individual's personality has a physiological makeup, it achieves its final form under the individual conception of self. This conception is determined by the role which society assigns the person, and the attitudes others in society form of him. The aged persons find themselves in a marginal, alienated position. Weiss (1973), has focused on disengagement theory as a descriptive model for alienation. As society has increased in mobility and complexity, individuals are forced to engage and disengage from significant others. This may OCCUr developmentally in terms of age and peer pressure or by formal positioning in a social stratum. The constant shifts in structural definitions reduce the chances for the longevity of relations with others. Alienation and its association to the lower class has been demonstrated in several studies (Faris, Dunham 1960, Hollingshead, & Redlich 1958, Meyers 1959). The elderly person of low socio-economic status not only has been structurally disengaged from society, but if in a lower class has the Iiklihoodof beihg alienated as well. The alienation in terms of magnitude and intensity is higher. Thus mental disorders in the elderly may have to do not with intrinsic personality disorders but rather with structural shifts. Faris and Dunham (1960), found that the elderly residing in the central business districts of lower class status, were more likely to be alienated or isolated and that these factors are thus related to the high rates of schizophrenia.",

      "abstract": "Abstract What does it mean to call something especially significant or important or great? To be significant in the relevant sense is not only to be of value but specifically to be rare and of particularly high value. Having this rare, high value can be determined in two ways: either in a contextualized manner that determines importance relative to a particular standard of evaluation and a limited range of contrast classes or in a parameter-free “cosmic” manner. Regardless of the manner of scope, there seem to be multiple ways of achieving such importance: by having a big impact on others or on oneself or simply by being of value regardless of impact. But being important does not require that the important person and their value must have been irreplaceable. It just requires that the person actually be valuable.",

Perhaps most obvious are the superhuman powers of some and the extraordinary adventures of all characters in this genre. Just as salient as supernatural traits, however, is the predictable, repetitious quality of fairy-tale characterization. In fact, part of what distinguishes fairy tales is that they draw on a set of stock characters – fairies, ogres, tricksters, princes, princesses, and the like – who perform similar (nearly identical) tasks from text to text. So predictable and so repetitious are they that critics have often noted the one-dimensionality of fairy-tale characters. Usually devoid of individuating psychological traits, protagonists and antagonists alike highlight specific narrative and ideological functions. In other words, they are first and foremost incarnations of cultural values. They purvey the norms of the community and reject those of the individual.",

The masking is conscious when one represses some crude exclamation or modestly covers some part of the body. Man conceives of himself and passes judgment on himself in three different ways: in each of his acts, taken separately; in his being as a whole, as a person; and in the complete development of his life, his entire existence including its termination. The justification of the whole life is of concern primarily to one who feels it has come to an end, either because he considers the active period of his life to have ceased or because he is confronted with death. One of the most fruitful aspects is provided by the difference between two human types, where one is given as expansive, spontaneous, and turned outward and the other as concentrated, reflexive, and prone to probe within.",

      "abstract": "Individuals who have not been victimized by negative life events, such as serious illness, accidents, or crime, tend to perceive themselves as “uniquely invulnerable,” as less vulnerable to victimization than others. The actual experience of victimization, however, appears to shatter this illusion of invulnerability, creating in victims a new and unfamiliar sense of vulnerability often accompanied by psychological distress. This article reviews literature documenting nonvictims' perceptions of unique invulnerability and victims' heightened perceptions of vulnerability, and addresses the potentially adaptive versus maladaptive consequences of these perceptions. It is argued that victims who have the most difficulty coping with their misfortune may be precisely those individuals who initially felt least vulnerable prior to being victimized. Therefore, how victims cope may depend in part on their prior beliefs about risk. In addition, a distinction is made between victims who feel “uniquely vulnerable” (more vulnerable than others) and those who feel “universally vulnerable” (equally vulnerable as others) to future misfortune. It is proposed that perceptions of universal vulnerability may be a more adaptive reaction to victimization than are perceptions of unique vulnerability.",

The characteristic traits of these links are a degradation of one of the members of the link’s narcissistic integrity, together with a weakening of self-esteem, as a result of constant humiliations. The pervert’s victim suffers from fainting fits, allergic reactions, gastro-intestinal or vascular disorders, joints pain, somatizations or psychosomatic disorders with an anatomical starting point. The pervert can, in turn, develop physical disorders when he loses his superior stand and can’t express his distress, rant or hallucinate.The bond between the subjects of the link is weak or non -existent. There is a lack of mutual acknowledgement: the victim is not considered as a person by the pervert, he has no empathy towards the victim. The victim may even react with pleasure to belittlements thus encouraging him. The physical fits seem linked to the powerlessness to get rid of theses chains. The forces which look after self-protection are weakened. PFT and PCT cases will throw a light on these ideas.",

We arc all aware that not everyone will appreciate the painting or articulate its meaning in the same way; we admit that in most cases, to be able to “see” the significance of various motifs in the work of art requires training or at least exposure to certain cultural artifacts. If the artist intended to evoke specific themes by incorporating into the painting salient elements associated with earlier works of art, then viewers unacquainted with those other paintings would fail to “see” these allusions; they would be “missing” something that is “there” for those trained to notice it. Of course, this is not a permanent handicap; viewers can be instructed to see things they did not “see” before. Just think of the recorded tours a person may listen to while touring an exhibit: the oral tour guide “points things out” that one may not have known before, after which one “sees” the work of art in a new light.",

It comprises, first, the inward domain of consciousness, demanding liberty of conscience in the most comprehensive sense, liberty of thought and feeling, absolute freedom of opinion and sentiment on all subjects, practical or speculative, scientific, moral, or theological...[as well as] the liberty of expressing and publishing opinions....Secondly...liberty of tastes and pursuits, of framing the plan of our life to suit our own character, of doing as we like, subject to such consequences as may follow, without impediment from our fellow creatures, so long as it does not harm them, even though they should think our conduct foolish, perverse, or wrong. Thirdly, from this liberty...follows the liberty, within the same limits, of combination among individuals; freedom to unite for any purpose not involving harm to others....The only freedom which deserves the name is that of pursuing our own good in our own way, so long as we do not attempt to deprive others of theirs or impede their efforts to obtain it. Each is a proper guardian of his own health, whether bodily or mental and spiritual. Mankind are greater gainers by suffering each other to live as seems good to themselves than by compelling each to live as seems good to the rest....We can never be sure that the opinion we are endeavoring to stifle is a false opinion; and if we were sure, stifling it would be an evil still.",

      "title": "Hatred and Anger",
      "abstract": "Abstract If we have suffered or expect to suffer some wilful injury from a man, or if he is in any way offensive to us, we dislike him; and dislike easily rises into hatred. Such feelings, if experienced in a moderate degree, are not clearly expressed by any movement of the body or features, excepting perhaps by a certain gravity of behaviour, or by some ill-temper. Few individuals, however, can long reflect about a hated person, without feeling and exhibiting signs of indignation or rage. But if the offending person be quite insignificant, we experience merely disdain or contempt. If, on the other hand, he is all-powerful, then hatred passes into terror, as when a slave thinks about a cruel master, or a savage about a bloodthirsty malignant deity. Most of our emotions are so closely connected with their expression, that they hardly exist if the body remains passive – the nature of the expression depending in chief part on the nature of the actions which have been habitually performed under this particular state of the mind. A man, for instance, may know that his life is in the extremest peril, and may strongly desire to save it, yet may exclaim as did Louis XVI, when surrounded by a fierce mob, ‘Am I afraid? feel my pulse.’ So a man may intensely hate another, hut until his bodily frame is affected he cannot be said to be enraged.",

      "abstract": "Bowlby saw attachment as one of several motivational and behavioral systems in humans and mentioned affiliation and playful interactions as examples of related systems that were distinct from seeking protection from an attachment figure. In his first volume on attachment, he quotes Murray (1938) who introduced the use of the word \"affiliation\" to denote \"all manifestations of friendliness and good will, and a desire to do things in the company of others \" (Bowlby, 1969/1982, p. 229). Bowlby goes on to say that \"as such [affiliation] is a much broader concept than attachment and is not intended to cover behaviour that is directed at one or two particular figures, which is the hallmark of attachment behaviour\" (p. 229). Bowlby also made the distinction between playful interactions and attachment:A child seeks his attachment figure when he is tired, hungry, ill, or alarmed and also when he is uncertain of the figure's whereabouts . . . By contrast, a child seeks a playmate when he is in good spirits and confident about the whereabouts of his attachment-figure; when the playmate is found, moreover, the child wants to engage in playful interactions with him or her. If this analysis is right, the roles of the attachment figure and playmate are distinct.",

      "title": "Factual Tests for Identification of Volitional Insanity",
      "abstract": "A. Soundness of mind at the time of committing an offence is complementary to mental maturity as a condition for the criminal capacity of the perpetrator and is thus a condition for the criminality of his act. Accordingly, the perpetrator's mental disorder limits the criminality of his act, although not every such disorder has such radical legal consequences. If the disorder is cognitive , it must be such as to prevent the person from understanding the physical or social meaning of his conduct: if it is volitional , it must be such as to prevent him, at the time of his act, from choosing between performing the act and refraining from doing so. These are symptoms of mental disorder that negatives the criminal capacity of a person, and each of them is a necessary, but not a sufficient, condition. It is essential that this be due to a disease of the mind or an organic defect of reason. The disorder in question is therefore a radical one, and one that is also chronic if not permanent in nature, as opposed to temporary or less deep-rooted conditions such as a disturbed state, a trauma or emotional condition, impulsiveness in certain matters or urges that deviate from the normal in certain areas. B. The following remarks are confined to the absence of criminal capacity on the volitional level, to which we shall refer in short as “volitional insanity’. This is the case where the person at the time of his act did not have a choice between acting or not acting due to a disease affecting his mind. This case is also referred to as the commission of an act as a result of an irresistible morbid impulse.",

      "title": "What Chimpanzees Know about Seeing, Revisited: An Explanation of the Third Kind",
      "abstract": "Chimpanzees follow the gaze of conspecifics and humans — follow it past distractors and behind barriers, 'check back' with humans when gaze following does not yield interesting sights, use gestures appropriately depending on the visual access of their recipient, and select different pieces of food depending on whether their competitor has visual access to them. Taken together, these findings make a strong case for the hypothesis that chimpanzees have some understanding of what other individuals can and cannot see. However, chimpanzees do not seem nearly so skillful in the Gesture Choice and Object Choice experimental paradigms. Neither behavioral conditioning nor theory of mind explanations can account for these results satisfactorily. Instead this chapter proposes the idea that chimpanzees have the cognitive skills to recall, represent, categorize, and reason about the behavior and perception of others, but not their intentional or mental states, because they do not know that others have such states since they cannot make a link to their own. Human beings began their own evolutionary trajectory with these same skills, but then at some point in their evolution (probably quite recently) they began to understand that their own experience could serve as some kind of model for that of other persons. This allowed for even better prediction and control of the behavior of others and better communication and cooperation with them as well, and so it was an adaptation with immediate adaptive consequences that ensured its survival.",

      "title": "Kant: Let Us Compare",
      "abstract": "Every thing in this world is judg'd of by comparison. (1) It is impossible to continue in the practice of contemplating any order of beauty, without being frequently obliged to form comparisons between the several species and degrees of excellence, and estimating their proportion to each other. A man, who has had no opportunity of comparing the different kinds of beauty, is indeed totally unqualified to pronounce an opinion with regard to any object presented to him. By comparison alone we fix the epithets of praise or blame, and learn how to assign the due degrees of each. (2) IN KANT'S ETHICAL THOUGHT, (3) Allen W. Wood powerfully argues in defense of Kant's alleged notion that we ought not to compare ourselves with others on the moral scale, however much such comparison may be meaningful and permissible with respect to our other skills and characteristics, such as the artistic, practical, or technological. Meaningful, permissible, comparable or not, those skills and characteristics have no inherent worth anyway. These have a market price or a fancy price but no dignity, and it is only dignity which confers incomparable moral worth. A human being, says Kant, possesses a dignity (an absolute inner worth) by which he exacts respect for himself from all other rational beings in the world. He can measure himself with every other being of this kind and value himself on a footing of equality with (4) I tend to think, in an a priori way, that to claim that Mother Teresa or Martin Luther King or Mahatma Gandhi and I have the same absolute, incomparable moral worth is just laughable. They might think that I have the same absolute, incomparable moral worth as they do; I concede. I cannot even bring myself to think it. This is not undue self-abnegation or humility. There is moral inequality here; if that is not a hard moral fact, I don't know what is. (5) My purposes in this paper are twofold, one primary, one secondary. The secondary purpose is to argue against Wood's claim that, according to Kant, we ought not to make moral comparisons; it is a rather limited purpose, if only because it concedes to Wood a variety of substantial points in the Kantian exegesis, particularly Wood's idea--which is the cornerstone of his book--that the various formulations of the categorical imperative had better be seen as constituting a system, (6) a system in which the Formula of Humanity as End in Itself plays a central role, a role routinely accorded (since Hegel) to the Formula of the Universal Law. (7) My own reservations about Wood's central thesis lie in the fact that several key passages from the Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals and Critique of Practical Reason, in which Kant explicitly accords the Formula of Universal Law a prime place in his system and denies such a place to any other formula, are not given a fair hearing and sometimes not even aired. This is no less true of the later work, The Metaphysics of Morals, which is Wood's favored piece to show the importance of the Formula of Humanity as an End in Itself. Had he done so, this might perhaps have resulted in the dull view that Kant was ambivalent--perhaps, even conflicted; but making things neater and more clean-cut than is warranted by the texts does not yield accuracy of interpretation. Of course, this is just a bland assertion and must await justification in a paper different from the present one. Whatever the merits of the secondary, exegetical purpose, my primary purpose is philosophical. It is to demonstrate that we ought to make moral comparisons. No one can read Wood's book without marveling at how successful he has been in portraying the unity--not to mention depicting the beauty of that unity--of Kant's moral and social philosophy; nothing said herein detracts from that remarkable achievement. In section 1, I briefly present Wood's central arguments; in section 2, I evaluate them. …",

They originate in the relational learning processes in which the individual participates, and they presuppose the ability to thematize oneself in relation to others, especially by means of language. Among the basic constituents of all these features is the insight into one's own limitations: to be wise and humble presupposes that one knows what one cannot do or be, whereas grace is the manifestation of that which moves oneself beyond what one thought it was possible to do or be, due to unforeseen and unanticipated elements in the reality in which one takes part. Hence, wisdom, humility, and grace must all be seen as conditions for (pre-)human agency, building on psychological and other evolved capacities. Thus, these features are also important elements when humans relate to the world in terms of orientation, transformation, and reflection.",

      "title": "Some Criteria for Humanizing.",
      "abstract": "growth of studies of our potentials is giving us a new feeling about Introduction and Focuses In the accumulating enormous range of information and deeper understanding of many other cultures than our own, we can see how a society's attitude toward a being has changed. As the metamorphoses of our ways of knowing throughout our history begin to take shape, we a way to see through the maze of information, to find broad outlines and unifications. A good deal has already been written this direction. It is hoped that the following considerations may move this trend forward an area of great concern to all of us, wherever we may be living. We can begin by exploring some differences between and nonhuman. Human has been contrasted with machine-like, mechanical, devoid of feelings. Human may also be contrasted with animalistic, a pejorative term when referring to a person. Or, may be differentiated from some mythical superhuman being, with implications of inferiority. Thus, we say, He is only human if someone makes a mistake or loses control of his feelings, is involved some misdemeanor, or acts irresponsibly. The growth of studies of our potentials is giving us a new feeling about ourselves. Articles are being written on the sense of giving the worker a feeling of dignity on his job, providing him a chance for using his imagination, getting away from dull mechanical routine. Humanizing is different from anthropomorphizing when referring to a machine, or a computer, for instance. Those who work with computers know their present limitations, besides their great help. As John C. Eccles said, the computer does not recognize unexpected messages ... (1) Would cultivating an appreciation for artistic works influence a person toward behaving more humanly? Many believe so, or did believe so until they became disillusioned from events World War II. It is well known that the Nazis spent evenings listening to Mozart and Beethoven and the very next morning committed horrible brutalities the concentration camps a few miles away. In his paper on Communications and Information Theory Dr. Dan McLachlan, Jr., gives us a clue to the relation of human-ness to the theory, when he writes: Meaning, value, and are not to be discussed here because they have not been investigated to any extent such as has been done on information theory or communication general. These words are rarely found books of science, and it is unfortunate that they have not been because these are such words [italics mine] and the future decency of our race depends so much on our understanding of them. Such expressions as moral values or cultural values are difficult to handle. Such terms as in want or in dire need have a pretty diffuse line of distinction. (2) While any terms we use -- no matter which -- involve some assumptions and problems of ferreting them out, are there some ways of speaking about humanizing that do not get us into as much of a quagmire as some others? If at every moment of investigating, the person who is observing becomes an integral part of the observation, it is not possible to get away from some kind of values, or from the assumptions hidden the very terms and categories that are used to talk about the research. Some Criteria as Guides The following considerations are suggested as guides our context for investigating: 1. The kind of behavior we classify as uniquely human. 2. The holistic character of the premises, based on the principle of the organism-as-a-whole-in-an-environment. 3. The terminology used for investigating, and its applicability to the functioning of the nervous system. 4. …",

      "abstract": "Abstract Men may be divided into any number of classes-rich and poor, educated and ignorant, successful and unsuccessful, and so on; but none of these classifications is fundamental. A more vital classification or division of men would be those who live only in the present and those who live both in the present and the future. Having or lacking the power to project oneself into the future is what primarily divides men who move forward and upward from those who remain stationary or slip back. There is homely illustration often given to mark this dividing line. It is the difference between a man who plants a tree and a man to whom such an act would never appeal. The man who plants a tree performs an act in the spirit of the Great Creator. He serves not only himself but future generations unknown to him, who will enjoy its fruit and its shade. To realize in life the deeper meanings of success one’s vision cannot be limited by the circumscribed horizon of the present. It must transcend those bounds and take in the future. This comprehension of the future involves the spirit of altruism, the divine spirit of service to others, and embraces all men and all generations; but it carries not only these abstract and, perhaps to some, vague principles of altruism, but also a very concrete and individual value. For, contrary to the general notion, there is a future which is neither hazy nor unknown. There is a definitely known future, a future which it is possible to know as well as the past is known. This is the future in which those who are today going out from this institution are now probably most interested.",

      "title": "Dignity, Respect, and Cognitive Disability",
      "abstract": "Dignity is typically taken to be an inherent feature of humans, in virtue of which we have moral status and are owed basic forms of respect. When such claims are made, an explanation is owed as to how we come to have such dignity. A very standard response appeals to purportedly universal capacities held by humans, such as rationality. However, this way of construing dignity has the effect of excluding individuals with severe cognitive disabilities. If such individuals do not have dignity, it follows that they lack moral status and are not owed basic forms of respect. This chapter offers an alternative way of construing dignity. Rather than grounding it in natural capacities, the chapter argues that dignity is grounded in the social kind “human.” On this approach, all human beings have dignity, irrespective of their cognitive capacities.",

      "abstract": "The idea of reflexivity has much to offer to the analysis of taste - but reflexivity in its ancient sense, a form neither active nor passive, pointing to an originary state where things, persons, and events have just arrived, with no action, subject or objects yet decided. Objects of taste are not present, inert, available and at our service.They give themselves up, they shy away, they impose themselves. ‘Amateurs’ do not believe things have taste. On the contrary, they make themselves detect them, through a continuous elaboration of procedures that put taste to the test. Understood as reflexive work performed on one’s own attachments, the amateur’s taste is no longer considered (as with so-called ‘critical’ sociology) an arbitrary election which has to be explained by hidden social causes. Rather, it is a collective technique, whose analysis helps us to understand the ways we make ourselves sensitized, to things, to ourselves, to situations and to moments, while simultaneously controlling how those feelings might be shared and discussed with others.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Percipience involves the exercise of judgment and reasoning in relation to perception. All animals rely on direct, causal interaction with their environment to endorse the perceptual predication of properties to objects; all shift attention sub-intentionally, often in pursuit of other intentional goals; and all dismiss or neglect perceptions that prove behaviorally misleading. But equipped with percipience, the humanoids can increase the range of properties perceived, can regulate their attention intentionally in seeking the answers to various questions, and can judge and believe that things are not as they are perceived to be rather than investing perception with unquestioned authority: they can distinguish appearance from reality, finding their way to aesthetic appreciation and speculative thought. Percipience can also enhance the awareness of what they perceive, which they share with the non-percipient, transforming their consciousness-in-perception. And it can enable them, unlike other perceivers, to enjoy consciousness-of-perception: to be able to recognize as such the perceptual states in which their world is presented, and possibly mis-presented, to them.",

      "title": "Artificial Intelligence and Moral intelligence",
      "abstract": "We discuss the thesis that the implementation of a moral code in the behaviour of artificial intelligent systems needs a specific form of human and artificial intelligence, not just an abstract intelligence. We present intelligence as a system with an internal structure and the structural levels of the moral system, as well as certain characteristics of artificial intelligent agents which can/must be treated as 1- individual entities (with a complex, specialized, autonomous or selfdetermined, even unpredictable conduct), 2- entities endowed with diverse or even multiple intelligence forms, like moral intelligence, 3- open and, even, free-conduct performing systems (with specific, flexible and heuristic mechanisms and procedures of decision), 4 – systems which are open to education, not just to instruction, 5- entities with “lifegraphy”, not just “stategraphy”, 6- equipped not just with automatisms but with beliefs (cognitive and affective complexes), 7- capable even of reflection (“moral life” is a form of spiritual, not just of conscious activity), 8 – elements/members of some real (corporal or virtual) community, 9 – cultural beings: free conduct gives cultural value to the action of a ”natural” or artificial being. Implementation of such characteristics does not necessarily suppose efforts to design, construct and educate machines like human beings. The human moral code is irremediably imperfect: it is a morality of preference, of accountability (not of responsibility) and a morality of non-liberty, which cannot be remedied by the invention of ethical systems, by the circulation of ideal values and by ethical (even computing) education. But such an imperfect morality needs perfect instruments for its implementation: applications of special logic fields; efficient psychological (theoretical and technical) attainments to endow the machine not just with intelligence, but with conscience and even spirit; comprehensive technical means for supplementing the objective decision with a subjective one. Machine ethics can/will be of the highest quality because it will be derived from the sciences, modelled by techniques and accomplished by technologies. If our theoretical hypothesis about a specific moral intelligence, necessary for the implementation of an artificial moral conduct, is correct, then some theoretical and technical issues appear, but the following working hypotheses are possible: structural, functional and behavioural. The future of human and/or artificial morality is to be anticipated.",

      "title": "Self-harm and suicide",
      "abstract": "A person may redress a wrong by harming the transgressor, or by harming someone with whom the transgressor has a vital CS relationship. Suicide and self-harm take both forms, sometimes simultaneously. Thus, Annie may kill herself because she has violated a relationship that only her self-punishment can redeem, or she may kill herself to punish Bill who has transgressed against her, but who loves her and will suffer when she kills herself. In either case there are often important metarelational motives at work. Hurting or killing oneself may restore the collective honor of one’s primary CS group, such as family or military unit. Suicide and self-harm may also show that one accepts full individual responsibility for failure, so third parties should not blame anyone else. In other metarelational processes, Annie’s suicide to punish Bill’s transgression against Annie may make George, who loves Annie, hate Bill, or at the very least shame Bill by drawing George’s and others’ attention to the gravity of Bill’s transgression against Annie. Similarly, like Lucretia’s suicide after being raped by Sextus, it may spur others to avenge a grave transgression. More recently, Tibetan monks’ suicide by setting themselves on fire to protest Chinese rule over Tibet and repression of Buddhism have put great moral pressure on China, and in 2010 Mohammed Bouazizi’s suicide by fire in Tunisia brought out masses of protestors who overthrew the government.",

Disabilities in persons with visual impairments have a major influence on daily life.The physical limitations of people with visual impairments hamper any activities that are normally carried out by normal (seeing) people. These limitations affect the mental condition of persons with blind disabilities, for example a feeling of inferiority towards the physical possessed, then fear and insecurity about their potential, this is a problem that must be faced by persons with blind disabilities.Persons with disabilities who are blind with imperfections of their sense of sight will naturally experience various problems including those related to their self-acceptance, because it is not easy for those with disabilities to be able to accept themselves, and will require a long time, until it is embedded in him that experiencing blindness is not the end of everything, and with limitations on their sense of sight they still have a strong desire and determination to realize their desires, and are able to adapt themselves to their circumstances and environment by seeing themselves as they really are and recognizing themselves as they really are.Persons with visual impairments, whether innate or not, who have self-acceptance they will have the confidence to face problems, have the same degree as others, can receive praise, be able to accept criticism, able to accept limitations and strengths that exist in themselves, have a positive assessment of himself, able to control his emotional state, and be responsible",

Se cuenta, por ejemplo, la historia de un hombre en la India, que una manana desperto y ya no pudo recrodar que le habia pasado a su elefante. Aquel hombre se perdio a si mismo. Por supuesto, existen historias menos ajenas a nosotros –menos absurdas, pensara alguno–; en cualquier caso, lo mas importante es nuestra reaccion frente a la perdida, y parece que ante ella nunca podemos mantenernos impasibles. Ni siquiera los estoicos podrian negar el sufrimiento causado por el desequilibrio que ella representa. Claro que hay quien sobrelleva este tipo de situaciones de una mejor manera. Pero no es posible que haya un desapego total a las personas o a las cosas por parte de un individuo. Esta en nuestra naturaleza sentirnos incompletos y es por eso que existen las pasiones; es la nocion de perdida, de que algo esta faltando lo que nos permite relacionarnos con el mundo. De otra manera, si fuesemos seres completos, totales, no tendriamos necesidad de nada en absoluto. En cierto modo, tambien la sensacion de perdida se corresponde con un sentimiento de angustia que es lo que nos obliga a recuperar lo perdido o a sufrirlo en estoica quietud. He aqui las unicas dos formas de reaccionar ante nuestra naturaleza, que se excluyen y al mismo tiempo se complementan. Ambas existen como posibilidad dentro de nosotros, y es nuestra voluntad la que las activa.

God is the great orginal, in Whose image man is made. Acts of imagination are repetitions, and therefore imitations, of His Creation. The hierarchical structure this implies can, however, be dissolved (at least m theory), since, by imitating God, man might hope to equal Him, go one better than Him, or merge into Him. Indeed, the potential for rivalry is built mto the act of imitation: to the imitator this offers the excitement of aspiration, but from a higher moral per-spective it looks like presumption. One might take as an analogy from Paradise Lost Satan’s estimate of his own powers, which appears compellingly imaginative from one po of view and impotently rebellious from the other.",

      "title": "Tutorial 1-3: Leader Election and Pattern Formation in Swarms of Deterministic Robots",
      "abstract": "In a given environment, the ability for the swarm of robots to succeed in the accomplishment of the assigned task greatly depends on global properties assigned to the swarm, and individual capabilities each robot has. Examples of such global properties are the ability to distinguish among themselves at least one (or, more) robots (leader), to agree on a common global direction (sense of direction), or to agree on a common handedness (chirality). The individual capacities of each robot are its moving capabilities and its sensory organs. To deal with cost, flexibility, resilience to dysfunction, and autonomy, many problems arise for handling the distributed coordination of swarms of robots in a deterministic manner. This issue is motivated by the minimal level of ability that the robots are required to have in the accomplishment of basic cooperative tasks. In other words, the feasibility of some given tasks is addressed assuming swarm of autonomous robots either devoid or not of capabilities like (observable) identifiers, direct means of communication, means of storing previous observations, sense of direction, chirality, etc. Leader election and arbitrary pattern formation are fundamental tasks for a set of autonomous mobile robots. The former consists in moving the system from an initial configuration were all entities are in the same state into a final configuration were all entities are in the same state, except one, the leader. The latter consists in the design of protocols allowing autonomous mobile robots to form any (arbitrary) geometric pattern. The solvability of both these tasks turns out to be necessary in order to achieve more complex tasks. During this tutorial, we address both problems. We first consider the deterministic solvability of the pattern formation problem assuming swarms of anonymous robots. Next, under the same assumptions, we provide a complete characterization (necessary and sufficient conditions) on the robots positions to deterministically elect a leader. Finally, we show that Leader Election and Pattern Formation are two equivalent problems in the precise sense that, the former is solvable if and only if the latter problem is solvable.",

Moral judgments imply the notion of an ideal state of things, an ideal situation, which is such that, if it were once known and understood, it would be the supreme object of desire for every human being.

Barangsiapa telah mencapai derajat yang paling mulia akan merasakan kehadiran hatinya bersama dengan Allah dalam segala halnya. Tiada lagi hal lain terlintas dalam hatinya, dan tiada lagi yang mengetuk pendengarannya, maupun pandangannya, kecuali yang bermuatan ibadah. Tidak pantas sama sekali seorang yang menginginkan martabat ini pada dirinya, lalu menjadi malas ibadahnya.

      "title": "Personality and its disorders",
      "abstract": "Personality is a difficult concept to define: it is ex­tremely hard to encapsulate what makes a person ‘who they are’ in general terms. Personality is typically thought of as the set of characteristics which make us think, feel, and act in our own unique way. Personality is pervasive; people tend to behave in similar ways throughout life and across differing social and inter­personal contexts. The characteristics of personality, called traits, are a set of common features which are observed in variable degrees in different people. Traits provide a useful structure in which to describe a per­sonality: Box 31.1 shows some common personality traits. Some traits may be perceived as an asset to the individual, while others are more of a nuisance. We all have a little more or a little less of any given trait. The word ‘temperament’ rather than personality is used to describe the behavioural characteristics dis­played by young children. This is because our person­ality takes time to develop; it is shaped by a multitude of environmental, biological, and factors which interact throughout early life. By our late teens or early twenties, the majority of individuals have the set of traits which define the personality we will have for the rest of our lives. Having an understanding of an individual’s per­sonality helps clinicians to predict their patients’ re­sponse to illness and its treatment. The majority of us have some less favourable aspects to our personality, but we work around them and/ or have more prominent favourable traits that allow us to get on with our lives. For a minority of people, their less favourable traits are so prominent that they cause problems for themselves or for those around them. It is these people who we think of as having a personality disorder. It is extremely difficult to draw a line between normal personality and personality disorder, so this simple pragmatic approach is helpful in clinical practice. People with a personality disorder may: … ● have difficulties with social situations and relationships; ● have difficulties controlling their feelings and/ or behaviour; ● react in unusual ways to illness or to treatment; ● behave in unusual ways when mentally ill; ● have more extreme or unusual reactions to stressful events; ● behave in ways that are detrimental to themselves or others ● be more prone to developing other types of mental disorder.",

      "abstract": "While men do indeed construct self-validating and often peculiar interpretations of the realities of their world the simple fact that these views become consensually shared doctrines of experience does not protect them from the revisionism of historical scrutiny. These perceptions of the world become retrospectively altered as developing bodies of knowledge reject them as being clearly deceptive or anachronistic. The concept of psychopathology, distinguished historically under many rubrics, has not been immune to these same processes of modification, nor has it ever been free of the diverse irrationalities which men of all ages have constructed to explain the etiology and treatment of deviant behavior. Historically, consideration of atypical behavior all reflect attempts to explain dysfunction utilizing existing systems of belief and knowledge. For example, primitive and ancient societies advanced quasi-theoretical frameworks that stressed either external causation (e.g., spirit intervention, sorcery, demonic possession, lunacy, bewitchment) or personal causation (e.g., loss of soul, breach of taboo, object intrusion, brain disease).",

It relies on a number of factors: the absence of beliefs that might cause one to neglect or misrepresent useful aspects of one's own mind; the possession of a rich and partly unsystematic neural compost of experience, snippets and understanding; an intuitive grasp of when and how to think clearly and precisely, and when and how to think vaguely and dreamily; an awkward but irresistible sense of wonderment and scepticism; patience and persistence in the face of confusion and frustration; and the ability to amass and deploy material, spatial, technological and social resources in a way that is fluidly appropriate to the evolving nature of the creative project. This last factor is perhaps the most important of all: the presence of mind to orchestrate both one's own mental resources and habits, and the affordances of the outside world, in a way that optimises their ability to mesh with themselves and with each other. Creativity means being smart about yourself, smart about the world, and smart about how to fit the two together.",

      "title": "Reality and Representation: The Problem",
      "abstract": "Reality is different, for each and every of us. Different is the manner in which we understand reality and also our personal representation of it. For some people reality is represented, simply, in everyday' s life, but for others the representation of reality is transformed into art or literature. Thinking somehow beyond Derrida' s own words, all of us can say is nothing outside reality. But also true is the fact that we live in the same world, and still we see different realities. Reality can be understood in way that links to views or parts of them. Reality represents the totality of all things, structures (actual and conceptual), events (past and present) and phenomena, whether observable or not.Reality is not (only) philosophical term. Certain ideas from physics, sociology, literary or art criticism, and other fields shape various theories of reality, but following philosophy we can attach importance to this term and we can also deconstruct it. One such belief is that there simply and literally is no reality beyond the perceptions or beliefs we each have about reality itself. More than that, owing to representation, people know and understand the and reality through the act of naming it. Signs are manipulated in order to make sense of the world. Thus, representation of reality has been associated with aesthetics (art) and semiotics (signs).By this special issue dedicated to Reality and Representation, International Journal on Humanistic Ideology tries to present different approaches of the same reality, philosophically speaking. The present issue brings together articles signed by reputed professors and researchers from Romania, United States, India and United Kingdom and covers different panels, from logic, cognitive science and semantics; recent history and its meaning or art interpretations to specific case analysis (Jewish Sapiential Literature or Indian Museums and their relevance for the representation of reality).The issue opens with Gardenforsy Conceptual Spaces and Affective Representations by Dana Sugu and Amita Chatterjee, from Jadavpur University, Calcutta, an article in which they try to examine an emotion episode from its elicitation to the differentiation into affective processes.It continues with Real World Semantics, very important article by Professor Ionel Narita, from University of Timicoara. The article speaks about the world as contradictory term, because, as we all know, is only world, the real one. In this case, as the author says, it follows that the possible semantics must be replaced with real semantics.The third article of this issue is written by Gregory Jones-Katz, from University of Wisconsin, and is entitled Rethinking Deconstruction in America. It is very well documented analysis of the centrality of the concept of history in Jacques Derrida' s and Paul de Man's works and also speaks about how reception of deconstruction was shaped in the United States.Petronia Petrar, from Babec-Bolyai University Cluj-Napoca, proposes us an analysis Towards Typology of Spatial Representations. The paper is concerned with a tentative categorisation of the various modes of representing space that have shaped and continue to shape modern identity. Both symbolic and allegorical space are described and so is the allegory of nostalgia, in order to show that one major difference between symbolic and allegorical spaces seems therefore to lie in their relationship with 'nature' . …",

Although we adults attribute or \"ascribe\" understanding to very young children, only in the late preschool years do the children themselves begin to ascribe understanding to themselves and others a competence that comes with learning the meaning of the word \"understand.\" It is argued that ascription of understanding to others allows the creation of shared belief while self-ascription allows one to introspect on one's understanding: to know that one understands, to understand expressions that young children would simply reject as false, and to understand hypotheticals and counterfactuals. This competence applies to both understanding spoken expressions and reading comprehension. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved).",

It took more than wealth to be a vir bonus; he also had to embody a number of other characteristics, including integrity and gravitas, and adhere to a particular dignified lifestyle. These demands meant that some men of substance did not count as proper boni in its full sense of ‘good’ and might find their status challenged. A passage in Cicero’s Pro Flacco sums up who qualified as a vir bonus and who did not. He contrasts ‘viros bonos gravisque homines’ with a ‘homini egenti, sordido, sine honore, sine existumatione, sine censu’, Flac. 52. His second, negative definition of bonus is revealing and shows that a combination of qualities was required. Wealth was the obvious precondition (census), but he also had to be satisfied with his resources (i.e. not being egens). In addition, he had to be a man of honour (honos) and enjoy general esteem and a good reputation (existumatio).",

It nevertheless arises logically from our conception of ourselves as self‐conscious believers operating in a world not necessarily consistent with our needs or cognitive structures.

Although these selves are rarely experienced as distinct (because they are held together by specific forms of stimulus information), they differ in their developmental histories, in the accuracy with which we can know them, in the pathologies to which they are subject, and generally in what they contribute to human experience.",

Belonging to a given culture is actually defined by ones identity and by \"being oneself\". Both concepts--\"being oneself\" or \"being strange\"--are rational and related constructs. Whatever they are confronted with, for most human beings it is self-evident to differentiate between subject and object, between \"being oneself\" or \"being strange\". This explains why thinking often occurs in opposites or polarities, as an either/or. All \"being strange\" has its origins in one's own self. \"Being strange\" becomes most obvious when persons, gestalt or cultures strongly deviate from one's own familiar situation. It is part of man's disposition to be cautious, suspicious of and at distance from everything considered strange and different. That explains his xenophobia feelings and actions. Behind this attitude we can always discover one's wish to preserve the familiar beliefs--combined with an uneasiness to give up one's thinking and behaviour that is proven and routine. It is only by reflecting on our own culture and our own inheritance that we have the possibility to come to terms with our own ethnic identity and foreign behavioral patterns. If we do not try to understand other cultures while keeping our own cultural identity, tensions and violent conflicts will inevitably result.",

Furthermore, we may then well think, events occurring at earlier times, by causing them, determine those at later times; by causing, the earlier leave no alternative but for the later to occur. There are some other further suppositions, somewhat more radical, which are also quite natural, even if they do not occur quite so easily or frequently as those just previously expressed: As things are determined so that prior events are causing everything which happens, there is no chance for any person himself to cause anything. There is, then, no possibility for you yourself to make anything happen, prior events always and inevitably taking care of things completely. Accordingly, it is not within your power to act, or to do anything at all. You are totally, completely impotent.",

In the antecedent clause the event or state denoted by the predicate must be perceptible. There are some exceptions to this restriction. The exceptional cases are where the event or state denotes a personal feeling on the part of the addressee (or addresser, in some cases). From these observations, it is concluded that the antecedent clause must be an event or state which can be directly experi­ enced by the addressee (or, addresser). In the consequent clause, the mood must be imperative, hortative or promissive. When the mood is declara­ tive or interrogative, the modality must be volitionaL These moods or mo­ dality can be characterized as something that can be satisfied by some ac­ tion on the part of the addresser or addressee.

      "title": "Altruism as a Function of Age and Deprivation: An Interactional Study",
      "abstract": "August Comte, a French philosopher and sociologist, first introduced the term, 'altruism'. Probably, he came to adopt the term from the Italian word, 'altrui'. For Comte, meant an unselfish regard for the welfare of others. According to Bryan and London (1970), altruistic behaviour refers to those behaviours which are intended to benefit another but which appears to have a high cost to the actor with little possibility of material or social Altruism is generally defined as any form of voluntary act intended to favour another without expectations of rewards (Smith & Mackie, 2000). It refers to a kind of selfless help, which is based on pure desire to help others (Aranson, Wilson, Akert & Fehr, 2004). Examples of altruistic behaviour cover a wide range including expression of support and sympathy, doing special favours to others, acts of generosity, active defence of the rights of deprived, engagement in voluntary activities for the mentally and physically handicapped and martyrdom. It is a desire to help others which expresses itself in many ways through sympathy, philanthropy, etc. A person with strong altruistic want has affection and concern for others and is usually contrasted with the selfish person. According to Hamilton (1978), altruistic behaviour which helps only the recipient can be distinguished from other types of intra specific social interactions, for example, cooperative behaviour which helps both parties, selfish behaviour which helps the donor only, and spiteful behaviour in which both parties lose. Altruistic behaviour involves helping, sometimes, even taking great risks even though the act is not likely to be rewarded, recognized or even appreciated. Thus, an altruistic act is selfless. The same has been stressed by Walster and Piliavin (1972) who say that altruism is [a] very special form of helping behaviour that is voluntary, costly to the altruist and motivated by something other than the expected one of material or social reward. Altruism then is selfless rather than selfish. Yarrow Scott and Walter (1973) point out that is not a specific form of behaviour rather it includes a diversity of responses such as helping, sharing, rescuing, sympathizing and undoubtedly more.The term, deprivation, has stemmed from the verb, 'to deprive', which means to dispossess or strip off an individual from certain things. It, thus, implies a felt loss. It indicates a state of certain deficiencies experienced by the individual which relates to certain features of the environment that are absent or inadequate in certain degree which cause an impact on the functioning of the individual. Thus, when one states of deprivation, the emphasis is on the relevant aspect of the environment which are deficient or wanted in some respects (Sinha, 1982). Nurcombe (1970) stated that deprivation refers specially to a disposition or loss of privileges, opportunities, material goods and the like which occur with reference to three interrelated sets of basic needs-physical, psychological and socio - cultural.Altruism is a trait found in everybody. However, individuals differ with regard to depending upon several factors. Social psychologists hold the view that is indeed not inborn but a learned trait. Children can learn to be altruistic, friendly and self-controlled by modelling and socializing. Therefore, age is an important determinant of across the life-span. It has been observed that children become more prosocial with age (Berndt, 1985; Chou, 1998; Collins & Getz, 1976; Eisenberg, 1982; Rai & Gupta, 1996; Sharma, 1996). In a recent study, Ojha and Pramanick (2010) found that with advancement of age increases significantly. But there are also studies which do not reveal age related effects on altruistic behaviours (Green & Schneider, 1974; Lowe & Richley, 1973; Midlarsky & Hannah, 1985). Studies directly related to the effect of environmental deprivation on are few and far between. …",

      "abstract": "Abstract We have all heard people say ‘Beauty is only skin-deep’, or ‘Beauty is in the eye of the beholder’: our culture promulgates a conception of beauty as subjective, superficial, and independent of other values like moral goodness or knowledge and understanding. Yet our taste in beauty affects many aspects of our lives, sometimes playing a decisive – and often detrimental – role in areas as wide-ranging as our identity and self-esteem, our morally salient decisions, and our relationship to the environment. This presents us with a choice: we can either ignore the facts – leaving our conception of beauty unchanged and allowing our taste to influence much in our lives while either not acknowledging such influence, or perhaps seeking to reprimand it; or we can take the power of beauty seriously and seek to harmonise our taste with our values. I argue for the latter option and propose a way of bringing beauty and taste in line with what matters to us using the notion of functional beauty. Adopting this strategy, I suggest, can have a powerful – and positive – impact on our self-esteem and wellbeing, our relationship to others, as well as our attitudes towards the environment.",

A curse expresses a wish for misfortune to someone, or more specifically a wish for something unpleasant or violent to happen to a person/group, up to a death wish. Similar to insults and threats, curses contain a negative emotional value and realise a form of verbal violence, as the speech act hints at a harmful event in the future: pending harm is invoked. Jews, Israelis, as well as the State of Israel or Zionism can all be targets of an antisemitic curse.",

      "abstract": "In the relevant circumstance of both relatively high burden or cost to others and low prospective gain for themselves, people have a prima facie duty to die sooner rather than later. This duty is a personal moral duty, not a \"societal\" duty, and thus, it in no way implies that others may demand that it be exercised. It is literally a duty to let death come, not a more general duty to die that encompasses active measures to ensure death. A person can owe this duty not only to close family and loved ones when they are heavily burdened, but in the right circumstances also to more distant persons, even to \"society\"; the fundamental reason is fairness to others in the society or insurance pool, given one's own evaluative preferences about trade-offs involving expensive, low-chance-of-benefit care. This personal moral duty to die does not extend to incompetent patients, at least not in any literal sense. The duty to die also does not jeopardize the marital vow, \"for better or worse, in sickness and in health\"; the creative and mutual relationship envisioned in a marital promise does not bar people from ever coming to think that they may be obligated to accept death because of effects on a spouse. Finally, although this duty is rooted in sensitivity to considerations of quality of life, it need not threaten the \"special\" value of individual life and lifesaving.",

      "abstract": "Abstract We subscribe to the assumption that the self is fundamentally relational—that is, entangled with significant others—such that key elements of the self are experienced in relation to significant others, even when others are not present. In our socialcognitive model of transference, transference occurs when a mental representation of a significant other is activated by cues in a new person that resemble the other. As a result, the self in relation to this significant other is activated, eliciting changes in affect, expectancies, motivations, and behaviors, as well as in the nature of the working self-concept, all reflecting the version of the self one is when with the significant other. Moreover, when people experience a threat to either a significant other relationship or the self in the context of an encounter with a new person who triggers transference, this sets into motion self-regulatory processes, which play out in relations with the new person. Overall, we argue that the evocation of prior experiences with significant others tells us something about the nature of the self, affect, and self-regulation that has implications for both resiliency and vulnerability.",

When something has a disposition, it is such that, if it were in a certain kind of circumstance, a certain kind of effect would occur. Dispositions include such varied properties as character traits like a hero’s courage, characteristics of physical objects like a wine glass’s fragility, and characteristics of microphysical entities like an electron’s charge. Some dispositions are natural while others are non-natural. Some dispositions called “powers” are ungrounded while non-fundamental dispositions are grounded in other properties. Some dispositions manifest constantly, some of them manifest spontaneously, while others manifest only when they are triggered to do so. Some dispositions manifest by causing another dispositional property to be instantiated, while others have manifestations that involve non-dispositional properties and relations. Some dispositions are intrinsic to their bearers while others are extrinsic. Some of them are causally relevant to their manifestations while others are not. Some dispositions manifest in some particular way in particular circumstances, while other dispositions manifest in various ways in various circumstances. What makes all of these diverse properties dispositions is their connection to a certain kind of counterfactual fact.

      "abstract": "Complexity is a term that is often invoked by those writing appreciatively about the taste, aroma/bouquet, and/or flavor of food and drink. Typically, the term is used as though everyone knows what is being talked about. Rarely is any explanation given, and the discussion soon moves on to other topics. However, oftentimes it is not at all clear what, exactly, is being referred to. A number of possibilities are outlined here, including physical complexity at the level of individual molecules, at the level of combinations of molecules giving rise to a specific flavor profile (e.g., as in a glass of quality wine or a cup of specialty coffee), at the level of combinations of distinct ingredients/elements (e.g., as when composing a particularly intricate dish in a high-end restaurant, say, or when pairing food with wine), and/or the number of stimuli/steps involved in the process of creation. Of course, people might also be referring to some aspect of their perceptual experience, and one of the intriguing questions in this space concerns the nature of the relationship(s) between these different ways of conceptualizing complexity in the chemical senses. However, given that physical/chemical and perceived complexity so often diverge, we argue that it is the latter notion, or rather inferred complexity, that is the most relevant when it comes to the chemical senses. Finally, we look at the role of expertise and review the evidence suggesting that inferred complexity can emerge either from a unitary taste experience that is judged to be complex, or from a tasting experience having multiple individuable elements.",

The presumed consent laws represent persuaded altruism designed by the egoistic needs of the society. Explicit consent is based on ‘direct reciprocity’. Financial incentives for organ donation and transplant tourism gratify egoism, as in reality, these donors are “sellers”, and altruism is absent in their motivation. The concept of receiving additional points for allocation priority if recipient /family register as donors is founded on ‘vested interests’. Living donation satisfies ‘psychological egoism’. Altruism is an ethical doctrine that holds that the moral value of an individual's actions depend solely on the impact on other individuals, regardless of the consequences on the individual itself. Psychological egoists respond that helping others in such ways is ultimately motivated by some form of self-interest, such as intrinsic satisfaction, the expectation of reciprocation, the desire to gain respect or reputation, or by the expectation of a reward in a putative afterlife. Therefore it would probably not be completely unethical to directly use egoism to promote organ donation rather than altruism.",

Teachers and parents can develop humanitarian giftedness by being role models, by sharing stories of humanitarian giftedness, and by encouraging it in their students. They also must discourage use of gifts for ends that harm humanity. The road to more humanitarian deployment of gifts is not through tests and other assessments, but through the development of humanitarian gifts as a learned form of expertise—as gifts not from genes, but rather from the interaction of the person with the tasks they confront and the environmental contexts in which they live.",

The fact that many languages devote a grammatical mood specifically to this kind of speech act shows that their speakers assign a particular role to them. We must not assume, however. either that imperatives are the only kind of prescriptions, or that all imperatives are similar to each other in all their features, The imperative mood can be used to express military commands, polite requests, instructions for using hair-driers or cooking omelets or finding a friend’s house, entreaties, prayers. and any number of other kinds of prescriptive speech act. The most general term for speech acts of this kind is telling someone to do something, in contrast to telling him (or her) that something is the case. This applies even to prayers, where the speaker has no authority or power of enforcement, but is in a completely subordinate relation.",

On this view help should not be seen as stemming from the recognition of contingent differences between those who are inclined to help and those who are in need, nor as a one-time response to evil, or as an act close to heroism. Help should be seen as an element of the pursuit of one of the ends which are also duties, i.e. as the promotion of the happiness of others and, at the same time, the self-perfection of the helping person. Helping results from a stable readiness to act for the benefit of others, which stems from one’s recognition of the weakness, limitation, and lack of self-sufficiency which are common to all humans, and so are shared by both the helper and the person in need.",

As rational and reasonable people, we care about developing our understanding, imagination, agility, dexterity, and other physical and mental abilities we have. We also value cultivating these powers in other people. The aims of this chapter are to describe a conception of what it is to be a naturally perfect human person, to explain our interest of reason in this kind of natural perfection of all people, to distinguish it from others, and to explore some presumptive laws of reason that are favored by our interest of reason in the natural perfection of everyone. A human person is naturally perfect just in case she has intrinsic properties that, for any end, lead to the realization of that end. Such an ideal person can accomplish all ends and is immanently useful for satisfying all ends. Rational and reasonable persons with interests of reason in the natural perfection of all could or would favor presumptive laws of reason that concern cultivating our own powers of body and mind, learning new skills, acquiring knowledge, toughening our bodies, not mutilating people, and educating children. Various kinds of friendships, social groups, economic competition, educational institutions, and political arrangements provide favorable conditions for enhancing the natural perfection of human persons. Our interests in natural perfection also favor laws that require us to feel pleasure, not pain, at the perfections of others and to feel pain, not pleasure, at their imperfections.",

Compulsive drug use may therefore be seen as an attempt to obliterate particular states of mind. In this paper addicts are considered as dangerously addicted to a loss of contact with parts of the mind as they are to a given drug. A splitting off, for example, of loving and nurturing or hateful parts of the personality is effected where these cannot be tolerated by or integrated into a pathological internal constellation. Deficits in early caregiving and environment as well as constitutional factors play a part in this. Addiction is therefore seen as an unconscious attempt to maintain a precarious inner equilibrium by destroying contact with parts of the personality, literally through their drugging. In psychic reality or in phantasy this may be felt as a slicing up or tearing to pieces, and so subjugation of objects. A clinical example will illustrate this idea.",

The emotional reaction, the mood and even the character are supposed to correspond to the facial expression. When we say to some one, \"Look at me,\" we mean, \"Look at my face.\" A woman's chief pride is her face. We speak of her face as her fortune. We are told to face our difficulties, and when our failures or shortcomings are exposed, we lose face in the community. To a Chinaman to lose his face is a major calamity. Often it is said that certain people as well as certain things give us a pain in the face.

      "abstract": "Abstract Surprisingly often Kant asserts that it is possible to behave in such a degrading way that one ‘throws oneself away’ and turns oneself ‘into a thing’, as a result of which others may treat one ‘as they please’. Rather than dismiss these claims out of hand, I argue that they force us to reconsider what is meant and required by ‘respect for humanity’. I argue that to ‘throw away’ humanity is not to lose or extinguish it, but rather to refuse or otherwise fail to claim the respect that it authorizes one to claim. If I refuse or fail to make this claim, there is a sense in which I become a thing, and I leave others no choice but to treat me as such. This is compatible with their respect for humanity in my person.",

Moreover, in Alarcón’s plays, prudent deception is invariably concerned with the maintenance of honour-virtue, and the discovery of moral truths, whilst cunning is employed in the pursuit of worldly or sensual goals such as social advancement, riches, and sexual gratification. A circumspect and reasoned approach often proves sufficient to expose the deceptions practised by others, but Alarcón’s protagonists must also learn to overcome the inducement to self-deception presented by the allure of worldly attributes such as beauty, wealth and position, and to regard these as irrelevant or illusory, and this kind of desengaño requires a higher degree of wisdom.",

In my probabilistic argument I pursue the second way, arguing that the existence and nature of the universe makes it probable that the universe was created and sustained by an essentially everlasting omnipotent person. An omnipotent person will be a “best-acting” God. He will therefore only allow bad states to exist if allowing them is logically necessary for the existence of some good state. I argue against Mark Murphy’s claim, that God is so different from ordinary humans that there is no reason to suppose that there is much in common between his obligations and those of humans. A morally perfect being would be not merely a best-acting God, but also a “best-feeling” God. He would allow himself to have the right feelings, which are feelings good in themselves, or right reactions to human actions and situations; or feelings which are logically necessary for a great good, such as the pain felt by Jesus on the cross. This account of God’s feelings is consistent with conciliar definitions that God is “impassible” in his divine nature.",

Without constitutive resistance, we are not able to know how to separate ourselves from the mother, and we do not know how to construct our autonomy in relation to the others. The state of ignorance due to language is violent and this has implications in the workplace as well. However, the ignorance is in a stronger collision there, because language in the workplace cannot be mere discourse. At work, people seek results and material and intellectual transformations.

Or perhaps it would be more appropriate to say that they have substance and meaning only as it is lent to them by the personal interests and assumptions of individuals, so that they change from generation to generation, from country to country, from circumstance to circumstance. The traditional dilemma of free will or determinism is entirely artificial, like most exclusive alternatives of a high order of abstraction. Freedom is subjectively illusory, if the absence of any experience of constraint depends upon the absence of a desire to do what one would be prevented from doing. It is the instinctive recognition of this truth that links the experience of a lack of freedom with the idea of oppression and tyranny. When men feel the loss of freedom they behave as though someone were responsible.",

      "title": "The Essentials of an Education. (Ment. Hyg., April, 1920.) Paton, S.",
      "abstract": "The essentials of an education are: (1) a knowledge of actual life; (2) a definite impelling interest in some phase of life; (3) the recognition from actual experience of one's own capacity and limitations of adjustment; (4) the acquirement of the emotional attitudes and habits necessary for perceiving and adapting to reality. These ensure against nervous breakdown, but are not synonymous with modern education, which views the problems of man as he was or may become, not his reactions as he is. Life is a process of slow adjustment, and must be accepted as it is. If elemental biological facts are not faced squarely serious personal difficulty arises. Conflict to the point of mental depression can be so met as to preserve sound personal judgment on public questions. Individual conscious processes are not so essential to adjustment as is believed: decision is made from well grounded feeling, often not from reason which can be logically detailed. An outstanding example is Abraham Lincoln, whom science cannot explain by his heredity or early experiences. Successful life implies consciousness of the reality of environment, and avoids the visions of intemperate idealism. The student is not taught to know himself, to estimate the present, and to intelligently adjust to immediate circumstances.

      "title": "Respect",
      "abstract": "Aretha Franklin asked her man (who she calls her baby) to show her a little bit of R-E-S-P-E-C-T when he came home. In health care, we may have never had more need to consider the implications of maintaining mutual respect between health-care workers, patients and relatives. The word respect has many nuances: it can be used as a noun, to show respect, or as a verb, to respect someone (Fig. 1). We sometimes use the term respect in a loose way, 'Ethics lite',1 either to mean the deference we owe to elders or to denote simple politeness, with the implication that respect must be earned. People cheapen the concept of respect by using the phrase 'with all due respect' when about to say something decidedly disrespectful. But fundamental human respect runs much deeper: it is an obligation on every person to respect the intrinsic dignity of every other person.1 Respect for other humans runs so deep that it continues after death: when Achilles killed Hector, mutilated his body and dragged the corpse behind his chariot, this desecration was outrageously disrespectful. The Ancient Greeks believed a dead body needed to be correctly prepared to find peace in the after-life. The Ethics Centre says: 'Respect for persons may perhaps be the most fundamental principle in all of ethics'.1 The 18th century German philosopher Immanuel Kant expressed this in terms of never using a person as a means to an end: Kant abhorred slavery. True respect should lead us to oppose discrimination against other persons on any basis: age, gender, sexuality, race or religion. True respect means we should not silence or insult others even when we disagree fundamentally with them. In health care, the need for respect is reflected both in our interactions with families and with colleagues. Families of child patients are often under stress, sometimes the extreme stress of coping with a devastating illness. They may come from a different cultural background from the health care personnel staff caring for their child and may have different expectations. It is beholden on health care staff to ask parents their opinion and to listen to the response. If we disagree, the conversation should always be respectful. The parents' opinion should not be dismissed out of hand, nor should the parents feel belittled. One principle of family-centred care is that the parents should be fully informed and their voice should be heard.2 However, in the event that the parents and doctors fail to reach agreement, there is arguably an obligation on parents to show respect to health-care workers. For 2500 years or more, at least since the time of Hippocrates, doctors have been afforded huge respect by patients and families, but this may be changing. Colleagues working in intensive care in Australia, the United Kingdom and the United States have remarked on an increase in the number of families challenging medical expertise and talking aggressively to staff. It is extraordinarily confronting for an experienced intensive care nurse to work an entire shift with the parents muttering under their breath: 'You'd think they would give us a nurse who knew what she was doing', as happened at our hospital recently. Some families deliberately praise some doctors or nurses and refuse to let others look after their child, a phenomenon known as 'splitting'.3 Health care workers need to set limits regarding such passive-aggressive behaviour and need to be supported by administrators in doing so. Aggressive parents need to be helped to recognise that treating health-care workers without respect is actually detrimental to the care of their child. With regard to our colleagues, all staff acknowledge the need to treat each other with respect, but we are humans and we transgress.4 An 'operating theatre' sounds like a recipe for drama. Tensions run high during tricky operations. This is no excuse for failing to treat colleagues with respect, both because we owe them respect as fellow humans and because patient care is likely to suffer when surgeons bully nurses and junior doctors. The behaviour of Australian surgeons has been highlighted in the media recently, with allegations of bullying and sexual harassment by individual surgeons and the surgical profession generally.5 A Royal Australasian College of Surgeons working committee found that 49% of surgeons and surgical trainees reported experiencing bullying, discrimination and sexual harassment. The college introduced an operate with respect course, which is mandatory for supervisors.6 While this could make a major difference to behaviour and alter a culture of disrespect for colleagues, it is perhaps significant that a fellow of the college writing an opinion piece praising the college's initiative decided to publish it anonymously.7 Respect is integral to autonomy. It is integral to ending discrimination. It is integral to ending bullying in the workplace. Let us all try to show respect to other people all the time.

      "title": "Love and its objects",
      "abstract": "Love is commonly reckoned to be one emotion among many. But how many emotions we think there are depends on what account we adopt of the necessary and sufficient conditions for something to be an emotion. If we think that emotions are simply our awareness of the physiological changes produced in us by our perception of certain sorts of objects, then we can try to count the different sorts of objects that are capable of causing these bodily sensations in us: for example, frightening objects, extraordinary objects, delightful ones. Or we can try to count emotions by distinguishing the different patterns of these physiological changes that certain sorts of objects and situations produce in us: in sorrow, irregular heart beats combined with weeping and trembling, for instance. However, if the view adopted is the one that we shall employ here, an emotional state consists in abnormal bodily changes caused by the agent's evaluation or appraisal of some object or situation that the agent believes to be of concern to him or her. Distinguishing such states from each other, and hence counting them, will require us to distinguish the different kinds of evaluations and appraisals embedded in them – evaluations, for example, of situations as being inexplicably strange or embarrassing or pathetic or pitiful or appealing. Since not all societies make these same sorts of evaluations, some emotions named and recognized in one society can be nameless and unfamiliar in another. Thus the German Schadenfreude, or malicious glee, is a response that is familiar outside Germany but perhaps not common enough in some societies for it to be classified by their members as an ordinary emotion.",

      "abstract": "Among psychologists, it is widely thought that infants well under age 3, monkeys, apes, birds, and dogs have been shown to have rudimentary capacities for representing and attributing mental states or relations. I believe this view to be mistaken. It rests on overinterpreting experiments. It also often rests on assuming that one must choose between taking these individuals to be mentalists and taking them to be behaviorists. This assumption underestimates a powerful nonmentalistic, nonbehavioristic explanatory scheme that centers on attributing action with targets and on causation of action by interlocking, internal conative, and sensory states. Neither action with targets, nor conative states, nor sensing entails mentality. The scheme can attribute conative states and relations (to targets), efficiency, sensory states and relations (to sensed entities), sensory retention, sensory anticipation, affect, and appreciation of individual differences. The scheme can ground explanations of false belief tests that do not require infants or nonhuman animals to use language. After the scheme is explained and applied, it is contrasted with other, superficially similar schemes proposed in the literature-for example, those of Gergely and Csibra, Wellman and Gopnik, Perner and Roessler, Flavell, and Apperly and Butterfill. Better methods for testing are briefly discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record",

Altruistic behaviours may be influenced, for example, by personal concerns for the well-being and interests of others that fit into a broader framework of values. We use an online experiment to explore how donors (pure altruists, warm-glow givers and impure altruists) differ in their structure of values, and whether their prosocial behaviours are guided by specific sets of values and motivations. We find that donors give great importance to the relationship with others, and they identify themselves with the norms and attitude of a community, responding to the values of tradition, conformity, benevolence and universalism. On the contrary, non-donors do not seem to have this kind of values reference and, therefore, are not inclined to make a donation. Furthermore, we find that impure altruists wish to achieve self-enhancement objectives through altruistic behaviour, as pure warm-glow givers do, but, at the same time, they make a donation because it represents a genuine altruistic act, similarly to pure altruists.

      "abstract": "Nostalgia may be considered as a particular mood (Stimmung) or a peculiar form of being (Dasein). Sometimes it can also degenerate into psychopathological disorders as “lived time” and “lived space” chronic alterations. Nostalgia phenomenology is characterized by three conditions: loss (past), desire (future), absence (present). This work aims at investigating them throughout an omnipotence-impotence fluctuating taxonomy. We have two main phenomenological types: 1) negationist-obstinate (subculture: impossible); 2) resigned-depressive (subculture: anaclitic). Each psychological type has an equivalent social culture: 1) thanatophobic screen culture (subculture: Telemaco complex and migrations society); 2) impossible xenalgic-nostalgic (subculture: war orphans’ silent nostalgia society). Finally, we have a third category named resilient-nostalgic dealing with Art as absence transformation device. Nostalgia becomes a shared condition for all human beings, a “presentification” process about an eternal past",

      "title": "The Significance of Names in Ghanaian Drama",
      "abstract": "The significance attached to names and naming in Ghanaian society is remarkable; it is strikingly different from what obtains in Euro-American cultures. Names of peoples, objects, spirits, and God tend to emanate from the interplay of religious, mythical, social, and historical realities (Abraham, 1962). Individuals are named on the basis of the culture's expectations and identification of the personality so named with particular clan or genealogical groups beliefs, birth order and circumstance, status, and attributes (Quartey-Papafio, 1913). For example, the Akan call a male child born on Saturday Kwame. A child doomed to cyclical birth and death is named Bejina (come and stay) and one whose paternity is not acknowledged or who is born to aging parents is called Nyame Kye (God's gift). Asante military tactics and Ga striking power are celebrated in the appellations Asante Kotoko (Asante the Porcupines) and Gagaa (Ga the Soldier Ants), respectively. This system of nomenclature seems to be the basic one subscribed to by many other African peoples including the Yoruba, Ewe, Igbo, Hausa, and African-Americans. Though the elaborate and formalized naming pattern may have been lost among the latter the African presence is maintained through the AfricanAmerican's widespread use of epithets, bynames, and nicknames (Asante, 1987, p. 73). Naming has colored the writing and artistic works of Africans, from earlier generations to contemporary times. What is lacking, though, is a systematic study of the nature and qualities of such nominal colorations as they arise from the various parts of the African world. The present article is a modest contribution in this",

      "title": "Values and Nature",
      "abstract": "Human relationships matter, and our relationships reflect our attitudes. Whether we are aware or not our attitudes and actions matter to our surroundings - and to ourselves. This is obvious from our attitudes towards other human beings. We may be kind and understanding and be recognizing likenesses with ourselves or what we cherish, or we may be hostile and without an ability to recognize any likenesses with ourselves.  As such our attitudes are expressions of emotional dispositions for experiencing things in a specific value-laden way, and values come into existence from the awareness of our attitudes to various things and reflections on their goodness and badness, rightness or wrongness - i.e. whether our attitudes reflect our right values. Values therefore seem to be pondered  attitudes, but his is by far normally the case. Most often values are traditionally accepted ways of viewing what is good and bad and right and wrong to do on this background of values and the actions therefore are not necessarily reflected and in accordance with what might be the right or true values. An examination of the possibly right values involves a deep reflection on human life and the nature of values and that includes all the aspects of human life - i.e. our relationship to nature:  to surrounding nature and to ourselves. We might discover the problematic relationship of human beings to nature on the background of destruction and perhaps hence exploitation and climate-change, but we might also start the other way round and ask which values - and that means which human and cultural conditions made it possible to develop values and attitudes that have over-exploitive and destructive consequences for nature - and ourselves.",

      "abstract": "PERSONALITY may be defined as a resultant of internal forces within an individual which affect his relationship to his environment. It may be regarded as a subjective concept and be subdivided into such components as impulse, temperament, character and intelligence1 (1). It is a form of 'potential energy,' a summation of attributes which can be brought to bear in the individual's dealings with the world. When it is expressed and becomes kinetic or active, one may designate it as behavior, an objective concept. To evaluate properly the endocrine glands as active causes or even as precursors of personality change, it is necessary to understand the mechanisms involved in any diseasepersonality relationship. These are the structural, the functional and the psychogenic. The most fundamental aspect of structure is the constitutional make-up of the individual. His hereditary factors express themselves in certain body types (pyknic or leptosomic) with a resultant predisposition toward one or another form of personality or mental disease (manic-depressive or schizophrenic).",

      "abstract": "Empathy has been described as an epistemic state – knowing what another individual is feeling, or as an affective state – feeling what another individual is feeling. There are less automatic, slightly more developed, versions of emotional empathy described in the literature. The concern was that empathy would somehow undermine theory of mind. Empathy that is not merely emotional empathy involves understanding the state of mind of the other, others' physical or social situation, and their differing goals. Empathy is important for understanding group norms. This is true of most social beings, like chimpanzees and dogs and rats. While the Kuni anecdote is an example of cognitive empathy coupled with a mistake in understanding, experimental work with rats suggests that perhaps they engage in more apt forms of empathy. Other animals may not have the exact kinds of empathy that humans are capable of, but sadly, humans continually fail to engage their empathy.",

      "abstract": "forkomne, who are sterkt medtatt, halvt 0delagt (av utmattelse, kulde, fattigdom, drikk ell. lign.).2 In fact, forkommenhet is probably the most obvious and idiosyncratic component of Andersen's works.3 Furthermore, as might be expected, the majority of critical studies tend to stress this issue even those whose subject is ostensibly far afield (e.g., Frik Hougen's Andersens Opplandsfort elling er) which makes it stand out all the more. None of these studies, however, attempts to determine the cause of forkommenhet ; up to now, the approaches have been largely symptomatic.4 Thus the term has taken on a considerable number of nuances, so that an individual who is called forkommen may be lonesome, isolated, alienated, rootless, sick or degenerate (physically or mentally), passe, inactive, anxious, hopeless, down-and-out, morally depraved, or a variety of these traits.5 Much as this list of qualifiers might add to the meaning of forkommenhet , it does not bring us appreciably closer to an understanding of its cause. At times, of course, the cause may be readily apparent, as when physical illness is the sole debilitating factor (e.g., in D0den ombord and Faerdig), but these cases constitute an insigificant minority. Most important, as can be seen from the descriptive list of symptoms above, forkommenhet must be defined mainly as a disease of the spirit, a pernicious state of mind caused by psychic trauma, and its etiology is by no means obvious. Clearly, this pervasive and dominating yet critically unexplained malady requires investigation. Moreover, the results should provide more than just an etiology of forkommenhet , for the issues involved concern the basic needs of every Andersen character, not just the forkomne ones.

Their temerity must be very great, if, after rejecting the production by a mind; I mean, a mind resembling the human (for I know of no other); they pretend to assign, with certainty, any other specific intelligible cause: And their conscience must be very scrupulous indeed, if they refuse to call the universal, unknown cause a god or deity; and to bestow on him as many sublime eulogies and unmeaning epithets, as you shall please to require of them.",

      "abstract": "The relationship between the obsessed one and the object of obsession is not based on caring. It is based on power, a show of brutishness, a game of ego. The possession needs to be absolute, to the point of excluding everyone else, and the obsessed attempts to demonstrate it all the time to get any pleasure from it. The obsessed is not concerned if this oppresses or even hurts the object of obsession.\r\n\r\nWuthering Heights is a psychological study of a man, named Heathcliff, whose soul is torn between the two opposing passions of love and hate. Instead of the psychologically stable world of character, based on the authority of the will and the security of accepted values, Wuthering Heights illustrates a world, psychologically, of compulsion, coercion, obsession, sadism, fanaticism, self-harm and addiction. Despite Heathcliff’s sadism, he is however satanic chiefly in his wounded pride. His obsessive love for Catherine is the single principle of his being. This passion is so enormous and so destructive, of everyone, that it seems insufficient and improper to call it love. \r\n\r\nThe capacity for love is in contrast with the ability to hate. Heathcliff hates with a vengeance. He initially aims at Hindley as the object of vengeance and hate, then at Edgar, and then to a certain extent, at Catherine. Because of his hate, Heathcliff’s resort to revenge is another consequence in the novel. Hate and revenge interweave with selfishness to reveal the conflicting emotions that force people to do things that are not particularly nice or rationale. This paper is an attempt to give a clear picture of the sources and consequences of the obsessive love-hate relationship among characters in the novel, paying close attention to the concepts of Romantic love and Demonic love.",

Moreover, the content of consciousness may be impaired by disease, as when a patient loses part of a visual field or sensation over part of the body.

I outline the scale of the phenomenon focusing on some prominent examples and distinguish a subset of what I call ‘high artworks’. In such artworks, I argue, drug experiences are encoded: their drug-related contextual and intrinsic properties or content are aesthetically or artistically relevant and should be mentioned in any in-depth analysis. I then further argue that it is impossible or at least very difficult to fully appreciate or produce optimal evaluations of a high artwork, unless one has oneself had drug-induced experiences of the kind encoded in the work. This is because such experiences afford one the relevant phenomenal knowledge that is otherwise inaccessible, yet required to gain an adequate level of competence allowing one to fully grasp the work.",

The senses’ respective representational modes, styles, and structures differ very strongly from each other. (2) The Layering thesis. A single sensory representation usually has more than one content; the perceptual state represents one object or property by representing a more primitive or less ambitious one. Though this “layering” is ubiquitous, its structure and range differs dramatically as between sense modalities, and in some modalities it works unexpectedly: for example, nearly all tactual representation derives from representation of conditions of or in the subject’s own skin, meaning that touch represents, e.g., the texture of a physical object by, and only by, representing stress within the skin; also the tactual layering is remarkably fine-grained and rich. (3) Aspect perception. Besides the intrinsic interest of “perceiving as”—even popular appeal, what with joke ambiguous figures such as the duck-rabbit and the old/young woman—it remains especially mysterious. Nearly all work on it has concerned vision only. But it is crucial for understanding auditory representation, which is one thing that distinguishes hearing from the other senses. Further, the auditory case greatly reinforces the idea that perceiving-as depends on expectations, it severely damages what we had thought was the best further approach to understanding aspect perception, in terms of attention.",

Whenever I read the newspapers, speak about history or science, and in fact whenever I get on a train, eat a meal, or perform many other ordinary actions, I am implicitly making acts of human or natural—that is to say, non-theological—faith. In so doing I may be following a spontaneous instinct, an acquired habit, or a free, voluntary decision. I may be said to be exercising faith in my senses, in my memory, in the reliability of a machine, or in the competence and integrity of other persons. The term “faith” is especially appropriate in the case of firm beliefs involving implicit trust in another person or other persons. Faith in this case is closely connected with love and loyalty. The English word “believe” is etymologically connected with the word “love,” just as the Latin credereimplies a gift of the heart (cordare). Faith normally leads to faithful action, which is a matter of”keeping faith” with persons or living up to one’s commitments. When a person is said to have or profess a faith, the reference may be to a com­prehensive vision that serves to give an interpretation of life as whole, including a scale of values. For convinced adherents, philosophical systems such as Platonism and ideologies such as Marxist Communism serve as faiths of a quasi-religious type. Faith in the theological sense includes everything connected with the secular meaning of the term. But over and above this, it is a response to God as he acts and manifests himself in the world and in human consciousness.",

      "abstract": "Abstract If there is to be an economy of esteem, then esteem must be something that it makes sense for people to demand and seek out by their own efforts, thereby giving rise to unintended, aggregative consequences; it must be more that something that they welcome but can do nothing about attaining. It may seem that acting on the desire for esteem is counterproductive, since being seen to act on such a desire is unlikely to win esteem. But this does not hold under all circumstances, only in some special cases. And anyhow it will not be counterproductive to act under the virtual as distinct from the active control of that desire. The desire will be in virtual control when habit or other forces normally produce action but retain control only so long as the action does all right for the agent in esteem terms: if it fails to do so, then the desire for esteem may be activated and may take active control.",

      "title": "Presence and Absence: The Paintings of Andrew",
      "abstract": "For a radical hermeneutic, God is always and everywhere, in all the epochs, essentially withdrawn from the world, even as faith says He is omnipresent. His very self-giving is self-withdrawing, a-lethic. God is never given in some sheer excess of presence or plenitude… His presence is deferred even as it is revealed… God’s presence is always caught up in the play of presence and absence. The faith of the believer consists in staying in play with that play, which involves maximum risk and uncertainty. Far from having magical powers, the eyes of faith suffer systematic strain from having always to do with shadowy forms and twilight figures. – John D. Caputo 1 Philosophers typically like things to be determinate and decidable. Philosophers of religion, in particular, do not like to contemplate anything less than a god whose qualities or attributes are precisely delineated (usually in a highly abstract and technical language), with the overall aim of reaching a decision as to whether to categorise themselves as ‘theists’ and reality itself as ‘theistic’. To arrive at such a decision, it is often presumed that empirical evidence both in support of and against religious belief must be sought and carefully evaluated. And as a result of this almost forensic investigation a determination can be made as to how likely it is that religious belief is true. 2 Finally, only if the balance of probabilities tilts heavily in favour of religious belief is it rationally acceptable to make a personal commitment to religion, a commitment that is forever revisable and contingent on the latest proofs and disproofs of God’s existence published in the professional philosophy journals.",

Since, indeed, religion is a part of the struggle for the preservation and perfection of life, it involves from the very beginning emotional states. But to speak of religion as originating in emotions is to assume a conception of religion which seems to me utterly unacceptable. If any sentiment or emotion, such as reverence or fear or awe, is found at the dawn of religion, it exists as part of the response, in a particular situation, to a sense of the presence of an invisible Being, upon whom one depends and with whom one desires to hold satisfactory relations. The emotion belongs to an experience involving the whole man, that is, man as a feeling, thinking, willing being.",

For this reason, humans are given the to choose between good and bad things. God himself has given trust to humans so that people always choose the good. God has made freedom an ethical foundation for humans to do. However, it turns out that there are many people who are unable to maintain God's trust; Most humans often choose bad deeds. The failure of religious obligations and irresponsibility is a form of human error in choosing freedom, and at the same time betrays God's trust in humanity. The failure of humans to fulfill their obligations and responsibilities is caused by the shortsightedness and narrowness of the human mind, and because of the shortsightedness and narrowness of the mind, humans often lose moral balance. In a long time, shortsightedness and narrowness of the mind will make the conscience of humans frozen, as a result humans increasingly away from the nature of events. Setiap individu tidak secara otomatis mampu merealisasikan keinginannya, namun manusia dilarang melupakan Tuhan selama dalam usaha merealisasikan keinginan tersebut dalam bentuk pengabdian kewajiban dan tanggungjawab. Untuk itu manusia diberi kebebasan memilih antara hal yang baik dan yang buruk. Tuhan sendiri telah member kepercayaan kepada manusia agar manusia senantiasa memilih yang baik. Tuhan telah menjadikan “kebebasan” sebagai “landasan etika” bagi manusia dalam berbuat. Akan tetapi ternyata banyak orang yang tidak mampu memelihara kepercayaan Tuhan tersebut; manusia kebanyakan sering memilih perbuatan yang buruk. Tidak terlaksananya kewajiban-kewajiban agama serta sikap tidak bertanggungjawab adalah bentuk kesalahan manusia dalam memilih kebebasan, dan itu sekaligus menghianati kepercayaan Tuhan kepada umat manusia. Gagalnya manusia menunaikan kewajiban dan tanggungjawab disebabkan oleh kepicikan dan kesempitan pikiran manusia, dan karena kepicikan dan kesempitan pikiran itu, manusia sering kehilangan keseimbangan moral. Dalam waktu yang lama, kepicikan dan kesempitan pikiran akan menjadikan “hati nurani” manusia beku, akibatnya manusia semakin jauh dari fitrah kejadiannya.",

      "abstract": "Treating the other as an autonomous person is widely considered a guiding ethical principle. The notions of autonomy and personhood are, however, far from evident in a time of striding naturalism. Hermeneutical phenomenology provides an explanation of these notions, and argues that personhood is not merely an ethical principle, but an integral part of vulnerability to mental illness. In other words, ethics and questions of norms and values are not merely a bioethical add-on to psychiatry, but an integral part of what it means to do psychiatry. Being a person is to be faced with the constant task of becoming who I am through the otherness that constitutes my life as a person. Otherness challenges my life from without (e.g., the way other people understand and treat me) and from within (e.g., my body, habits, and dispositions). Although a major aspect of personal identity is constituted by otherness, a person is able, nevertheless, to change her habits, think about her dispositions, and reconsider her actions. This ability to relate ourselves to what and who we are is constitutive of personhood and of the fragility that makes each of us the person that we are.",

Instead, we speak of a person's resolve, determination, or his anxiety, eagerness, and so forth, as the ‘powers’ that move us. Of course, one desires for various reasons to carry out his various intentions but that desire is not a component of the intentions. An intention is, roughly, the course of action that one has adopted, so it has no such components. There are other characteristics of intentions which the mental state idea of intentions does not share. Intentions do not have the temporal characteristics that mental states have, or share the curious context dependency that intentions have. And since, according to the theory, mental states operate causally, it would not be possible for a person to commit himself to a course of action as we ordinarily do when we make a promise or sign an agreement or contract.",

It need not correlate with the reality to an external observer of physical or psychological disability. Psychoanalytic emphasis is directed to the motivations for the persistence of this sense of defect, rather than primarily to etiology (trauma) or genetic history. Accurate perception and evaluation, having been interdicted during childhood, is avoided with the magical hope that thereby one will be acceptable and what is wrong will disappear. The interaction between self and parents, real and fantasied, cannot be clearly known. The patient remains uncertain as to what is wrong, in whom it is located, and how it has come about. The sense of defect, physical or psychological, becomes the nidus around which much is crystallized. This is then offered up to a parent (and the superego) as an appeasement and seduction, aiming to help this parent feel better by agreeing that the child is indeed the cause of what is wrong. Dangerously destructive (and sexual) wishes are defended against and atoned for by emphasis on one's defectiveness.",

However, the term “grief” is also used when referring to losses of various other kinds, as with grief over illness, injury, unemployment, diminished abilities, relationship breakups, or loss of significant personal possessions. Complementing such uses, we propose that grief over a bereavement and other experiences of loss share a common phenomenological structure: one experiences the loss of certain possibilities that were integral to—and perhaps central to—the unfolding structure of one’s life. Grief can thus be conceived of in a broad but still univocal way. To develop this position, we focus on the example of grief over involuntary childlessness, where lack of a concrete, historical object of emotion serves to make explicit the way in which grief concerns future possibilities. We go on to suggest that the phenomenological complexity, diversity, and prevalence of grief are obscured when approached via an abstract, simplified conception of bereavement.",

Both those who judge some particular person to be courageous or generous or just or whatever (using those words in accordance with commonplace usage) and those who apparently judge similarly (using those very same words, but doing so in order to give expression to their own particular systematic and coherent understanding of the virtues) will of course do so on the basis of some set of actions by that person. And it may well be the case, indeed it often enough is the case, that it is on the basis of the very same set of actions, performed in some limited set of situations, that both parties judge that particular person courageous or generous or just. Because he or she on a limited, but sufficiently numerous, range of occasions has done particular brave or generous or just actions and has not performed any clearly cowardly or niggardly or unjust actions, a settled disposition so to act is ascribed. But what it is crucial to notice is that although both parties are ascribing a disposition, using the same words to do so, it is not the same disposition that is being ascribed. The same sentences are being employed, but the judgements to which they give expression are in fact different. Wherein does the difference lie?",

When this happens, we may then fulfil our obligation to care for the other person not out of loving concern for them, but from other motives, such as the self-righteous satisfaction of having done our duty, or out of fear of not doing it. We thus find ourselves in a contradictory situation, of being faced by a demand on the one hand, which it is impossible to satisfy on the other, as the demand should not have arisen as a demand at all. When it does arise, we seem to be faced with a decision whether to act, and obey the demand for care; but for the agent who genuinely loves the other person, no such decision situation will arise, as no other option will appear to be available to them.",

      "abstract": "The usual distinction between diplomacy and force is not merely in the instruments, words or bullets, but in the relation between adversaries-in the interplay of motives and the role of communication, understandings, compromise, and restraint. Diplomacy is bargaining; it seeks outcomes that, though not ideal for either party, are better for both than some of the alternatives. In diplomacy each party somewhat controls what the other wants, and can get more by compromise, exchange, or collaboration than by taking things in his own hands and ignoring the other's wishes. The bargaining can be polite or rude, entail threats as well as offers, assume a status quo or ignore all rights and privileges, and assume mistrust rather than trust. But whether polite or impolite, constructive or aggressive, respectful or vicious, whether it occurs among friends or antagonists and whether or not there is a basis for trust and goodwill, there must be some common interest, if only in the avoidance of mutual damage, and an awareness of the need to make the other party prefer an outcome acceptable to oneself.",

By means of presence, actors can discover who they are at their cores and deliver a powerful message to the audience without any words.\r\nActor’s presence is available only if actor are aware of their living body. In other words, ‘Bodily-awareness’ is the decisive factor of actor’s presence. However, each actor has distinct habits which respond unconsciously and cannot be inhibited volitionally. Habits distort proprioception, the major source of bodily awareness.\r\nThere are four fundamental habits which inhibit actor's presence on stage. Namely, habitual concentration on time, space, oneself, and goals. To explain, actors have a tendency to focus on the past or the future rather than the present, and they are likely to pay attention to the audience or counterparts without being aware of their bodies and the whole space surrounding them. Furthermore, there is a big chance that actors have self-consciousness, which means comparing or evaluating themselves with the norms as opposed to bodily-awareness. Plus, actors tend to concentrate on extrinsic targets toward the audience, director, and character. These habits tenaciously make actors not mindful of their bodies.\r\nIf actors learn how they discover and inhibit their own habits, they can build their own methodologies that are able to train themselves as existent actors on stage. Alexander technique would be a powerful method to recover actor's body awareness, leading to actor's scenic presence.",

      "abstract": "What is the first thing that comes to mind when you hear the word leader? I imagine it conjures images of power and influence. Some think of wealth and status. Some think of specific individuals who represent leadership to them. Often leaders are thought of in very positive ways. Some might even say mythical ways (Bennis, 1999). Everyone wants to be thought of as a leader. In fact, research suggests most people do think of themselves as leaders (Laurent, 1978). Parents want their children to be leaders, not followers. Indeed, when someone says that one is a follower, it is generally not a compliment. However, people actually spend far more time in the position or role of follower (Kelley, 1992). Now, what comes to your mind when you think of the word: follower. I suspect the images are ones of blind obedience, passivity, perhaps even weakness. Sheep are a common metaphor that comes to mind for many. When we combine these first thoughts about leadership and followership, the conception of the relationship between leaders and followers is one of strength and greatness contrasted with and presiding over weakness, passivity, and obedience. While this conceptual paradigm of the relationship between leaders and followers is relative common, it is nonetheless inconsistent with the realities of the leader-follower dynamic. The relationship between leaders and followers is far more dynamic and varied than these default paradigms suggest. This is particularly true when one adds the term servant to the leader-follower dynamic. This article explores the impact of this addition with a particular emphasis on the concept of the servant-follower.",

Such individuals lack, in the fi rst place, the fundamental cognitive skill being the awareness of their own and other people’s mental acts. The absence or insuffi ciency of the theory of mind gives rise to disorders in acquiring the linguistic worldview, inability to decode fi gurative meanings, failure to use langue in order to maintain contact, and failure to speak of language itself, and many more. Autistic people are characterised by the metonymic cognitive style, which uses the potential of the so-called systemising skills. Instead of thinking of other people, what to say to them and what should be said to them, people with autism think of the things that do not require familiarity with the theory of mind and are not as complex as humans.

      "abstract": "This analysis of the concept of a human action takes its point of departure in the fact that actions are things done by persons. But people do many things which do not qualify as actions. A necessary condition for calling something done an action, is that the agent intends or means something by it, in the sense that the agent has some specific end in mind. Thus an action may be said to be the externalization, realization, or expression of the agent's meaning. But what precisely are such meanings or intentions that are given expression in actions? How are they to be distinguished from other mental contents ? The author tries to answer these questions by distinguishing them, on the one hand, from experiences, sensations, feelings, and, on the other hand, from other thoughts and meanings that do not find expression in the action. It is claimed that this account of action explains many characteristics of actions: that actions are appraised, not described (because meanings are evaluated), that an action is regarded as a unity (because the meaning is a unity), that the intention and the performance are not causally related, but related as are the content and expression of linguistic utterances, etc.",

Not just the unexpected startles him by its chance happening: the customary and presumedly permanent background for the appearance of the unexpected is now itself seen as contingent. What astonishes him is the most familiar: the most familiar did not have to be at all. Contingency, not subjectivity, is the fundamental ontological category of Montaigne's self-understanding. Thus Auerbach can say of Montaigne that \"among all his contemporaries he had the clearest conception of the problem of one's self-orientation; that is, the task of making oneself at home in existence without fixed points of support.\"",

      "abstract": "Unfortunately, formality has been diverted from its prime object and has lost its original meaning. Really it has become an irresistible fascination to the modern society. We like formality. We anticipate formality. We enjoy formality. So we praise a formalist and laugh at a less formal or non-formalist who is also called an unsocial or uncultured fellow. In true sense, nobody is absolutely free from the addiction of this so-called social custom. So an individual of any caste, creed, religion or nationality is more or less formalist, and thus he acquires a peculiar character which varies from individual to individual, society to society, etc. Also it changes with time. Human being, therefore, may be described as a born formalist. But this innocent customary behaviour has, by the so-called social tyrants, been converted simply into a torture only. In fact, formality in its limited range is good, but it is more than dangerous when it crosses that limit. Now since formality becomes the root of suffering of man, an individual who does not like to suffer should avoid formality. There is a person who neither accepts nor does he offer gift. So he seldom is afraid of any invitation. But the poor people are always afraid of any invitation. Further, instead of expending much for formality, it is judicious and noble deed as well to spend for the ailing humanity thus to enjoy intense heavenly delight. However, to offer food to a hungry man is not so-called formality but humanity which is very essential for society’s benefit and hence it is cordially welcome.",

Destitute alike of speed to avoid and of arms to repel the aggressions of his voracious foes; tenderly susceptible of atmospheric influences; and unfitted for the coarse aliments which the earth affords spontaneously during at least two thirds of the year, even in temperate climates, — man, if abandoned to mere instinct, would be of all creatures the most destitute and miserable.",

That felicity in writing has the same effect upon us that happiness in common life has: that in life when any thing lucky arrives to us, upon the first surprise we have a transport of joy, which is immediately followed by an exaltation of mind: ut res nostrce sint ita nos magni atque humiles sumus; and that both these, if the thing that happens be beyond expectation fortunate, are accompanied with astonishment: we are amazed at our own happiness: that the very same thing befalls us upon the conception of an extraordinary hint. The soul is transported upon it, by the consciousness of its own excellence, and it is exalted, there being nothing so proper to work on its vanity; because it looks upon such a hint as a thing peculiar to itself, whereas what happens in life to one man, might as well have happened to another; and lastly, if the hint be very extraordinary, the soul is amazed by the unexpected view of its own surpassing power. Now it is very certain that a man in transport, and one that is lifted up with pride and astonished, expresses himself quite with another air, than one who is calm and serene.",

      "title": "Willa Cather's \"Consequences\" and &lt;i&gt;Alexander's Bridge&lt;/i&gt;: An approach through R. D. Laing and Ernest Becker",
      "abstract": "Willa Cather's \"Consequences\" and Alexander's Bridge:An approach through R. D. Laing and Ernest Becker Fritz Oehlschlaeger (bio) In his classic work of existential psychiatry, The Divided Self, R. D. Laing explores and defines a \"schizoid way of being-in-the-world\" characterized by what he calls \"ontological insecurity,\" a condition in which \"the individual in the ordinary circumstances of living may feel more unreal than real; in a literal sense more dead than alive; precariously differentiated from the rest of the world, so that his identity and autonomy are always in question\" (42). The ontologically insecure person may respond to the anxiety that becomes his constant condition by a splitting or division in the self. He seeks to protect his inner or true self, which comes to be experienced as \"transcendent\" or \"disembodied,\" by developing a \"false self system\" (73) whose job it is to confront and manage reality. Moreover, there is in the ontologically insecure person \"a failure to sustain a sense of one's own being without the presence of other people. It is a failure to be by oneself, a failure to exist alone\" (52). Such dependence on others for one's identity, however, threatens the self with engulfment, with \"complete loss of being or absorption into the other\" [End Page 191] (44), and thus the ontologically insecure person frequently retreats into utter isolation. For him the poles of existence cease to be separateness and relatedness, for these are based upon a firm sense of one's own autonomy. Instead, he is torn \"between complete isolation or complete merging of identity . . . each equally unfeasible\" (53). Laing's description of ontological insecurity provides an extraordinarily useful set of concepts with which to approach two of Willa Cather's studies of anxiety and psychic division, the 1912 novel Alexander's Bridge and the 1915 short story \"Consequences,\" which shares many of the novel's motifs.1 \"Consequences\" is the story of a young man's being driven to suicide by his double, an alter-ego or projection of himself as an old man. Its hero, Keir Cavenaugh, is completely dependent on others for his identity. Indeed what one of Laing's patients said of himself could easily have been said by Cavenaugh: \"Other people supply me with my existence\" (52). Alexander's Bridge, of course, is the story of an engineer, Bartley Alexander, who undergoes a comprehensive splitting of his personality at midlife. After Bartley renews his relationship with Hilda Burgoyne, his becomes clearly a \"schizoid way of being-in-the-world.\" Why Bartley becomes thus divided can be illuminated dramatically by looking at his experience from a perspective supplied by Laing and by the related work of Ernest Becker. To define the nature and sources of Bartley's fragmentation and to allow \"Consequences\" and Alexander's Bridge to shed light on one another will be my purpose here. Keir Cavenaugh is the thirty-two-year-old son of \"a Pennsylvania preacher, who died soon after he discovered that his ancestral acres were full of petroleum\" (71). Cavenaugh has come to New York, where the story is set, to enjoy his fortune, which he does by lavishly entertaining others. But entertaining is not simply a pastime for Cavenaugh; it is the means by which he sustains his precarious sense of identity: His motor hit the Park every morning as if it were the first time ever. He took people out to supper every night. He went from restaurant to restaurant, sometimes to half-a-dozen in an evening. The head waiters were his hosts and their cordiality made him happy. They meide a life-line for him up Broadway and from Fifth Avenue. (71) Cavenaugh soon comes to be pursued, however, by an old man of decayed and shaby gentility. This figure seems to have an independent existence, but he is also clearly Cavenaugh's double, an alter-ego or projection of Cavenaugh himself as an old man. He appears only to Cavenaugh, and Cather is careful to leave ambiguous the problem of his corporeality. What [End Page 192] seems especially to disturb the old man is a photograph of Cavenaugh's twin brother Brian, who...",

It may be traced to the old phylogenetic submissive posture in animals, which is a pattern of behavior belonging to the group of survival instincts. Different forms of proskyneses and servility may emerge as an expression of psychotic behavior in man, reflecting a special stage of \"archetypical\" (C.G. Jung) consciousness. Archetypical conciousness is understood as a special step in the emergence of the human mind, thought and self-consciousness. The freedom of thinking--as the highest function of the human mind--is lost in every psychotic disorder. Archetypical consciousness with its lower stages of thinking may be typical for one kind of psychotic thinking disorder. Diagnostic problems may arise, if one does not recognize the drive of instinctive behaviour which lies behind the mere forms of human costums and religious rites.",

An adult in a wholly strange environment also may still be at home within himself; indeed, he may depend more on himself, the less a strange environment welcomes him.

The wisdom of nature still speaks from the tranquillity of the animal's gaze, because in animals the will and the intellect are not yet far enough apart that they can find one another surprising when they encounter one another again. The whole of appearance still hangs tightly onto the trunk of nature from which it sprouted, and is part of the unconscious omniscience of the great mother. – Only after the inner essence of nature (the will to life in its objectivation) has advanced vigorously and cheerfully through the two realms of beings that lack consciousness and then through the long and wide series of animals does it finally, with the onset of reason (which is to say in the human being), reach the point of awareness: then it is surprised by its own work and asks itself what it is. But its sense of wonder is all the more serious since this is its first conscious confrontation with death, and along with the finitude of all existence, the futility of all striving becomes more or less evident. Thus together with this awareness and this sense of wonder there arises the need for metaphysics that is distinctive to humans alone; a human being is, accordingly, a metaphysical animal. At the beginning of his consciousness of course he takes himself as something self-evident as well. But this does not last for long: very early, at the same time as the first act of reflection, we already find that sense of wonder that some day is to become the mother of metaphysics. Accordingly, Aristotle says at the beginning of his Metaphysics: ‘For it is due to this sense of wonder that people begin to philosophize now as before.’a And the truly philosophical state consists in the first instance in being able to entertain a sense of wonder about habitual and everyday things, since this causes one to problematize the universal aspects of appearance; researchers in the sciences of the real, meanwhile, only wonder about contrived and rare appearances, and for them the problem is just to reduce these rare appearances to more familiar ones.",

      "abstract": "As an operative force, the well-known mechanism of catharsis (cleansing, elimination, purification, purge, purgation of emotion, epuration...) can easily be used or misused, depending on the context of its appearance. A mediating question would be whether this mechanism is set in motion spontaneously, or if it must be seen as almost always assembled and constructed. What are the conditions in which it appears? Can it be elicited anywhere, at any moment? Can it be set in motion by anyone? In order to fulfill its purpose as an artistic practice, and thus to have a far-reaching impact, it needs to be conceptually unobtrusive and inconspicuous. Conversely, with its improper use, any content aiming to convince, to leave an impression or an imprint of authenticity, can be viciously exposed to ridicule or scorn. Worse, it can lose its credibility altogether. Briefly, my thesis is that the use or misuse of the mechanism of catharsis (I would dare to contend – even of affect itself as the power of performing) is directly tied to the functionality or disfunctionality of a community, which in our case means a community with democratic aspirations.",

      "title": "What's So Special About Human Dignity?",
      "abstract": "I must confess that I don't know exactly what that is: human dignity.1 – Jean Améry, At the Minds Limits: Contemplations by a Survivor on Auschwitz and Its Realities (1980). What a sorry state for the human mind to be in, that the most remote and trivial ideas about the revolution of the heavens should be better known than the moral notions which are near to hand and of the greatest importance… This apparent paradox vanishes if we consider how objects too close to our eyes become blurred.2 – Cesare Beccaria, “Of Honor” (1764). Human dignity is something special. Or so it seems to us humans at least. As one prominent theorist recently explains: “The core idea of human dignity is that on earth, humanity is the greatest type of being.”3 And who could deny it? Don't our unique human capacities (for reason, technological mastery, freedom, self-control, etc.) mark us out from the beasts, as it were? Don't they grant us a special dignity—an elevated place in the order of creation?4 It is a wonderful piece of self-flattery. But nothing in the concept of human dignity actually commits us to it. Dignity can be shared across species. There is no logical rule against this. Indeed, chickens may well have a dignity (i.e., chicken dignity) that rivals that of human beings, even if it may not impose the same practical requirements (such as the right to vote). At its core, talk about human dignity is simply talk about the kind of dignity attributable to human beings; it need not make any assumptions, positive or negative, about the dignity attributable to other animals. This is not a trivial point. As Michael Meyer puts it, it would be a “cruel irony” if human dignity, a foundational moral idea of our time if anything is, turned out to be an inextricably speciesist concept.5 This paper argues that human dignity is special in a rather different sense. If we think of normative concepts (justice, mercy, charity, freedom, equality, utility, etc.) as plural—that is, if we think there is more than one, and that each picks out a meaningfully distinct set of concerns—then we might wonder how the concept of human dignity fits into this varied landscape. Is there anything special about the concerns it raises, or the practical directives it issues? And if so, what? In what follows, I suggest that dignity's concern is with social status and its markings—or what we sometimes call “honor.” What it requires is that we avoid subjecting people to the specific (socially oriented) harm of humiliation or degradation and, more positively, that we help protect them from such harm, too. In arguing this, I am taking sides in an established debate.6 But I offer new reasons for taking this side, and develop the technicalities of the view. Theories of dignity are often stipulative.7 Some associate dignity with a duty to respect the moral inviolability of persons;8 others, with a duty to promote basic capabilities;9 others, with the virtue of self-control;10 and so on. Apart from observing certain obvious constraints—e.g., that human dignity must belong to all human beings, and generate reasons and/or duties—thinkers just seem to plonk down in favor of their preferred (stipulated) view. And this fuels a common perception that dignity is, in the end, just a placeholder (“nothing but a phrase”) on which nearly any theoretical agenda can be projected—a quality that some have argued is, ironically, key to its success.11 But dignity is not just a placeholder. On the contrary, it is rich in normative content. And this content is, once again, special; it has to do with our social lives, and social vulnerabilities, in particular. Moreover, we can demonstrate this by examining considered judgments about particular cases.12 A complete philosophical theory of human dignity should have four main components. First, it ought to tell us something about human dignity's nature, or “what” it is. Is it a kind of value, status, or virtue?13 Second, once we understand what human dignity is, we'll want to know what grounds it—that is, how and why one comes to possess or lose it. Third, as a normative concept, a complete theory of human dignity should tell us what its practical requirements are: what duties and/or reasons it generates. And fourth, there are methodological questions about how inquiry into all of this should proceed and be understood. One natural way to construct such a theory is to begin by answering the first question, about human dignity's nature, and then to address the other questions accordingly. For instance, if we start by thinking of dignity as a virtue, this will structure our thinking about its grounds and practical requirements. On the one hand, it will have to be grounded in aspects of one's character and behavior (e.g., the tendency to “stand up for oneself,” or to keep composure under challenging circumstances). And as for its practical requirements, these will depend, at least in part, on our understanding of the correct response to virtue (or vice), such as praise (blame), admiration (contempt), or reward (punishment). My strategy here will be different, and in a sense opposite. Instead of starting with an account of its nature, I start with some observations about human dignity's practical requirements—in particular, about the conditions of its “violation.” The various accounts or theories of human dignity I consider below should be understood as accounts of these requirements, first and foremost. Once we are satisfied that we have the right practical account, we can then use it as a benchmark for understanding the idea more generally.14 Bicycle Theft: Sheila bikes to work one morning. Upon arrival, she responsibly locks her bicycle to a rack on which plenty of other bicycles are also locked. At the end of the workday, she once again emerges only to discover that her bicycle has been mercilessly stolen. Sheila is, of course, morally wronged in this instance. If, like her, you own a bicycle, others have a corresponding duty not to take it without your consent. But however obvious it is that Sheila is wronged, it is not as clear that her human dignity is at stake, or in any way undermined. Indeed, I think most would resist understanding this as a violation of human dignity, at least on the current description. Vandalism: One evening, a group of adolescents get up to no good and, in a fit of juvenile delinquency, throw a rock through the window of a local corner store. Thankfully, it is after closing hours, so the shop is empty, and no one is hurt. This too, of course, is wrongful treatment—a senseless (and dangerous) attack on private property. But do the reckless adolescents violate anyone's human dignity? Once again, this seems less clear. Not all moral wrongs convincingly register as violations of human dignity, then. And this suggests that dignity is normatively special—that its violation represents a particular type of wrong. Such a claim might seem obvious, in the abstract. But it happens to be at odds with a large body of existing theory. According to many theorists, human dignity is concerned with humanity's membership in the moral community, with “moral status,” rather than the provision of some particular moral good. This is what we might call a Gateway theory. Any treatment short of what is owed to human members of the moral community—to anyone residing within that gateway, as it were—will violate dignity, on such a view.15 Just what sort of conduct this includes will depend on the type of Gateway theory one adopts. On a standard version of the view, human dignity requires respect for the moral “worth” of Homo sapiens—for the fact that, unlike rocks, cloud formations, and kitchen cabinets, human beings are objects of intrinsic (rather than merely instrumental) concern, and are owed a full gamut of moral observances in light of this.16 On another version, popularized by thinkers like Joel Feinberg and Stephen Darwall, dignity demands respect for the moral “authority” of persons: the right to claim moral treatment, or “stand up” and insist that one actually gets what one is owed.17 This is sometimes understood as a requirement of respect for rights, i.e., an agent's authoritative claims against others.18 But it is also understood in contractualist terms, as a basic demand to treat others in “justifiable” ways.19 Either way, Gateway theories can hardly make sense of our judgments about Bicycle Theft and Vandalism. Not only do these cases both involve (“unjustifiable”) moral wrongs, they both involve rights violations, and thus violations of dignity, on the Gateway view. Perhaps this moves too fast, though. It is possible that the cases do register as attacks on human dignity: just very minor (nearly indetectable?) ones. After all, as far as moral wrongs go, these are relatively harmless. Worse things can happen to a person. And if minor wrongs like these come across as minor violations of human dignity, this is conceivably all well and good from the point of view of Gateway theories. But this conciliatory strategy won't work. For one, even if there is room for disagreement about this, it seems entirely natural to understand Bicycle Theft and Vandalism as posing no threat to human dignity. And that's of course not something that can be explained by appealing to the minor nature of the wrongs themselves. More importantly, though, we shouldn't confuse the gravity of a crime with its patency. Even if they aren't especially grave, the two cases patently involve moral wrongs—indeed, rights violations. According to Gateway theories, they should also patently involve dignity violations. But they do not. These cases give us reason to think human dignity is special: that not all moral wrongs violate, attack, besmirch, or undermine it. This only raises a further question, however. If dignity is special, what's so special about it? What distinguishes “dignitarian” from “non-dignitarian” harms? To answer this, we need more data. And for that, we can consider variations on the preceding cases, as well as others. If we discover patterns in these variations, or factors that consistently trigger (or assuage) concerns about dignity, this will be instructive. For instance, while the average bicycle theft isn't naturally (or normally) pegged as a violation of human dignity, much depends on the details. What if Sheila is a disabled person, and the theft is a premeditated attack designed to take away her only means of independent transportation: a modified bicycle custom-built for her at great cost? If this is part of the case description, it becomes more natural to think it describes an assault on dignity.20 Or imagine, in Vandalism, that the adolescents involved are young members of the Ku Klux Klan, and attack the store in order to intimidate its owners: an African American family that has just recently moved into a mostly white neighborhood. Once again, these details change things. They make it difficult not to think of the case as an attack on human dignity. Homicide: Late one evening, Charlie is walking home. As he nears the doorstep of his apartment building, two armed assailants approach him, and attempt to steal his backpack. This creates a struggle, in the midst of which one assailant fires a gun, striking Charlie in the chest. The injury proves fatal. Unlike the previous cases, this is a grave crime from the start. Like those cases, however, altering its details can transform its dignitarian significance. Suppose, once again, that we introduce an element of discrimination: Charlie is attacked because he is an immigrant who, according to the assailants, does not “belong” in their country. Or, suppose we alter details about the manner in which Charlie is killed. What if Charlie is shot, not haphazardly in “the heat of the moment,” as it were, but in cold blood, at point blank range, in the head? Or what if Charlie is made to kneel or lie down before being shot from behind, in the style of a summary execution? What if he is beheaded on his doorstep? These excruciating details transform the nature of the crime in a profound way. They inject a kind of offense (or outrage) into it that strongly triggers concerns about human dignity. But what, if anything, does this tell us about the nature of such concerns? The philosophical literature provides us with a litany of interpretive options here. There are a number of influential theories that, unlike Gateway theories, tie human dignity to a specific moral value, principle, or injunction—one which, crucially, may be at issue in the case of some moral wrongs but not others. To simplify things, we can group these theories under two broad headings: Autonomy and Inviolability theories. The former link human dignity to a requirement of respect for human autonomy. The latter link it to respect for the moral inviolability of persons or the rights thereof. Consider each group in turn. Some Autonomy theories focus strictly on so-called “negative” liberty: that is, simple duties of noninterference.21 But most incorporate positive duties as well. For instance, James Griffin links human dignity to respect for “personhood”—our capacity to independently formulate a life plan and then to act on it.22 Respecting this capacity involves noninterference, but it also requires material and educational assistance (what Griffin calls “minimum provision”).23 Similarly, Martha Nussbaum understands human dignity to require “creating the conditions” in which individuals can exercise and develop their “central human capabilities,” such as capacities for health, imagination, thought, sensation, emotion, practical reasoning, friendship, play, and so on.24 This isn't just a matter of leaving people alone. It requires providing them with reliable access to various life-enhancing goods. These are attractive theories, considered on their own terms. But they have questionable interpretive power in the present context. It is true that, in Bicycle Theft, part of what distinguishes the more egregious, dignity-violating version of the crime is that, in it, Sheila loses not just a bicycle but her sole means of independent mobility—an important aspect of her personal autonomy. So, Autonomy theories do have some hope of explaining why that version of the case more naturally registers as an attack on dignity. But consider Homicide. Why, if Autonomy theories are correct, does a coldblooded gunshot to the head strike us as more of an affront to human dignity than a frightened gunshot to the chest? After all, both are squarely against the wishes of the victim, and equally likely to result in death and the destruction of agency. Why do factors like the posture and position of a victim and perpetrator at the moment of killing so strongly amplify (or relax) our sense that human dignity is at stake? Why, when all else is equal, do facts about the subjective attitudes of a perpetrator toward their victim, and whether these attitudes are discriminatory or not, demeaning or not, so strongly affect our sense of whether the perpetrator commits a dignitarian crime? These questions are not easily answered by Autonomy theories. Inviolability theories face even graver interpretive difficulties. According to such theories, human dignity requires that every individual enjoy a set of basic entitlements (e.g., to life, privacy, autonomy, equality, minimum welfare, etc.) that, barring only the most extraordinary circumstances, are not to be overridden or traded off, even when this would serve some demonstrably greater good.25 As John Rawls puts it, it means that persons “possess an inviolability… that even the welfare of society as a whole cannot override.”26 This idea is often associated with Kant, and his “Formula of Humanity,”27 but it also finds expression in Catholic ethical doctrine, where dignity is similarly associated with an “inviolable” right to life—often in a markedly absolutist mode.28 This is a popular way of understanding the practical import of human dignity: that it erects a strong (normative) “shield” around individual rights or persons. Still, it too has limited heuristic value in the present context. The main reason for this is that all of the cases described above, regardless of variation, break this shield, as it were. They all violate “inviolable” rights— e.g., to life, liberty, and property. According to Inviolability theories, the cases should therefore all come across as blatant violations of human dignity. But again, they do not. Some register as more obvious attacks on dignity than others. And it is not clear how Inviolability theories can explain this. Where else might we look for insight, then? In 1970, Peter Berger, an Austrian-American sociologist, published a short essay entitled, “On the Obsolescence of the Concept of Honor.”29 In it, he argues that the idea of “honor” has grown outdated: today, an individual asserting it “hardly invites admiration, and one who claims to have lost it is an object of amusement.”30 In place of honor, Berger argues the modern West has rallied around the notion of “human dignity,” which he understands to be importantly different. Berger explains that the acquisition and maintenance of honor is a social achievement. It requires public display, external approval, and the fulfillment of social roles. Human dignity, by contrast, is a more inward-looking concept, in Berger's view. It is something one is meant to possess and pursue outside of the strictures of society, as part of a romantic search for individual authenticity or self-enlightenment.31 Berger's thesis is interesting because it draws a stark contrast that we should reject. As several others also note, it turns out to be more illuminating to focus on the continuities between the “old” notion of honor and the “new” concept of universal human dignity.32 Much like insults to honor, violations of human dignity characteristically humiliate, shame, or degrade. They attack our social standing, above all—undermining our sense of pride and belonging in society. This is, in short, what I think is special about human dignity. What it demands is that we avoid subjecting others to gross humiliation or degradation, and that we help protect them from such harm, too. According to the Oxford English Dictionary, to “degrade” means to “reduce from a higher to a lower rank, to depose from a position of honor or estimation.”33 If we think of human dignity as essentially concerned with a harm of this sort, we can make good sense of the cases (and variations) examined in Sections III and IV. Consider Bicycle Theft, for example. Part of what separates the dignity-violating version of that case from its ordinary counterpart is not just its greater overall impact on the victim's life, but its degrading or humiliating character. The variant case is degrading for a number of reasons. For one, unlike its more benign counterpart, it strips its victim of something ordinarily considered (and that we expect Sheila herself considers) crucial to one's pride or self-respect: independent mobility. In this regard, the sheer impact of the crime degrades its victim in a way that ordinary cases of bicycle theft do not. Then there is the matter of the crime's intent. Unlike most ordinary cases of bicycle theft, this is a malicious and premeditated attack on a disabled person, which is significant in two ways. First, it means that there is something distinctly personal about the theft. It is no mere coincidence that Sheila's bicycle is the one stolen that day; rather, the perpetrator steals Sheila's bicycle precisely in order to attack her. It is humiliating (not to mention terrifying) to be targeted for attack by others, particularly when this is to exploit a vulnerability (in this case, a physical disability) that is already a source of stigma for the victim involved. In this way, the dignity-violating theft reinforces, or forms part of, a more general pattern of social exclusion and discrimination that is degrading in its own right. Second, the intended impact of the crime—to render Sheila dependent and immobile—suggests that it is meant not just to harm or disable but, indeed, specifically to humiliate its victim: to attack her sense of pride and equal membership in society. Actions can degrade unintentionally. Torture, for instance, is degrading even if this is unintended. But when actions are purposefully designed to insult, humiliate, or degrade, this typically heightens the sense in which they do.34 By the measure of both its impact and intentions, then, the dignity-violating version of Bicycle Theft is notably more degrading than its counterpart. There is a positive fit, here, between the degrading character of a crime, on the one hand, and the patency of its status as a violation of human dignity, on the other. This correlation bears out across the other cases as well. Vandalism, for instance, violates human dignity only when it becomes degrading in intent: that is, once it transforms from a product of ordinary juvenile delinquency into a hate crime. As a hate crime, Vandalism's intent is degrading in much the same way as above. First, it is no longer a random but, now, a targeted attack on an African American family, because they are African American (in our world, already a source of social stigma and systematic discrimination). Moreover, it is now meant not just to harm but to socially terrorize its victims: to make them feel unwanted, excluded, humiliated, and afraid. Or consider Homicide. When the assailants make Charlie kneel down for formal execution, it is clear that they are interested in more than just a backpack. Their aim must be to add insult to injury—to say something demeaning about the victim (e.g., that he is worthless, base, despicable, etc.) and their relationship toward him (e.g., that it is one of subordination and/or antipathy). This makes the crime viscerally degrading in a way that it otherwise isn't, and a blatant offense to human dignity as a result. This completes the basic argument of this paper. If we put abstract theory aside for a moment, and look instead at our concrete (“applied”) judgments about what human dignity practically requires, and when it is violated or most at stake, we see that it is preoccupied not simply with moral status (or even specific moral goods like autonomy or inviolability) but with social status—with “honoring” a person, as opposed to humiliating or degrading them. But just what is it to degrade or humiliate (or, by contrast, to “honor”) someone? If we can't say anything more about the nature of such a harm (or good), then it won't mean very much to say that dignity is concerned with it. This is not the place to offer a complete account. But we can make decent sense of the preceding observations, at least. If we start, once again, from the idea that to humiliate or degrade is to “reduce from a higher to a lower rank, to depose from a position of honor or estimation,” we can identify at least three general ways of perpetrating this kind of harm. First, and perhaps most straightforwardly, an agent can degrade or humiliate by adopting a disrespectful attitude toward others. An attitude, as I shall understand it here, is “a complex set of dispositions to perceive, have emotions, deliberate, and act in ways oriented towards [someone].”35 And an attitude is disrespectful if it has, quite simply, some contemptuous or demeaning component. This may involve moral disregard: a belief that someone has no (or lesser) moral value or authority—like a mere object or plaything.36 Or it might involve something closer to disesteem: a failure of what Darwall calls “appraisal” (as opposed to “recognition”) respect.37 If we think about the degradations of a caste society, for example, these are not just about moral discrimination, i.e., the assignment of lesser rights, value, and opportunities to certain members of the population. They are also about the attitudes of disgust, contempt, and condescension directed toward such persons, e.g., those deemed “untouchable.” Attitudes can degrade because they are fundamental constituents of social relationships, and of social status in general. To fully inhabit a social position (friend, colleague, ruler, citizen, celebrity, etc.) others must reliably take one to have it—that is, one must be “seen” as having it.38 Chloé and Lesley are not really friends, they do not really enjoy “friendship,” unless they both regard each other as friends (itself a socially constructed category). When others fail to adopt relevant attitudes toward us, then, this can threaten, undermine, and even obliterate our social position, humiliating or degrading us.39 This seems true even if others treat us as if we hold a position they do not regard us as holding, or as worthy of holding. A white supremacist may treat their black neighbor as an equal without regarding them as one—that is, without regarding them as genuinely deserving of such treatment. It may be better, all else equal, for the racist to dissemble here. But their supremacist attitude is degrading nonetheless.40 In addition to holding disrespectful attitudes, agents can degrade or humiliate by treating others in ways that express such attitudes.41 Expressing an attitude involves manifesting it in one's actions or statements in some way—including via gesture, tone of voice, posture, forms of art, or other expressive media.42 And the attitude expressed or manifested by an agent's behavior partly depends on intent, i.e., the reason(s) for which the agent acts. This is because intentions reflect the attitudes one has. For instance, to borrow an example from Thomas Scanlon, if I call my sick relative because I am concerned about her welfare, the call expresses my care for her. But if I call because I hate her and expect I will enjoy hearing how weak she sounds, the same act now expresses an entirely different (disturbingly sadistic) attitude.43 Some actions express attitudes more overtly, because they are specifically designed to communicate them, i.e., to make others aware of an agent's attitudes by “sending a message.” This is of course a particularly important form of expression.44 Consider Vandalism, once again. If the attack on the shop window is a matter of ordinary juvenile delinquency, it demonstrates a certain idiocy and recklessness, to be sure. If this is a hate crime, however, it transforms in two respects. First, it expresses a different (and notably darker) set of attitudes: hatred, domination, and exclusion. This alone is enough to mark the crime as an insult to human dignity. But there is something else. As a hate crime, Vandalism is also designed to communicate those attitudes, to make the shop owners (and perhaps others) aware of their unwantedness by hurling an insult—as if to say, aloud: “You don't belong here!” All this helps us understand why intent matters in the way the foregoing analysis suggests. First, it explains why it is humiliating to target someone for mistreatment. I may be brazenly cut off by a fellow driver in rush hour traffic. This is of course a nuisance. And it is undoubtedly “jerkish” behavior. But it is not an attack on my human dignity because it is not really (at least not normally) an attack on me. Like an indiscriminate bicycle theft, it won't usually matter to the driver that I am the person they cut off; indeed, they may hold no specific attitude toward me. They just want to get home as quickly as possible (and I just happen to be in the way). But all this changes if, as in the variations on the cases above, this somehow becomes a targeted attack; if the driver cuts me off because, say, I am from a low-income neighborhood, and they hold no regard for people “like me.” In that case, the act comes to express a kind of social contempt that it otherwise does not. Second, we can now better understand why expressly intended humiliations tend to be more profound examples thereof. Deliberate communications of disrespect—e.g., insults “to one's face”—have unique social consequences. It is one thing, as discussed above, for someone (x) to hold me in low regard, or to think of me as, say, less than equal. Because my social position depends on the attitudes of others, this already makes me less than equal, so far as my relationship with x is concerned. But when x communicates this disrespectful attitude to me, at least if the communication is successful or “received,” my social demotion (vis-à-vis x) is more complete. Had I never known x's true feelings, we could at least engage under the pretense of relational equality; now that they are out in the open, this becomes impossible, and the relationship must proceed on new, degraded terms.45 Of course, I may not accept these terms. I may openly defend my equality, my honor. But the publicity of x's attitude denies me even the sad privilege of feigned respect.46 This is what the young Klan members deny the shop owners in the variation on Vandalism. Important as intentions are, however, the expressive content of behavior is not wholly determined by them. For one, sometimes the revealing thing is what an agent fails to intend. A government that fails to fit public buildings with access for disabled persons shows disregard toward such persons, even if this is inadvertent.47 An agent may also act on reasons, or express attitudes, that they are not consciously aware of.48 And third, there are social norms to consider. In some instances, I may be unaware of what we might call the “public meaning” of my actions, i.e., “social conventions or norms that set public standards for expressing certain attitudes.”49 If I tell a sexist joke to my female colleague, this expresses a certain disrespect toward her (and, indeed, toward all women), even if I am somehow clueless about this.50 Or consider again the variations on Homicide. It is (in theory) possible that the perpetrators have no real intention of humiliating Char",

      "title": "Non-Verbal Behaviour in Mental Illness",
      "abstract": "It is a paradox that during the years of psychosocial development each man has to achieve an identity, a role in which he can feel secure, and yet poets and philosophers tell us that man is forever seeking to diminish the isolation which a personal identity imposes. Without the development of a personal identity and a role in life the individual remains a social isolate, a dependent parasite or a social deviant. Yet, once achieved, identity brings a new awareness of separateness from others and a need to merge the self with others, to identify with someone or something else. This would seem to be a main objective of love. It has been said that human love is the supreme act of communication with another, a merging of identity, and poets speak of communicating with nature or with God in like terms. Romantic and sacred literature abound in metaphors and images describing the bliss which such activity offers. If it is true that while we have a need to develop a sense of personal selfhood, an identity and a role, we have a further need to diminish the separateness such awareness imposes, how do we go about it? The contemporary answer is, of course, by communication, by relating to others. The better the communication we have with others, the greater our sense of belongingness, the less the pain of individual isolation. It is not necessary to emphasize that a cardinal feature of all severe mental illness is either a loss or a distortion of the individual's communicative capacity. But I would like to emphasize that the debate as to whether failure of communication is either a cause, or an association, or a consequence of mental illness is not my theme.",

Humans use symbols that relate to in-group psychology, loyalty, power, and remembrance. Such symbols often have a strong emotional charge, and may lead to overvalued or mistaken beliefs and magical thinking. Graves, flags, and the Christian Eucharist are examples. Some symbols are private and personal. Some symbols are unrecognized and exert their influence through unconscious processes. Other human symbols relate to the new function of language and do not have the same emotional power. Some evidence is presented that symbols work by an ‘as if’ mechanism, using some of the same neural circuits that the thing symbolized uses. People can think in symbols, for example, a sentence can use the word dog without either the speaker or the listener having a mental image of a dog.",

      "abstract": "We often notice that adolescent sexuality shows, especially in its first stages, an earlier onset and it is also more ephemeral and transitory, based more on acting and experiencing feelings than on building loving relations. In this expression of adolescence today, as well as in others, the recourse to sensations at the expense of relations is prevailing: feeling takes the place of thinking. We can gain a deeper understanding of the meaning of cuts self inflicted by some patients as linked, in the most serious cases, to the feeling of an inconsistent identity or a serious identity conflict, whose unruliness find temporary solace in the “envelope of suffering” it creates. These are clearly extreme measures which however allow through cutting one’s skin to re-establish certain primitive psychological functions, such as the sense of the body’s and of the Ego’s boundaries and the “feeling of being intact and consistent”.The recourse to these symptoms entails the reconstruction of the function of “linking different categories of feelings in a shared sensory space” that the patient did not enjoy due to his/her parental couple’s and family’s default exactly at this level. All the current changes in the family’s shapes attack the sense of identity and encourage the most superficial behavioural changes which can improperly or adhesively support the self and provide an apparent skin.",

      "abstract": "Moral standing is the property by which an entity is considered to be capable of being wronged or is morally considerable. For example, when I kick a rock, I do not do anything wrong, nor is the rock wronged. On the other hand, if I kicked an innocent child, I do something wrong, but more importantly I wrong the child. I argue that sentience (the capacity to feel pleasure and pain) and rational autonomy (the conscious capacity to self-govern) are both individually sufficient for moral standing and disjunctively necessary for moral standing. I argue against a variety of alternative positions such as consciousness (the capacity to have any experience such as the color blue), biological life, and dispositional agency, in order to strengthen my position. Moral status refers to the set of normative features governing the way we treat those with moral standing. When it comes to moral status regarding moral patients, I argue that they have at least two kinds of basic moral interests which are based on their wellbeing and their autonomy. I argue in favor of a hierarchical system of moral status whereby moral patients and agents possess higher, weaker, or equal moral status based on their capacities. I conclude by arguing that we may have impersonal obligations (moral obligations owed to no moral patient) towards the environment because the natural environment may be a possible source of beauty. Thus, our moral obligation would be to beauty rather than the environment itself.",

      "title": "Physical and mental violence as the main types of criminal violence",
      "abstract": "The article states that there is no clear diﬀerentiation of types of violence either in domestic legislation or in criminal law science. The following are defined as objective and subjective signs of violence: illegal behavior that manifests itself in the external environment and is expressed in specific conscious acts of human activity; targeting another person's body; the presence of a specific addressee (the victim — in the case of direct violence, or his relatives — in the case of indirect violence); can take place both against and against the will of another person (victim); the intentional character of the person's behavior; the ability to influence the unconscious and cause physical, moral, property damage to another person; the presence of a goal to cause harm to another person of a certain nature. The dominant position is the division of violence into physical and mental. An objection was expressed against the existence of formulas: «violence = physical violence», «threat = mental violence» (this is exactly the vision of the developers of the new Criminal Code of Ukraine). This approach, in contrast to the generally accepted division of violence into physical and mental, determines the thesis that violence exists exclusively in the form of physical harm to the victim, and reduces another type of violence, mental, to a threat. Whereas mental violence in the current Criminal Code of Ukraine manifests itself not only through threats, but also coercion, coercion, influence, terrorizing, etc. The thesis that physical violence can manifest itself not in active actions, but in the form of inaction, has been criticized. However, even examples simulated by scientists refute this approach. It is supported by the idea that murder is also a manifestation of violence, since it is committed in a violent way, at the same time, violence does not include the destruction and damage of someone else's property. Although physical violence is traditionally considered the most dangerous, in some cases mental violence can cause irreparable damage to a person's health. Signs of mental violence as a deliberate, criminally illegal and socially dangerous act are also the active nature of the behavior (as in the case of physical violence), the influence on the psyche of another person against their will, as a result of which harm is caused to the health or life of a person. Key words: violence, aggression, physical violence, mental violence, psychological violence, types of violence, threat, harm, murder, destruction of property, action, inaction, influence, intimidation.",

Can trust between people be formed on the basis of Internet contact alone? Forming the required expectation in regard to another person, and so trusting them on some matter, may be due to believing that they are trustworthy; to believing that they seek es teem and will be rationally responsive to the good opinion communicated or promised by an act of trust; or to both factors at once. Neither mechanism can rationally command confidence, however, in the case where people are related only via the Internet.

His use of the word \"autism\" was meant to convey this selfcontained quality but was, in some respects, an unfortunate choice of term since it introduced some confusion with the earlier use of the word, which described the idiosyncratic, self-centered thinking of schizophrenia. In addition to the problems in social interaction, Kanner noted the difficulties his patients had with many aspects of symbolization, abstraction, and communication. When language was present, it was remarkable for its literalness as well as other unusual aspects such as echolalia and pronoun reversal. In contrast to the child's lack of interest in the social world, Kanner noted that there was often a remarkable oversensitivity to the inanimate world, e.g., oversensitivites to sounds or other stimuli and sensitivity to even minor environmental changes. Kanner's description has proven remarkably enduring and remains the fundamental basis of current definitions of autism.",

While primary emotions require a self to experience the state (Lewis and Michalson, 1983), self-conscious emotions require a self both to produce the state and then to experience it. For example, a loud noise may put me in a state of fright. But to experience this state, I need to be aware of my state of fright. To be in a state of shame I must compare my action against some standard, either my own or someone else's. My failure, relative to the standard, results in a state of shame. Once in the state, I may or may not experience it. To experience it depends on whether I focus my attention on my state. Again, this requires consciousness. Others have suggested that the state of shame can be produced in a more automatic fashion, one that does not require objective self-awareness.

      "title": "Dolphin Social Cognition and Joint Attention: Our Current Understanding",
      "abstract": "Recent intense interest in social cognition in dolphins reflects findings that wild dolphins live in complex societies that rely on individual recognition, a protracted period of development, coalition formation, and cooperative, as well as competitive, social behaviors. Laboratory studies have revealed a host of cognitive skills that can support such complex behaviors—for example, broad imitative abilities, abilities to understand another’s indicative cues, and spontaneous use of pointing to communicate with human companions. Joint attention is recognized as a key element of social cognition that extends from simply following another’s gaze to using pointing or gazing cues of another to select objects or locations. Studies of bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) have revealed that they understand (1) human-given direct and cross-body points; (2) human-given dynamic and static pointing and gazing cues within object-choice tasks; (3) the geometry of pointing cues; (4) the referential character of pointing and gazing cues; (5) sequences of direct and/or crossbody points that were instructions to transport one object to another; (6) how to produce pointing cues and the importance of audience attention; and (7) possibly the belief state of another that is engaged in a joint attention task. The evidence suggests that joint attention skills in dolphins are robust and to some degree symmetric across comprehension and production. Comparative analyses indicate that in some areas of joint attention, abilities of dolphins exceed the demonstrated skills of apes. Possibly, a dolphin’s capacity for joint attention may be related to the adaptive benefits of being able to attend to the focus of another dolphin’s echolocation beam in conjunction with a sophisticated social structure dependent on attention to others.

The most noticeable physical changes at this time include ageing skin, greying hair, baldness, and a decline in physical stamina. Loss of muscle compactness, joint looseness, vitiation of Rakta (blood), excessive production of Meda (fatty tissue), failure of Majja (marrow) accumulation in bone, failure of production of Shukra (semen), and loss of Ojas component are examples of these pathological alterations.

First, we argue that ignoring salient needs reveals a greater deficit of benevolent motivation in the agent, and hence renders the agent more blameworthy. We use this fact to help explain our ordinary intuition that failing to give to famine relief (for example) is in some sense less bad than failing to help a child who is drowning right before your eyes, in a way that's compatible with the contention that there's no principled reason to see the one life-saving act as any more or less choiceworthy than the other. Second, we argue that alleged 'virtues of ignorance' (modesty, believing better of friends than the evidence supports, etc.) are better understood as 'virtues of salience'. Rather than placing demands on what we believe, these virtues place demands on what we find salient.",

Aggressive behaviour among peers seems to be established at this age and it is interesting to observe it within the Peer-groups. 2. A useful definition of aggression seems to be the following one: Aggression is any physical contact, direct or indirect, by which another person is hurt. 3. We observe five different forms of aggression: 3.1 Aggression by chance, without any aim, happening out of awkwardness and motoric clumsiness. This kind of aggression becomes rarer during the second year. 3.2 Manipulating one another, as shaking arm or leg of another child, pulling his hair, tapping his body and so on, giving the impression of the aggressor exploring his partner. This kind of aggression also becomes rarer during the second year. 3.3 Robbery of objects, i.e. toys being in the hands of another; the reaction of the victim is increasing during the second year. 3.4 Aggression in order to control the group and to establish leadership in connection with the development of a group hierarchy. 3.5 Pathologic Aggression, observed on a child of the group with brain dysfunction. The child overthrows others from behind, climbs on them and bites them in the ear, the neck or the cheek. 4. We still need more observation on Peer-groups of this age to know more about the beginning and development of the here described phenomena.",

      "abstract": "Common denominator of many philosophic approaches to the problem of using human embryos in medicine is the statement that it is \"a full-value human subject that deserves respect as an adult human being\". It has a defined identity in which it starts its own coordinated gradual development. Therefore, it is not just a simple cluster of cells. Integrity or holistic properties of a new quality of cells that, as a whole, represent an early embryo, and in fact are not a cluster of pre-embryonic \"structural\" parts or a sum of cells etc. They have theirs own evolution, previously inherently encoded, but not precisely predestined. In other words, only autointegrity alone in evolution, inherence as a part of predetermination in evolution of embryo, is not able to exist as a unit \"alone\". Human foetus since the first moments of its existence goes through many qualitative (externally or internally determined) transformations before it becomes a respectable human being. It is possible to say that medicine, as many times before, is now coming to a stage when axiologic values, ethical directives or moral feelings of its subjects and human objects proved in the past, are no more relevant at present. Therefore, medicine has no other alternative than an active approach to study this problem from all philosophical, biological and medical aspects to evolutionize itself in this new dimension. In this paper some of these questions are discussed and some ways of forming the ethics in therapeutic use of stem cells are presented.",

      "title": "The Sensuous Social Supernatural",
      "abstract": "Belief narratives relating to supernatural or paranormal events were common in the interviews, irrespective of informants’ religious or spiritual beliefs: even atheists sense ghosts. The findings and cross-cultural examples explored here contrast with other work in the field where such experiences are described, but insufficiently analysed, as common, folk, invisible or implicit religion. Scholars in the study of religion are often ill-equipped with appropriate concepts and terminology, mainly because they often seek to classify such experiences into different realms, such as sacred/profane or this world/other world. Those divisions do not seem to be significant, if they are apparent at all, to the informants who experience such phenomena. The majority of those experiences occur through bereavement, where belief narratives describing the experience of ‘sensing’ deceased relatives suggest a self-conscious desire and performative strategy to continue their belongings.Many people do not need religion or God to mediate those experiences, prompting the author to analyse the experiences as sensual, emotional, cognitive, self-mediated, and performative, produced in specific social contexts and explained with reference to longings for belongings. They are frequently supported by collective, social interpretations. In illustrating how informants experienced transcendent, non-material feelings and sensations in their ‘here and now’, transcendence is relocated to a non-spatial, temporal, social realm. That shift is made possible by ‘believing through bereaving’, supported by collective memory and desires for continuing relationships.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The scapegoat is the focus of projections. It may be an individual or a group, an obvious misfit or a concealed one, a temporary phenomenon or a permanent lifestyle (adopted willingly or unwillingly). The scapegoat makes it possible for man to live at peace with God, himself or his society by acting as symbolic recipient of qualities which man is unwilling to recognise in himself. The scapegoater by his treatment tries to reduce the scapegoat into something not human; for this reason a scapegoat which shows only small divergences from the norm evokes particular hostility. The individual scapegoat in a small group may accept his role fairly happily, but group scapegoats find few compensations. A variety of defence mechanisms will be adopted in these circumstances, but generally mature adjustment is impossible. The scientific and artistic achievements of scapegoats in the past have helped to liberalise society and extend the range of our compassion. So perhaps a society without scapegoats would lose its capacity for moral growth.",

      "abstract": "Direct reciprocity, indirect reciprocity, and reputation are important interrelated topics in the evolution of sociality. This non-mathematical review is a summary of each. Direct reciprocity (the positive kind) has a straightforward structure (e.g., “A rewards B, then B rewards A”) but the allocation might differ from the process that enabled it (e.g., whether it is true reciprocity or some form of mutualism). Indirect reciprocity (the positive kind) occurs when person (B) is rewarded by a third party (A) after doing a good deed towards somebody else (C) — with the structure “A observes B help C, therefore A helps B.” Here too, the allocation differs from the process: if there is underlying cognition, then indirect reciprocity is based on some ability to keep track of the reputations of others (to remember that “B helped C”). Reputation is a kind of social impression based on typicality, derived from three channels of experience (direct encounters, bystander observation, and gossip). Although non-human animals cannot gossip verbally, they can eavesdrop on third parties and learn vicariously. This paper ends with a proposal to investigate the topic of social expertise as a model for understanding how animals understand and utilise observed information within their social groups.",

      "abstract": "The study of gratitude has expanded beyond interpersonal gratitude and considers how people respond to gifts that are not caused by human agency. Given the discord between the prominent understanding of gratitude requiring the appropriate recognition of a gift to a giver and the increasing divergence of transcendent belief systems that do not acknowledge a transcendent or cosmic giver, we explored how people with different worldviews viewed and experienced gratitude. Transcendence does not hinge on metaphysical beliefs, but it can be experienced phenomenologically and subjectively. We conducted a case-study narrative analysis (N = 6) that represents participants from three different categories of belief systems: theistic, non-theistic but spiritual, and other. Our findings demonstrate how people link their transcendent narrative identity to their thoughts, feelings, and behaviors pertaining to gratitude. Although the theistic participants thanked God for gifts, others who experienced transcendence without a clear referent or source described responding to gratitude by sharing goodness forward. These narratives suggest that the recognition and appreciation of a gift stemming from beyond human cause may be enough to generate transcendent emotions and values that prompt beyond-the-self behaviors.",

      "title": "The Case for Intuition",
      "abstract": "A mental process has repeatedly been observed and described under different names, such as intuition, flair, hunch, revelation, sudden insight (Einfall), creative ideas, inspiration etc. This process is characterized by the sudden emergence of a new and often startling idea or insight at any odd moment, without apparent preparation and definitely without the co-operation of conscious mental processes such as thinking. The phenomenon has been observed by scientists, by artists but also by common people. The creative ideas produced may belong to the realm of science, of art and of religion, but also pertain to social life. The phenomena have been observed and described too often to be doubted. One would expect that this curious mental phenomenon would have interested the psychologists, but rather the opposite is the case. Most leading psychologists ignore it, some try to rationalize it away, very few freely acknowledge its existence. The attitude of the psychologist seems widely to depend on his geographical location: Americans and Russians ignore it, the Germans and French, on the whole, accept its existence. Those who theorize on intuition agree that it is an unconscious process, the final result only becoming conscious, whereas the beneficiaries of intuitive insights tend to consider it as a revelation of a hidden truth and therefore as infallible. Most psychologists as far as they have dealt with the problem of intuition at all, believe that the intuitive way of gaining knowledge is just as fallible as conscious reasoning. A few, like Freud after 1930, belittle intuition as mere guesswork, to believe in its reliability is an illusion. C. G. Jung is the only modern psychologist who squarely put intuition on the same level with thinking. His intuitive type is not smarter than the thinking type but smart in a different way. Thinking will solve problems which intuition would not solve and vice versa. Those who have enjoyed the benefit of intuitively obtained creative thoughts have practically put intuition on one level with inspiration. Many intuitions, as described by those who had them, were actually premonitions, anticipations of discoveries ahead and solutions to hitherto insolvable problems coming as a sudden insight.",

Instead, various host constructions such as the free-affectee construction (a subtype of which is the free-dative construction), monotransitive or applicative construction can – to a different degree – accommodate participants that are bound by a possession relation. The binding procedure identifying the possessor operates at the pragmatic-semantic interface and takes into account the semantic roles of the event participants, their discourse saliency and lexical properties (such as animacy), world knowledge, properties of the possessum (such as the degree of (in)alienability), etc. The external-possession relation and the meaning of the hosting construction are orthogonal to each other, but there is a strong interplay between them. Positing a dedicated external-possessor construction faces the following problems: the same binding procedure is found in other constructions as well (such as the monotransitive or ditransitive constructions); at the same time, the very possession relation is only inconsistently found in constructions referred to as external-possessor constructions, and, what is more, the possession relation may sometimes be canceled (even if it is inalienable). To account for this terminologically, I introduce the term non-thematic affectee construction , a subtype of which is the free (non-thematic) affectee construction particularly spread in European languages. The latter is found with different types of coding (accusative, dative, different prepositional phrases) which have different diachronic sources.",

It is a possible answer to a gift without a giver: a generous, poetic acceptance of life and nature in its immanence. As something which cannot be achieved without experiencing the pain of loss and the temptation of resentment or anger, this response builds individuality itself as free and not ego-centered existence.

The victim is not simply reduced to impotence, helplessness, but to a state of ever-greater dependency on his or her torturer. We have to distinguish between informed and deliberate conversion of a detainee’s political convictions, through a kind of hard bargaining that appeals to the detainee’s rationality; inducing a detainee to betray his or her convictions and his or her community and bringing that about by deceit and deception; and inducing a detainee to betray his or her convictions and his or her community by the deliberate destruction of the detainee’s identity and sanity.",

      "title": "Recovering the Radical Promise of Superheroes",
      "abstract": "Superhero meaning making is a site of struggle. Superheroes (are thought to) trouble borders and normative ways of seeing and being in the world. Superhero narratives (are thought to) represent, and thereby inspire, alternative visions of the real world. The superhero genre is (thought to be) a repository for radical or progressive ideas. In the superhero world and beyond, much is made of the genre’s utopian and dystopian landscapes, queer identity-play, and transforming bodies, but might it not be the case that the genre’s overblown normative framing, or representation, serves to muzzle, rather than express, its protagonists’ radical promise? Why, when set against otherwise unbounded, and often extreme, transformation—human to machine, human to animal, human to god—are certain categories seemingly untouchable? Why does this speculative genre routinely fail to fully speculate about other worlds and ways of being in those worlds? For all their nonconformity, superhero stories do not live up to the idea of a radical genre, in look, feel, or tone. The mainstream American superhero genre, and its surrounding discourses, tells and facilitates an astonishingly seamless tale of opposing ideologies. But how? Recovering the Radical Promise of Superheroes: Un/Making Worlds serves a speculative response, detailing not so much a hunt for genre meaning as a trip through a genre’s meaningscape. Looking anew at superhero meaning-making practices allows a distinct way of thinking about and describing the creative, formal, and ideological conditions of the genre and its protagonists, one removed from corralling binaries, one foregrounding the idea of a synergy—often unseen, uneasy, and even hostile—between official and unofficial agents of superhero meaning and one reframing familiar questions: What kinds of meaning do superhero texts engender? How is this meaning made? By whom and under what conditions? What processes and practices inform, regulate, and extend superhero meaning? And finally, superhero narratives present a new question: How might we reimagine its agents, surfaces, and spaces? Centering the experiences and practices of excluded and marginalized superhero fans, Recovering the Radical Promise of Superheroes reveals that genre meaning is not lodged in one place or another, neither in its official creators or fans, nor in “black and white” conservatism or in a “rainbow” of progressive possibilities. Nor is it even located somewhere in the in-between; it is instead better conceived of as an antagonistic, in-process nexus of meaning undergirded by systems of power.",

First, that we tend to use words, and these include creativity and madness, rather loosely, often, in contrast to what they actually mean, and in contrast to what can take us from mediocrity to greatness. Second, that all sensible human beings want happiness and abundance. People are miserable when their thoughts and deeds are poor. Third ,that we have to leave the mentally ill in the care of specialist doctors. It is not a topic we can resolve. Fourth, that every human being is creative. He can achieve great things if he is trained to use his mind wisely. We tend to use madness rather loosely. Most of us clamor to be in madly in love without realizing that mad men cannot sustain love. We are also mad when we indulge in negative emotions. Hysteria is nothing but extreme or uncontrollable excitement. It is a mental disorder. Madness in art and literature is often linked with genius. In reality, it is completely anti-life. Art is selective recreation of reality according to an artist s metaphysical value judgment. Literature re-creates reality by means of language. The most important principal of the esthetics of literature was formulated by Aristotle, who said that fiction is greater that history, because history represents things as they are, while fiction represents them as they might be and ought to be.

The fundamental vulnerabilities that are exploited correspond to features essential to our humanity (ontological), moral personhood (personal), and individuality (characteristic). These kinds of vulnerabilities are both constituted by and engender fundamental needs and give rise to direct dependencies on others to satisfy or to refrain from interfering with the satisfaction of fundamental needs. The unambiguous exploitation by the more powerful agent on whom the vulnerable directly depend is characteristic of evil action.

Many of these texts seem to regard invisibility as a subjective mental state, subject to suggestion and the projection of ideas, while others think of it as a more physical, scientific phenomenon, residing in the eye and subject to chemical or electric forces or the projection of rays of light. The two views combine when myths treat invisibility as the projection of a false or absent self from the mind and/or eyes of the magician into the mind and/or eyes of the beholder. In both cases, invisibility often shades off into masquerade and shapeshifting, as shadows, doubles, reflections, or camouflage hide the one true self from the observer or confuse the object of the gaze with the background or with another person.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The language of emotions is culturally conditioned and a conceptualization of emotions is determined by the value systems adopted in given cultures, as well as by personal experiences in recognizing, valuing, and communicating those emotions. It is believed that sometimes certain emotions have no lexical equivalents in particular languages. Even within one culture and one language, we can observe a gray area in the meaning of terms from this field. This is not surprising, given the subjective perception of the world by each member of a specific community, as well as the multitude of emotions themselves. Although most information about other people’s emotions comes to the recipients through language, talking or writing about them is not simple. Emotions are among the concepts that are not very clearly delineated in our experience and therefore other, more comprehensible concepts, such as spatial orientations or objects, should be used when referring to them. In the novel The Slynx by Tatyana Tolstaya, emotions are conceptualized and represented for instance by liquids, small animals, natural forces, and substances with some specific taste (sour, bitter, etc.). Our goal was to figure out which emotions and their linguistic instantiations are only typical for the Russian language and which ones would fall in the universal category. The paper will focus on the description and the way emotions are conceptualized from a cognitive linguistic perspective, drawing on CMT (Conceptual Metaphor Theory), conceptual metonymies, and cognitive models.",

      "title": "The Experiences, Opinions, and Attitudes of Yoruba Repatriates of the Former Eastern (Iboland) Region as Aspects of the Pre-Crisis Interethnic Contacts and Relations in Nigeria",
      "abstract": "One important element in the definition and understanding of the dynamics of interethnic or intergroup relations generally is the attitude which prevails among the particular ethnic groups who are in a contact situation. Attitude formation is a function of the experiences acquired and the opinions formed by the parties to the social contact. For the latter two by their nature are a necessary precondition of the former. Put another way, experience in a social situation and the judgement arrived at as being true and derivable from that experience either intellectually or otherwise (for this essentially is what constitutes opinion) must take place before attitude occurs. Attitude essentially is an acquired, or learned, and established tendency of an individual to react toward or against something or somebody. It does not, we must warn, refer to any one specific act or response of an individual, but is an abstraction from a large number of consistent, related acts or responses of the person to an object or people (Green 1954, p. 336). An attitude may be characteristic of a person (and as such relate to the given person) or to other persons or to social groups or to society. It may even be social in the sense that is characteristic of a homogeneous group of persons. The place of attitude in intergroup dynamics cannot be overemphasised. For it determines whether or not group members accept one another and a condition of harmony, integration, intergroup wholesome or unwholesome competition or rivalry exist among them. It also determines whether a condition of stability or instability obtains in the overall society in which the contacting groups are active participants in the socioeconomic lives. A group characterised by favourable attitudes toward another group would most probably accept the members of that group. And if acceptance is achieved, an important milestone is reached in the harmonious relations between the groups and in a condition of stability characterised by a minimum of antagonism. And man, it is said, functions fully, effectively under a condition of stability when his potentials are maximised and are fully released or expressed and utilised because of the existing security.",

      "abstract": "T F at some time a person's conduct can make -* the whole difference between probability = 0 and probability = 1 for the obtaining of some state of affairs S, then his conduct is relevant to (the obtaining of) S; or, as I shall sometimes say for short, he is relevant to S. One can also be rele? vant to S through affecting its probability less drastically than that. Everything I say here can take in that territory as well, but it is helpful to think mainly in terms of all-or-nothing relevance. A state of affairs may obtain (1) because some? body did such and such, or (2) because he did not do so and so. For example, the gate at the railway crossing was open (1) because he opened it, or (2) because he didn't close it. (2) doesn't apply unless he could have closed it: the Emperor of Japan didn't open the gate and couldn't have closed it, and so his conduct was not relevant at all to its being open. But I don't confine (2) to people who ought to have prevented S, or who had some duty or obligation to prevent it, or anything like that. I take someone's conduct to be negatively relevant to the gate's being open just so long as he could have closed it and didn't. That makes each of us negatively relevant to millions of states of affairs. But why not? I have been told: is not useful to make the notion of as weak as that. We should at least build into it that the person knew he could prevent S from obtaining. But if we do, we'll make some important truths harder to say, and thus harder to see. If I didn't know that I could have closed the gate, that may excuse me; and if I didn't know I was opening it, that may excuse me. It won't be easy to compare those two excuses if we work with a concept of ac? cording to which a person is not negatively rele? vant to S unless he does know what his conduct is leading to. It may be objected that the ignorance excuse falls very unevenly across the positive/neg? ative divide, being available a million times on the side for every one on the positive. But that doesn't mean that comparisons are not worth making; and in any case, you can't even state that objection without using negative relevance in my way. If we refuse to call someone's conduct negatively relevant to S unless he knew that he could make the difference to whether S obtained or not, we shall be definitionally abolishing the ex? cuse He was negatively relevant, but he didn't know, stamping into the ground an interesting and perhaps important difference between the two sorts of relevance. Similarly for the suggestion that we shouldn't call someone negatively relevant to S's obtaining unless it was his job to prevent it. We ought to be able to compare how the plea was not his spe? cial responsibility works on the side of the line with how it works on the positive side; but for that we need a concept of which allows the plea to arise on that side of the line.",

The father keeps talking optimistically about the future, keeps explaining away the evidence, and keeps pointing to what he insists are signs of improvement. We can easily imagine ourselves deciding that he has deceived himself about his son's condition. Nor is it the case that talk of self-deception is appropriate only in connection with other people. We can easily imagine the father admitting, say, after the son's death, that he has deceived himself about the child's condition. Thus the notion of self-deception obviously has application. Furthermore, ordinarily talk of self-deception is not thought to be puzzling.",

It consists of relations between facts such as actions, sentiments, attitudes or judgments, each belonging to one person and concerning another or others, that are directly related by motivations. In standard cases, these facts concern two agents, they are from one to the other and vice versa. In extensions of the concept, however, only one person is concerned in the two facts, or both original agents are replaced by two different ones (as explained shortly). The agents are often individuals, but they can also be groups or institutions of various kinds. The various cases depend on the nature of these facts and people, on the structure of the relationship and the number of people and of facts involved, and – most essentially – on the types of motives that induce the relation.",

      "abstract": "The state of chronicity in the psychiatric patient questions the psychiatrist's sense of responsibility as well as his guilt feelings due to therapeutic failure. On the other hand, chronicity revives the psychiatrist's curiosity and interest in discovering more affective means to counteract a process which seems, apparently, inevitable. The author, after demonstrating that chronicity cannot be defined in accordance with psychiatric nosology, not simply in opposition to an acute state, proposes a definition that takes into account the process as one developing in the interaction between the patient, his environment and his therapist. This long and morbid evolution, which we call chronicity, corresponds to the patient's existential equilibration which is characterized by dependency and ruptures with his personal history, where the perception of time is altered and where all desires are given up. The true representative of this state can thus be perceived only through the relationships that are established. The author therefore defines this evolution as a process developing in the interaction with a given environment (hospital or other), and/or the therapeutic relationship. It becomes thus necessary to question the structures that generate chronicity, whether it be the hospital, the social services which might foster child-like dependance, chemotherapy, or negative attitudes resulting from a therapeutic relationship. A more adequate healing attitude permits a modification of the precarious compromises which the patient tends to establish, and serves to encourage his possibilities to gain more freedom of action.",

The plotinian wise man doesnot stay isolated, rather, he is concerned about the state of other men and their ethicalpreoccupations.

This work reconstructs Plotinusnotion of friendship throughout the Eneads. Friendship is compatible with wisdom,reason for which it becomes a central topic in his ethical theory. We, firstly, analyze the\"other soul\" of the wise man in contrast with the ordinary man, which lets him liveindependently from the sensible world and lets him positively value as pre-eminentwhat is inside of him. Then follows an analysis of the relations amongst magic,sympathy and the unity of soul.

It concerns us therefore to stand very carefully upon our guard, that we be not insensibly misled by such an innate and unheeded temptation to error as we bring into the world with us. And consequently I may be allowed to consider whether – among other particulars in which this deluding propensity of our minds has too great (though unsuspected) an influence upon us – it may not have imposed on us in the notion we are wont to frame concerning nature. For this being the fruitful parent of other notions, as nature herself is said to be of the creatures of the universe, the notion is so general in its applications, and so important in its influence, that we had need be jealously careful of not over easily admitting a notion, than which there can scarce be any that more deserves to be warily examined before it be thoroughly entertained.",

All of us, for example, have an innate capacity to experience anger, resentment, joy, happiness, sadness, hunger, thirst, and sexual attraction, among many other things. The peculiarities of one's environment determine and limit the range of which particular things will be the objects of one's desires and aversions, as well as under which particular circumstances one will feel or act on various motivations. But the desires, aversions, and motivations themselves are given by our nature. The characteristic of human nature that Smith thinks principally bears on moral standards and moral judgments is, as we have seen, the desire for mutual sympathy, though other characteristics—like one's natural partiality for oneself and the natural interest one has in the fortunes of others—play important roles as well.",

      "title": "The Principles of Education",
      "abstract": "EDUCATION covers the span of life from the cradle to the grave. Impressions are received in bits and blocks in an endless stream. Some of these pass almost at once into oblivion, leaving the merest trace in our minds. Other impressions, stimulating more or less interest through partial or anticipated connection with something already in our minds, are seized upon, inspected and then, if found true and worthy, tagged and pigeon-holed with other associated impressions. An occasional new impression of unusual strength will dominate a whole group of old impressions. The mind then makes abstracts (ideas) of groups of impressions to connect with abstracts of other groups. The best measure of mentality is probably this tendency to interconnect and abstract the essential ideas in a wide variety of other ideas and groups of impressions. And mentality in this sense is a measure of the degree of education in an individual. The impressions of an infant are limited to those received from its immediate surroundings. During school days, the mind receives and assimilates ideas from farther afield not associated with desire or discomfort. Later on, in high school and college days, the mind likes and readily assimilates groups of abstract related ideas and even probes the infinite and unknowable. In middle life, the dominant interest lies in the practical problems of everyday life. The field of our activities is our school and the newspaper and magazine our text-books. The mind demands fresh facts and new ideas. In later life, after the details of most minor problems have become familiar, interest turns once more to general principles, and larger problems, details are reduced to routine when possible. In short, education is as long and as broad as our lives. National welfare requires that it be recognized and treated as such. What we now call education is a mere generalization of parental instruction covering the period of most active interest in the most abstract ideas. Real education in the interest of the nation should be such as to develop and bring into action all the latent possibilities in every individual. Whatever our useful activities at any period of our lives, we should be continually receiving and assimilating new ideas with both bodies and minds fresh and active, with a code of ethics firmly established and a philosophy of life equal to any emergency.",

We know that chimpanzee has all of them. In spite of such chimpanzee's competences, the variety of instrument chimpanzee has invented is very limited comparing to Homo sapiens.Language is a unique tool which make easily possible 1) to represent images of mental experience according to the liguistic codes as social fact, 2) to self-refer modalities of speaker (belief, probability, conditionality etc.) to the talked, 3) to recall propositional believes apparently not relevant to the situation here-and-now and mutually refer between them, 4) to check whether correspond or not with each other the mental images individually supposed by interlocutors. Language, as interface between brain and outer world and between individuals, is very effective tool for communication and inference. Chimpanzee has competence to laugh in playful situation as self-reference of unexpected experience. But it is mostly sure that he does not laugh as a third person. The fact that only Homo sapiens who speaks can laugh as a third person suggests that we, being equipped with language, began to live in a new intersubjective world where learnings and innovations are carried out.",

At a single moment, a person occupies multiple perspectives, associated with different practical identities. The good associated with one of her practical identities can conflict with the good associated with another practical identity, and her ends adopted from the standpoint of one identity can conflict with her ends adopted by another. Because of this, a person can make demands on herself from the perspective of one practical identity to another, pertaining to the protection of her wellbeing and ends, just as she might make demands on another person. Such demands can generate second-personal duties, which require that a person treat herself a particular way in the present. Since some duties owed to the self cannot be waived due to their relationship to the individual’s identity, the waivability objection is answered.",

However, even in such cases it would principally be the population of a state exhibiting denialism as a form of personal conduct when dealing with a specific issue or when trying to avoid dealing with it. Indeed, it is in the nature of people, either individually or in unison, to refuse to accept facts, events or beliefs which are widely held by others, even when they are objectively regarded as being true, accurate and scientifically correct. In such instances denialism could be perceived as a means of self-preservation. To have done otherwise could have led to facing new realities contradicting what was understood as the absolute truth for many decades or even for centuries.",

      "abstract": "In discussions on AI, the emerging experimental subfield of artificial creativity—that is, acts of creativity performed (semi-)autonomously by algorithmic/software robots—poses a particular set of problems. First of all, the prospect of a robotic/algorithmic creativity relatively independent of human intervention fundamentally conflicts with the anthropocentric ways in which we have historically invented ‘creativity’; as something uniquely and quintessentially human. Secondly, while recognisability and predictability are parameters that are usually held as vital for the success of robots that in some way or the other are to be enmeshed in a future sociality comprised of Men and Machines, our expectations of what constitutes something we might label 'creative’ deeply hinges upon the exact opposite, namely: an imperative of unpredictability and the somewhat unrecognisable (cf. reigning ‘creativity standards' of openness, originality, newness, surprise, unconventionality, even the exceptional). Ideas, that are not just being celebrated within pedagogy and psychology (as a means to self-actualisation, etc.) but also as part of a global political economy of invention and (creative) disruption. This paper will engage with the question how we might reinvent ‘invention’, recreate ‘creativity’. How could we accommodate for a potential artificial creativity, and how can it become routinised both in our thinking and doing/making? Various anthropologies, sociologies and philosophies of technology, materiality, things and stuff (cf. Ingold, Latour, Verbeek, Bennett, Marres, Boscaglia, etc.) have given us a fairly apt vocabulary for conceptualising these various human-technology entanglements and the (quasi-)agency of our nonhuman tools and milieus. Drawing on these theories, this paper will examine the Flow Machines-project, an AI-research project on popular music composition, which has recently released the album “HelloWorld” under the alias SKYGGE. We will look at its affordances, its actual outcomes (creative products) as well as the discursive framing that seeks to position it in relation to both an anthropocentric creativity and a future post-(anthropocentric) creativity, theoretically and in practice.",

      "abstract": "The development of the formal qualities of a work of art takes place in the feelings of the artist, and it is only through our feelings that we are able to truly observe them. The presentation of a piece is not enough; as an artist I feel that the visual observation without a response is worse than a negative reaction. Simple observation alone is a failure to perceive feelings; without reaction, positive or negative, one's feeling for a piece have yet to be touched and perception is soon lost. In my work, I strive to achieve feelings. I release my own, attempting to use visual signs to convey ideas and emotional experiences. Although I enjoy the procedures involved in the production of the piece and even if I am satisfied with the piece, I hesitate to accept the results unless others react. Without a reaction, I question whether I have conveyed my feelings or developed any for the observer, and the possibilities of further involvement are retarded. I am not saying that every art piece should be an intellectual problem revolving around one central theme; rather that in order for my work to be successful, feelings should be generated.",

      "abstract": "The experience, imagery, and fantasy of self in motion play a central part in the dreams, aspirations, and affective life of individuals, and in their growth. Human infants are supplied with an intrinsic drive to move to, with, and against forces and objects in the natural world, for that action maps a developing self into the world. This striving is not derivative from some other drive; it is a motivational force in and of itself intertwined with other essential strivings of the developing individual. Clinical observations and recent findings of developmental and neurobiological studies demonstrate that positive aspects of a person's striving in the sphere of motor control imbue a person's sense of self with qualities of energy, agency, and mastery. And, when thwarted, distorted, or unbalanced in relation to other strivings, one's physicality may also be a locus for conflict and maladaptive defenses. Schemas of self in relation to the world at large and especially to significant others are often encoded in procedural modes of remembering and perceiving, where movement is central. When the analyst is attuned to the experience of motor action in the life of the person he or she seeks to know fully and to help, the appreciation of that person's motives, emotions, and sense of self is deepened and enhanced.",

To identify is to allow discrimination — friend or foe? — the former classification being non-dangerous (potentially unharmful), the latter classification being dangerous (potentially harmful). For this, friend and foe must have distinguishable characters and the organism must both detect these characters, and know which characters are likely to associate with non-danger (friend) and which characters are likely to associate with danger (foe). After this discrimination, there must then be a response (either non-alarm, or alarm) that, in turn, would Icad to a variety of other responses of an adaptive nature (e.g. escape from, or destroy, the foe).",

      "title": "On Experiential Loneliness",
      "abstract": "Presumably, everyone has, at some point in their lives, felt lonely. Loneliness is, in that particular sense, omnipresent. What it feels like to be lonely can, however, vary significantly. Loneliness is far from being a homogeneous phenomenon. Different kinds of loneliness need to be distinguished, considering its causes, contexts, a person's capacities to cope with it, and many other factors. This paper introduces the notion of a specific kind of loneliness: experiential loneliness. Experiential loneliness, it will be argued, consists in particular ways of experiencing the world, oneself, and others. Although feelings of being lonely in one way or another can emanate from one's experience of the world being structured in a particular manner, such kinds of loneliness need not-at least, not always and the whole time-lead to emotional feelings that are concerned with one's loneliness or the lack of meaningful social relationship. Loneliness can give rise to quite different emotional feelings that sometimes even cover up their provenience from underlying experiential loneliness. The notion of experiential loneliness, it is suggested, helps to tie back certain styles of thinking, desires, feelings, and behaviors to contexts of loneliness. Moreover, it will be argued that the notion can also elucidate the development of feelings of being lonely in contexts in which others are not only around but also available. To develop and enrich the notion of experiential loneliness as well as to exemplify its usefulness, a closer look will be taken at the case of borderline personality disorder, a condition in which sufferers are often plagued by loneliness.",

      "abstract": "I argue that the construction of the social order, as shown by Adam Smith in The Theory of Moral Sentiments, depends on people’s ability to tame their inborn egoism. According to the philosopher’s anthropological assumptions a human being learns through life experiences how to control his selfinterest so that it does not threaten societal existence. During socialization, a human being – still an egoist to some extent – continues role-playing by the use of the psychological mechanisms of empathy and imagination. As a result he develops sympathy, at first, as a reaction to real people’s emotions experienced in a particular context. Finally, he naturally and more and more unconsciously takes under consideration the perspective of an impartial spectator. The gradually developing process brings about consequences that improve social morality, such as control over the expression of intense emotions, which is a condition for experiencing emotional harmony, or a refrain from pursuing one’s self-interest at the expense of someone else, so as not to become a subject of social contempt. One should also bear in mind that none of these consequences was carefully planned in advance nor purposefully executed.",

Because we are social creatures, dependent, and not simply self-made, we are responsible for aspects of our identities that have been given to us. We may be more responsible for what we choose, but we can be at least minimally responsible for what we do not voluntarily control, but nevertheless believe or desire, when we are not malfunctioning (for instance: we are reason-responsive). This claim is developed by considering how we should think about responsibility and blame in cases of autism, antisocial personality disorder, kleptomania, and schizophrenia. I argue that disease does not necessarily excuse us from responsibility or blame. Indeed, when one is infected with immoral beliefs and loves, that indicts.",

Important decision makers are in question here, but the biographer's subject need not be powerful or famous. It may be a person who is thought interesting because he or she is distinctively representative of some broader type than a Bourbon monarch or his counselor-perhaps a seventeenth-century tavern keeper or nun, reforming curate or minister, bourgeois gentilhomme, guerrier de Dieu or grand noble classique, as Labatut describes the duke of Navailles.1 No biographer comes to the task without some kind of typology or model-a conception of the position in the world that his or her protagonist fills. The fit of a real person with the type is never perfect. Thus the question of motives is raised. What accounts for the individual's conformity or nonconformity with the postulated dimensions of the role cast, the station fixed, the context faced? These are problems of psychology.",

      "abstract": "Emotions are affective states of short duration, with concomitant vegetative symptoms, triggered by an internal or external perception. There are primary or universal emotions (happiness, sadness, fear, anger, surprise, disgust), secondary or social emo- tions (compassion, shame, guilt, contempt, jealousy, envy, pride, admiration) and background emotions (wellbeing, malaise, calm, tension). Emotions are complex programs of actions shaped by evolution. The actions are completed by a cognitive program, but the world of emotions is primarily a world of actions carried out in our body from the facial expressions and body positions to the changes in the viscera and internal milieu. We can consider emotion as a primary value system of the brain, leading certain activations to be selectively reinforced. In clinical interviews we are often led from the line of verbal speech to the line of emotional speech. We use our own emotions or feelings as a way to detect discrepancies or incongruities in the relationship, probably between the channels of verbal, non-verbal and empathic communication. Carl Rogers made an important contribution to psychotherapy with his experience of unconditionally accepting the client, who comes to be heard, without prejudice or judgment. A feeling, an emotion, a reasoning were accepted with the same attention, care and respect. The forms of expression and the exact configuration of stimuli that can induce an emotion are different in different cultures and individuals. But what is striking is the similarity.",

The priorities can be different, even alternative in their context and opposite in their sense; eternal and temporary; truth and false; real and illusory; clear and subconscious or rational ones. The religion does not exist without the human factor, it has lost its sense, context, role, display, etc. The community without religion has never occurred. Each person and each community appeals to a religious source. A religion in its intrinsic sense is an embodiment of some axiological knowledge, search for a transcendental phenomenon. The religious approach to the moral values contains the deep considering of life sense independently of a person realization sphere. To conclude, while considering the specific features of the modern youth religious values, the two main factors can be named that influence on their functioning: spontaneity and rationality. A person has always been in their interaction. This is the core of a personal existential choice, a man has a real right for freedom, existence, and obtains an opportunity to understand the responsibility for the self existence through internal law, the law of conscience.",

It means happening by chance, not planned rather incidental e.g., a casual encounter, a casual meeting, a casual visit etc. It is made or done without much care or thought viz., a casual remark, a casual invitation. Thus, the term casual is widely used. In derogatory sense it signifies irresponsibility showing too little concern and interest as well. For example, the company’s casual attitude to office security invites danger. It stands for not careful or thorough i.e., not serious eg., a casual inspection, a casual glance at a book, a casual observer. In case of clothes, a casual short-sleeved shirt is an example of casual wear which is simply an informal dress. Similarly, in the market shoes are displayed with the message :a pair of man’s casuals. Shoes, clothes, etc. designed for informal occasions do not obey dress conduct.Thus, casual wear means relaxation. It disobeys or rebels against the so-called conduct.

      "abstract": "Equilibrium means maturity, a harmony and balance of tensions that comes from intellectual, emotional, social and spiritual maturity. Clearly the first essential is professional competence, the possession of those varied techniques and skills which can give a sense of adequacy. The social worker is often in a certain sense a lay spiritual adviser whose role, at its own level, is comparable to that of the confessor and spiritual director. For that reason a deepening knowledge of techniques and skills must be accompanied by a corresponding desire to appreciate the importance of moral and supernatural means. In this connection we may adapt the words of the famous physician and say that the social worker tends the wounds of the psyche but it is God who heals them. One can never leave out of account the working of God’s grace, and must remind oneself again and again that one’s role is secondary and subordinate. To do otherwise is to fall into the heresy of good works. Intellectual maturity also implies a true humility. By this I mean a serene acceptance of one’s limitations with the corollary that one is not ashamed through vanity or human respect to seek from others the knowledge that one lacks. But at the same time humility also means a sense of security in one’s strengths. Humility in the face of the mystery of this person, my client, who confronts me here and now, is essential if I am not to be overbearing and patronising, and consequently insecure because I seek security in my attitude of superiority.",

      "abstract": "After a selection from the remarks made by students about their preferen-ces towards writing in the I-mode, the YOU-mode or the ONE-mode, I propose two hypotheses: 1. There is a certain connection between the degree of self-experience and self-responsibility (primary existence) and the choice to speak or write in the I-, YOU- or ΟΝΕ-mode, but apparently it also holds that the choice of one of those modes restricts or elaborates the space a person has to express himself. More generally stated: There is a certain interaction between the way of existence of a speaker or writer and the way of self-denomination in his utterances. 2. There is a certain connection between the degree to which a speaker or writer a) has knowledge about himself and wants to be responsible for his feelings, thoughts and acts; b) guards or unveils his intimacy towards a hearer or reader; c) wants to be involved in or responsible for a process or activity outside his body; and the way he denominates himself or the outside process or activity in his utterances. I give some examples of ways of linguistic alienation, and propose an arrangement of the degrees of alienation in the same way as is done in language for local distances: HERE THERE YONDER SOMEWHERE NOWHERE I I, as a.. YOU ONE NONE (self) (increasing self-separation) (self-ignoring) (self-eliminating) I expect that children with a very sensitive linguistic intuition, draw conclusions about the reliability of adults from the way they use alienation codes; that human beings are or become strangers to one another, or are more attached as friends and lovers by using alienation codes or direct human language; that relational, social and economic victims advertise themselves as potential victims by the way they use alienation codes and do not recognize their potential oppressors by the way they use alienation codes. The main field of linguistic study as human linguistics lies in making clear what the differences are between direct human language and alienation codes.",

      "title": "Peculiarities of behavior of juvenile victims of violent incest",
      "abstract": "The article considers the peculiarities of the behavior of juvenile victims of violent incest. It is indicated that the following features should be taken into account when studying the typology of victims of violent incest: 1) biological and psychological features and types of victims; 2) circumstances that preceded / contributed to the commission of the violent act; 3) the behavior of the victim at the time of the act of violence and after it. Establishing these features will provide an opportunity to more fully and correctly classify juvenile victims of violent incest. The author points out that in the general sense, the types of juvenile victims of sexual crimes do not differ sharply from the general public. At the same time, the typology of such persons is somewhat narrowed due to the frequent dominance of certain features that provoke the criminal offender to commit an illegal act. For example, if a person seeks to commit theft or robbery / robbery, the victim often plays a secondary role, as circumstances that contribute to the offense come to the fore (dark time of day, absence of outsiders, etc.). In the case of violent incest or any other socially dangerous act of a sexual nature, the language focuses on the victim as the \"object of desire.\" That is why the criminal offender usually pays attention to two aspects: the biological characteristics of the victim and the psychological characteristics (behavioral reactions). A study of statistics and jurisprudence concluded that in most cases this type of criminal offense is committed against juveniles who have an attractive appearance and passive behavior (do not make excessive efforts to protect and prevent incest). Attention is drawn to the fact that the provocation of violent incest is inherent in older minors and is due to the desire to prove to their loved ones their adulthood, sexuality and readiness for sexual intercourse. Often such victims seek to feel wanted, but do not understand the real threat of experiencing illegal sexual influence, especially from a close relative.",

      "title": "Products as Pals: Engaging with Anthropomorphic Products Mitigates the Effects of Social Exclusion",
      "abstract": "Feeling left out has been shown to trigger primal, automatic responses in an attempt to compensate for threats to social belongingness. Such responses typically involve reconnection with other human beings. However, four experiments provide evidence that exposure to or interaction with anthropomorphic consumer products (i.e., products featuring characteristics of being alive through design, interaction, intelligence, responsiveness, and/or personality) can also satisfy (at least partially) social needs, ultimately mitigating previously documented effects of social exclusion. Specifically, interacting with anthropomorphic (vs. nonanthropomorphic) products following social exclusion reduces (1) the need to exaggerate the number of one’s current social connections, (2) the anticipated need to engage with close others in the future, and (3) the willingness to engage in prosocial behavior. These effects are driven by a need for social assurance, rather than positive affect. Moreover, an important boundary condition exists: drawing attention to the fact that an anthropomorphic product is not actually alive (i.e., the product does not provide genuine human interaction) limits its ability to fulfill social needs. Thus, in a time when consumer products are becoming increasingly anthropomorphic in design and function, the results reveal potentially important consequences for human-to-human relationships.",

      "title": "Conformity, Individuality, and the Nature of Virtue: A Classical Confucian Contribution to Contemporary Ethical Reflection",
      "abstract": "Abstract There can be no happy outcome in the contemporary debate that pits the priority of individual fulfillment against more traditional claims about the distinctive benisons of shared sources of meaning. This is, at least partly, because there are at least two different kinds of human flourishing, each one being raised up by one side or the other as the comprehensive human good. One kind of flourishing involves the distinctive development of what is unique to each individual agent as irreplicable subject. Although the total content of our identities may be ultimately unknowable,1 most advocates of this view allow agents some substantive insights into their personalities—enough, in any case, to give determinate content to notions of self-interpretation. Another kind of flourishing stems from what given communities take human beings to be in some universal sense (given human nature, basic human capabilities, and so on). The successful formation of communally valued character traits is thought to enable participants to fulfill the highest possibilities afforded by that (or any) community’s way of life. Both forms of flourishing represent very significant goods, and both are, in my judgment, indispensable to a nuanced understanding of the fullest human potential. To slight either, as both sides of the contemporary debate slight one or the other, is not only to impoverish ethical reflection but also to falsify human experience.",

      "abstract": "AbstractConcept of Supreme Being is as old as the human history itself. But the idea of entity and attributes of that Being varies from culture to culture and religion to religion. Islam gives very vivid image of God, namely Allah in terms of His entity, attributes, and nature of relationships with the creature, including man. The Arabic word Allah denotes in English “The God”. He is Only One without any partner. He is totally unseen. He is the Creator, Sustainer, Provider, Controller of the entire universe. All that is in the earth and heavens belong to Him. Nothing is unto like Him. His power is infinite. He is as close to man as his jugular vein. He is the Most-Merciful, the Most-Beneficent. He is eternal with no beginning and end. He interacts with man and communicates to him every moment. He is Just and loves those who subscribe to justice. He has forbidden injustice for Himself as well as for man. He is Generous and commands man to interact with others generously. In order to be close to Him man has to be as kind to others as to his own self. The qualities Allah wants to see in man include sincerity, honesty, truthfulness, trustworthiness, justice, generosity, altruism, tolerance, forbearance, and fortitude. This paper deals with all these dimensions of “The God” from Islamic perspective as available in the Qur’an and the Prophetic traditions.Keywords: God, Allah, Entity, Attribute, the Qur’an, Islam.AbstrakKonsep Yang Maha Esa setua sejarah manusia itu sendiri. Tetapi idea entiti dan sifat-sifat-Nya berbeza dari budaya ke budaya dan agama ke agama. Islam memberikan imej yang sangat jelas mengenai tuhan, yaitu Allah dari segi entiti-Nya, sifat-sifat-Nya, dan perhubungan-Nya dengan makhluk, termasuk manusia. Perkataan Bahasa Arab yaitu Allah, dalam bahasa Inggerisnya menandakan “Tuhan”. Yang Hanya Satu tanpa penolong. Yang benar-benar Tersembunyi. Yang Maha Pencipta, Pemelihara, Pembekal, Pengawal seluruh alam semesta. Segala yang ada di bumi, dan langit adalah kepunyaan-Nya. Tidak ada yang sama seperti-Nya. Kuasa-Nya adalah tidak terbatas. Yang lebih dekat dengan manusia daripada urat lehernya. Yang Maha Pemurah, Yang Maha-Pengasihani. Yang kekal tanpa awal dan akhir. Yang berinteraksi dengan manusia pada setiap masa. Yang adil dan mengasihi orang-orang yang menegapkan keadilan. Yang mengharamkan kezaliman atas diri-Nya dan juga untuk manusia. Yang Maha Mulia dan memerintah hamba-Nya untuk berinteraksi dengan orang lain dengan sebaik-baiknya. Dalam usaha untuk rapatkan diri kepada-Nya, manusia mesti berbuat baik kepada yang lain seperti keatas dirinya. Sifat-sifat yang Allah mahu melihat dalam manusia adalah keikhlasan, kejujuran, kebenaran, amanah, keadilan, kemuliaan, pemurah, toleransi, kesabaran, dan ketabahan.

      "title": "Prejudice: Complicit and Implicit",
      "abstract": "Abstract: Prejudice could be defined as an irrational sense of superiority, an ironic expression of an unconscious feeling of inferiority that claims paradoxically that one human identity is worthier than another. Implicit prejudice would suggest the unconscious nature of a bias within an individual, whereas complicit prejudice would suggest a shared bias within a family, or group, or even a whole society. The two (implicit and complicit) are intimately connected, of course, and how they influence each other can be explored. The cultural disease called prejudice has been with us forever and there is no cure in sight. Psychoanalysis itself is not immune to it, and “physician heal thyself” must be considered, even as the psychoanalyst puts pen to paper. Prejudice is an expression of hatred that the science of psychoanalysis tries to study on the most granular level, so that each individual human ego can understand, possess, and embrace its barbaric animal nature without disowning, and attacking in the other, what it dares not see in itself and call its own.",

      "title": "Happiness",
      "abstract": "At the beginning of the Nicomachean Ethics, Aristotle claims that all arts and inquiries, acts and choices, aim at some good. Indeed, they presume an ultimate good. For if they sought no good at all they would not be chosen, and without an ultimate intrinsic good their rationality would collapse. Aristotle's title for that ultimate aim, a title meant to be uncontroversial, is eudaimonia, loosely translatable as happiness. Its nature is not a given: philosophy has its work cut out for it in clarifying just what this ultimate human goal must be. Some seek happiness in pleasure, wealth, or honor; others scramble for whatever sensation appeals at the moment or blindly pursue domination. Aristotle, however, maintains that (1) eudaimonia is something objective, not mere gratification, euphoria, or complacency; (2) it is not merely a passive state of well-being but an active life of doing well (euprattein); and (3) the virtues are dispositions that promote the good life that we seek. Aristotelian moral virtues such as courage, generosity, and self-control are dispositions, or habits of acting in accordance with a mean discerned by reason. Phronesis, strength in deliberation, is an intellectual virtue, but sophia, the queen of the intellectual virtues, finds our most godlike activity in contemplation. As Aristotle sees it, the virtues point the way to happiness, much as Plato sought the nature of reality through his conception of knowledge.",

The most open of our moral feelings is shame-to the extent that it does not refer simply to the evidently deep-seated shyness about having one's body exposed.

      "title": "Caring is costly: People avoid the cognitive work of compassion.",
      "abstract": "Compassion-the warm, caregiving emotion that emerges from witnessing the suffering of others-has long been considered an important moral emotion for motivating and sustaining prosocial behavior. Some suggest that compassion draws from empathic feelings to motivate prosocial behavior, whereas others try to disentangle these processes to examine their different functions for human prosociality. Many suggest that empathy, which involves sharing in others' experiences, can be biased and exhausting, whereas warm compassionate concern is more rewarding and sustainable. If compassion is indeed a warm and positive experience, then people should be motivated to seek it out when given the opportunity. Here, we ask whether people spontaneously choose to feel compassion, and whether such choices are associated with perceiving compassion as cognitively costly. Across all studies, we found that people opted to avoid compassion when given the opportunity, reported compassion to be more cognitively taxing than empathy and objective detachment, and opted to feel compassion less often to the degree they viewed compassion as cognitively costly. We also revealed two important boundary conditions: first, people were less likely to avoid compassion for close (vs. distant) others, and this choice difference was associated with viewing compassion for close others as less cognitively costly. Second, in the final study we found that with more contextually enriched and immersive pleas for help, participants preferred to escape feeling compassion, although their preference did not differ from also escaping remaining objectively detached. These results temper strong arguments that compassion is an easier route to prosocial motivation. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved).",

      "abstract": "Emotions are a special class of Intentional states with structural components and properties similar to those of the traditional somatic appetites of thirst, hunger and sex. These were originally part of a hardwired, phylogenetically adapted, nonverbal information system for implicitly conveying information about these states both among and within individual members of the species. A classification system provides two major functional classes of emotions, (1) those serving as Appetitive Wishes toward objects, and (2) those serving as Beliefs about the status of fulfillment of those and other significant wishes. Thus, emotions such as Anger and Fear indicate a wish to attack or escape from some object or situation, while Love and Surprise indicate wishes to care about or explore an object or situation. Emotional wishes, like their somatic brethren, require Consummatory Acts for their fulfillment. The result of these acts are emotions such Anxiety and Depression, which indicate Beliefs that the relevant wishes will be hard or impossible to satisfy, or Contentment and Elation, which function as Beliefs that the wishes have been or are being fulfilled. Together, emotional wishes and beliefs form a comprehensive wish-belief information feedback system with manifold causal consequences.",

      "abstract": "Whereas Sigmund Freud considered the orality to be the beginning of the child development, in the last two decades the tactile-symbiotic mother-child-relationship came into the center of scientific attention. The symbiotic-narcissistic basal relationship of early childhood is reactivated in each later object relation. On this basis all active ego performances are built up, as e.g. the projective identification (archaic form), the identification, the transference (in psychotherapy), the regression etc. as well as the delimination from the object. The next level of the object relation is that of the free decision for or against an object. People with narcissistic personality disorders (narcissistic neuroses), having a constituent ego, and borderline personality disorders which occur in individuals with a fragmentation-prone ego, have suffered in their early childhood under deficiency experiences or the experiences of overprotection or of an attention under conditions. The more the individuals were disturbed also in their ego functions, the more an incapacity of the infant has to be supposed to experience or to admit the attention really presented to it. In major depressions the narcissistic emptiness or depletion seems to be at least partially the consequence of a genetic predisposition.",

      "title": "Agency and First-Person Authority",
      "abstract": "Ordinarily when someone tells us about her psychological states, we presume that she is right. By deferring to her in this way, we treat her as a kind of authority on her own psychological life. Although a person usually has this authority, she lacks it whenever she takes a more detached, indirect, or third-personal point of view toward her psychological states. We see this, for example, when she learns about a belief or desire from a friend or therapist. For this reason an adequate account of the phenomenon of first-person authority must explain why we have it only for some but not all of our psychological states. Most philosophers believe first-person authority is an epistemic phenomenon, consisting in each of us being better situated to know about our own psychological states than anyone else. Against all such epistemic views, I argue that, because they base their accounts on epistemic privileges that are in principle available to anyone, they cannot capture the exclusively first-personal character of our authority.As an alternative to the traditional approach, I argue that first-person authority is derived from a person's agency with respect to her own psychological states. By relating to her psychological states in a first-personal way, a person is able to change or maintain them directly on the basis of what she takes to be good reasons for them. Since no other person can affect her psychological states in this way, her capacities as an agent guarantee her a unique kind of authority for them. A person ordinarily expresses this kind of agential authority over her psychological states in what she says about them. This is what justifies our deferring to her psychological self-ascriptions. On the view I develop in this dissertation, first-person authority is not primarily a matter of special epistemic access to psychological facts and deference is not a response to the epistemic status of what someone says. It is an acknowledgment of the special role that a person's agency plays in determining her psychological life.",

      "title": "조선후기 서양화풍 초상화와 유가적 自我",
      "abstract": "The portrait is a genre that recreates a specific individual image, and it naturally reflects not only the outer characteristics and aesthetic viewpoint of the subject but also certain inner characteristics such as how the society in which the portrait was drawn views humanity. Therefore, it is indispensable to have a correct understanding of individuality. However, it is not an exaggeration to state that explanations of individuality in East Asian Confucian society are direly lacking. Terminologies that we customarily use such as“self”(“moi”in French) or “individual”(“individu”in French) are words loaned from western philosophical concepts signifying “an existence as a subject of perception, desire, and action which is separate from the external world or other human beings”or “a human being as an individuality that is irreplaceable with others.”Such meanings, however, are remote from the individuality of traditional East Asian society and that has been a cause of incomplete understanding of traditional portraits. Originally, the Confucian self was an active being with moral autonomy and the ability to judge appropriate patterns of behavior in each of the five cardinal relations(五倫): the parent-child, ruler-subject, husband-wife, old-young, and fiend-friend human relationships. However, as Confucianism became politically ideologized during the Han Dynasty and filial piety(孝) became known as the supreme value, the active individual self became submerged into a hierarchy of family ethics centered on the head of the family. Nevertheless, in spite of such a regression of individual autonomy, the Confucian individual can still be said to be a relational being that actively chose and carried out roles proper to the self within the horizontal relationship network of the five cardinal relations and the vertical[hierarchical] relationship network of the four classes(四民). The East Asian Confucian society based on these five cardinal relations and such a status system began to show political, social, and economic contradictions during the 16 th and 17 th centuries. In China, the desire to reform the irrational reality was expressed as a new current of neo-Confucianism, namely the doctrines of Wang Yangming(陽明學), which affirmed human desires and individuality, and that led to increased interest in the physical world. In the case of the Joseon Dynasty, studies on governing and applied scholarship were carried out mainly by the out-of-power Confucianists who rebelled against the unreality of existing neo-Confucianism and the failure of its policies. The resulting emphasis on the physical aspects of the Universe in the Late Ming Dynasty in China and the Late Joseon Dynasty in Korea also caused a transformation in the characteristics of the traditional Confucian individual. The traditional Confucian human being that endeavored to become an ideal person, a “man of virtue”(君子), through the cultivation of oneself as a relational being located within the network of the five cardinal relations and status-based relations, now became replaced by a realistic human being pursuing perfection of character within the concrete activities of everyday life. Such inner changes in Confucianism, however, did not negate the foundations of Confucian society, which rested on the traditions of the five cardinal horizontal relations and status-based hierarchical relations. The traditional self built on relationships was maintained just the same, while only the method of reaching the Confucian individual's ideal adulthood (becoming a man of virtue) had changed, shedding the abstract approach that had been the norm until then and following the new method of expressing that ideal within the concrete life of reality. The interest in reality influenced painting and created a tendency to emphasize realistic representation, and this showed most notably in portraits. With portraits in the Late Joseon Dynasty, the reception of western painting techniques began first with perspective rather than with chiaroscuro, because the techniques required for the former were relatively easier to change and adapt to the techniques of Oriental painting, which depends mainly on line-based expressions. Chiaroscuro, which pursues plane expressions through repetitive brush strokes and the hiding of the traces of the brush, was too removed from the modeling principles of Oriental painting which depended on brush and ink, and thus required far more time to become part of Oriental painting. The portraits of the Late Joseon Dynasty partially implemented the precise light and shade expressions of western drawing techniques, as can be seen in the way in which faces and clothes were expressed, as well as linear perspective, which can be seen in the foot-board. Those implementations achieved a faithful visual representation of life that was far more advanced than that of the previous period, but they still remained within boundaries that did not impede the essential function of traditional portraits. The interest in everyday occurrences and the ability to see into the artist's selfconsciousness have expanded the portrait genre, such as commemorative portraits and self-portraits, but the sense of commemoration expressed in these works merely reflected the motivation for producing the work, rather than bringing about any great change to the traditional iconography that was grounded on ritual symbolism. The newly introduced genres could never depart significantly from that ritualistic iconography, and the individual expressed was always a relational being defining his or her role within the five cardinal relations and status-based relations, never departing in any way from the Confucian individual. The drawings had such strong ritualistic appearances that the portraits could, without any awkwardness, be used as ritual portraits once the subjects of the portraits passed away. The external innovations and the internal conservatism of the western style portraits of the Late Joseon Dynasty reveal that this relational self and the Confucian system that formed the framework for this self were, although under threat from without and within, still exerting a strong influence.",

Without altering Alfred’s dispositions, subjective experiences, and so forth, we can imagine having substituted an identically appearing but internally rotten apple 2. In such a case, Alfred’s belief differs, while his behavioral dispositions, inner causal states, and qualitative experiences remain constant.",

      "abstract": "Near-death experiences (NDE) are lucid events that take place when a person is so physically compromised that he would die if its condition does not improve. He is unconscious, without heartbeats and breath, and with a flat-line electroencephalogram. NDE may include some of the following elements: Out of the body experiences or separation of consciousness from the physical body, increase in sensory perception and intense emotions, travel into or through a tunnel, encounter with a brilliant light and mystical beings, deceased relatives or friends, a sense of alteration in time and space, visualization of unworldly realms and a special knowledge, encounter with a barrier or boundary, and a return to the body, either voluntary or involuntary. The fact that children NDE are similar to adult NDE is an evidence that these experiences are real and not due to pre-existing beliefs, cultural influences or previous experiences in the present life. The characteristics of NDE are similar worldwide. No evidence supports the physiological, psychological, neurochemical, and neuroanatomical hypothesis proposed to explain the NDE. Multifactorial models, based on the combination of all of them (brain anoxia or hypoxia, release of serotonin, endorphins and ketamine-like compounds) have also been proposed. Although physiological, psychological, and socio-cultural factors could interact in the NDE, the hypothesis proposed consist essentially in unsupported speculations about what might be happening during the NDE.",

      "abstract": "H UMAN beings learn early that almost everything they want can be obtained only through each other's cooperation, whether their need or goal is a mother's breast or a love potion, a slave uprising or a new colony, a Nobel Prize or protection against a bullying policeman. Everyone learns, consciously or not, accurately or not, various ways of controlling others for one's own ends. Few people spend much time calculating how to control others, but everyone does so part of the time. Whatever people do, for whatever goals, will be evaluated by others, who will become thereby more or less willing to cooperate, more or less likely to resist, more or less likely to continue in the relationship. We all interact with others, engage in a flow of transactions with others; and whatever we do has some effect on others, to our advantage or not, in conformity with our wishes or not, and whether or not we will it so. Consequently, however else we might classify the wide range of human acts, we can also view them as samples of social control processes, i.e., the ways by which people shape the flow of each other's behavior. Almost all can be grouped into a small number of tvyes of social control forces. One of these is force and forcethreat, which I shall henceforth simply call force; when I mean only I shall so label it.' The use of force-and I repeat, I mean by this term both force-threat and overt force-is as ubiquitous as the preachments against it. Whatever else social systems are, they are also force systems. Force constitutes one of the major foundations of all social structures. The processes by which the command of force is expended, exchanged, accumulated, or lost, are universal in social interaction, because force is one of the fundamental resources people and groups need to elicit cooperation, help, and conformity from one another. Force constitutes one of the four great social control systems in all societies. For two millennia, social analysts have given much attention to three of these-which they have variously termed force, prestige, and wealth-because these underlie all stratification systems.2 The fourth, which",

      "title": "Stories That are Ready to Break",
      "abstract": "When illness is protracted, when there is no chance of return to the person one once was, or when there is no hope of being \"normal,\" a person's very sense of self is lived in a special way through the body. Personal identity becomes intimately tied to the pain, uncertainty, and stigma that come with an affl icted body. What might it mean to be healed when a cure is only a distant possibility or no possibility at all? The inevitable poverty of biomedical responses to this question has a great deal to do with why narrative is so irresistible. Stories, told or acted, offer healing possibilities that reach far beyond the purview of biomedicine. They can help transform identity, interpret the meaning of the past and even provide images of possible futures. This narrative potential has spawned a wealth of scholarship on the relation of narrative, illness, and personal identity. (See, e.g., Bülow & Hydén, 2003; Becker, 1997; Brockmeier, 2002; Cain, 1991; Charon & Montello, 2002; Frank, 1995; Garro, 2000; Good & Good, 1994; Greenhalgh & Hurwitz, 1998; Hydén, 1997; Kleinman, 1988; Medved & Brockmeier, 2004; Monks, 2000; Morris, 1998.) But stories have insidious potential as well, closing down possibilities, cloaking power in the name of \"stating the facts,\" preventing the very changes that might lead to healing. The very form of stories may oppress, forcing a meaning that denies or overrides a chaotic or inarticulate personal experience. Kirmayer, for example, contends that the coherence that is part of a well-told tale can distance the sufferer from her experience of suffering. Stories can be vehicles for ideology making, especially when coconstructed with powerful physicians, producing texts that are, from the patient's point of view, experience distant. Metaphors and \"fragmentary stories, narrative strands\" may be more revealing than a fi nely wrought narrative (Kirmayer 2000, p. 171). Unni Wikan (2000) also objects that sometimes stories present life in an overly coherent way and cannot necessarily be called upon when facing an unpredictable illness. It may even be that silences or half-told tales disclose more about what it is like to be fl attened by a serious and unexpected illness, to \"fall out of one's life,\" as Gadamer (1996, p. 42) puts it.",

      "abstract": "There is no way to identify an animate object other than to describe its specific characteristics which necessarily look like deviations from the normal “average” pattern, named here paragon, in which the Axiological Standard of a human group is fixed. Of particular heuristic interest is, in this regard, the logical pattern, often used in Russian for describing such a deviation: (he/she is) not A, but B, in which a human creature is being denied the property of being human, but is assimilated to fire, flint, rag, chump, mouse, dough, etc. The variety of descriptions (pseudo-identifications) is explained by his or her need to focus attention on some remarkable feature of person’s character, incompatible with the paragon of accepted traits included in it as a result of the evaluation responses of his or her fellow countrymen. Although they have a greater illocutionary force than a simple statement of a deviant property, these identifications cannot be checked for “truth”, in particular, for compliance with the “real” state of things. They are pseudo-identifications which can only be verified for compliance with some kind of attitude, defining what properties should be used to qualify a person and what should be the ideal sample selected as an auxiliary object in an ideal scenario.",

      "abstract": "Psychological resilience refers to the individual’s tendency to remain steadfast and composed in time of adversity and pressure in addition to his ability to be actively compatible and to cope positively with traumatic states and pressures.\r\nConsequently, this is conducive to fastness in recovery and overstepping traumatic states. It also leads to the previous normal functional state, and therefore to considering the traumatic or pressing state an opportunity to empower and fortify one’s self against traumatic states and pressures in the future. \r\nThe “Meaning of Life,” as an idiom, is considered one of the concepts that has attracted the interest of researchers in the field of mental health. For the human being, the meaning of life relates to its value, his self-contentment and his self-appreciation in the sense that his life revolves around and within the role that he finds himself best in acting.\r\nFrankl(1974) asserts that the meaning of life, love and identity follows the traumatic experiences that the individual encounters through his life. Bad situations are considered an opportunity for the individual to grow. To achieve this, one must have faith in the future, and without faith, there is no meaning for life or reason for living. The flow state represents the crucial factor in constituting the meaning and goal of life, and making sense and value out of it. Hence, this state pushes those who cope up with it to be creative; nay, to the highest degrees of human creativeness. \r\nThis paper attempts to link the previous variables with the resilience of the Syrian Arab Army by approaching methodologically the elements of this research paper. This methodological approach depends on analyzing the literature of the subject matter by collecting and coordinating the theoretical writings and research studies in this domain, then analyzing them in order to illustrate their underlying implications, and therefore easing the task to know the secret of psychological resilience, flow, and meaning of life within the context of positive psychology. In order to excavate for this secret, one must look for the nature of these variable and its limitations, and applying them on the resilience of the Syrian Arab Army. Thus, the current paper relies on a description and explanation emanating from building a base of concepts, and the methodology here is closer to qualitative research. \r\nيهدف البحث الحالي إلى دراسة العلاقة بين عدة مفاهيم أساسية, تعكس مكامن القوة والضعف في الشخصية الإنسانية ومالها من دور مؤثر على الواقع النفسي والمادي للفرد, وهي الصمود النفسي ومعنى الحياة والتدفق من وجهة نظر علم النفس الإيجابي.\r\nويشير مفهوم الصمود النفسي إلى فكرة ميل الفرد إلى الثبات والحفاظ على هدوئه عند التعرض لضغوط أو مواقف عصيبة, فضلا عن قدرته على التوافق الفعال والمواجهة الإيجابية لهذه الضغوط وتلك المواقف الصادمة, وبالتالي سرعة التعافي والتجاوز السريع للموقف الصادم, والعودة إلى الحالة الوظيفية العادية, واعتبار الموقف الصادم أو الضاغط فرصة لتقوية الذات وتحصينها ضد الضغوط والمواقف الصادمة مستقبلا.\r\nوتحاول الورقة الحالية ربط المتغيرات السابقة بصمود الجيش العربي السوري, من خلال التناول المنهجي لعناصر الورقة البحثية الحالية, الذي اعتمد على تحليل أدبيات المجال, من خلال تجميع وتنسيق الكتابات النظرية والدراسات البحثية في المجال, وتحليلها, بهدف توضيح مضامينها بما يسهم في الكشف عن ماهية الصمود النفسي والتدفق ومعنى الحياة في سياق علم النفس الإيجابي من خلال الكشف عن طبيعة هذه المتغيرات ومحدداتها وتطبيق ذلك على صمود الجيش العربي السوري, وتستند الورقة الحالية على الوصف والتفسير المنطلق من بناء قاعدة مفاهيم, وهي منهجية أقرب إلى البحث الكيفي.\r\nوخلصت البحث الحالية إلى أهمية العلاقة بين هذه المتغيرات, وتم تحديد أهم ثمرات الصمود النفسي ومقوماته, وأهم خصائص الأشخاص ذوي الصمود النفسي",

Sometimes other terms, such as \"spirit\" or even \"face,\" hint at the issue. In later sections, I discuss the relevance of this issue to the thought of Alfred North Whitehead and others influenced by him. Finally, I discuss the reality of trauma in human life and its implications for Whiteheadian thought and thought about the presence of God. I explore the sense we have of presence, something different from mind or body or objects or consciousness. (1) We become aware of our own presence in the world and the unique and irreplaceable sense we have of our own presence. (2) We become aware that sometimes we are more intensely present to other people than is normally the case. Then we begin to sense occasions when the other person becomes more intensely present to us. (3) Some people search for a cosmic presence, hoping perhaps that we are not ultimately alone.",

The woman becomes the object the man uses—or believes to be using—as he pleases. Some women complain about being considered as objects by their men. It is the case of Veronique, who came to see me to escape a painful relationship with a man who belittles her and considers her as an object—an object supposed to satisfy his urges and his whims. Veronique is, for this man, a beautiful object, a precious, irreplaceable object, and nevertheless, he does not want to recognize that he loves her as a woman. Why cannot this beautiful object be at the same time a loved woman for this man? Is it easier, for some men, to be dependent on an object rather than on a person?",

      "title": "Embodiment, Reason and Diversity/Pluralism",
      "abstract": "To be able to account for the human experience of reason and embodiment we need the dimension of the other. Levinas provides us with this dimension. We have evidence to demonstrate that reason is plural and that a pluralistic reason works. A pluralistic reason shows how diversity is strength rather than a threat. In Levinas, we see how ethical concerns bring us to metaphysical exteriority, where the orthodox opposition between theory and practice evaporates in the face of a metaphysical transcendence that establishes the “absolutely other” as truth. The theoretical exercise of thought does not monopolize transcendence any longer. We do not have an intellectual knowledge or comprehension of the Other; rather, through the phenomena of language, desire, and concern for justice the Other challenges and calls our self-complacency into question. This activity of the Other holds our excesses in check, calls us to order, and so founds reason. True, one’s relation with the Other, who questions the “brutal spontaneity” of one’s egoistic behaviours, initiates within one a new experience of oneself (Levinas, 1969, 203). Yet this response to one’s irresponsible and irrational freedom halts violence and irrationality, and, in so doing also, “founds Reason.” The totalizing thinking aims at absorbing all Otherness into its total system of harmony and order. It intends to have a general knowledge of the Other and of everything in order to put them into one of its categories and to give them a place in its egocentric world. It aims at categorizing with a view to manipulating (Levinas, 1969, 12-18). To reject the self-centered totalizing project of systematic metaphysics is not to break with systematic/orderly thinking or to break with rationalism. It is instead to be authentically rational. Levinas shows that though the Other is other than we are, he does not negate us, as Hegel and his proponents would have us believe. Levinas’s middle way proffers us an Other-regarding solution that values and respects the Other in our behaviour, thought, and speech. This way of thinking rejects the traditional idea that reason has no plural.",

      "abstract": "pelled to acknowledge a far greater uniformity of appreciation than we are apt to suppose from the frequent use of such phrases as that \" tastes are so various as to be beyond the influence of rational dis- cussion.\"It often happens that a man likes one thing before his attention is directed to another, just as he may relish one dish until he partakes of a better.Devise, however, something essentially good, some- thing which satisfies the common yearnings of civilized humanity, and it will as surely court universal appro- bation as the skill of the accomplished chef will elicit general commendation.No better illustration of popular misconception can here be adduced than that treated of in Chapter IV.A friend rejoicing in the glories of the imagination, or aiming at discovering artistic proficiency alone, triumphantly points to a ceiling embellished with sky, clouds, doves, and angels, and exultingly exclaims, \"Is not this fine !\" You cannot go into ecstasies over it ; you feel it ought not to be there.You essay your reasons ; he will not listen to reasons.He shrugs his shoulders, pities your want of appreciation, and cuts short all controversy by giving you to understand that disapproval is immaterial, because whether you like it or do not like it is entirely a question of \" taste.\"Such decoration is radically wrong, since a house being a purely artificial thing, and a roof an absolutely neces- sary thing, no attempt should be made to impart to the ceiling a semblance of intangibility, or to suggest ex- posure to the open air.The friend can assign no reason for his approval beyond the circumstance that he likes it, and when he tells you it is a matter of \"taste,\" he really means that the thing he admires suits his own predisposition.Now Taste, as contradistinguished from predilec- tion, is eminently a subject within the influence of rational discussion.It will not be long before prin- ciples are established in this as in every other science ; and if we deduce our rules from those ascertainable laws written upon the open volume of Nature before us, we shall have no difficulty in ascertaining what is best calculated to please the eye, gratify the mind, elevate the sentiments, and conduce to that general harmony which prevails in creation around us ; which the spirit of man so earnestly desires, but which the folly of man so materially impedes.But it is idle to expect any effectual progress in popular appreciation unless we bear in mind the dis- tinction already adverted to between rules and principles ; unless we treat the subject more as a matter of judgment than of mere sentiment ; unless attention be drawn to the why and wherefore of aesthetic proposi- tions.It would be difficult to name even any book which goes beyond telling us that we ought to admire this, that, or the other, without assigning any reason for doing so; or that we ought to adopt one thing and B 2 ment ; that the arch is supposed to have been unknown to them, and to have been introduced only after the Macedonian conquest, -although recent discoveries in Asia Minor somewhat militate against this hypo- thesis ; -that it forms a distinguishing feature in Eoman design ; that it is a vast improvement upon the rigid lines of their predecessors, and that it is an in- dispensable element in successful construction at the present day.After the transfer of the capital to Byzantium oriental extravagances became engrafted upon the grand simplicity of the Eoman style, and thence arose the Byzantine, a very good specimen of which, although somewhat fantastic, is afforded in the Cathedral of St. Mark's in Venice.The twelfth century witnessed the incipience of that most exquisite method known as the Gothic, with its pointed arch and steeple, its buttresses, its mullion windows, chamfered edges, foliations, delicate tracery, and exquisite elaborations.From its almost simul- taneous adoption by those nations which had taken part in the Crusades, the germs of this style are supposed to have been borrowed from the Saracens ; and certainly there is a striking resemblance in the shape of the arch, in the spires, and in other salient characteristics.In the South Kensington Museum is a photograph from an unfinished mausoleum to Ali Adil Shah, which bears a most remarkable similitude to that of a ruined abbey.",

      "abstract": "Ownership of a body by a self is not possible without a distinction between self and body, for simply being a (human) body does not suffice for being a person or a self. But neither is a person or a self an independent entity that merely uses the body. One must understand the self as constituted by certain interrelations between the psychological states of a body, inter-relations that simultaneously create a self and create a relationship of ownership between the body and the self. This chapter deals with much recent work on the nature of personal identity or selfhood, including work in such fields as the philosophy of mind, literary theory, and feminist theory. The self, or the ego, is not a separate entity with independent desires. It is, rather, a certain way of coordinating unreflective beliefs and desires, a way that depends on the emergence of certain rational capacities, which themselves emerge with the capacity for reflection.",

      "title": "Quality of life: the heart of the matter",
      "abstract": "Abstract It is believed widely, and with good reason, that some other members of the animal kingdom, like us, have feelings (associated with brain states induced by various sensory inputs and cognitive processes) which can be pleasant or unpleasant. Associated with the strengthening scientific foundations for this belief, there has been growing consensus around the world that we have a moral responsibility, in all of our dealings and interactions with sentient animals, to take account of their feelings. This has led to widespread re-evaluation, in recent years, of the nature of our interactions with other animals. However, assessment of the feelings of animals — the quality of their lives — remains a great challenge for veterinarians and others involved with their management. The fundamental difficulty is that whilst judgements about management or treatment often have to be made on the basis of our inferences of how they feel (ie of the feelings they consciously experience), a subjective step cannot be avoided in making these inferences. We cannot know how other animals feel but can only infer this based on our knowledge of the animal and on our own experiences of feelings. This inevitable ‘gap’ in objective deductions about feelings is often wide enough that people can reach radically different conclusions when judging an animal's quality of life. Opinions thus often differ regarding the point at which it becomes kinder to euthanase an animal than not to do so, the point at which it becomes kinder not to undertake a potentially painful therapeutic intervention than to do so, and where the balance lies when animal welfare costs are being ‘weighed’ against some benefit of their use for humans (eg as laboratory, farm or companion animals). The aim of this meeting is to discuss if and how science has helped in developing reasoned approaches to these dilemmas, and to consider the need for further research, education, and policy development.",

      "title": "Possibility, Novelty, and Creativity",
      "abstract": "From the introduction]Genuine novelty is the introduction and creation of new things, relations, and affections in the world.Human experience constantly confronts us with novelty, in surprising, intimate ways (spotting new freckles, a great cup of hot chocolate, budding flowers), and in more time-extended, sweeping ways (invention of the automobile, the Little Ice Age, the development of homo sapiens).And yet things are the same.The novel always contains what has already been as a component, but with some modification.Generically, all novelty is the outcome of some creative act, and all creative acts beget some novelty.Apart from this, the concept of novelty is not homogenous.There can be novel itemsindividual and unique things.There can be novel kinds: new sorts of things or states of affairs, new types of events.There can be novel problems and questions and concepts.All novelty involves a measure of unpredictability and a measure of breaking from the status quo.And novelty is a pervasive element of human experience.I want to take this aspect of human experience seriously when doing metaphysics; I do not want to make the world of human experience secondary to some ineffable realm.Because our experience is an aspect of the real world, an account of novelty must acknowledge that the novel things that emerge in the course of events are \"genuine.\"That is, they are metaphysically significant and ontologically real.I want to construct a metaphysic that accommodates pervasive change and novelty, one that accommodates radical novelty.This is, however, a drastic change from much contemporary metaphysical work.Often, the way change is dealt with metaphysically renders our most intimate interactions and feelings an unimportant component of reality (if it is a component at all).Thus the reworking of many fundamental notions is required in order to make sense of the ideas of 'change' and 'novelty.'One of these notions is 'possibility.'Commonly held notions of possibility, such as an existenceless form (a \"possible object\" -a plaid apple, for example), or possibility as a rearrangement of the elements of actuality (taking what actually exists and putting it in new combinations -horse + horn = unicorn), drain all significance from the notion of novelty.In this paper, I attempt to revise our notion of possibility using Bergson and Whitehead by creating a picture that does not entail \"possible objects,\" but allows for a creative actuality and radical novelty.This modified view of possibility will provide a basis for understanding higher and more complex and coordinated forms of novelty.[...",

Factors that can modify the internal state and in turn induce alliesthesia are as follows: internal physiological variables (e.g., deep body temperature or body dehydration modify the pleasure of thermal sensation or taste of water); set points (e.g., during fever the body temperature set point is raised and pleasure defends the elevated set point); multiple peripheral stimuli (e.g., mean skin temperature determines the set point for deep body temperature and in turn generates alliesthesia); and past history of the subject (e.g., association of a flavor with a disease or a recovery from disease renders it unpleasant or pleasant). Positive alliesthesia indicates a change to a more pleasurable sensation; negative alliesthesia a change to a less pleasurable one.",

      "abstract": "People are not born in groups. They come to life individually as separate entities and independent organisms. They need air, food, water, protection from heat and cold, as well as shelter, rest and sleep. Most of their needs cannot be satisfied unless there are some other people around to help. Human infants cannot survive unless they are assisted by others; their are the very condition for survival. As soon as the infant is able to perceive or to feel or somehow to become aware of the presence of other individuals around him, he begins to differentiate between people who are able to help him and those who are not. People who can satisfy the infant's needs or deprive him of satisfaction have power; they are the strong ones in contradistinction to those who cannot do so. For example, a mother can feed him; she is considered a strong person, while the unhelpful onlookers such as an old grandfather or a little brother, are weak persons. Those in power are not always willing to help. If they are willing to do so, they are friendly persons, but if they refuse or prevent satisfaction of needs they are perceived as hostile individuals. The child's well-being depends on how strong and friendly the people around him are. The child's first social relations are instrumental for survival. The process of the child's socialization can be considered as a product of his basic needs. It is essential to differentiate between the two types of needs. The first type may be considered to be such items as food, water, shelter. The second type is to be sure that the needs will be satisfied by friendly people who accept the child and are willing to help him. There is plenty of evidence that the ,,social need to be accepted and to live in a friendly atmosphere appears very early.

      "title": "The Resemblances of the Concept of Love in Theravada Buddhist Philosophy and Stoicism: A Comparative Study",
      "abstract": "In Theravada Buddhist Philosophy, love exists as psychological activities that can be called by many names such as Sineha or romantic love, Karma or erotic love, Pema or family love, Metta or compassionate love etc. Variety of love is also categorized into lower kinds and higher kinds of love. Lower kind of love refers to those psychological activities that demand possession of the objects that we love while higher kinds refers to psychological activities that extends goodness to others. However, love, as well as everything, is governed by the Law of Impermanence, meaning that it occurs, comes into being and then cease to be. The highest form of love in Buddhism is, presumably, called Chanta (the will) or the love of dharma which is the highest truth and the wisdom to be free from all attachments. Similarly, the Stoic philosophers (c.300 B.C.-c. 300 A.D.) try to live their lives according to their ideal state of happiness (Eudaimonia) by avoiding the emotions such as desire, pain, grief, fear and passion. The Stoics hold that such feelings are caused by false judgements and that the wiseman who had attained moral and intellectual perfection would not undertake them. The later stoic philosophers such as Seneca and Epictetus, emphasize the doctrine that the wiseman is entirely resilient to misfortune and that virtue is satisfactory condition for happiness. Thus, passionate or romantic love is an unnecessary condition for human to attain happiness. In this research paper, the researcher attempts to identify the commonalities in the concept of love of two ancient school of thoughts, one from the western and the other from the eastern part of the world. The result will support at the international level, the expansion of knowledge in the field of philosophy of love.",

      "abstract": "Creativity as the source of culture In this paper the author presents human creativity as the main source of culture. Logically, it comes even from the definition of culture, understood as everything created by men (everything, which does not belong to nature). Creation by man includes the material, symbolic and societal types of culture. In the field of symbolic culture, like art, science or media, the process of creativity includes activities which result in new and valuable products. Creativity develops in the private, social and cultural domains. In the private domain an individual creates something, which is new and valuable for himself (or herself). In the social domain an individual creates something, which is new and valuable to a group, where he or she belongs. Finally, creativity in the cultural domain means creating something, which is new and valuable for all human culture. Normally it is possible through the publication or public presentation of a product, after a process of selection. Thus, normally there exists a barrier of entering this main. Creativity in the domain of culture requires not only being a creative person in the psychological sense, but also a huge amount of knowledge and practice in the specific field of activity. But by enhancing the private and social creativity, it is possible to enlarge the number of persons, which could inspire to enter the domain of cultural activity. Moreover, the true creative activity always contains the individual, private, authentic internal perspective, and is always directed to some social environment. Also, the new ways of distributing the creative products, like the Internet, makes the barrier to cultural creativity less tight, than they used to be in the past.",

Intelligence becomes defined in terms of 'knowing how to handle oneself under a variety of circumstances.

Here we focus on a different structural feature, their connection to a person's self-concept. In 6 studies, we predict and find that people's most enduring regrets stem more often from discrepancies between their actual and ideal selves than their actual and ought selves. We also provide evidence that this asymmetry is at least partly due to differences in how people cope with regret. People are quicker to take steps to cope with failures to live up to their duties and responsibilities (ought-related regrets) than their failures to live up to their goals and aspirations (ideal-related regrets). As a consequence, ideal-related regrets are more likely to remain unresolved, leaving people more likely to regret not being all they could have been more than all they should have been.

      "abstract": "Abstract According to most accounts of trust, you can only trust other people (or groups of people). To trust is to think that another has goodwill, or something to that effect. I sketch a different form of trust: the unquestioning attitude. What it is to trust, in this sense, is to settle one’s mind about something, to stop questioning it. To trust is to rely on a resource while suspending deliberation over its reliability. Trust lowers the barrier of monitoring, challenging, checking, and questioning. Trust sets up open pipelines between yourself and parts of the external world. Trust permits external resources to have a similar relationship to one as one’s internal cognitive faculties. This creates efficiency, but at the price of exquisite vulnerability. We must trust in this way because we are cognitively limited beings in a cognitively overwhelming world. Crucially, we can hold the unquestioning attitude towards objects and technologies. When I trust my climbing rope, I stop worrying about its reliability. When I trust my online calendaring system, I simply go to the events indicated, without question. But, one might worry, how could one ever hold such a normatively loaded attitude as trust towards mere objects? How could it ever make sense to feel betrayed by an object? Trust is our engine for expanding and outsourcing our agency—for binding external processes into our practical selves. Thus, we can be betrayed by our smartphones in the same way that we can be betrayed by our memory. When we trust, we try to make something a part of our agency, and we are betrayed when our part lets us down. To unquestioningly trust something is to let it in—to attempt to bring it inside one’s practical functioning. This suggests a new form of gullibility: agential gullibility, which occurs when agents too hastily and carelessly integrate external resources into their own agency.",

However, from a functional perspective, one might expect that an emotion that evolved to protect social bonds from interlopers might exist in other social species, particularly one as cognitively sophisticated as the dog. The current experiment adapted a paradigm from human infant studies to examine jealousy in domestic dogs. We found that dogs exhibited significantly more jealous behaviors (e.g., snapping, getting between the owner and object, pushing/touching the object/owner) when their owners displayed affectionate behaviors towards what appeared to be another dog as compared to nonsocial objects. These results lend support to the hypothesis that jealousy has some \"primordial\" form that exists in human infants and in at least one other social species besides humans.",

Sometimes “knowledgeable” (clairvoyant) persons are said to speak to such spirits and are, in turn, spoken to by them. Some of these spirits are far more powerful than the human spirit and consequently man himself. But man, by his higher intelligence, can control them all, to his own purpose, if he only knows how to go about it.

      "abstract": "Anxiety, unlike fear, which is strongly object-related, accompanies man all his life. This anxious condition appears especially then, when danger is imminent, also in the case of being severely ill. Anxiety and hope, even in people severely ill, do not exclude each other. Human life for many and perhaps for all is a race with time. The anxiety not being able to realize enough in a given time often is the reason for a busy and restless activity. Man often suffers from anxiety of other human beings. As ever an individual may live, it always owes something to others. Accordingly, the doctor or other helpers never are able to behave totally in the way as the patient expects and the patient cannot act as the helper truly would like it. Man experiences anxiety, however, also then, when he recognizes to remain in debts towards himself and, in the view of religion, towards a task given by God. Yet, man suffers anxiety not only because of his confrontation with death but also with life and the responsibilities which he has to take over when growing up in society. The struggle for existence described by Darwin, a result of anxiety, seems to be lost for the patient knowing he or she is severely ill, and he/she is therefore upset against a destiny which threatens to exclude him/her from the community of healthy people and perhaps soon from the living persons. Anxiety always turns also around the existence in the group.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Its meaning is far from obvious; it veils a multitude of implications and has given rise to a swarm of misconceptions. It has been assumed that all desire is sub ratione boni ; nay more, the good has been defined as the object of universal desire, as “that at which all things aim.” The view that desire is conditioned by prior apprehension of the good has provoked the rejoinder that desires precede consciousness of their end, that cognition is the result of, or at least concomitant with, the conative process which reveals it. Again, it may be asked whether the gooddesired is necessarily my own good, so that its attainment may beconstrued as self-realization; and, if so, whether it is private tomyself or a common good which can be shared with others. Is heereone absolute Good, knowable by man, to which all other goodsare relative? Is it possible to pass beyond what we opine and believeto be good, so as to know and desire what is “really” good?",

      "abstract": "Abstract Awareness of the self and awareness of others are difficult faculties to define. Part of the problem lies in the wide range of abilities that involve various aspects of awareness. Some of the most commonly studied abilities focus on the self-awareness of the individual. These abilities range from the capacity to distinguish self from non-self to the competency to reflect on one's past, present or future condition. Another set of abilities that is relevant to the study of awareness involves the interactions of individuals, and includes behaviours such as deception and empathy. We explore the possibility that species other than humans engage in deception and empathy, and consider the implications of such behaviours for self-awareness and other-awareness in these species. Although examples from a variety of species are provided, many examples come from dolphins and whales. This reflects both the authors’ interest in these animals and the possibility that large-brained creatures are more likely to engage in deliberate deception and/or true empathy.",

      "title": "Asian Christian Spirituality: Context and Contour",
      "abstract": "Asian Christian Spirituality: Context and Contour Peter C. Phan In its broadest sense, spirituality refers first of all to the human capacity for self-transcendence actualized in acts of knowledge and love of realities other than oneself. Secondly, and more narrowly, it refers to the religious dimension of life by which one is in touch with the more-than-human, transcendent reality, however interpreted and named (for example, Emptiness, the Holy, the Ultimate, the Absolute, Heaven, or God). Thirdly, and more strictly still, it indicates a particular way of living one's relationship with this transcendent reality, through specific beliefs, rituals, prayers, moral behaviors, and community participation (for example, Hindu, Buddhist, Jewish, Christian, Muslim, etc.). 1 There is of course no generic spirituality, untethered from a historical and particular tradition and community. Even when one attempts to construct one's own spirituality, one can only do so by drawing upon various elements of pre-existing spiritual traditions. In other words, the institutional dimension of spirituality is essential to any spiritual quest. 2 Needless to say, Asian spirituality embodies all these three connotations. It is human self-transcendence toward the Ultimate Other within a particular religious tradition. This is also true of Christian spirituality, which is a particular way of relating to God as Abba/Father, mediated by Jesus of Nazareth in his ministry, death, and resurrection, and made possible by the power of the Holy Spirit, who has been poured out upon the community called church. In short, Christian spirituality as relationship with God is pneumatological (empowered by the Spirit), Christological (mediated through and modeled after Christ), and ecclesial (realized in the church). This reflection on Asian Christian spirituality will consider how these three dimensions are realized in the context of Asian societies, cultures, and religions. On the basis of this context I will also delineate the contour of such a spirituality. 3 Spirituality as Life Empowered by the Spirit: Being Religious Interreligiously Spirituality is essentially life in the Spirit. It is not however antithetical to the body and matter. According to Paul, \"spirit\" (pneuma) and spiritual (pneumatikos)—from which \"spirituality\" is derived—are the opposites of \"flesh\" [End Page 221] (sarx), \"fleshly\" (sarkikos), and \"soul-ly\" (psychikos), but not of \"body\" (soma), \"bodily\" (somatikos), and \"matter\" (hyle). The Pauline opposition is not between two ontological orders: the incorporeal and the immaterial on the one hand and the corporeal and the material on the other. Such metaphysical dualism did not attach to the use of spiritualitas until the twelfth century. Rather, the opposition is between two ways of life, one that is led by and in accord with the Spirit (\"spiritual\") and therefore leading to life, and the other opposed to the Spirit (\"fleshly\") and bringing about death. Christian spirituality then is essentially life empowered by the Spirit of Christ, by which men and women are made sons and daughters of God by adoption and brothers and sisters of Christ into whose image they must be fashioned. Such a life is adorned with the Spirit's gift of virtues (1 Cor 13:13; Col 1:9; Rom 8:21; Gal 5:13; 2 Cor 3:17), fruits (Gal 5:23–24), and charisms of different kinds to build up the Christian community (1 Cor 12:4–11; 28–30; Rom 12:6–8; Eph 4:11–13). 4 Because Asia is the birthplace of most if not all religions, and because Christians form but a tiny minority of the Asian population, Asian Christians, more than their fellow-believers in any other part of the globe, cannot live their Spirit-empowered lives apart from non-Christian religions. At first, most missionaries, both Catholic and Protestant, were pessimistic about the spiritual values of these religious ways of life. But the goodness of non-Christians (many of them are holier than Christians!), with whom many Christians share their daily life intimately as family members, give the lie to the church's age-old teaching that...",

These nuclear ideas or attitudes about health, illness and care are culturally patterned and are both conscious and unconscious (implicit). Moreover, expectations of the nature of the patient-healer relationship have implications for medical practice in general and psychotherapy in particular.",

The Greek concept ofphildtimo clarifies the connection between honour and shame and determines whether or not any action will be taken in order to restore the damaged honour. Etymologically phildtimo means 'love of honour' and is used to identify the character of a Greek who is concerned with his honour and his good name above all and who is willing to safeguard it at any price.

      "abstract": "The author offers an instructive distinction between a gift and a transfer. A gift enhances the human and intellectual development of another; a transfer might initiate the downhill slide of another into the state of victimhood known as entitlement. Every act we perform toward another, whether individually or through our social capital as philanthropists, has these two possible outcomes. The author then distinguishes between three possible meanings for the concept of obligation: a duty, a responsibility, or compassion and gratitude. He proposes that any act toward another that begins as a duty will likely lead to dependence and reduction of the human spirit. An action that creates in another a state of “being entitled” carries with it, for that person, a significant risk of becoming, in his or her own eyes, a victim with an ever-deepening loss of self-awareness and personal freedom. When that obligation is viewed with a sense of responsibility, an important positive step is achieved in that giving responsibly requires of the donor active caring about whether the gift will harm another. Finally, when obligation is manifested through gratitude as compassion, it leads to the enhancement of one’s own spirit and to the enhancement of the spirits of those it touches. It is the practice of love for one’s fellow man. It is the essence of philosanthropos and thus of philanthropy. <b>TOPICS:</b>Wealth management, foundations &amp; endowments",

The arrival of the child, on the other hand, leads the mother into the labyrinths of an experience that, without the child, she would only rarely encounter: love for an other. Not for herself, nor for an identical human being, and still less for another person with whom \"I\" fuse (love or sexual passion). But the slow, difficult, and delightful apprenticeship in attentiveness, gentleness, forgetting oneself.

      "abstract": "The elephant is neither an inference nor a statement nor the subjective judgment of a creator. It is a phenomenon. But people are so used to the idea that psychic events are wilful and arbitrary products, or even the inventions of a human creator, that they can hardly rid ourselves of the prejudiced view that the psyche and its contents are nothing but people's own arbitrary invention or the more or less illusory product of supposition and judgment. Religion, as the Latin word denotes, is a careful and scrupulous observation of what Rudolf Otto aptly termed the numinosum, that is, a dynamic agency or effect not caused by an arbitrary act of will. A great many ritualistic performances are carried out for the sole purpose of producing at will the effect of the numinosum by means of certain devices of a magical nature, such as invocation, incantation, sacrifice, meditation and yoga practices, self-inflicted tortures of various descriptions, and so forth.",

Serendipity deals with grasping affordances, that is, usage potentials, creating correspondence and resonance between environmental and personal factors. Serendipity thus plays a fundamental role in how we discover, explore, and learn, and are creative, in all fields of life; on a continuum from grand discoveries in science (like penicillin) to small curiosity insights and informal learnings we all make in everyday-life micro-serendipity [http://hdl.handle.net/2142/36052]. In line with my poem here on Chance + Choice + Change, I see serendipity as a control clash between perceived non-control (Chance) and perceived control (Choice), often leading to Change in our perceptions and directions in life. Serendipity leading to such changes in scientific knowledge as well as in our everyday life is the result of discovering and grasping so-called adjacent possibilities that are both available and new to us in a given situation [https://www.academia.edu/71056287/Adjacent_possible].

He does not hold that all matter can determine a human action’s species, but only that matter to which an action is specially related, called the ‘matter about which’ an action takes place or its ‘due’/‘undue’ matter. Aquinas has two different ways of explaining how matter can specify. On occasion, he argues that just as particular kinds of matter predispose for certain substantial forms (for instance, only flesh and bones can accommodate the human soul), so the distinctive characters of things willed predispose for certain kinds of human actions and habits (for example, pleasures of touch predispose for temperance, not courage). In other contexts, Aquinas uses explanations more familiar in his moral teaching: he says that matter specifies because a human agent wills some matter as an end, or because matter possesses a distinctive formal aspect (like an object’s).",

It is the same with gifts of fortune. Power, riches, honor, even health and that complete wellbeing and satisfaction with one's condition called happiness, produce boldness and thereby often arrogance as well unless a good will is present which corrects the influence of these on the mind and, in so doing, also corrects the whole principle of action and brings it into conformity with universal ends – not to mention that an impartial rational spectator can take no delight in seeing the uninterrupted prosperity of a being graced with no feature of a pure and good will, so that a good will seems to constitute the indispensable condition even of worthiness to be happy.",

      "abstract": "Confucian spirituality consists in the positive development of human desire for meaningfulness, that can be distinguished as desiring desire (能欲) or original desire, which we may call benxin 本心, the original generosity to go outside of oneself towards others; the desirable desire (可欲), which we may call chuxin 初心, the initial direction of desire to the good in many others; and the desired desire (所欲) that men should constantly guard against becoming selfish in the seeking and enjoyment of any specific object. Various artforms may be termed ''inducers of desire''; these induce the positive development of desire for meaningfulness. Arts, with authenticity and sincerity, serve to elicit from us unselfish desire in directing it to order and beauty, fining it, even to the point of seeking poetic wisdom. Then, unselfish desire should come back to itself and form a life of virtue, defined as excellence in the realization of one's natural abilities, and the harmonization of relationships. In the end, we will turn towards Confucius' religiosity, in dealing with his intimate relationship with Heaven as the ultimate reality, to which he prays in gratitude for even a humble meal, trusting his mission given by Heaven, and facing the challenges of life, even dangerous and life-threatening, with the support of Heaven.",

Explaining life and its origin is rich in paradoxes and far from denitive (Bedau, 1998). From a theoretical and technical standpoint, life may only exist in systems that are dynamic and very complex (Prigogine and Stengers, 1984; Kauman, 1993). us, asking that a denition for life should be at the same time brief, popular, and scientically accurate is wrong. Most dictionary-like abbreviated definitions or colloquial denitions of life are too truncated or too simplistic to be acceptable. ey may serve but a segment of the public and certainly not the specialist. An acceptable denition for life cannot be constrained for size or simplistic on purpose. It will be in the form of a description of the essence and fundamental properties of life and will be tailored to a specic purpose and target audience. It is also possible that a denition of life is not something that a person with inadequate academic training can be briefed about in a rush, that is, \"Life is not something that can be told about, it may have to be taught.\"",

      "title": "A whole world: the personal is the global",
      "abstract": "A truly holist worldview would indicate that indeed all personal actions and perceptions are experienced and interact in a logical way with a fully structured, interdependent world. Every personal action, feeling and thought is reflected and responded to in the ‘whole’. While the individual experience of such a world compares to living in a matrix and is encountered when sufficient perceptional capacity is present, this does indeed not indicate that everything which exists and is perceptionally experienced would be fictional or an illusion. Rather, all of these perceptions are (probably) real and true in their own way, even not intentionally related and meaningful, but for the experiencing individual they make an immediate meaningful sense where all things seem related and deeply meaningful. This perception of the world, for which I use the classical term ‘holist’, has been experienced by many individuals before. Scholars such as Jung, Freud, Plotinus and many others have discussed specific elements of it (three levels of consciousness, synchronicity, serendipity, unity of all, telepathy, etc. etc.). It is oftentimes encountered by people experiencing what we would usually call ‘altered perceptions’. Those might be incited by the use of substances or by spiritual practices or might even be found in what the Western world terms ‘mental illnesses’. Within this altered, but ultimately not entirely incorrect, worldview, causal or apparently causal relationships exist virtually everywhere. While in this worldview, our materialist causal knowledge does still make sense, in addition alternative knowledges such as provided by Eastern philosophy, para-sciences, mysticism, religion, also make sense. For example, such an individual might perceive meaning in numerology, while at the same time knowing with the same certainty, that the numbers read were not intended to provide a certain information when they were written. There seems to be a paradoxical tension between the Eastern and Western reality, between meaning and coincidence, rationality and irrationality. In fact, there is no real conflict between these two perceptions. Rather, when integrated, they can provide a new and potentially progressive and more meaningful understanding of our world and reality. This new worldview could, as one example of concrete holism, show concrete correlations between personal experiences and actions, and global effects.",

      "title": "Degradation of (moral) values in the context of the ego ideal and the ideal ego",
      "abstract": "All conclusions about some psychological characteristics or content must derive from relations of social, or better yet, epochal changes and structure they create. General agreement - admittedly biased and without access to a constant fact which is not close to any transitional movements - that the times are unstable - does not end with a precise understanding of how much would that instability reflect on the formation of a stable character. It could be said that this particular level of structuration, which connects 'the external' and 'the internal', is consistently absent in most theories. This especially applies to our central self, our consciousness, the authoritative part of us that sets standards and has been wrongly equated with universal truths, general principles and something that is considered to be common to all people. All complexity of formation of the super­ego, as the lastly formed instance that is also responsible for the sense of duty or the sense of moral obligation, has always been a result of the current form of structuration and has always been realized, more or less, as a distorted memory of certain, quite determined, events that a subject was overwhelmed with. If we listen to our own tendencies toward instability, we will not fall into the trap which is often present when describing ourselves, i.e. the belief that we have 'a real self', common to all human beings, whose requests are more important than requests of all others. However, outside of dynamic psychology, it would be difficult to understand how Lacan's 'split entity' could ever have 'a real self' whose requests are, especially concerning morality, more important than all other requests. Human nature has most easily been introduced into the norm by those ideals that had insisted on denial, and are located in the ego ideal. When 'ideals' moved, usually behind a screen of freedom and urge for individualization, the pleasure returned to nature in the form of ego ideals that knew the answer to the question, 'What is good for a man's life?' It is, as a reality principle, located in egocentric context, but no longer as an individual excess, but rather as a general, universal truth. Individualism, as the supreme value, has allowed different people to keep different views on what is a good life. While the ego ideal extolled people to make a compromise in which, of course, they had to forgo nature for the sake of culture, ideal ego approves all bypasses of the law if it is good for the subject. It could almost be said that the system of ego ideal, which is valued less and less, makes values as they are. There is no degradation whatsoever because cancelling of differences and boundaries leads to uniformity where the difference between the right and wrong is reduced to personal good. 'An inner voice' that dictates duties to the subject and indicates where good and evil are in opposition as pure or impure, was suspended. Ideal ego is not an ally of the law because it does not care for the subject's well-being. Unlike it, the ego ideal was giving satisfaction by its realization. No matter how strange it might seem, the highest value in a man (moral values) is most deeply associated with the lowest, with his pure nature. Therefore, it is difficult, if not impossible, to answer the question, 'What is my true self?' to a man who wonders what it is human nature. For psychoanalysis, it is hard to accept that naive 'clear understanding of self' and own values, which starts from Plato. And that was particularly difficult when, instead of compensated narcissism in the ego ideal, he continued his life in the ideal ego.",

      "abstract": "The experience of emotion is a fundamental part of human conscious ness. Think, for example, of how different our conscious lives would be without such experiences as joy, anger, fear, disgust, pity, anxiety, and embarrassment. It is uncontroversial that these experiences typically have an intentional content. Anger, for example, is normally directed at someone or something. One may feel angry at one's stock broker for providing bad advice or angry with the cleaning lady for dropping the vase. But it is not uncontroversial that emotional experiences are always intentional. John Searle, for example, remarks, Many conscious states are not Intentional, e.g., a sudden sense of elation ... (1983, p. 2). Moreover, many animals experience emotions and it is natural to suppose that such emotions lack the sophistication of beliefs or thoughts. When a dog experiences delight in seeing its master after an absence of several days, the suggestion that at least part of the dog's experience of delight is a belief (or thought) that its master has returned home seems to import into the experience something that at best is associated with it and perhaps is not really a state to which the dog is subject at all. And even in the case of human beings, emotional experience often does not seem to involve thought. Consider the experience of disgust, to take one obvious example.' Nor is a salient belief required. One may have a strong fear of spiders and yet not believe that spiders typically pose any risk to humans. But if emotional experiences need not involve beliefs or thoughts, then just how are they intentional?2 Recent theories of consciousness have not devoted as much attention to the",

      "title": "You and I: Psycho-Spiritual Health and the Voice of Love",
      "abstract": "As therapists, we regularly observe the extent to which our patients are distanced from a voice of love or compassion toward themselves and others (e.g., inner good voice, benevolent superego, good internal object, spirit of love, God). We believe the extent to which one realizes an intimate relationship to this voice (through the tangible mediation of loving others) is the defining measure of psycho-spiritual health. As such, the curative power of “love” is grounded in a tangible relationship with a self-transcendent good that is not reducible to simply subjective experience, affect, behavior, or social interaction. To that end, the present paper aims to examine some individual, group, and collective psycho-spiritual health implications of a case wherein a patient experienced a moment of “spiritual perfection,” during which he felt “immersed in a self-transcendent spirit of love” that brought with it a sense of self-actualization. While the experience lasted, the patient reported a vivid sense that intentional wrongdoing harmed himself far more than others, and psycho-spiritual health was directly bound with loving others. Methodologically, we approach this case from both a multidisciplinary and psychologically integrative “phenomenological” viewpoint that may speak to our patients as well as to a more professional audience, with two primary goals in view: first, to define and demonstrate the importance of this “love,” and second, to elucidate the process by which individuals might operationalize and examine it in a reasoned, methodological, and testable fashion. Through this case, we hope to provide readers with an appreciation for the utility of such an experience and knowledge, in particular as it relates to overcoming issues related to addiction, freedom, and power that can enable us to become more and better than we are.",

In this personal reflection I explore how self-inflicted scars can have the same meaning as self-injury to control the self and act as self-expression, and how the marked female body can be a resistance to the cultural idea of femininity. I draw upon my own personal experiences of self-inflicted scars and how these scars have become intertwined with my identity. I have carved or burnt my body in different situations and from different moods in the past, but they are all with me at the present and will be with me in the future.

      "title": "The idealized “other”",
      "abstract": "The existing discourse on \"otherness\" approaches the concept and the process of \"\"othering\" as devaluing and alienating the \"other\" based on perceived differences for the purpose of saving the self and its intrinsic value or preserving a social order of domination and submission. The current chapterattempts to look at\"otherness\" from a different angle, namely, the need to idealize the other, even at the price of distorting reality, in order to preserve the self and its need for security. The chapterargues that our need for an idealized other, specifically, a caretaking parental figure, is so profound that if we do not experience nurturing figures in our \"real\" life relationships, we invent them in our minds or distort their real attributes. Because the most convenient way of heightening the feeling of safety is through the modification and control of perception, the real rejecting, abandoning, or unavailable mother or father isneglected in favor of a phantasmic, idealized one whose image iscolored by wish fulfillment—an omnipotent and omniscient figure who provides unconditional, everlasting care and gives comfort. We then become attached to these internal images that our fantasy created. To illustrate this thesis the chapterreviews the universal portrayal of maternal archetypes in Greco-Roman and Judeo-Christian myths depicting maternal feminine imagoes; as well as the concept of God in psychoanalytic literature. The Greek mythological images of Gaia, Rhea, and Demeter, as well as the Judeo portrayal of the Shechinah and the Christian characterization of the Virgin Mary are discussed in this context. The chapteralso draws from psychoanalytic and attachment theories to explain this phenomenon, particularly on Bowlby, Fairbairn, and Fromm. The discussion focuses on Fromm's suggestion that the everlasting longing to be cared for and protected like a young child is at the heart of personality organization. The pre-Oedipal attachment to the mother and the yearning for what he called \"paradisiacal bliss\"—a symbiotic relatedness to a loving mother who makes one feel safe and secure—is always threatening one's independent existence and is the cause of developmental arrests. Much of normal behavior, as well as many clinical phenomena, such as those observed in neurosis, psychosis, and addiction, can be understood as the ego's attempts to preserve a sense of safety. Mary Main's findings on idealized internal parental representation arealso be discussed in this context. Clinical and pop culture illustrations arebe elaborated upon as examples of this psychological phenomenon.",

      "abstract": "Willingly or not, humans, when in co-presence, continuously inform one another about their intentions, interests, feelings and ideas by means of visible bodily action. For example, it is through the orientation of the body and, especially, through the orientation of the eyes, that information is provided about the direction and nature of a person's attention. How people arrange their bodies and how they orient them and place them in relation to each other or to features in the environment, provides important information about how they are engaged with one another and about the nature of their intentions and attitudes. Activities in which objects in the environment are being manipulated, modified or rearranged, are indispensable for grasping a person's aims and goals and interests. Of equal importance, however, are actions that are seen to be purely expressive. Here we find those configurations of action in the face and body that appear as displays of feeling and emotion, as well as actions that often play a central role in the accomplishment of important moments in social interaction. Greeting, showing gratitude or affection, challenge, threat, submission, compliance, all are accomplished through a range of different expressive actions.",

Until finally fir`un fell from power because fir un lost the trust of his own people. Fir`un failed to communicate with the environment until fir un carried out a massacre in his own community and people and was afraid of a replacement. And if they do not communicate and deliberate properly and have extraordinary ambitions, then fir un eventually lost power, because they had persecuted their own people because they were too confident in power and played with extraordinary attitudes, then fir un's power was destroyed. Self-destruction at fir un is indirectly doing self-destruction, So good communication is being able to bring power to a more advanced and dignified direction. Poor communication can be fatal and devastating. So the conclusion in this scientific work is that the basis of the study of naturaltology is that the failure of fir un in receiving messages and communication has caused its own destruction. Penelitian ini menjelaskan tentang kegagalan Fir’un dalam komunikasi. Akibat gagal memahami komunikasi diri sendiri dan saat gagal komunikasi pada dirisendiri maka Firun telah hilang kekuasaan dan akibat sombongnya Fir’un  dan ingin memonopoli kekuasaan dan ingin kekal kehebatannya maka akhirnya kehancuran yang dirasakan oleh Fir’un, dan menganggap dirinya tuhan karena ingin meuguasai serta melakukan penganiaan terhadap orang lain termasuk orang yang ada disampingnya. Hingga akhirnya fir`un jatuh dari kekuasaan lantaran fir un hilang kepercayaan dari rakyatnya sendiri. Fir`un gagal komunikasi dengan lingkungan hingga fir un melakukan pembantaian dalam masyarakat dan rakyat nya sendiri dan takut adanya pengganti. Dan tidak melakukan komunikasi dan musyawarah dengan baik dan  ambisi yang luar biasa maka fir un akhiryna hilang kekuasaan, karena telah menganinya rakyatnya sendiri karena terlalu percaya diri dalam kekuasaan dan mempermainkan sikap extrim yang luar biasa maka kekuasaan fir un telah hancur. Kehancuran diri sendiri pada Fir’un secara tidak lansung adalah melakuakn kehancuran diri, Maka komunikasi yang baik adalah bisa membawa kekuasan kea rah yang lebih maju dan bermartabat.

      "title": "Knowledge, Skepticism, and the Individual",
      "abstract": "VERY BROADLY SPEAKING, it can be said that philosophers in the West have been concerned with a range of diverse problems bearing upon (1) the ultimate nature of the universe, multiverse, or totality of reality, in which man finds himself, whether he likes it or not, in some manner caught up and with respect to which he may regard himself a part, but perhaps a part apart from other parts; (2) the ultimate nature of man, that apparently paradoxical creature which, from one point of view, exists in the sense in which a tree or a stone exists, and which, from another point of view, exists, unlike any tree or stone, or so we would suppose, in such a way as to be capable of becoming aware of itself as an existing thing; and (3) the nature of the good life and the good society for man, man being the kind of creature that he is and caught up in the kind of universe, multiverse, or totality of reality in which he is apparently caught up. Although this tripartite division is arbitrary and, therefore, not imposed by the nature of logic or by the nature of things, most of the basic philosophical questions can be brought under one or another of these three generic problems. Epistemology, as a division of the field of philosophy, is concerned with man as a knowing or would-be knowing creature. If men did not wish to know, if men did not make cognitive claims of one kind or another, or if men were not aware of cognitive wishes or cognitive claims, then for philosophers there would be no epistemological problems. Not only do men exist, but men are capable of making cognitive claims, or so it would appear; and thus the epistemologist finds himself with a subject-matter. The epistemologist raises, with respect to this whole matter of actual or possible cognition, at least three fundamental questions: (1) Is human knowledge possible, or is what we call knowledge indistinguishable, in principle, from what we would otherwise call opinion, belief, or conviction? (2) If human knowledge is possible, what are its sources and by what marks, standards, criteria, or methods do we distinguish between what we call knowledge and what we do not or should not call knowledge?

      "title": "Introduction: Transgressions or, Beyond the Obvious",
      "abstract": "Introduction: Transgressions or, beyond the Obvious I Recognitions and MisrecognitionsTransgression: it is a common enough word, circulated enough for us all to believe we understand what is meant by it when it is used.Ideas about what constitutes transgression are equally commonplace.Transgression, we might say, goes without saying.Yet, is that in fact the case?Or is it not that we are so used to what we take to be the idea of transgression that we have, in all truth, forgotten, or not even become aware of the extent to which transgression constitutes our identities?Believing we understand the term as indicative of breaking a law, doing something illicit, disrupting order and rebelling against societal norms, if and when we think we transgress we do no more than conform to expectations of acceptable 'deviance'.We act up in a manner already in some sense prescribed, whether socially or historically, and so merely conform in a way that is more or less tolerated, even when excoriated.Transgression however runs much deeper than that.It is, as I shall argue in the present volume, not merely the breaking of a code, a rebellion against normative social or cultural constraints; rather it is the very pulse that constitutes our identities, and we would have no sense of our own subjectivity were it not for a constant, if discontinuous negotiation with the transgressive otherness by which we are formed and informed.Identity must needs believe in its own stability for the conventions of transgression to apply.However, 'for a subject to imagine itself as having a stable identity', remarks Elisabeth Bronfen, is always an act of misrecognition (mésconnaissance), a fiction, an illusion…'.She continues, 'though language allows for a differentiation between self and Other… this differentiation is never complete and the imaginary register never disappears … In a sense any image is the death because the negation of the thing, for it signifies that something was thought or recognised, not as real but as an image' (Elisabeth Bronfen 1992, 395) Seeing oneself as having a stable identity is, then, to misrecognize one's selfhood.It is to project an image and take that simulacrum as the reality, as Bronfen suggests.From this basis of misunderstanding or, to anticipate the next citation, from this 'mode of production' that generates the social structure we call the self, the subject or identity, it is an all too easy step to imagine the self negated, the subject beyond the law, situated, and situating itself, in a locus of negativity, opposition, and transgressive rebellion.This leads to the following question.'If', asks Julia Kristeva, ' in certain modes of production, social structure projects itself…by circumscribing a represented, assumed, encased negativity…how does this closed place function generally, logically, outside the … system?' (97).Kristeva's inscription of precise location, of an inside and an outside in the definition of proscribed or outlaw act or event is instructive.It comments on the coercive nature of modes of production that are shaped by historical, cultural and ideological forces, which are themselves not stable but which shift endlessly, in order that a 'social structure' such as the subject might be incorporated in the mode of production, (mis)recognised as a product of that mode, or otherwise placed outside, expelled or marginalised.Identifying illicit practice, determined as a negativity in relation to, and yet closed off from the social structure, Kristeva defines in part at least the transgressive subject produced as a historical subject and determined through the reading of a transgressive space or locus.Her description of spatial position, of clearly defined positions based on perceivable oppositions such as I have indicated, is far from uncommon in the thinking of transgressive events.However, as valuable a starting point as it may be, Kristeva's reading does not take into account sufficiently the endless differentiation implied in Elisabeth Bronfen's argument, and",

      "title": "Ecological Virtuous Selves: Towards a Non-Anthropocentric Environmental Virtue Ethic?",
      "abstract": "Existing predominant approaches within virtue ethics (VE) assume humans as the typical agent and virtues as dispositions that pertain primarily to human–human interpersonal relationships. Similarly, the main accounts in the more specific area of environmental virtue ethics (EVE) tend to support weak anthropocentric positions, in which virtues are understood as excellent dispositions of human agents. In addition, however, several EVE authors have also considered virtues that benefit non-human beings and entities (e.g., environmental or ecological virtues). The latter correspond to excellent character dispositions that would extend moral consideration and care for the benefit of non-human beings, entities, or entire ecosystems. In this direction, a few authors have argued that EVE could be considered non-anthropocentric insofar as it could: (a) promote non-human ends, well-being, and the flourishing of non-human beings and entities; (b) involve significant relations to non-humans. Drawing from different traditions, including ecofeminism and care ethics, we argue for a broader notion of self and a decentered notion of virtues. The broader notion of selfhood corresponds to the “ecological self”, one that can be enacted by both human and non-human beings, is embedded in a network of relations, and recognizes the more-than-human world as fundamental and yet indispensable otherness. We suggest that this broader notion of agency allows for an expansive understanding of virtues that includes a-moral functional ecological virtues, which can be exercised not only by humans but also by certain non-human beings. This alternative understanding of selfhood and ecological virtues within EVE could have several theoretical and practical implications, some of which may enable different types of agencies and transform collective action.",

      "title": "Flaubert and Emma Bovary: The Hazards of Literary Fusion",
      "abstract": "Romantic love has been one of our most effective myths for making sense out of our sensations. It organizes bodily intensities around a single object of desire and it provides a more or less public theater for the enactment of the body's most private life. In love, desires and sensations are both structured and socialized. The loved one invests the world with a hierarchy of desirability. At last we have a measure of value, and even the unhappiest lover can enjoy the luxury of judging (and controlling) his experience according to the distance at which it places him from the loved one's image or presence. Passion also makes us intelligible to others. Observers may be baffled as to why we love this person rather than that one, but such mysteries are perhaps more than compensated for by the exceptional visibility in which the passionate pursuit of another person places the otherwise secret formulas of individual desire. Love is desire made visible, but it is also desire made somewhat abstract. We do not yearn merely for sensations in romantic desire; we seek the more complex satisfaction of another desiring presence. To desire persons rather than sensations is to indicate a certain predominance of mind over body. The sublime-sublimating nature of love is clearly enough pointed to by the notable fact that, as we see in Racine, even the most obsessive sexual passion can be adequately described with practically no references to the body. Indeed, the more obsessive the passion, the more insignificant the body may become; sexual fascination steals some of the body's vitality, and therefore partly dissipates physical energies. Love, like art, is a cosa mentale; like art, it systematizes, communicates and dilutes the fragmented intensities of our senses. But this is of course too one-sided. Even in passions as diagrammatic as those of Racine's protagonists, the diagram itself is initiated by a traumatic encounter with another body (Je le vis, je rougis, je palis a' sa vue, Phedre says of her first meeting with Hippolyte). And, even more decisively, the rich verbal designs which express the Racinian lover's passion never divert him from the single purpose of possessing another body. An abstract psychology of mental states constantly refers to an impossible and indescribable meeting of bodies. The dream of certain happy sensations sustains all speech, while the realization of that dream would be the end of speech. In its continuous allusiveness to both sensation and thought, love once again reminds us of art. They are both pursuits of sensual intensities through activities of sublimation. Love, then, can be considered as an ideal subject for literature; it is the",

      "abstract": "As a species, we are prone to share, help, and cooperate with each other, especially in our families and their extensions to the group we consider “like us.” We are equipped with a humanitarian impulse – when someone is in distress, we want to come to their aid. Slowly, the circle of compassion, to use Einstein’s wonderful term, has widened and until now it is globe-encompassing. With our technologically-enhanced capacity to know what is happening in Bhutan or New Orleans and our enhanced ability to respond, we, or at least some of us, want to share, help, and relieve distress all over the world.\r\n\r\nWe have moved even further, and decided that these are not optional charitable impulses, but duties, and that those with insufficient resources or security and those in distress from natural or man-made disaster have a right to receive help. People have a right to development (a share of resources at least to levels of sufficiency) (1), in particular a right to health (2), a right to peace (to live without being attacked, oppressed or exploited) (3), and to humanitarian assistance (4), although this last is incompletely institutionalized in international law.\r\n\r\nThis is one of the most wonderful aspects of humanity, and we are deeply inspired by those who enact such giving. However, we must attend to problems that arise in giving across distances and to people who are not like us, problems such as an assumption of superiority of the giver over the recipient, especially if reciprocity is thought to be unlikely (this can be seen even in families); an assumption by the giver of no reciprocity if the recipient is materially poor; erroneous assumptions about what is wanted or needed, with inadequate consultation with the recipient about this; cultural blindness (unawareness that cultural differences between giver and recipient will determine a great deal about the meaning of actions and words); unawareness that changes to (possibly volatile) social, political, or economic dynamics may entrain negative consequences, especially in a situation of resource poverty and conflict (5); and problems with people in any situation handling large-scale resources with insufficient accountability.\r\n\r\nMary Anderson has carefully researched situations where poorly informed projects intended to help have actually harmed the recipients. Her famous “Do No Harm” (5) is required reading for all who would try to help.\r\n\r\nKen Bush has developed the now much-used Peace and Conflict Impact Assessment (PCIA) for enhancing the sensitivity of project workers working in conflict situations (6,7). This process, which is intended to be used before, during, and after a project, structures an examination of the risks and opportunities presented by the conflictual context on the project, and then an examination of the impact of the project on the conflict. Based on an analysis of the conflict, the project team, which is expected to include local people, examines the potential impact of the project on the following areas: (a) conflict management capacities of individuals, groups or the state; (b) militarized violence and human security; (c) political structures and good governance in both state and civil society, including structures of accountability and strengthening of human rights measures; (d) economic structures and processes, such as whether the project counters or strengthens a war economy, increases or decreases dependence on the military for employment; and (e) social empowerment, such as impact on gender equity.\r\n\r\nBush gives detailed examples of positive and negative impacts in all of these areas and emphasizes the potential of development projects to enhance peace. It is coming to be considered a necessary element of good practice for those working in conflict zones to incorporate a “conflict-sensitive approach” (8).\r\n\r\nAnne Birouste and Anthony Zwi at University of New South Wales School of Community Medicine and Public Health have worked on a tool more specifically for Peace through Health projects. It is, for now, called the Health and Peacebuilding Filter (9), and is intended to call to mind for the donor, project worker, or recipient all the necessary dimensions of a project based on compassion and deep respect for all involved, together with acknowledgment of the complexity of the context of such projects.\r\n\r\nThe “filter” attends to five broad dimensions needed for an excellent project. These dimensions are cultural sensitivity, conflict sensitivity, social justice, social cohesion, and good governance.",

      "abstract": "Much has been said and written on loneliness, which is a common human phenomenon that belongs to everyday existence, but few attempts have been made to capture the phenomenon and its existential meaning without reducing its complexity. This paper addresses the question: What is loneliness, what is its essence? The study practiced a phenomenological approach, called Reflective Lifeworld Research. Twenty-six interviews were analysed for meaning with the aim of describing an essential structure for the phenomenon, showing what loneliness is. The analysis shows that the phenomenon of loneliness stands out in meaning as figure against a background of fellowship, connectedness and context. One is lonely when important others are not there, because either one has rejected them or they have chosen to be rejected and left the person behind, feeling lonely. One can reject others in favour of another kind of connectedness. Such loneliness is restful and pleasant. It involves the lack of tangible context that other present people can offer, yet a context is not missing*in this instance there is a relationship to and one is part of something else such as nature or animal fellowship. Involuntary loneliness on the other hand involves a lack of context and connectedness. To be involuntarily lonely and not belonging to anyone is to lack participation in the world. To not be. Loneliness as a phenomenon is further characterized as transcending the present situation containing loneliness. One can feel lonely even if there are many people around, or one can be completely alone without feeling lonely. Loneliness can disappear with a sense of belonging, when one connects with someone who is miles away. Key words: loneliness, phenomenology, lifeworld, Reflective Lifeworld Research",

The difference between reductionistic and nonreductionistic theories is the difference between a self who is created by awareness and behavior and a self who becomes aware and creates behavior. Most theories of personality argue on one side or the other. There are also theories which simply ignore the argument and use the term “self” vaguely.

      "title": "THE ROLE OF SPIRITUAL POWER IN HUMAN HEALTH",
      "abstract": "पMedicine, and healthcare have been related in one way or another in all population groups since the beginning of recorded history. Only in recent times have these systems of healing been separated. One of the challenges physicians face is to help people find meaning and acceptance in the midst of suffering and chronic illness. Spirituality is the person’s inner truth or blissful experience. For many, spirituality takes the form of religious observance, prayer, meditation or a belief in a higher power. For others, it can be found in nature, music, art or a secular community. Spirituality is different for everyone. Through spiritual pursuit, a person tries to connect with a supreme divine or what most people call almighty God. Such people resort to techniques like silence, prayer, meditation and yoga mostly as individual or collective practice, usually under the directions of a spiritual Guru. Others believe in the self-less service to the mankind as a major pathway for seeking god. They adore ‘goodness’ to see God.",

According to the Buddha, everything lacks inherent existence, because all things arise in dependence on impermanent causes and conditions.Anicca/Anitya: Terms for the first of the “Three Marks” of existence according to the teachings of the historical Buddha, they mean “impermanence.” Impermanence refers to the coming to be, and passing away of all conditioned phenomena, whether physical or psychological, that interdependently arises.Puggalavadins/Pudgalavadins: Pali and Sanskrit terms for “Personalists,” or those who think the puggala/pudgala or “person” exists as a subsistent entity.Sarvastivadins: Sanskrit term for those who think that “everything exists” in the past, present, and future simultaneously.Sautrantikas: Sanskrit term for those who reject the authority of the Abhidhamma Pitaka and instead are “followers of the Suttas.”Sunnatta/Sunyata: Pali and Sanskrit terms meaning “emptiness” or “nothingness,” these terms usually refer to the Mahayana interpretations of interdependent arising and the original state of mind, even though there is good evidence for an early Mainstream Buddhist understanding that involves the metaphysical structure of the human person.

      "title": "Transcending the human",
      "abstract": "The processes of hyper-modernization are moving in the direction of transcending all limitations of the human person, based on the supposition that the latter is deemed to be too weak, fragile, and perishable. The human/non-human distinction is blurred in every direction, in order to reach a higher evolutionary stage (a theory of technological singularity). Donati debates these trends and claims that the transcendence of the human does not lie in an enhanced individual, nor in human-like technologies, but primarily in the interpersonal relationships considered within a context of social networks, and not in isolation. What is distinctive of the human is its proper and unique relational nature, both as constitution and activities, which is not replaceable by any other natural, artificial or hybrid entity. The distinction human/non-human is a transcendental relation that contains an enigma. It can be seen only in a framework that recognizes the inter-dependent and inter-penetrating nature of the relations between all levels/layers of reality. It concerns both the personal body/mind relationship and the agential causal powers necessary to generate relational goods. In the end, the human transcends itself in its original internal as well as external relationality, whose emergent effect is a real 'third' that has no functional substitutes or equivalents.",

Children begin to understand that they can see their intentions as representational, as relative, as things that belong to them personally and not as the only truth (for example, a belief). They can think about thinking; they have developed a theory of mind. The child organises memories of his acts and experiences, thus creating an autobiographical self.

If one acts so as to achieve the object of an irrational desire, one needs a reason for acting in that way in order for one’s actions to count as rational. However, people usually have reasons for acting in these ways, and if the reason is adequate the action is no longer irrational. Reasons for acting are conscious rational beliefs that can make some otherwise irrational actions, rationa/.1 The belief that having one’s right arm cut off will save one’s life is a reason for having one’s arm cut off. In the discussion of irrational desires, several of these kinds of beliefs were mentioned. Beliefs that one’s action will decrease one’s own or anyone else’s chances of dying, of suffering pain, or of losing some ability, freedom, or pleasure count as reasons. These beliefs are reasons because they can sometimes make acting to achieve the object of an irrational desire rational. Other reasons are beliefs that one’s action will maintain or increase one’s own or anyone else’s consciousness, abilities, freedom, or pleasure. These beliefs can also make some otherwise irrational actions rational.",

      "title": "From Conflict to Mutual Recognition",
      "abstract": "Abstract This document exposes the conflict from the Post-Rational cognitive perspective, understanding the conflict as a relational phenomenon, which emerges when the need of recognition is exposed to its contrary: the non-recognition. “To know oneself” means in fact, to recognize oneself through the mediation of the other (Castiglioni, 2008). An individual develops himself by recognizing the “otherness” that constitutes him. The self (idem/identity) that goes out toward the other and then returns as ipse/selfhood, having acquired self-awareness through the other (Ricoeur, 1993). For this reason, recognition is a fundamental element in the building of human subjectivity (Honneth 1997). Identity is a continuous process that lasts a lifetime. It contains a central nucleus that ensures continuity by which a person is able to recognize him/ herself. In this way individuals learn to define who they are through interactions with others, especially those whom are more significant. Being recognized by others and by the environment offer the individual a sense of unity and coherence about himself. Conflict arises when the other or the environment becomes a threat to the survival of the subjectivity; when the absence or lack of recognition leads to harm in a person (Tello, 2011). Relational experiences are able to engender and ensure recognition, while holding onto an indispensable acceptance of individual differences. They thus allow each one to bring forth their own unique identity.",

The highest point of this life was life of love. The secret of attachment of value to this term \"Love\" should be searched in this fact.

      "title": "Human Suffering as a Challenge for the Meaning of Life",
      "abstract": "When people suffer they always suffer as a whole human being. The emotional, cognitive and spiritual suffering of human beings cannot be completely separated from all other kinds of suffering, such as from harmful natural, ecological, political, economic and social conditions. In reality they interact with each other and influence each other. Human beings do not only suffer from somatic illnesses, physical pain, and the lack of decent opportunities to satisfy their basic vital, social and emotional needs. They also suffer when they are not able to experience and grasp any meaning of life even if such suffering is not quite as obvious as most forms of physical, social and emotional suffering. Suffering from the lack for the sense of the meaning of life is a special form of emotional, cognitive, and spiritual suffering. Although all human beings share the same basic human need for some meaning of life, the fulfilment of this need is highly individual and personal. Although all forms of human suffering can be a challenge to the meaning of life, the personal conditions of suffering usually are a stronger challenge for the meaning of life. Among the personal conditions of human suffering, the Grenzsituationen cannot be cancelled or raised at all, but only accepted and coped with as existential aspects of the conditio humana. According to Karl Jaspers these are: death, suffering, struggling, guilt, and failing. The challenge for human beings to cope with these Grenzsituationen is a way to move from the mere Being-there to true human Existence. 1",

      "abstract": "It must not be supposed, that, in the remarks I have made in my foregoing Discourse on the organic character (if I may use so strong a word in want of a better) of the various branches of Knowledge, viewed together, that I have been merely pointing out a peculiarity, which we may recognise or not at our pleasure; and that, on the ground, for instance, that a System of knowledge is more beautiful intellectually, or more serviceable in practice, true though this may be, than a confused litter of facts, or a heap of observations or rules. On the contrary, I assumed the fact of a System, and went on to point out some of the consequences which it involved. I assume, not only as incontrovertible, but as more or less confessed by all men, that the various sciences, which occupy the field of Knowledge, have, not mutual relations only, but run towards and into each other, and converge and approximate to a philosophical whole, whether we will or no:—so active is the sympathy which exists between them, so ready is the human mind to recognise, nay so impatient to anticipate, the Principle of System in all matters whatever, even at the risk of investing with laws and moulding into one, materials too scanty or too detached to sustain the process. Nor is it any unmixed compliment to the intellect thus to speak of its love of systematising; it is obliged to view its various creations all together from their very incompleteness separately.",

      "title": "Learning and decision-making in artificial animals",
      "abstract": "Abstract A computational model for artificial animals (animats) interacting with real or artificial ecosystems is presented. All animats use the same mechanisms for learning and decisionmaking. Each animat has its own set of needs and its own memory structure that undergoes continuous development and constitutes the basis for decision-making. The decision-making mechanism aims at keeping the needs of the animat as satisfied as possible for as long as possible. Reward and punishment are defined in terms of changes to the level of need satisfaction. The learning mechanisms are driven by prediction error relating to reward and punishment and are of two kinds: multi-objective local Q-learning and structural learning that alter the architecture of the memory structures by adding and removing nodes. The animat model has the following key properties: (1) autonomy: it operates in a fully automatic fashion, without any need for interaction with human engineers. In particular, it does not depend on human engineers to provide goals, tasks, or seed knowledge. Still, it can operate either with or without human interaction; (2) generality: it uses the same learning and decision-making mechanisms in all environments, e.g. desert environments and forest environments and for all animats, e.g. frog animats and bee animats; and (3) adequacy: it is able to learn basic forms of animal skills such as eating, drinking, locomotion, and navigation. Eight experiments are presented. The results obtained indicate that (i) dynamic memory structures are strictly more powerful than static; (ii) it is possible to use a fixed generic design to model basic cognitive processes of a wide range of animals and environments; and (iii) the animat framework enables a uniform and gradual approach to AGI, by successively taking on more challenging problems in the form of broader and more complex classes of environments",

      "abstract": "Abstract This chapter begins with a search for a praiseworthy trait in the realm of sensitivity and attention to others’ suffering, a trait that ought to lie somewhere between the poles of indifference and anguish (and that those who are confident that there is such a praiseworthy trait tend to call “compassion”). Because of the very enormity of unjust suffering in the world, every possible level of sensitivity and attention to others’ suffering is at once too indifferent (for one always turns one’s back on so many) and too anguished (by the pain of those to whom one does attend). Even if one can determine a “best” disposition to have and make the right decisions regarding which actions to take in the face of all this suffering, one still leaves strong moral demands unsatisfied. The resultant moral remainder (in the form of regret and guilt at what one cannot do) burdens the moral agent, and what one can successfully do in the way of being attuned to others’ suffering is burdensome too, for such sensitivity, even in moderation, is intrinsically painful. Thus even the best possible trait to have turns out to be a “burdened virtue.”",

      "abstract": "The term \"complementary medicine\" or \"alternative medicine\" refers to a broad set of health care practices that are not part of that country's own tradition or conventional medicine and are not fully integrated into the dominant health care system.[1] Ruqyah (plural: ruqa), an example of complementary medicine treatments, derives from the past tense verb raqa. It consists of words said or written in the form of dua or dhikr for the purpose of protection or cure. It is sometimes accompanied by other actions, such as blowing or wiping over the thing which it is applied to. \"It should be done by reciting the words of Allah, may He be exalted, or His names and attributes, and in Arabic or in a language the meaning of which is understood, and with the belief that ruqyah has no effect in and of itself; rather it is only effective by the will of Allah, may He be exalted.\"[2] Ruqyah practice can improve one's calmness, spiritual quality, and happiness, as a characteristic of an individual's mental health. Ruqyah practices are an effort to restore human nature (fitrah) that has inner peace and happiness.[3] The Quran says, \"Without doubt in the remembrance of Allah do hearts find satisfaction.\"[4] Herein, we presented the use of ruqyah as shifa (cure) in patients with neuropsychiatric disorders to draw attention to the importance of ruqyah applications in clinical practice.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The overall premise of this concluding chapter is that human relations can never be stable. Whether they are biologically or socially structured (usually these categories overlap), relations require nurturing, care, and attention. They also require uncertainty, the potential to fail, as well as loneliness and longing. Discussing utterances and tactical use of kinship terminology, personal names, and nicknames, this chapter discusses how relations in Illorsuit (pseudonym) continually re-invoked and negotiated. Some relatives may cease to address each other using appropriate kinship terminology; sometimes out of spite, other times out of respect. Others may long for the return of a dead ancestor so much that they end up willing their return, while others are content with the sporadic moments in which their dead relatives make themselves known in young children. Either way, an ideal model of kinship in Illorsuit (pseudonym), must be able to accommodate for the un-ideal and the instability and uncertainty inherent in human relationships. The chapter finally draws on the Figure-Ground reversal as one such model, arguing that ideal kinship in Greenland is simultaneously figure and ground, that is, relatedness and loneliness at the same time.",

      "title": "Defining One's Own Concept of Existence and the Meaning of the Universe: The Presumption of Liberty in Lawrence v. Texas",
      "abstract": "The only freedom which deserves the name is that of pursuing our own good, in our own way, so long as we do not attempt deprive others of theirs, or impede their efforts obtain it. Each is the proper guardian of his own health, whether bodily, or mental and spiritual. Mankind are greater gainers by suffering each other live as seems good themselves, than by compelling each live as seems good the rest. . . .1 Liberty protects the person from unwarranted government intrusions into a dwelling or other private places. In our tradition the State is not omnipresent in the home. And there are other spheres of our lives and existence, outside the home, where the State should not be a dominant presence. Freedom extends beyond spatial bounds. Liberty presumes an autonomy of self that includes freedom of thought, belief, expression, and certain intimate conduct. The instant case involves liberty of the person both in its spatial and more transcendent dimensions.2 I. INTRODUCTION The U.S. Supreme Court's decision in Lawrence v. Texas,3 the landmark 2003 ruling overturning a Texas statute criminalizing homosexual sodomy, strikes at the very heart of a debate that has been raging in academic and political circles ever since the Court's revival of substantive due process in Griswold v. Connecticut.4 The crux of the debate focuses on a question primal political theory: if an expansive understanding is be given the right of the individual to define one's own concept of existence, of meaning, of the universe, and of the mystery of human life,5 what legitimate role is left for the state declare moral limitations upon the definitions individuals choose? This note argues that Lawrence stands for a presumption of liberty protecting the private acts of individuals under the Due Process Clause. Simply put, this means that if the government fails show that its restrictions on individual exercises of liberty are not necessary and proper regulations of behavior harmful others, the mere claim that the government is upholding morality grounded in history or traditions should not justify such restrictions on liberty. This reading of Lawrence recognizes the Court's decision both as a victory for a more sound adjudication of substantive due process claims and as an accurate understanding of the libertarian underpinnings of American constitutionalism. Far from the fears of the dissent, Lawrence does not signal the end of morality in the law, but rather it recasts morality in terms that are palatable both contemporary intuitions of what liberty means and a classical understanding of the role of the individual in liberal democracy. In the final analysis, Lawrence is best seen as a substantial victory for the right of all Americans define their own concepts of meaning and value in matters fundamental how individuals constitute their very existence. Part II of this note gives an overview of the Court's substantive due process jurisprudence in order give context Lawrence's potential reach beyond sexual autonomy cases. Part III analyzes the Court's opinion in Lawrence, focusing on Justice Anthony Kennedy's majority opinion and Justice Antonin Scalia's dissenting opinion. Part IV offers a particular interpretation of the majority opinion, arguing that Lawrence is nothing less than a watershed moment both for a renewed soundness in constitutional jurisprudence, and for the revival of libertarian values that have far too long been ignored by the Court. This part argues that Lawrence can and should be read as ushering in a presumption of liberty in subsequent cases brought before the Court. This part also offers a rejoinder the principal arguments of Justice Scalia's dissent, relying on the writings of Joel Feinberg argue that Scalia's most sweeping claims are misplaced or incorrect because they fail grasp the proper limits of legal moralism. Part V offers a short conclusion. …",

One of the passengers standing is a woman in her thirties holding two relatively full shopping bags. John is not particularly paying attention to the woman, but he is cognizant of her. Joan, by contrast, is distinctly aware that the woman is uncomfortable … John, let us say, often fails to take in people's discomfort, whereas Joan is characteristically sensitive to such discomfort. It is thus in character for the discomfort to be salient for Joan but not for John. That is to say, a morally significant aspect of situations facing John characteristically fails to be salient for him, and this is a defect of his character – not a very serious moral defect, but a defect nevertheless. John misses something of the moral reality confronting him … John's failure to act stems from his failure to see (with the appropriate salience), not from callousness about other people's discomfort. His deficiency is a situational self-absorption or attentional laziness.",

      "title": "Personhood",
      "abstract": "Abstract Legal personhood is distinct from and dependent on ordinary understandings of what it means to be a human person. Yet not every human being is a person (slaves are not, for example), and there are some non-human entities (such as corporations) which are. The legal category of the person is thus at once continuous and discontinuous with that of the natural person, designating a subject of rights and duties along a spectrum from full to very partial personhood. Moreover, the mode of being of natural persons is by no means self-evident, because the status of the “natural” person is itself constituted by a juridical demarcation of the boundaries of embodied human being and by distinct institutional and practical conditions of constitution, and natural persons are not necessarily coextensive with their bodies. While Western models of personhood are based on the coherence and continuity of the self as rational or ethical substance, quite different ways of understanding personhood are found in other cultures, where persons may be taken to be the sum of their social relations or of the exchange of substances between their bodies and the rest of the social and material world. Similarly, in most cultures persons are constituted by their relation to the generations of the dead from whom they inherit, to the gods, and to the unborn descendants to whom property and some of the components of kinship (a name, a status, a genetic inheritance) are to be passed on.",

      "abstract": "1). Tabuh Pategak\r\n\r\n Marajaya berpendapat, bahwa pertunjukan Wayang Kulit Bali pada umumnya dimulai dengan tabuh pategak atau pembukaan. Tabuh ini mempunyai tujuan untuk menarik perhatian penonton agar terkonsentrasi pada jalannya pertunjukan.Tabuh pembukaan atau pategak ini dapat juga ditemukan pada pertunjukan-pertunjukan seni teater lainnya seperti: Drama Gong, Prembon, Arja, Wayang Wong, Janger, Joged Bumbung dan lain sebagainya. Pada tabuh pategak pertama selesai, sang dalangpun naik ke panggung tempat pertunjukan, dan tabuh pategak ke dua dilanjutkan oleh panabuh. Tabuh pategak ke dua mulai, sang dalang duduk mengukur jarak kelir dengan blencong menggunakan ujung jari tangan, setelah merasa sudah cukup, dilanjutkan dengan makan daun sirih (nginang) dari ujung daun sirih dengan ucapan mantra: Pukulun Sanghyang Tunggal amasanga guna kasmaran, buta asih, liak asih, janma manusa asih, Dewa Batara asih, teka patuh ingkup, teka asih 3x. Ong antara, pantara, patara, sarwa sih manembah alila sudha ya namah, Ang Ah.

Dalam pertunjukan Wayang kulit Bali, tabuh pategak dilanjutkan dengan tabuh pamungkah.\r\n\r\n2). Tabuh Pamungkah\r\n\r\n Dalang melakukan langkah-langkah seperti: nebah keropak yaitu tutup keropak ditepuk dengan telapak tangan kiri, disertai dengan ucapan mantra: Atangi Sanghyang Samirana angringgit amolah cara. Dalang membukanya tutup keropak ditaruh di sebelah kanan dalang sekaligus digunakan alas wayang yang akan sering dipakai di dalam pertunjukan. Dalang mengambil ke dua pamurtian, yang kanan dipegang dengan tangan kanan, dan yang kiri dipegang dengan tangan tangan kiri, dengan mengucapkan mantra: Pukulun Sanghyang Tiga Wisesa amasang guna pangeger. Kemudian pamurtian diserahkan kepada pembantu dalang (katengkong) di kanan untuk ditancapkan di ujung layar (kelir) sebelah kanan, pamurtian kiri diserahkan kepada pembantu dalang (katengkong) di kiri untuk ditancapkan di ujung kelir sebelah kiri. Dalang mengambil alat pemukul keropak (cepala) yang dipasang (dijepit) dengan telunjuk dan jari tengah tangan sebelah kiri. Setelah sang dalang siap, kemudian memberikan aksen dengan satu ketokan keras (tak), maka tabuhpun mulai nguncab, pemukulan keropak disesuaikan dengan tabuh gamelan (mecandetan). Kemudian sang dalang mengambil kayonan ditempel di siwadwara di bagian belakang blencong dengan mengucapkan mantra: Om Sanghyang Sambhu mulih ring Wisnu, Sangkara mulih ring Mahadewa, Ludra mulih ring Brahma, Mahesora mulih ring Iswara meraga Sanghyang Tunggal, mawak gni, tangan gni, rambut gni, melidah aku mirah, asing cepolang aku bentar, teka mandi 3x, teg nyer 3x",

Everyone assumes that a person's beliefs may be, to some extent, ascertained by seeing how he acts: for we suppose that he will do the things which he believes will fulfil his wishes, and avoid doing what he thinks will frustrate them. Similarly, his desires may, to some extent, be ascertained by seeing how he acts; for if we know what he thinks about the results of his actions, we suppose that the expected results are desired or not disliked and those believed unlikely are disliked or undesired. We have three variables, conduct, desire, and belief; and we suppose that there is some equation by which the first in conjunction with one of the others implies a determinate value of the third. In principle, it should be equally possible to deduce conduct from belief and desire. But that seems of less metaphysical interest, because we think of actions as open to observation in a straightforward way, whereas we are more dubious about beliefs and desires.",

She exhibits autonomy of choice in a particular decision-making situation only if she is unhindered from without in the exercise of these capacities. She is fully autonomous if, once the decision is made, she is proficient at its enactment. Proficiency is constituted by power or token ability, a combination of positive and negative freedom. An agent may possess virtually full autonomy within a certain sphere if all the deliberations in that sphere result in autonomous decisions to perform certain actions which the agent is proficient at executing and which are relatively easy to perform – actions that do not demand heroic effort or the thwarting of contrary powerful impulses, moods, or general tendencies. The scope of autonomy of such an agent may or may not be extensive, depending upon the character of the items within this sphere.

      "title": "Personal Reactive Attitudes and Partial Responses to Others",
      "abstract": "This paper argues for a new understanding of Strawson’s distinction between personal, impersonal, and self-reactive attitudes. Many Strawsonians take these basic reactive attitude types to be distinguished by two factors. Is it the self or another who is treated with good- or ill-will? And is it the self or another who displays good- or ill-will? On this picture, when someone else wrongs me, my reactive attitude is personal; when someone else wrongs someone else, my reactive attitude is impersonal; and when I wrong someone else, my attitude is self-reactive. Against this account, I argue that the basic reactive attitude types are better distinguished according to whether they express partial or impartial concern. This fits Strawson’s discussion in “Freedom and Resentment”, and it allows us to see an important point that the alternative approach obscures. Namely, while attitudes like resentment, gratitude, shame, and pride can arise as responses to our own treatment and behavior, they can also arise as third-party responses to the treatment and behavior of our family members, romantic partners, and close friends. Similarly, attitudes like moral indignation and disapprobation also have a wider scope than is often acknowledged; they can arise as responses to others’ treatment, but they can also arise as responses to our own treatment when we react impartially to circumstances involving ourselves.",

      "title": "Too Cute for Words: Cuteness Evokes the Heartwarming Emotion of Kama Muta",
      "abstract": "A configuration of infantile attributes including a large head, large eyes, with a small nose and mouth low on the head comprise the visual baby schema or Kindchenschema that English speakers call \"cute.\" In contrast to the stimulus gestalt that evokes it, the evoked emotional response to cuteness has been little studied, perhaps because the emotion has no specific name in English, Norwegian, or German. We hypothesize that cuteness typically evokes kama muta, a social-relational emotion that in other contexts is often labeled in English as being moved or touched, heartwarming, nostalgia, patriotic feeling, being touched by the Spirit, the feels, etcetera. What evokes kama muta is sudden intensification of a communal sharing (CS) relationship, either CS between the person and another, or CS between observed others. In accord with kama muta theory, we hypothesize that a kama muta response to cuteness results from a sudden feeling of CS with the cute target. In colloquial terms, the perceiver adores the cute kittens and their heart goes out to them. When a person perceives cute targets interacting affectionately - that is, intensifying CS between them - this should strengthen a kama muta response. We experimentally investigated these predictions in two studies (N = 356). Study 1 revealed that videos of cute targets evoked significantly more kama muta than videos of targets that were not particularly cute. Study 2, pre-registered, found that, as hypothesized, when cute targets interacted affectionately they evoked more kama muta and were humanized more than when they were not interacting. We measured the level of kama muta by self-reports of sensations and signs and of feelings labeled heartwarming, being moved, and being touched. Participants' ratings of kama muta were positively correlated with reported cuteness. In addition, as in our previous research on kama muta elicited by other types of stimuli, trait empathic concern predicted kama muta responses and perceived cuteness. The studies thus provide first evidence that cute stimuli evoke the heartwarming emotion of kama muta.",

      "abstract": "Human being is not perfect by nature so he is also not perfect in his desires and decisions. Human being has a priority in each decision in his favor. In such priorities, human being commits harm and cause loss to others to accomplish the desires and dreams to be true. By doing so, he commits such acts due to intention, negligence or unintentional acts which cause loss to others. Such acts, sometimes, amount to the loss of life of other person. The act done with full consciousness intention and preparation, then it is called Amd in Islamic jurisprudent and Shariah and other acts; done unintentional, are called Khata or Bis-sabab (unintentional act or by reasons of something else). In either cases; intentional or unintentional acts, the loss should be compensated. Islam has formulated such rules derived from the Holy Quran and Sunnah of the Holy Prophet (peace be upon him). In case of loss of life, limb or loss of effective activity of a limb or more (injuries to human body), the Shariah has ordained rules which include Qisas (retribution), Diyat( blood money) and AFW (forgiveness by victim or heirs of victim). These rules are exceptions to general rules and are blessings of Allah (SWT) as mentioned in the Holy Quran that : O ye who believe! The law of equality is prescribed to you in cases of murder the free for the free, the slave for the slave, the woman for the woman. But if any remission is made by the brother of the slain, then grant any reasonable demand and compensate him with handsome gratitude, this is a concession and a mercy from your Lord. After this whoever exceeds the limits shall be in grave penalty . It is because of the previous nations as Bani Israil (Jews) and Nasara (Christians) were not bestowed such remissions simultaneously in case of offence of injuries and murders. Bani Israil (Jews) were ordered Qisas only but no Diyat or Afw whereas Nasara (Christians) were given permission of Afw only but no Qisas or Diyat. As compared to them Muslims were given three possibilities in case of loss of others so that the enmity and grudge may be settled down between parties amicably or by way of Qisas . These rules have been proved to be a source of stability in the Muslim society. Qisas and Diyat laws introduced in Pakistani legal system and certain amendments were introduced in the penal and procedural laws and rules were framed for the said purpose. The Islamic concept of security to the human being is far lasting and is secured in each and every manner. Concept of Aqilahh is one of those securities provided in Islamic law. The loss of human being should not go vain in any manner whatsoever.",

      "title": "Do Apes Read Minds?",
      "abstract": "An argument that as folk psychologists humans (and perhaps other animals) don't so much read minds as see one another as persons with traits, emotions, and social relations. By adulthood, most of us have become experts in human behavior, able to make sense of the myriad behaviors we find in environments ranging from the family home to the local mall and beyond. In philosophy of mind, our understanding of others has been largely explained in terms of knowing others' beliefs and desires; describing others' behavior in these terms is the core of what is known as folk psychology. In Do Apes Read Minds? Kristin Andrews challenges this view of folk psychology, arguing that we don't consider others' beliefs and desires when predicting most quotidian behavior, and that our explanations in these terms are often inaccurate or unhelpful. Rather than mindreading, or understanding others as receptacles for propositional attitudes, Andrews claims that folk psychologists see others first as whole persons with traits, emotions, and social relations. Drawing on research in developmental psychology, social psychology, and animal cognition, Andrews argues for a pluralistic folk psychology that employs different kinds of practices (including prediction, explanation, and justification) and different kinds of cognitive tools (including personality trait attribution, stereotype activation, inductive reasoning about past behavior, and generalization from self) that are involved in our folk psychological practices. According to this understanding of folk psychology—which does not require the sophisticated cognitive machinery of second-order metacognition associated with having a theory of mind—animals (including the other great apes) may be folk psychologists, too.",

      "abstract": "Does knowledge of other people’s minds grow from concrete experience to abstract concepts? Classic research from developmental science suggests that before infants reach for objects, they do not see others’ reaches as intentional. Here, we test an alternative hypothesis: that young infants view reaching as undertaken for a purpose, but they are open-minded about the specific goals people tend to pursue. In three experiments (n = 68), we show that 3-month-old infants, who cannot reach for objects, learn to attribute both object goals and spatial goals to other people, after seeing them reach for the same object regardless of where it is, or to the same location regardless of what is there. Thus, before infants have learned to reach and manipulate themselves, they already understand that intentional agents’ actions are motivated by enduring goals. This understanding may support infants’ rational learning about other minds.",

However, he also addresses the cultural and historic forms of validity based on the perspectives of his own interests, reasons and wishes, ambitions, religious and ideological commitments. In this sense, not only does the social world constitute the main scene of our actions but also the locus of resistance. These days of highly social complexity and growing cultural interaction mobilize different identification and differentiation processes. In extraordinary situations of change, such as migration for reasons of work or study, or reasons of political or allegedly religious exile, a reformulation of socio-cultural spaces occurs, which is coupled with a rupture of social connections of support and belonging. This refers to a lifestyle under a “transience” status, which may last, in certain cases, all life long. The “place of roots” fails and the subject ends up feeling a stranger even in its own spaces. In this sense, the foreigner’s right (xenos) to hospitality resides precisely in not being considered the absolute other, the barbarian, the savage who is absolutely excluded and heterogeneous, but in being someone whose identity should be guaranteed. Upon answering this requirement, the foreigner undertakes responsibility before the law and before its hosts: the foreigner becomes “a subject of rights”.",

Hence the title is chosen deliberately. I suppose one of the hydras haunting the spiritual life comes from misunderstanding the all-or-nothing principle. God is recogized as the infinite good, which indeed he is, but this infinity in made both so big and individualized that it elbows out all other goods. This emphatically God does not do, otherwise when we called him creator it would be only of a shadow world.

Revelation means that God has spoken —has spoken to all men and so to me —through His appointed spokesmen, the prophets, and through His Son. He has told me things I could never have discovered for myself—things of the most vital and supreme importance to me for this life and hereafter. Revelation is essentially concerned with Mystery , with that which of its very nature is unknowable by man’s unaided efforts. It is not enough for me to know that God exists, that there is an Infinite, an Absolute, an Ultimate Explanation, a First Cause, a Supreme Intelligence, a perfect Beauty, a final Value, an Object of all yearning, striving and desire. These truths which thought and philosophy can tell me are, in themselves, of relatively little practical importance if God is to remain the unattainable Infinite, remote, impersonal.",

      "title": "The Economic Value of Water",
      "abstract": "In economics, the value of an item—including water—to a person is defined as the most of something else of value (typically money, but sometimes time) the person is willing to give up to obtain that item (willingness to pay) or the minimum compensation the person would want to receive in exchange for forgoing the item (willingness to accept). These are measures of gross value; they are in principle quantitative; and they are subjective and idiosyncratic to the individual and the circumstances. The economic value of an item is not measured by its price. It is likely to vary with the amount of the item and should not be taken as a constant. A core conceptual distinction is between use value and nonuse value. A person’s use value for an item is the value that she places on the item from motives connected with the use of the item by someone, whether her own use or that of someone else. Nonuse value is the value she places on an item from motives not directly connected with the use of that item by anybody in any tangible way. For example, a person may value water to drink (a use value), but he may also value having water remain in its natural state (a nonuse value). Consumptive uses are use values, but nonconsumptive uses can also be use values (e.g., swimming in a lake). Other conceptual distinctions include that between wet water and paper water (water that exists on paper but is not actually accessible or usable), and that between raw water alone versus water accompanied by the infrastructure necessary to store it and convey it so as to make it available for use.",

      "title": "Love of Friendship and Love of Concupiscence",
      "abstract": "Love of Friendship and Love of Concupiscence Jordan Olver WE LOVE WINE and other lifeless things in a different way than we love our friends. We love our friends for their own sake, wishing good for them and being inherently pleased by their possession of it. We love wine and other such things as objects to be used, enjoyed, or possessed by someone we care about; we do not love them fundamentally as subjects for whom we wish some good but as goods we wish for some subject. Aristotle, in his Nicomachean Ethics, drew attention to this difference and, through it, identified friendship as essentially a benevolent love, that is, one that wishes good for the loved one for the loved one’s own sake.1 In the thirteenth century, theologians looked back to Aristotle, and presumably to experience itself, and distinguished between two kinds of love: the kind of love one has toward wine they called concupiscence or love of [End Page 573] concupiscence; the kind one has toward a friend they called friendship or love of friendship. Thomas Aquinas received the distinction between love of friendship and love of concupiscence from his Scholastic predecessors, and in a sense from Aristotle as well. He used the terms love of friendship and love of concupiscence throughout his career, and the distinction associated with them eventually came to occupy a central role in his thought on love. Arguably, the distinction became so central that without it one cannot present his thought except in a vague manner, nor can one solve the primary problem associated with his doctrine of love, namely, how love of others for their own sake is possible.2 Scholars have often treated of the distinction between love of friendship and love of concupiscence. Most treatments, however, have been part of a broader inquiry; rarely has the distinction been the proper object of study. The effect has been that scholars have rarely considered the two loves as a controversial topic, one over which to argue.3 But differences in interpretation do exist, some being more obvious, others more subtle. These differences exist in turn because Thomas’s understanding of love of friendship and love of concupiscence is itself difficult to discern. Thomas presents the two loves in a variety of ways, and it is not clear how we are to reconcile these different accounts. Some dedicated studies, accordingly, are needed to [End Page 574] address the various textual difficulties and consider the diverse interpretations in the secondary literature. This study aims to provide such a treatment. With the help of the secondary literature, we will first set out the questions we will seek to answer in our inquiry. Then, to provide a firmer foundation for interpreting Thomas, we will survey his predecessors’ use of love of friendship and love of concupiscence. Afterward, we will examine Thomas’s own use of the terms throughout his career. Finally, we will return to the questions raised and draw conclusions about how we ought to understand the two loves and the distinction associated with them. I. Scholarly Treatment and Possible Interpretations Twentieth- and twenty-first-century interpreters of Thomas generally present love of friendship and love of concupiscence in one of four ways. Some divide the two loves as other-oriented and self-oriented: love of friendship is a disinterested love of others for their own sake while love of concupiscence is a love of something wished for oneself.4 Others divide the loves as being of persons and of things wished for persons: love of friendship is of a person, whether oneself or another, for that person’s own sake, while love of concupiscence is of some good wished for a person.5 Still others divide the loves similarly but [End Page 575] add that the loves are not distinct acts, but two aspects or tendencies found in every act of love: in each act, one tends with love of friendship to some subject for whom one wishes some good and with love of concupiscence to some good one wishes for that subject.6 Finally, some identify multiple senses of the two loves.

      "title": "Justifying an Adequate Response to the Vulnerable Other",
      "abstract": "Is it possible to justify requiring that I respond adequately to the other’s vulnerability? I contend that insofar as I value my own personal identity it is consistent to respond adequately to the vulnerability of the other. Part one provides a break down of vulnerability in terms of its fundamental indeterminacy. Part two illustrates how the ability to respond either adequately or inadequately to the other’s vulnerability is implied by the fundamental co-constitution of personal identity. I understand myself as a self only insofar as I stand in relation to other selves that see me as a self. If the relationship between recognition and identity also holds for the other, my response to her vulnerability founds her identity as well. In part three the relationship developed in part two is employed to justify the obligation to respond adequately to the vulnerable other. If I value my own personal identity, then I require an adequate response from others, because that response plays an integral role in the foundation of my personal identity. The other cannot respond adequately to my vulnerability unless her own identity is assured. Only if I respond adequately to the vulnerability of the other will she be in a position to assure my identity. Therefore, I ought to respond adequately to the vulnerability of others if for no other reason than it puts the other in a position where she can assure the personal identity that I value.",

      "abstract": "In this thesis, consisting of three empirical projects (18 studies, total N = 8,218), I investigate how people morally value animals and why they value them less than humans. My central hypothesis is that people primarily value animals less than humans because of their mere species-membership, i.e. due to speciesism. First, I develop and validate a Speciesism Scale, a psychological assessment instrument that measures the extent to which people value humans more than animals. I find that speciesism is a stable construct with large interpersonal differences. It shares psychological properties with other forms of prejudice and predicts behaviour directed towards animals. Second, I experimentally investigate in more detail why people endorse speciesism. I develop a multi-factorial framework according to which people: a) believe that individuals should prioritise members of their owns species over others (Species-Relativism); b) have a slight tendency to consider humans to be of superior value in an absolute sense (Pro-Human Bias); and c) have a specific bias against animals (Anti-Animal Bias). I also show that people value animals less, the lower their perceived mental capacity levels are (Individual Mental Capacity View)—a principle that people selectively apply to animals but not to humans. Third, I experimentally investigate when people consider it permissible to harm animals or humans in cases where harming a few could save many. My findings support a model which I call Multi-level Weighted Deontology: deontological protections against harm are not absolute and get weaker the less people value the respective being, but they do not completely disappear. They are strongest for humans, followed by dogs, chimpanzees, pigs, and finally inanimate objects. Overall, my research shows that speciesism is a pervasive psychological phenomenon that strongly impacts our social lives and moral thinking. This thesis is one of the first attempts to transition speciesism from moral philosophy into psychology.",

Because of them, man may be free politically and economically, yet deeply enslaved. He can be free of all arbitrary external controls, yet live under the power ol internal compulsions which make of him an automaton: insatiable in his needs, inflexible in his methods, and incapable of learning intellectually or of maturing emotionally through experience. Because of these inner processes, man may be an absolute monarch or a constitutionally elected president, an abstract artist or a precise scientist, a criminal or a clergyman, yet not possess the greatest of all freedoms–the freedom to change. 1",

The provoking behavior was generally portrayed by the perpetrator as meaningful and comprehensible, whereas the victim tended to depict it as arbitrary, gratuitous, or incomprehensible. Victim accounts portrayed the incident in a long-term context that carried lasting implications, especially of continuing harm, loss, and grievance. Perpetrator accounts tended to cast the incident as a closed, isolated incident that did not have lasting implications. Several findings fit a hypothesis that interpersonal conflicts may arise when a victim initially stifles anger and then finally responds to an accumulated series of provocations, whereas the perpetrator perceives only the single incident and regards the angry response as an unjustified overreaction. Victim and perpetrator roles are associated with different subjective interpretations.",

It is at this point that he begins his long social conditioning history. His dependence on other people may lessen and his dependent behavior may change in form, but the class of behavior most generally labeled social behavior remains, and in many ways becomes more firmly controlled by other people. In our complex society the lack of social behavior is unheard of except in the extreme cases of the psychotic and the retarded, and even here there is most often evidence for some minimal social behavior. Living together is of course not restricted to man; animals also display social behavior. The definition of social behavior is then quite simple: It is behavior which varies as a function of other organisms—other organisms may elicit the behavior, set the occasion for it, or reinforce it. Furthermore, the behavior need not occur in the presence of other organisms to be called social—it may be related to other organisms only through stimuli which were once associated with them.",

      "abstract": "The article is devoted to the study of the features of human intelligence and the intelligence of complex computer systems, usually referred to as artificial intelligence (AI). As a hypothesis, a statement was formulated about a significant difference between human and artificial intelligence. Human intelligence is a product of a multi-thousand-year history of the development and interaction of three interrelated processes: 1) the formation and development of the human personality; 2) the formation of complex network relationships between members of the social community; 3) collective activity as the basis for the existence and development of communities and individuals. AI is a complex of technological solutions that imitate human cognitive processes. Because of this, with all the options for technical development (acceleration of processes for collecting and processing data and finding solutions, using computer vision, speech recognition and synthesis, etc.). AI will always be associated with human activity. In other words, only people (not machines) are the ultimate source and determinant of values on which any artificial intelligence depends. No mind (human or machine) will ever be truly autonomous: everything we do depends on the social context created by other people who determine the meaning of what we want to achieve. This means that people are responsible for everything that AI does.",

This may occur in at least two ways-by anthropomorphizing nonhuman agents such as nonhuman animals and gadgets to make them appear more humanlike and by increasing belief in commonly anthropomorphized religious agents (such as God). Three studies support these hypotheses both among individuals who are chronically lonely (Study 1) and among those who are induced to feel lonely (Studies 2 and 3). Additional findings suggest that such results are not simply produced by any negative affective state (Study 3). These results have important implications not only for understanding when people are likely to treat nonhuman agents as humanlike (anthropomorphism), but also for understanding when people treat human agents as nonhuman (dehumanization).",

      "title": "The Physician as a Leader",
      "abstract": "Psychologists divide mortals into two general classifications; one is called the subjective type, the other the objective. The subjective type of personality glories in working on his own responsibility and does his best work by himself with subordinate help, if any. He wishes to know more and more about some particular phase of human activity and to become the expert in medicine, in engineering, or in the arts—he engages in research work—he dreams—he creates—he invents—by and large, he does the world's work. The objective type is exo-centric. He is the power and personality boy. He knows a little about a great many things and not too much about any one thing. He becomes the executive, the politician, or the statesman. He sells the work of the hands of the subjective type. In the main, the world is run by the objective type. Some of us, of course, are altogether subjective or objective, while the majority of us have some of both characteristics but lean more strongly one way or the other. It now becomes apparent why physicians are not particularly successful in presenting their work, their cause, and their point of view; why they are not good politicians and why so frequently they squirm and wiggle because some layman is the executive who tries to direct and control their work and tell them how and where the work of their hands and brains should be carried out. The old-time family physician, the doctor, was a generation ago the father confessor and adviser to persons, not only in matters of health but in economics and human relations of all kinds. He helped John secure finances for the purchase of a bam or more cattle; he gave Mary useful advice in matters of the heart. He must have been objective- as well as subjective-minded since, in many, many ways, he was a power and influence in the community. As medicine has become more and more intricate, as the field of technical knowledge has expanded, too many of us have ceased to be “a doctor“—one who is learned—and have lost our interest for knowledge in fields other than those that concern our daily work; and so we have become highly trained technicians. Is it any wonder that we have gradually, as subjective-minded persons, come under the control of the objective-minded members of the community? It is high time that we make a conscious effort to become partially objective-minded; that we seek positions in our community on Boards of Health or Education; that we run for the City Council, and that we once again exert our personality and intelligence and win back the esteem and the respect of the community because of our efforts for community welfare in general. We should once again produce our rightful proportion of leadership in all phases of human activity.",

Celtic supernatural beings described in folktale (Scottish elves, witches or ‘selkies.’ Irish síth, Breton korrigan, Cornish Spriggans and so on) may use song (and less often, dance) in various tactical ways and modes: to decorate their own ‘parallel’ (but Other) cultural realm, to celebrate and show the superior Otherness of this realm, to lure humans into their power (often breaking the boundaries of ‘human’ time and space in the process) or for other reasons. Eastern and South Slavic supernatural beings (Russian rusalka, Serbian vile and others) show some similar characteristics, though the vila herself has variant forms (which can be related to the Dumézilian fonctions) – and some shamanistic modes seem possible here. In the end, in both contexts supernatural beings are described as separated from humankind – but then ‘song and dance’ brings them back into the human realm again. Their acts and intentions may be benignant or malignant, but what is shown is the imagined power of the Other, and we can indeed find valuable comparanda in the two Indo-European (Celtic and Slavic) cultural-linguistic areas.",

Such exhortations are made particularly in the context of religion. When for instance, we face some personal tragedy which may well seem inexplicable, we are told that faith can help us through it. Very often faith is referred to in a vacuum. Presumably faith in God is usually meant, but all too often God drops out of the picture, and it seems that all we need is faith, not faith in anything or anyone, but just faith. We are thus encouraged to add what seems to be a magic ingredient to our lives, which can transform everything. Perhaps at the back of such thinking lies some Calvinist notion of the corrupt character of human reason. As a result it may seem that we cannot rely on our judgment, which is the product of the fallen and sinful nature of humanity. Instead we must depend on ‘faith’ which may, or may not, be given us by the grace of God.",

      "abstract": "JAVMA, Vol 240, No. 5, March 1, 2012 C and misunderstanding often occur when two people attempt to communicate using different languages. More commonly, confusion arises when two people attempt to communicate using the same language but attach different meanings to the same terms. A good example is the term humane, particularly as it relates to whether the care we provide as veterinarians is humane. The term humane encompasses the best qualities of humankind, including kindness, tenderness, empathy, and compassion. Although all of these behaviors exist to some extent in various animals, animals cannot act in a humane fashion (that is, animal behavior is not judged as humane or inhumane), whereas humans can act in a humane fashion toward other humans and animals. Behavior that is inhumane is lacking in compassion for the suffering of humans and animals; synonyms of inhumanity include unkindness and cruelty. Thus, a veterinarian or animal owner who deliberately chooses to disregard available means to reduce injury or illness in an animal under his or her care could be thought of as inhumane or, in some circumstances, cruel. The definition of cruelty encompasses actions that are inhumane and without pity. The definition of pity encompasses having compassion for the suffering, distress, or troubles of another. Whether an act is cruel depends not only on the act itself, but also on the intent of the act. In my opinion, cruelty involves acts and motivations limited to people. The term welfare signifies a state of being or doing well. The concept of animal welfare has traditionally been founded on the premise that humans have an obligation to act humanely toward animals. In my experience, animal welfare problems are more likely to encompass acts of omission rather than commission (ie, deliberate acts of cruelty). The term compassion is derived from Latin and literally means to suffer with. Thus, compassion encompasses feelings, but more is involved with compassion than simply emotions. According to several modern English dictionaries, two complementary human qualities must be combined to be compassionate. First, we must have empathetic awareness of the suffering, distress, or troubles of another living being. Second, we must have an empathetic desire to help correct the problem. Empathy is the projection of our own thoughts and feelings onto the thoughts and feelings of What does it mean to be humane?",

In spite of having the power and supreme control He does not force righteousness. We have the choice of opting or rejecting righteousness.Allah Almighty has made righteousness clear to its full extent in the Holy Qur'an but, does not force to accept it and having the power of stopping mankind forcefully from, He does not do so He wants intentional righteousness. Allah Almighty has given all the means to accept or reject it. The power of logic is irrefutable fact, but if the quest for righteousness is not available then one cannot get righteousness. If the man is headstrong, egotist and reluctant then these attitudes leads to aberration. The man who is on the right path should not think that he got this by his hard work. It is only grace of Allah Almighty. Righteousness may be given to someone who is not eager of it by the grace of Allah Almighty, but aberration is only given to those who deserve it.",

      "abstract": "Cardiac surgery: a complex system Heart surgery has much in common with other high technology systems in which performance and outcomes depend on multifaceted interactions of individual, technical and organizational factors. In addition, our specialty often functions as a chaotic/emergent system since the initial circumstances vary in patients with the same medical condition resulting in uncertainty and lack of predictability [1]. Complexity: The American Heritage Dictionary defines complex and complicated as “things whose parts are so interconnected or interwoven as to make the whole perplexing”. If we add rarity and small numbers to complexity, the results is a distinctiveness that explains many aspects of our profession and specialty such as variability with institutional differences in outcomes; inconsistency of results in treating rare diseases and uncertainty on any inference about results of complex rare lesions [2]. A system is a set of interdependent elements that are interacting, or working together, to accomplish a common goal. All systems, at the “atomic” level, consist of individuals, activities, connections, and pathways with the following characteristics, qualities or peculiarities in complex systems: • Heterogeneity of the parties (diverse nature and multiple); • Cause-and-effect relationships may be nonlinear and obvious only in retrospect; • Richness of interaction between them (including their contradictory character); • Multidimensional and multi-referential; • Many variables commonly present; • Provide information that by itself reveals the extent of its complexity; • Under an apparent simplicity, they often hide the true dynamics of these processes and interactions between its parts • Vulnerability — Are influenced by factors and surprising circumstances that may affect, cause, or facilitate a change in behavior and expected results, altering all or changed significantly “Complex business generates complex services.

      "abstract": "In early'90s, Gilles Lipovetsky announced twilight in a desperately seeking welfare, comfort and achieving intimist, materialistic happiness; values of sacrifice being, in this context, all muted. This trend has given rise to Postmoralist society which Lipovetsky claims that stepping out beyond realm of duty, (these societies) does hold without recognizing any authority, but according to a weak and minimal ethic, without obligation and sanction.1The societies that have accepted and have structured their activities according to principles of minimalist ethics, and based on dynamics of subjective rights, have had to adopt a new paradigm, capable, at an ethical and moral level to address and solve problems that societies face: terrorist attacks, natural disaster, famine. Actions required by extreme circumstances2 transcend duty, moral values, good, right, bad get other meanings, and their assessment cannot have as model usual rational structures. In such circumstances, emergence of of (acting on altruistic spirit, placing welfare of others above their own well beyond boundaries of what duty states), imposes itself, and cultivates it and recognizes its merit. The terms holy or holiness, referring to action, as they are used by supererogatory acts3 theories has purely moral sense, without any religious implications. The moral evaluation criteria of terms and intended to be used in moral contexts is reduced, according to Urmson, to two dimensions: personal and actionable. The morality of supererogation manifested at first level is attributed to person who carries out duty in a context where inclinations, desires, and self-interest would determine most of people to do it, and actionable perspective, self-control, self-mastery become essential. The her o overcomes self-preservation instinct, terror-and acts under self-control in a context where most people are gripped by fear. These actions go beyond moral duty and obligation. From an ethical perspective, to act correctly means you do help those facts which are considered to be wrong, and most of ethical standards have a negative-they appear therefore under prohibitions as not to While followers that promote a closed ethical system4, see actions from a clearly dichotomous perspective, these being just right or wrong, and requirement that every man over his lifetime, to always choose lesser evil. The condition of and Hero from point of view of normative theories, is either related to'the voluntary assumption of positions and functions that require these virtues for proper performance of duties or to looking for higher purposes in a manner that is conform to justice, but that exceeds requirements of obligation and duty. As such, morality of supererogation those of saint and hero, do contradict norms of law (right) and of righteousness (justice) rather self voluntarily adopts specific purposes of these principles, going beyond5. The supererogatory actions are related only to this class of actions that would include only saints and heroes. From a broader perspective, supererogatory actions (because focus is more on action and on individual traits, motives, intentions or emotions) become optional or non-binding acts, completely different than acts falling under duty, they transcend duty because agent made more than duty, which requires him or involves what to do. With these features, David Heyd believes that the supererogatory acts have special value: they are morally good and praiseworthy6. Actions with moral value, appraisal, non-mandatory, optional, voluntary undetermined by universal rules and which do jeopardize lives of those who perform them fall into category of (unqualified supererogation)7. …",

This has been called negative magical contagion, an implicit belief in the transmission of essence by physical contact. Alternatively, individuals may avoid a negatively contaminated object because: 1) the object is a strong reminder of the original contagion source (association account); or 2) the act of interacting with the object signals specific information about the self (social communication account). We report that: 1) people often prefer to interact with an entity that they believe is more associated with a negative source rather than an entity that is less associated but has made physical contact with the same negative source; 2) while an associative account requires that contact enhances association, a study of memory for visual pairings of objects indicates that when objects are touching, their associative link (recall) is no greater than when they are in proximity; and 3) subjects continue to show aversion to (prefer to wear gloves to handle) an object that contacted a negative entity even if they are handling the object in order to physically destroy it, hence strongly signaling their rejection of that object. Association and social communication are at best partial accounts for contagion effects.",

With problem-focused coping, humans seek information and weigh the pros/ cons of alternatives (i.e., valence-carriers); humans invest time and cognitive effort to maximize confidence for the best possible decisions.

God is the most perfect being in which He is the only being (one), does not need any other existence and has dominion over All things.

Among the main points in this article is talk about faith and monotheism, where the statement that Allah has broken His promises is a lie and the accusation that he took a son is an insult. With the Qur’an and hadith as the foundation for breaking every accusation that is thrown to Allah, it is impossible to think that it can be in God’s substance, and when someone can understand it as well, it can have a big impact on their faith and deliver a big love to their only one God. This research was conducted using the qualitative method, which entailed gathering data from various sources, connecting the data, and then using the data as a foundation to deny all lying and amplifying that thrown to Allah and as a foundation that Allah was the truth, and and only God all of time.",

      "abstract": "Abstract This chapter develops Non-Identity Theodicy—that is, theodicy primarily claiming that our existence as the individuals we are depends on God’s policy of evil and suffering allowance. Non-Identity Theodicy suggests that God allows evil in order to create and love the specific individuals who come to exist. This theodicy is unique because the justifying good recommended is neither harm-aversion nor pure benefit. It is not a good that betters the lives of individual human persons (for they would not exist otherwise), but it is the individual human persons themselves. In order to aim successfully at the creation of particular individuals, however, God would need a control of history so complete that it might be argued to be inconsistent with beliefs about human free will that are important to some theologies. In order to avoid this problem, a second version of Non-Identity Theodicy is constructed. This version considers whether God’s justifying motivation could be a desire for beings of our type, even if it could not be a desire for particular individuals. It is suggested that God would be interested in loving those he creates under various descriptions (e.g., biological, psychological, and narrative descriptions) and that a horror-prone environment is necessary for us to be the type of being we are under these descriptions. This second version of Non-Identity Theodicy allows some version of Non-Identity Theodicy to be available to the theist regardless of her views about the existence and nature of human free will.",

In most cases, people tend to describe themselves as “good,” “cultured,” and “decent,” while other nations are considered “bad,” “uncultured,” or “mean.” However, self‐loathing, self‐depreciation, or self‐criticism are not uncommon in different descriptions of national characters. Both positive and negative portrayals are fluid and relate to specific events or recent developments. Others have a longer history and reflect certain stereotypes or expectations about the typical behavior of a representative member of a national group. Consider a well‐known joke about some European nations: “What are Heaven and Hell? Heaven is when the restaurant chef is French, the cop is British, the auto mechanic is German, the planner is Swiss, and the lover is Italian. In Hell, everything is out of order: The chef is British, the policeman is German, the mechanic is French, the planner is Italian, and the lover is Swiss.” This old joke embodies simplistic views of national character.",

      "title": "Type/Face",
      "abstract": "For Socrates the act of communication is grounded in the world of original forms, archetypes, or abstract ideas. These ideas exist independently of the human mind and reflect a reality that is truer than the world of everyday experience. The task of the speaker is to draw the listener closer to the truth of these ideas, and this requires an intimate coupling of the form of speech to the character of the listener. In Phaedrus, Socrates explains, \". . . a would-be speaker must know how many types of soul there are. The number is finite, and they account for a variety of individual characters. When these are determined one must enumerate the various types of speech, a finite number also.\" The types of soul must then be carefully paired with the types of speech. This theoretical knowledge by itself, however, is not sufficient. A speaker must also know when \". . . he has actually before him a specific example of a type which he has heard described, and that this is what he must say and this is how he must say it if he wants to influence his hearer in this particular way\" (Plato 91-92). Thus, the aspiring speaker must sharpen his powers of observation. Exactly how a speaker goes about discerning the various types of souls in his audience is not discussed in Phaedrus, but one assumes it is by mastering the art of face reading, or physiognomy. The science of physiognomy was of particular importance to the ancient Greeks. Nearly all the well-known Greek writers had something to say about the subject. Pythagoras is claimed to be the first Greek to formalize it systematically as a science. Hippocrates wrote voluminously on the subject, as did Aristotle. Socrates not only recommended physiognomy to his students (Tytler) but he is also reported to have demonstrated his facility with the science at least twice: once in predicting the promotion of Alcibiades and once upon first meeting Plato, whom he immediately recognized as a man of considerable philosophical talent (Encyclopedia Britannica). Writing is inferior to speech, Socrates tells Phaedrus, precisely because it cannot see and adapt the message to the reader. Like a painting of an object, writing is merely the image of dissociated speech. What is missing in writing-and what writing seems ever intent on reconstructing-is the human face. Pressing Faces Behind the Typeface Although physiognomy was banned by the Church, as it was associated with paganism and devil worship (practitioners of the science were burnt at the stake), it was revived in the Renaissance and became an obsession with the advent of the printing press. The printing press heralds democracy. But as human rights grew, urban centers developed, and new professions and classes emerged, people were no longer able to divine their own destiny or to predict the behavior and destiny of others. It became imperative to find other more reliable means of identifying the good and the bad, the talented and the unremarkable. Two books were considered indispensable: the Bible and Lavater's Essays on Physiognomy (Juengel). Physiognomy was the science that helped people decipher class and profession. It became the spelling book of character, one that people diligently studied so that they could learn to read not only the marks of character in others but also the signs of talent and potential in their own faces and in the faces of their children. Face reading was egalitarian and leveling (Juengel). The heads of state could be read and debunked in the flourishing art of caricature, and people delighted in decoding the physiognomy of the ordinary faces that crowded the pages of the popular press. The populace applauded the artists that succeeded in revealing the whole spectrum of a character-class, intentions, profession-in the masterly strokes of the pen (Wechsler). Unfortunately, so intense was the interest in face reading that many people were forced to cover their faces when out in public (Zebrowitz). Inside the religious, medical, educational, and criminal justice institutions, authorities scanned faces to identify the virtuous and the vile. People were hanged because of the shape of their jaws (\"A physiognomic auto-da-fé,\") and sometimes convicted of crimes because of an unfortunate physiognomy, even before any crimes were committed (Lichtenberg. 93). Mass Consumption of the Face Open a magazine. What do you see? I counted over 200 faces in the September 15, 2003 issue of Newsweek, 120 faces in the September 29, 2003 issue of Forbes, 124 faces in the September 15, 2003 issue of Time, and 37 faces in the November, 2003 issue of Handgunner (I included the masked faces). Whereas, in the 19th century, face reading was used by the religious, medical, and criminal justice authorities to identify a person's character, in the modern world face reading becomes face righting. Early in the century, people came to be viewed less as individuals than as masses that were dynamically statistical with fluctuations of opinions and tastes that could be sampled and manipulated. It quickly became apparent to the behemoth advertising industry that was erected with the advent of mass media that product designs and packages could be collated with viewer reactions. The audience is scrutinized, labeled, and targeted. What people are fed are fleshless images of themselves. Horkheimer and Adorno have observed that the media have reduced the individual to the stereotype. Stereotypes package people, typically in unflattering boxes. Mediated faces are used to mirror, to prime, and to manipulate the audience (Kress and van Leeuwen). On television and in print, images of canned faces proliferate. Not all stereotypes are unsavory. Nothing recommends itself nor sells like a beautiful face, but even beautiful faces must be retouched, even recomposed from features extracted from databases of perfect facial features. So important is the image of the face that media icons routinely visit the plastic surgeon. Michael Jackson is the most extreme example of what has been derogatorily termed a \"scalpel slave.\" Plastic surgery is not exclusive to celebrities; countless millions of ordinary Americans feel compelled to undergo various cosmetic surgeries. The 20th-century consumption of the face has ended by consuming the face. Facing the Face Interface Text has made a comeback in hypertext. Empowered by the hyperlink, readers have become writers as they assemble texts with the clicks of a mouse (Landow). Electronic texts are pushed as well as pulled. Businesses have learned to track and to query users, building individual profiles that are then used to assemble personalized pages and email messages. Socrates' objection that writing is unable to perceive the reader no longer holds. The virtual text is watching you. And it is watching you with virtual eyes. There is a growing interest in developing face interfaces that are capable of perceiving and talking. The technical requirements are enormous. Face interfaces must learn to make eye contact, follow speaking faces with their eyes, mirror emotion, lip synch, and periodically nod, raise eyebrows, and tilt the head (Massaro). Face interfaces are also learning to write faces, to map rhetorical forms to the character of their interlocutors in ways Socrates could not have imagined. Socrates did not teach his students to consider the rhetorical effects of their faces: the speaker's face was thought to be fixed, a true reflection of the inner soul. Virtual faces are not so constrained. Smart faces are being developed that are capable of rendering their own appearances from within a statistical model of the users' impressions of faces. The goal is for these virtual faces to learn to design, through their interactions with users, facial appearances that are calibrated to elicit very specific impressions and reactions in others (Brahnam). Some people will disapprove of virtual faces. Just as the media use faces to manipulate the viewer and perpetuate facial stereotypes, smart faces run the risk of doing the same. Some may also worry that virtual faces will be attributed more intelligence and social capacity then they actually possess. Do we really want our children growing up talking to virtual faces? Can they satisfy our need for human contact? What does it mean to converse with a virtual face? What kind of conversation is that? For the present at least, virtual faces are more like the orators and bards of old. They merely repeat the speeches of others. Their own speech is nearly incomprehensible, and their grammatical hiccups annoyingly disrupt the suspension of disbelief. On their own, without the human in the loop, no one believes them. Thus, the virtual face appears on the screen, silently nodding and smiling. Not yet a proper student of classical rhetoric, it is much like the virtual guide at artificial-life.com that recently greeted her visitors wearing the following placard: A virtual guide that greeted visitors at artificial-life.com.

      "abstract": "The mechanisms of vulnerability come into play, mechanisms which call on the social resources of the person concerned, on his social anchorages but also on the chain of experience which constitutes his real-life world. Family socialisation, acquired values, the social trajectory, possible situations of betrayal which lead to a precarious identity, everything can finally converge towards a vulnerability which is not latent but real. Vulnerability is no longer restricted to the domain of the badly-integrated or excluded, it touches the whole of the social world. Vulnerability as being specific to the responsible human being, a vulnerability of a moral nature, as it were, and vulnerability making it impossible for a person to appear to the world, in other words a vulnerability of a social nature. Responding to the potential vulnerability of the other person, is the vulnerability of he who responds and who not only 'always has one response more to give' but a responsibility which is inexhaustible.",

      "abstract": "This paper explores why direct observation of our own species behaviour is so little done in psychology and other social sciences.The very familiarity and the richness of our cultural understanding of our behaviour is paradoxically an impediment, since that understanding is couched in the language of an active participant in social interactions.That language acknowledges and communicates the subjective states of ourselves and others but it is not couched in the language of a scientist, who is an outsider, a passive observer, who does not use the terms of his subjects and does not study their subjectivity since it is not publically observable and cannot be agreed upon in the usual scientific way of demonstrating a phenomenon for anyone to observe.A major function of our rich everyday knowledge is to help us be successful social participants.That type of practical knowledge is not necessarily useful for a detached science.Other impediments include • our moral distaste at viewing our fellow human beings as objects without subjectivity • initial observations can seem banal and uninformatively familiar • direct observation is time consuming and expensive • specific research hypotheses seem lacking Two traditional ethological ways of describing behaviours -by morphology and by consequence.A disciplined seriously playful approach is advocated for the early stages of research, trying to find useful behaviour categories to measure.One aid to this is to look for natural divisions in the phenomena studied and quotes the Plooij's work comparing children's behaviour either side of regression (rapid development) periods in early development.",

      "abstract": "Love is ultimately willing to be foolish in its risk calculations. Love does not only reject the risks that risk-averse calculation, aimed towards security, would advise. Living in the web of life entangles beings with multiple processes of mutual dependency which defy any simplistic idea of autonomy, self-sufficiency, and power. Love calls these calculations into question and asks for courageous unilateral action. The double structure of action and observation of the action in terms of its fit into processes of securing expectations is dimmed down or even abandoned. A true spirit of love sensitizes one to others and cultivates the enlightenment of a widened perception. Love graciously discloses the very limitations of life and the markers of its finitude by addressing them. Love transforms perception, both in terms of its depth and its horizon. The expansion of perception,however,comes at a price.",

Most people wish not just for their own happiness but also the happiness of the people they love; some compassionate souls may even wish for the happiness of all sentient creatures. What exactly is it that we all want? Is it to be pleased or satisfied? To feel tranquil or joyous? To attain certain objective goods? And what role does happiness play in morality? Is the production of happiness the goal of morally right action? Is it the organizing principle of moral theory? Or is it just one contingent value among many?",

While I agree with this non-identity, I will argue that the reason no such identification will work is because the term ‘person’ is not a sortal, but is a psychosocial honorific – somewhat like ‘captain’ – applying pro tem to those beings which have attained distinctive “personal” capacities. Transtemporal identity conditions are formulated which show persons to be (as in Locke and Lowe) identifiable neither with masses of matter nor with organisms, but their status as persons requires them to be physical.",

      "title": "Can One Be Cognitively Conscious of God?",
      "abstract": "How do humans ‘register’ God: attain knowledge or revelation of God? Analysis is familiar in terms of explanatory hypothesis, necessity, authority and commitment. However individuals speak also of ‘experience’ or ‘consciousness’ of God/Christ/grace – received widely, not just by an esoteric few. But may we properly hold that people can be cognitively aware of God? Undoubtedly such speech has problematic aspects. Not only do psychosis, self‐deception, gullibility recur. Commentators are liable to enlist what may be termed the A‐conceptual Lucidity picture, which critically fails. Various positions urged by thinkers rule out by definition the very possibility of cognitive awareness of God. Some analysts assert: a person’s experiencing x is constituted throughout by the person’s use of concepts in toto reached previously and independently. But, why adopt any a priori dismissiveness? We should favour a portrayal of people’s epistemic situation respecting God called the Consciousness Portrayal. Phrases therein include: ‘God’s gracious, guiding activity’; ‘a person’s access to God’; ‘attentive consciousness/conceptualization/knowledge of God’; ‘diverse levels or modes of consciousness’; ‘God’s guidance in a person’s creatively picking out concepts’; and ‘“cognition” which, as regards meaning , is not just a function of calculative reasoning’. Alertness to usage in non‐religious contexts aids our finding the religious phrasing intelligible. The Portrayal is approachable from an internal and external angle. Opponents’ challenges to the Portrayal invoke some broad epistemological theses, often pronounced intrinsic to ‘rationality’. But we fittingly espouse certain contrasting epistemological views. And these prove to fortify the Consciousness Portrayal.",

      "title": "What One Is",
      "abstract": "That this contributes much more to a person's happiness than what he has, or what he represents, we have already recognized in general. All depends on what someone is and, accordingly, has in himself; for his individuality accompanies him at all times and in all places; it colours all that he experiences. In and through everything he initially enjoys only himself; this is true of the bodily, but much more of the intellectual pleasures. Hence the English ‘to enjoy one's self’ is a very fitting expression, with which, for example, we say ‘he enjoys himself at Paris’, thus not ‘he enjoys Paris’, but ‘he enjoys himself in Paris’. – However, if the individual character is badly constituted, all pleasures are like delicious wines in a mouth full of bile. Accordingly, in good times and bad times, leaving aside great calamities, it is less important what befalls us in life than how we feel about it, hence what is the nature and the degree of our receptivity in every respect. What someone is and has within himself, in short, personality and its worth, is the only thing that immediately counts for his happiness and well-being. Everything else is mediate; consequently, its effects can be frustrated, but those of personality never. For that reason, envy directed towards personal merits is the most unforgiving, as it is also the most carefully concealed. Moreover, the constitution of consciousness alone is persistent and enduring, and individuality acts constantly and incessantly, more or less at every moment; everything else only acts from time to time, occasionally, temporarily, and is also subject to reversal and transformation. Hence Aristotle says: ‘Nature is permanent, but wealth is not.’ 344 Because of this we bear a misfortune that has befallen us entirely from the outside with more composure than one that is self-inflicted; for fate can change, but one's own nature never.",

Such a pessimistic point of view, however, did not affect Seneca’s optimism.

In the case of love, those entities are people we are related to, whose characters, qualities or traits we admire; pride, by its turn, is a passion related to the self. In spite of that, Hume is explicit in stating that love is naturally attended by a desire for the goodness and happiness of the beloved being; but it does not make sense to say that we desire our own happiness and well-being because we are proud of ourselves. How can we explain this asymmetry? First, I will deal with the problem of the contrast between the unrelatedness of the emotion of pride and the desire of our own happiness and the relatedness of passion of love and the desire of happiness of the beloved person. After, I will link the conclusions reached with Hume’s famous claim that we cannot be happy in solitude. Our own happiness depends not only on our own well-being and success, but also on the well-being and happiness of the people we love, and both of which are related to the well functioning of society in the long run.",

The reasons for the evil eye can be diverse and they talk about the way in which certain qualities or attributions are perceived, the disenchantment describing sometimes a genuine ceremonial, meant to reestablish the initial order. The content of the disenchantment referrers to certain additional elements, certain plants with prophylactic valences, to specific attitudes. The particularities of these protective practices include either some references to the prophylactic, apothropaic elements – of keeping away the evil, of protection (not to catch it): garlic, basil or different practices meant to remove the evil eye. The typology of the disenchantment takes into consideration their destination, being either a remedy, either protection for the households. These former practices lead to a wide range of gestures orientated towards prophylaxis and remedies, an ensemble of attitudes that draw the attention of the researchers through the richness of their symbolism.\"",

And we blame ourselves both for things over which we exerted agential control (e.g., our voluntary acts) and for things over which we lacked such control (e.g., our desires, beliefs, and intentions). I argue that, despite this manifest diversity in our blaming practices, it's possible to provide a comprehensive account of blame. Indeed, I propose a set of necessary and sufficient conditions that aims to specify blame's extension in terms of its constitution as opposed to its function.

      "abstract": "The literature has sometimes portrayed queer/disabled people as the “Other.” People with disabilities and queer sexualities are frequently subject to ridicule and abuse. Historically, the literature has aided in the social constructionism of disability phenomena in society by depicting the disabled as someone harmful and undesirable. Furthermore, traditional representations of queer and/or disabled existence have frequently been biased and are usually about how the “able-bodied” or the so-called normal people perceive people with diverse bodies and queer sexualities. However, it has been conspicuously silent regarding the plight of people with disabilities and queer sexualities. In a departure from traditional representations of queer and/or disabled existence, Firdaus Kanga presents a first-hand account of the lived experiences of his precarious life in the Indian sociocultural context and beyond. He has to his credit a series of critically acclaimed books such as Trying to Grow (1990), Heaven on Wheels (1991), The Godmen (1995), and The Surprise Ending (1996). As a severely disabled individual suffering from a crippling disease called osteogenesis imperfecta (brittle bones disease), Trying to Grow (1990), a semiautobiographical novel, is a narrative of his lived experiences of disability and tryst with queer sexuality. While his other work, Heaven on Wheels (1991), is a discourse on queer sexuality and disability from the perspective of queer and disabled existence. Kanga critiques the ableist society’s treatment of the queer and the disabled, which is tantamount to human rights abuse.",

      "title": "Virtues of Willpower and Self-Possession",
      "abstract": "Abstract This chapter argues that the virtues of willpower (courage, self-control, patience, perseverance, etc.) put the self in possession of itself, and, since to be a self is (in part) to be in possession of oneself, are important in the very constitution of the self. The virtues of willpower are impulse-resisting personal strengths, excellent traits that enable their possessor to do work on his or her self. To be a self is (in part) to be an agent; to be an agent is to be an origin of one’s actions; and the power that enables such origination is choice. The person with the virtues of willpower exercises choice over the very self she is and thereby is an agent/origin/creator/owner of that self. In saying that humans have a role in creating themselves, we do not deny that we have been made by Another who has established the conditions of selfhood and to whom we are subject.",

      "title": "The direct perception hypothesis: perceiving the intention of another’s action hinders its precise imitation",
      "abstract": "We argue that imitation is a learning response to unintelligible actions, especially to social conventions. Various strands of evidence are converging on this conclusion, but further progress has been hampered by an outdated theory of perceptual experience. Comparative psychology continues to be premised on the doctrine that humans and nonhuman primates only perceive others’ physical ‘surface behavior’, while mental states are perceptually inaccessible. However, a growing consensus in social cognition research accepts the Direct Perception Hypothesis: primarily we see what others aim to do; we do not infer it from their motions. Indeed, physical details are overlooked – unless the action is unintelligible. On this basis we hypothesize that apes’ propensity to copy the goal of an action, rather than its precise means, is largely dependent on its perceived intelligibility. Conversely, children copy means more often than adults and apes because, uniquely, much adult human behavior is completely unintelligible to unenculturated observers due to the pervasiveness of arbitrary social conventions, as exemplified by customs, rituals, and languages. We expect the propensity to imitate to be inversely correlated with the familiarity of cultural practices, as indexed by age and/or socio-cultural competence. The Direct Perception Hypothesis thereby helps to parsimoniously explain the most important findings of imitation research, including children’s over-imitation and other species-typical and age-related variations.",

Each trait of the character of the individual should take into consideration his general external appearance and the nature of his abilities, decisions, motives, reactions, expertise, and the total values and attitudes that direct his behavior. The literary character is one of the imaginary or real individuals with whom the events of the novel or play deal. A number of values and traits are attributed to it, which can be discovered through the dialogue, the verbs and the description that the reader reads or hears. Like every human or non-human being that appeared in literature, whether individually or collectively, the character has a specific function in the story. Besides, it has physical, moral, and rational traits, which vary from one character to the other according to the function that is attributed to it, whether major or minor, and according to the literary genre in which it plays a certain role. In short, the character can be defined as the total traits that constitute the nature of the human being.",

      "abstract": "Unlike developments which imply an action, perfection is always a result of a frozen state since there is nothing beyond. In psychoanalytic and philosophical terms, perfection is close to the 'sublime' and more generally to the 'ideal'. One should mention that the quest for perfection is dangerous, not only for the individual who becomes inhibited, but also for the society when a leader can seduce masses through an ideology that offers the idea of achieved perfection. Ideology shows a deep belief in ideas of absolute perfection. It implies not only that criticism has been reduced to silence but also that the individual is no longer capable of being conscious of its own renouncement. Far from a loss of the ego in an ideal of perfection inhibiting or alienating, sublimation manages to achieve an erection or restoration of the ego following the acceptance of loss.",

Or, if you prefer, superstition is that sort of enchantment or magical power which fear exercises over our soul; the wretched daughter of the imagination, who attacks it with ghosts, dreams, and visions […] It crushes the mind, mainly with illness or adversity; it transforms good discipline & venerable customs into mummery & superficial ceremonies. Once it has put down deep roots in whatever religion it might be, good or bad, it is capable of extinguishing natural enlightenment ( les lumières naturelles ), & of troubling the soundest minds. In short, this is humanity's most terrible scourge. Even atheism destroys no natural sentiments, casts no slur on the laws, or on popular morals; but superstition is a despotic tyrant who makes everything surrender to its flights of fancy. Its prejudices are superior to all other prejudices. An atheist has an interest in the public tranquillity through a love of his own peace of mind; but fanatical superstition , born of a troubled imagination, overthrows empires […] Ignorance and barbarity usher in superstition , hypocrisy maintains it with useless ceremonies, false zeal propagates it, & self-interest perpetuates it. The hand of the monarch is unsure how to put the monster of superstition in chains, & it is from this monster, still more than from irreligion (inexcusable as it is) that the throne should fear for its authority […] Superstition , put into action, properly constitutes fanaticism, see FANATICISM; this is one of the finest and best articles in the Encyclopédie .

It is a familiar mental activity, sometimes involving great effort. But whether this effort produces results is uncertain. Long deliberation may be followed by an impulse to act that flies in the face of one's own good counsel. Despite doubts of this nature, most people who reflect on the matter have a strong desire to be in charge of themselves, however difficult the task and uncertain the outcome. Self, in western society, has become a central idea. It is the focus of an endless number of popular and academic books. Since the seventeenth century, it has become attached as a prefix to an increasing number of words, such as self-esteem. In sum, self is central to our beliefs, and in this important area of our life we do not want to be led – by authority, dogma, or false prophets. It is a journey we take alone whether or not we find ourselves surrendering control to others. It is widely supposed that we have to find ourselves.",

      "abstract": "“We all aspire to talk, to dialogue in a world shaken by multimedia communication, but which paradoxically establishes an impersonal silence. Everything happens as if we didn’t transmit the main point.” (Raoul Pantanella) Human groups organize and maintain themselves thanks to believes, opinions, prejudices common to all the members that make them up. However, not only the personality features of the subjects have repercussions over the group, but also the group influences the individual. Within the group, man learns to adopt an attitude towards the others, to time him to the circumstances, to see him in others – opportunity of personal probing, of rediscovering and awareness of the difference between what we believe we are and what we really are. As soon as man passes beyond the immediate knowledge, through sensations, as soon as he tears himself away from what it is given by the direct experience, by his memories, he disposes of two ways of drawing up explanations, of making assumptions and anticipations, of reasoning or imagining things. There are a logic of reasons and a logic of feelings; the last one – the most frequent in the individual and social life – is not a residuum of the other one, but it has a structure and a reason of its own. Man represents a complex informational and communicative structure. He emits, intercepts and remakes information; he is source and receiver in the same time. Physically and biologically programmed, he is source of information and receiver; he transmits, receives, remakes information and includes it into his own structures. He cannot live outside the communication, communication being the sense, the support and the reason of being. The content of communication, reflected by the way of thinking, by the logical rigour and correctness, by mental attitudes, represents the decisive factor, which gives sense and relevance to the communication. The psychic inner, culturally shaped, acquired through education and self-education, represents the real basis of the communication’s efficiency, succeed and success. In a certain way, relations are like games, having in view certain purposes and including rules, which define the roles the persons in relation with it must perform.",

That image has been consistent with the classical analytic role of the blank screen which discloses no personal facts, reveals no emotions, but simply mirrors the projections of the patient. But there has been an evolution in the conception of the role of the therapist mirror to participant observer to human being or, as Michels (1986) puts it, from authority to collaborator (p. 288). Each succeeding role does not displace the former, as in the Kuhnian (1962) sense of a succeeding paradigm overthrowing a former one, but rather exists alongside of the others. That is, most analysts seem to function in each role at some time with the same patient and to varying degrees with different patients. Of course, the analyst's theoretical allegiance might be expected to govern the predominance of one role over others. In any case, each succeeding role does involve a greater degree of involvement on the part of the analyst than the former one.",

      "title": "Rhetoric and Reality: Nomenclature and Notoriety",
      "abstract": "\"We spin a web of dreams in our mind; the silken rainbow threads make us blind; and so we travel on, but we never find; the things in life we left behind1\" The act of naming establishes a power relationship between \"namer\" and \"named\". In the patriarchal tradition, for instance, man's dominion over the rest of nature was symbolized by the privilege of naming \"all the cattle and the fowl of the heavens and all the beasts of the field.\"2 We bestow names not only on our children, but on our pets, properties and subordinates. The terms \"Nabinyagan\" or \"Nabansagan\" refer to the informal process of such social assignations. The \"namer\" assumes dominance in the relationship over the \"named.\" The process is not reciprocal (at least not overtly). In Filipino culture, as in other vertically-oriented societies, subordinates/youth do not address superiors/elders solely by name, but by appending a title denoting the relationship between both parties (Lolo/Lola Tatay/Nanay, Tiyo/Tiya, Kuya/Ate, Diko/Ditse, Sanko/Sanse, Sir/Ma'am) Such practices are less evident in more horizontally oriented socio-cultural contexts such as North America, where grandparents and parents-in-law may be addressed by their first name alone. The act of naming may also define3 (de, \"completely\" + finire, \"to limit, set bounds, end\") reality for the bestower. Whether such nomenclature pertains to stars and planets, taxonomies of flora and fauna, the pharmacopoeia or computer language, recognition and use of a name allow one to understand it and to know some of its secrets. Like a magic key, using a name unlocks a relationship between the user and the person, animal or object named. Agreement on and shared use of such \"rhetoric\" by other observers constitutes \"objectification\" of what would hitherto be \"subjective\" reality, but may also promote \"shared delusion\" as was the case with the proverbial \"Emperor's New Clothes.\"4 In such a situation, courage can hardly begin to describe the one who dares speak out, as he or she promptly becomes fair game for those who would prefer the delusions of darkness to the harsh realities of light. And prophets and bearers of bad news are notoriously unwelcome in their own country. As is the case with any organization, professional associations are made up of individuals and aggrupations bound by shared interests as much as (or more than) by shared friendships. These shared interests find expression in shared terminologies, while concealing self-serving agendas. What happens when rhetoric does not match reality? To call a spade a spade may be considered \"impolite\" and \"undiplomatic,\" yet coming \"out of the mouths of babes\" is refreshingly, disarmingly direct. Such requires the childlike ability to say things as they are, without rancor or hidden agenda. How often do we encounter empty words and phrases, devoid of meaning because the realities they supposedly point to do not really exist? How often do we ourselves silently conspire, by omission if not commission, to uphold such vacuous rhetoric? And in so doing, how much of our power do we invest in and ascribe to that which does not really exist? Does the fact that there are many of us sharing the same delusions make us less deluded? Were we more transparent in our dealings, would reality be more apparent? _________________________________ This issue pays tribute to three colleagues who passed away this year, and coinciding with the 12th Asian Research Research Symposium in Rhinology, features a meta-analysis on intranasal corticosteroids for the medical management of nasal polyps in adults, a case report of intravascular lymphoma of the inferior turbinate, a grand rounds discussion of rhinophyma, a histopathologic case of sinonasal teratoid carcinosarcoma and practice pearls on nasal saline lavage.

      "title": "“Mind to Mind”: Tolkien’s Faërian Drama and the Middle English Sir Orfeo",
      "abstract": "“Mind to Mind”:Tolkien’s Faërian Drama and the Middle English Sir Orfeo1 Kelley M. Wickham-Crowley (bio) Now “Faërian Drama”—those plays, which according to abundant records the elves have often presented to men—can produce Fantasy with a realism and immediacy beyond the compass of any human mechanism. As a result their usual effect (upon a man) is to go beyond Secondary Belief. If you are present at a Faërian drama you yourself are, or think that you are, bodily inside its Secondary World. The experience may be very similar to Dreaming and has (it would seem) sometimes (by men) been confounded with it. But [in Faërian Drama you are in a dream that some other mind is weaving, and] the knowledge of that alarming fact may slip from your grasp. …2 You are deluded—whether that is the intention of the elves (always or at any time) is another question. They at any rate are not themselves deluded. This is for them a form of Art, and distinct from Wizardry or Magic, properly so called. They do not live in it, though they can, perhaps, afford to spend more time at it than human artists can. The Primary World, Reality, of elves and men is the same, if differently valued and perceived. (OFS 63, ¶74) … faierie a state of being in which the will can more or less directly cause things imagined or desired actually to be, or can at least present them to the senses; and the very immediacy of the operation enhances the quality of the product: beautiful things produced by faierie retain the beauty of the vision that precedes the making … (OFS 255) Between every two trees is a doorway to a new world. (Attributed to John Muir)3 J.R.R. Tolkien’s foundational theories of “On Fairy-stories” include the coining of the term “eucatastrophe,” the definition of subcreation, a term first implied by George MacDonald4 though without the expansion Tolkien gave it, and the concept of Secondary Belief in a created Secondary World. But another phrase, Faërian drama, has gone mainly undiscussed as a literary term except in some of Verlyn Flieger’s work,5 perhaps for obvious reasons. It appears as a somewhat peculiar [End Page 1] reference to what fairies/elves might create as art but becomes a springboard for philosophical and metaphysical considerations of how two created species with inherently different minds might communicate what is most central to their experience of the world. On one level, “On Fairy-stories” is a manifesto, as Verlyn Flieger has rightly called it (“Fairy-tale” 27). It does not simply attempt to discuss the terms, rules, and history of what are commonly called fairy tales; it declares Fantasy the highest form of human literary art because, motivated by a desire to be closer to the original creator of worlds, it attempts in its subcreated worlds to imitate that maker. It offers reasons why the desire to tell a story that gives us new ways to see the world, that turns unexpectedly to joy, is central to any being and its health, but even more, central to the created world and its purpose. Within an essay with such a sweeping context for human art, then, Faërian drama initially seems paradoxically important and a minor aside. Tolkien invites us to acknowledge that “fairy-stories” are really human stories about Faërie and its immortals, and asserts that Faërie in its own art would consider humans and mortality as similarly puzzling and alien. Both bodies of stories would inevitably be partial and sometimes in error, constrained by the minds and natures of each. Of what use then, perhaps especially in an academic essay, is an imagined art and genre for an equally imagined or even nonexistent race of artists? The key here is Tolkien’s refusal to separate his scholarly and intellectual interests from his urge, as a created being, to create fiction and fictional settings that command credibility. He had to work out the metaphysical possibilities of Faërie art, constituted by him here under the term “Faërian drama,” to create his own...",

A courtesan, on the contrary, has relations with several men, and this renders her ineligible as a conjugal partner. For the courtesan, more¬ over, love is a business, and whatever the romantic feelings that may occasionally be attributed to her, her relationships with men are in the first instance commercial. This is the basis for the common characterization of the hetaera as greedy. Marriage stands outside such mercantile transactions. Far from being acquisitive, the marriageable woman seems almost to be devoid of motives altogether. She is the object of another’s desire, and it is she who is transferred from one party to another in the conjugal transaction. The courtesan engages as an agent in the sphere of economic circulation, selling the use of herself to a purchaser, while the bride is passively given, along with a dowry, by her father or nearest male relative to the authority of her husband.",

      "title": "Natural Duties and the Duty to Obey the Law",
      "abstract": "The failure of Transactional and Associative theories to explain the source of a general duty to obey domestic law pushes us to explore other possibilities. In particular, since the moral duty to obey seems to many a relatively basic, natural, nonvoluntary feature of social life, it seems initially promising to suppose that the moral principle that accounts for this duty belongs to that group of principles that specifies our natural moral duties. Natural Duty theories of the duty to obey the law, as we have seen, are those that ground our duty to obey not in who we are (as in Associative accounts) or in what we've done or enjoyed (as in Transactional accounts), but rather either (a) in the moral importance of advancing some impartial moral good or (b) in some moral duty thought to be owed by all persons to all others as moral equals, regardless of roles, relationships, or transactions. Thus, the natural duty in question, from which the duty to obey is to be derived, could be a consequentialist moral duty to promote or maximize the occurrence of some good property or state of affairs – such as happiness (utility, preference satisfaction, etc.), moral perfection, or justice.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Recovering nature is not only about connecting to the outer nature, but also about connecting to each person’s inner nature, starting with one’s own body. Human nature is what defines a human being regardless of gender, origin, or culture. It includes the biological characteristics of the human body, but also the fundamental human needs, which ignore the traditional separation of body and mind altogether. Needs can be seen from two opposing perspectives: the traditional Judeo-Christian perspective of unsatisfied needs, linked to lack and poverty, or that of satisfied needs, linked to fulfillment and flourishing. Experience shows that recognizing, naming, accepting, and embracing fundamental human needs, experiencing their power and beauty, is a source of joy and richness, not of misery and poverty. For fundamental needs are what connects humans to the general movement of life that flows through them and transcends them.",

      "title": "Love and Moral Structures",
      "abstract": "This entry sketches ways in which placing love at morality's center—where love is conceived as various forms of good will—can point the way to a number of attractive and new (or neglected) options for moral theorists. These include treating virtues as internal and basic to both duty and value; relativizing all our moral virtues, obligations, and so on, to certain role-relationships we fill in persons' lives; focusing on actions' and attitudes' \"patients\" (understood as the people to whom anyone's occupying such relationships connects); and morally categorizing actions, including whether they are obligatory, forbidden, or merely permitted on the grounds of their agents' motivations rather than the actions' results. Such virtues basing, as we can call it, offers an appealing alternative to seeing either duty or the valuable as conceptually basic, and, indeed, regarding love as the form of our major moral virtues helps answer enduring questions about how to analyze each of them. Similarly, love is always of someone, the beloved (object of love) and, when theorists focus on these patients of loving actions, seeing the action's licitness as its lovingness to that Other within the role, they can recognize the real determinants of moral status not in self-interest, nor in optimization of the world condition, but in the agent's resolve to act helpfully. Likewise, as virtues, the various forms of love such as truthfulness (that is, willing one's auditor the good of true belief) or respect (i.e., willing someone such goods of personhood as self-governance) are features having which tends to make the loving person good within one or more of her relevant role-relationships: a good friend, for instance, or good as a spouse, or simply a good \"neighbor\" in the Christians' sense. That suggests a relational conception of moral life wherein any virtue or vice or duty that someone has is one that she has in some person-to-person role. In addition, whether an action, or emotional reaction, is loving is shaped by what is the moral subject's and agent's mind; such an input-driven account of actions' morality stands against any even partially consequence-dependent account of moral right and wrong. These options involve moral structures in either the sense that they reveal the logical structure of an important kind of moral judgment, or the sense that they disclose which, among the moral concepts and judgments, stand as fundamental and which derive from those bases.",

Though consumer culture seems to provide the raw materials necessary for self-construction using the meaning-making and signaling capabilities of products and brands, consumption-based projects of self-creation will likely falter because of structural features of desire-formation in that setting. For projects of self-creation to be meaningful, the choices about what kind of identity to form must (1) flow from reflective processes and (2) be based on grounds that the agent him or herself can endorse—two conditions necessary for self-governing agency. Yet desires in consumer culture are often hardened into what Kant calls “passions,” a kind of desire that precludes and overcomes reflective processes thus undermining the self-governing agency that is required for self-construction.",

      "title": "Architecture [Caring about Places]",
      "abstract": "Caring about Places: Architecture Architecture, the deliberately made physical structure of place, creates opportunities for people to position themselves in space, in time, and in the order of things. To choose one's position in space is one of the continuing ubiquitous pleasures in life, a pleasure that we seek instinctively throughout the day. To be next to something (someone), to be above or below, behind or in front, inside or outside, are existential conditions that give distinct qualities to our actions. T o look out over, to shelter within, to rest against, to stand up to and to face directly are actions we can imagine, actions with generic significance that we all understand. To be able to choose among such conditions is part of being able to be human. We should imbue our buildings and landscapes with occasions for choice. Functionalism and determinism, not modernism, prescribe specific limited actions in a building—for whatever good or evil purposes—and deny, thereby, the expressive potential of relationships between people and things. O f course we do more in a building, in life, than stand about. Architecture, properly done, enables us to reflect upon our position, to imagine our relationship to the building, not just to act it out, and to see the acts of others reflected in a building's form. Architecture has the capacity to nurture our attention, to bring things to mind, to strike associations, and to reward curiosity. Architecture gives us places to inhabit, to make a part of our lives. To take position is a figure of speech used more often w i t h ideas than with things. We take position on the issues of the day, align ourselves for or against the large scale forces and purposes of society. Architects and architecture do that, too. A n d we should do it deliberately. H o w our buildings provide choice for people, what attentions they nurture, w h o m they serve, and to w h o m they can belong, are cultural and political questions of consequence. The positions we take on those questions are embedded in the places we build and give rise to their form. We consider it necessary for architecture to bring attention to people and to place: to make places that are filled w i t h opportunities to choose, that are visibly related to human actions, that sustain detailed attention, that can belong to those w h o use them, and that are related always to the larger place of which they form a part.

      "title": "Through Thick and Thin: Mele on Autonomy",
      "abstract": "Since interest in autonomy, for most thinkers, is grounded in a desire to know the extent to which we limited creatures can approximate this ideal, a balance must be struck between the principle that an autonomous agent must be free to adopt or reject just about any value, principle, or end and the facts of human existence that must temper our desire to honor the principle. For example, since adherence to rational principles is in general the most efficient way to achieve our purposes, there would be something incoherent about goal-oriented creatures like ourselves eschewing entirely the most reliable way of achieving their goals. Hence, autonomous agents cannot choose to be thoroughly irrational. In general, however, as Alfred Mele insists, we must look not to the content of a person's values or desires, but rather to their derivation.' If we possess attitudes or desires that we cannot shed, our autonomy is undermined if they were produced in ways that bypassed our capacities for control over our mental lives, if, in Mele's terms, they were the result of compulsion. Conceding the need for virtually unlimited leeway with respect to content, I would, nevertheless, opt for a thicker conception of autonomy than Mele's. For we need elaborate but slightly on the conception of ourselves as creatures born into a world in which we must make choices, choices that will both form and reflect our attitudes and values. These choices will determine the manner of our engagement with the world and the extent of our satisfaction with this engagement. Whether we choose the life of a social worker or a monk, a civic leader or a recluse, we will be immersed in circumstances and relationships whose nature can fulfill or frustrate our purposes. And just as the heteronomy of a slave is grounded on his dependence on external forces that may potentially thwart his goals, so may the heteronomy of an ostensibly independent person be grounded on the operative force of barriers imposed by his own physiological, psychological, and cognitive limitations.

      "title": "Aristotelian Friendship: Self-Love and Moral Rivalry",
      "abstract": "IN THE FIRST SEVERAL PARAGRAPHS of Nicomachean Ethics 9.8, Aristotle asks whether a man should love himself most (NE 1168a28),(1) and asserts that say that one ought to love best one's best (1168b1). Yet earlier (1159a27) Aristotle describes loving more essential to friendship than being loved; furthermore, he emphasizes that a man wishes well to his friend his friend's sake, a means to his own happiness (1155b31). Note also Aristotle's continued emphasis upon man a political animal. In the Politics well the Nicomachean Ethics, Aristotle describes the biological, even instinctive tendency of humans to seek each other's company. He considers absurd a man even to imagine living alone, since without no one would choose to live, though he had all other goods (1155a5-6). It only the human animal, however, who even capable of that genuine friendship which, although rare (1156b25), Aristotle considers not only necessary but also noble; . . . we think the same people that are good men and are friends (1155a28-31); these are alike in their excellence (1156b7), one loving as being the man he is (1156a11). We would argue that this implies that in loving a friend men thereby choose what good themselves: for the good man in becoming a friend becomes a good to his (1157b28-31), and, simultaneously, his friend a good to him. Aristotle states that the recognition of my friend's good character (known by his actions) that incites me, so to speak, to wish him whatever good. The same true in the other direction. Aristotle adds: it mutually known to them that well-wishing of this kind [also] reciprocated (1156a3-5). Just what are we wishing our friend? If one values the person and his welfare, should one take care to discern how best to serve him? It seems evident that the well-wisher (and well-doer) in a genuine friendship by definition cannot make serious blunders or be greatly unskilled. A developed sensitivity to needs seems assured. After all, one must know what the friend wants: genuine friendship requires time and familiarity to become established (1156b26). Friends trust only one another, but also (and especially) each other's ability to recognize and even anticipate what each does in fact need.(2) What each wants--being good, hence consistent (and weak-willed)--is that which good the other. That which good him precisely what good the well-wisher, he self. Since one's friend similarly a good man, one chooses him what one would wish oneself. The in Friendship. What kind of another the good man's friend? It noteworthy that Aristotle employs the noun (autos) very seldom, and only in his ethical treatises. Moreover, only in the chapters on friendship that Aristotle refers to self (allos autos) or considers self-love (philautia). Self Aristotle uniformly describes the human agent responsible his choices, the originating source of his own conduct. The term central to Aristotle's analysis of friendship. Self, we conclude, underlies the notion of what one when being a friend of the genuine sort, and what goes on in this friendship, namely, self-loving. Whenever one friend acts (and desires to act) his friend's sake, this definitive of genuine friendship (Rhetoric 1361b35-40). For Aristotle, to be aware of one's friend in effect to be that friend, by means of one's own activity of knowing him; one thereby knows one's self. In order to be able to know myself friend, however, I must recognize my self in my friend, becoming identical, so to speak, with him. I thereby become aware that he self while recognizing that I am one just like him, self. Aristotle's notion of self that of an impersonal, objective or transcendent mind; rather, the self simply the individual who thinks, acts, has affections, wishes, and chooses. …",

The experience of fear is the immediate subjective experience of apprehension marked by activation of the fight or flight response. The experience of fear is best understood on the basis of its principle function. According to Seligman (1971), “the great majority of phobias are about object(s) of natural importance to the survival of the species.” In the most severe of circumstances (e.g., in the presence of a fast‐approaching predator), fear activates the organism to flee or battle for its life. A less severe illustration of fear function is seen in day‐to‐day social interactions in which individuals avoid saying or doing embarrassing things in order to prevent social rejection or maintain companionship.",

      "abstract": "My topic in this essay is the comparative moral value of self-interest and altruism. I take self-interest to consist in a positive attitude toward one's own good and altruism to consist in a similar attitude toward the good of others, and I assess these attitudes within a general theory of the intrinsic value of attitudes toward goods and evils. The first two sections of the essay apply this theory in a simple form, one that treats self-interest and altruism symmetrically. The third section examines whether the theory can be revised to accommodate an apparent asymmetry in our common-sense thinking about self-interested and altruistic attitudes. I will start by assuming that each person has a good, or that certain states of the person are intrinsically desirable and others undesirable. Of course, philosophers have disagreed for centuries about what this good consists in, or what particular states are desirable. Welfarists take each person's good to consist in pleasure, the fulfillment of her preferences, or something describable as “welfare” or “happiness.” Perfectionists hold that certain states of a person are good apart from any connection with happiness. Thus, some perfectionists hold that knowledge, achievement, and deep personal relations are good independently of how much a person wants or enjoys them. For the purposes of this essay it does not matter much which initial claims about the good we accept. To discuss issues about self-interest and altruism we need only some initial theory of each person's good, whatever its specific content. Consequently, and to cover as many bases as possible, I will start by assuming a mixed welfarist-perfectionist theory of the good, one claiming that pleasure, knowledge, and achievement are all intrinsically good.",

      "abstract": "The human body constructs itself into a person by becoming attuned to the affective consequences of its actions in social relationships. Norms develop that ground perception and action, providing standards for appraising conduct. The body finds itself motivated to enact itself as a character in the drama of life, carving from its beliefs, intentions, and experiences a unique identity and perspective. If a biological body can construct itself into a person by exploiting social mechanisms, could an electromechanical body, a robot, do the same? To qualify for personhood, a robot body must be able to construct its own identity, to assume different roles, and to discriminate in forming friendships. Though all these conditions could be considered benchmarks of personhood, the most compelling benchmark, for which the above mentioned are prerequisites, is the ability to sustain long-term relationships. Long-term relationships demand that a robot continually recreate itself as it scripts its own future. This benchmark may be contrasted with those of previous research, which tend to define personhood in terms that are trivial, subjective, or based on assumptions about moral universals. Although personhood should not in principle be limited to one species, the most humanlike of robots are best equipped for reciprocal relationships with human beings",

He thereby demonstrates that the most important thing for happiness is not to have a good friend in another but to have the right stance toward oneself and the capacity to secure what is good for oneself, especially for one's soul or mind. Aristotle does not bend his efforts to making the case that all men in fact love themselves most of all, although he clearly indicates that they do. For showing that all the actual men that we know love themselves most would not prove that the rarest and best man, leading the best possible life, might not love others more. Instead, he makes the more radical claim that the greatest self-love is characteristic of the very best people, even or especially in their moments of seemingly greatest self-sacrifice; and what is more, that the truest form of self-love, in the best individuals, does in fact take precedence over everything and everyone else. In the process, Aristotle illuminates the difference between the self-love of ordinary people and that of the most moral citizens, while prompting some reflections upon the self-love of a third group, the philosophic souls who possess complete self-understanding.",

The main factors in an abnormal environment are: psychological (isolation, sensory deprivation, sensory overload, sleep deprivation, temporal disorientation); psychophysiological (thermal, stress positions), and psychosocial (cultural humiliation, sexual degradation). Each single factor may not be considered tortuous, however, if deliberately structured into a systemic cluster may constitute torture under legal definition.

      "title": "The Equal Moral Weight of Self- and Other-Regarding Acts",
      "abstract": "Self-regarding acts are frequently classified as non-moral; even more frequently, they are assumed to have less moral weight than parallel other-regarding acts. I argue briefly against the first claim, and at greater length against the second. Our intuitions about the lesser moral weight of self-regarding acts arise from imperfectly recognized, and morally relevant, differences between acts which are ordinarily described in misleadingly parallel phrases. ‘Love of self,’ for instance, and ‘love of another’ are not symmetrical attitudes, in spite of the symmetrical grammar. More obviously, one cannot steal from, lie to, nor force oneself in the same way one can do these things to others. I conclude, therefore, that difference in moral weight never stems merely from a difference in the person concerned (myself or another), but rather from differences between the actions themselves; furthermore, that whatever it is wrong to do to a willing other, it is wrong to do to oneself.",

To struggle is painstaking, hut he intends to achieve the possibility of living to the hilt in spite of failure of death. Even if he is bound to destruction, he insists on being destroyed on his own terms. He sticks to his own codes in order to exist authentically and die with dignity. His insistence on authentic significance and ”grace under pressure” in a God-abandoned universe bears resemblance to atheistic existentialism.\nMan and beast are contrasted as intelligence and nobility. What distinguishes man, apart from his intelligence? The capacity for hope, probably. 'But man is not made for defeat. A man can be destroyed but not defeated'. Hope is a duty of man. Without it his intelligence would merely be balanced by the beast's courage and strength, and he would suffer defeat as frequently as achieved victory. He must regard the capacity for hope as one of his most precious possessions. But he must not be arrogant or unchivalrous.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Many objects that we encounter have ‘typical’ material qualities: spoons are hard, pillows are soft, and jell-O dessert is wobbly. Over a lifetime of experiences, strong associations between an object and its typical material properties may be formed, and these associations not only include how glossy, rough or pink an object is, but also how it behaves under force: we expect knocked over vases to shatter, popped bike tires to deflate, and gooey grilled cheese to hang between two slices of bread when pulled apart. Here we ask how such rich visual priors affect the visual perception of material qualities and present a particularly striking example of expectation violation. In a cue conflict design, we pair computer-rendered familiar objects with surprising material behaviors (a linen curtain shattering, a porcelain teacup wrinkling, etc.) and find that material qualities are not solely estimated from the object’s kinematics (i.e. its physical (atypical) motion while shattering, wrinkling, wobbling etc.); rather, material appearance is sometimes “pulled” towards the “native” motion, shape, and optical properties that are associated with this object. Our results, in addition to patterns we find in response time data, suggest that visual priors about materials can set up high-level expectations about complex future states of an object and show how these priors modulate material appearance.",

Psychopathic behavior or maladjustment is strongly indicative of trial-and-error attempts to utilize the constantly accumulating energy generated in the presence of a stress situation for which the individual possesses no adequate outlet. Consequently, otherwise normal reactions become overcharged with energy and result in anti-social modes of response, or else less adequate responses are utilized to relieve the tension state. The fault lies in the type of behavior utilized rather than in any fundamental physio-organic disorder. Since all social behavior is learned there is great hope for the ultimate elimination and prevention of antisocial modes of conduct now designated as emotional in nature.

      "abstract": "<title>Abstract</title> Many philosophers and psychologists have made claims about the feelings in an experience of beauty. Here, we test how well these claims match the feelings that people report while looking at an image or listening to music that is beautiful to them, or recalling a personal experience of beauty. We conducted ten experiments (total n = 851) spanning three nations (US, UK, and India). Across nations and modalities, we find that top-rated beauty experiences are strongly characterized by six dimensions: intense pleasure, an impression of universality, the wish to continue the experience, perceived harmony in variety, exceeding expectation, and meaningfulness. Other frequently proposed beauty characteristics — like surprise, desire to understand, and mind wandering — are uncorrelated with feeling beauty. When explicitly asked, participants in all countries report that beauty is closely related to pleasure, found in nature rather than art, influenced by mood, and a form of communication. A remembered beautiful experience was typically active and social, like a family holiday, quite unlike the passive solitary appraisal of art emphasized in aesthetics. Our data align well with Kant (r = 0.74) and psychological theories that emphasize pleasure, and reject theories that emphasize information seeking. These six dimensions characterizing how individuals feel beauty emerge from the reports of hundreds of people seeing, hearing, or remembering something beautiful to them.",

      "title": "Perfectionism, value pluralism, and the human good",
      "abstract": "What makes for a good life? If you have a child, a spouse, or a very close friend you probably want what is best for her. However, in order to know what would be best for your loved one you need an account of the personal good. I argue for a version of value pluralism, according to which there is disparate list of fundamental goods which resist reduction to some single supervalue such as pleasure and lack any strong unifying principle. I argue that any adequate account of the human good must include pleasure and freedom from pain, knowledge and understanding, practical rationality, and proper emotional responsiveness as fundamental goods, and that the only thing these various goods have in common is their intrinsic goodness. Value pluralism is an alternative to various kinds of monism about the good, such as hedonism, perfectionism, and the desire-satisfaction theory. Hedonism explains the value of any putative good in terms of pleasure, while perfectionism sees the good in terms of the development and exercise of those capacities or characteristics essential to some aspect of our nature. Desire- satisfaction views are best considered a form of monism about the good, since their identification of one's good with the satisfaction of one's desires offers a way of unifying various goods. The battle between monistic and pluralistic accounts is usefully analyzed in terms of competing theoretical virtues such as unity, simplicity, explanatory coherence, and plausibility. Monistic accounts typically score high along the first three of these dimensions and quite low along the last. I consider what I take to be the most promising versions of value monism, and argue that each scores so low along the dimension of plausibility that it should be rejected in favor of value pluralism. I begin by considering hedonism and the desire- satisfaction view and then discuss two distinct versions of perfectionism. Hedonism and perfectionism, in particular, are implausible because they fail to recognize our complex natures as embodied rational agents, and our need for a vision of the good which is correspondingly complex. In the final chapter I offer just such an account",

To introduce Confucianism by means of the notion of self-inquiry is only to contend that the personal disposition to seek a meaningful connection between one's inner life and the external world is fundamental to the living out of a religious life. Benevolence towards one's self as well as towards others is what one may gradually realize through the ceaseless process of self-inquiry, and it is usually sparked by an affective response to suffering in others. As Mencius famously puts it in the case of one who happens to see a child about to fall into a well, \"one's heart/mind would be filled with alarm, distress, pity and compassion, not because one wanted to get in the good graces of the child's parents, nor because one wished to win the praise of neighbours and friends, nor because one disliked cry of child\".",

For these two things follow one another in such a way that whenever an obligation arises in one person a corresponding right springs up in another, since it is impossible to understand how I can be obligated to furnish something unless someone is able to demand it or, at least, properly to receive it from me. Yet the reverse, that a right in one person is immediately followed by an obligation in another, is not always the case (as, for example, while there is in rulers a right to exact punishment, the guilty are not obligated to submit to it), unless we are willing to say the following: A right, if taken narrowly as a faculty and competence to have something, always corresponds to an obligation in another; not always, however, if it denotes a faculty to do something.",

An ongoing question in the philosophy of love is whether we love another in recognition of his value, or whether we confer value upon him through loving him.

The other is a social construction that is necessary to serve the political function of organizing society. Accurate information about the other is not necessary to serve this political function. The realityof the other, to the extent it exists, lies within the self and not within any external experiential world. 3. The Other Cannot Define Itself The other, as a social construct, does change, but it changes at the behest of the self. When the self changes, the other changes. The other is an object acted on by the center/self. It is fixed vis-a-vis the self. The other cannot define itself. It is defined by the self. This is what makes the act of self-definition by outsider communities so destabilizing to the existing order. Those who exist in the subordinate position of the hierarchy cannot name and define for themselves without usurping the power of the dominant and ripping the hierarchical structure of self and other apart. 4. The Other Is To Be Feared and Controlled As a manifestation of difference, the other is perceived as a threat. As a threat, the other must be controlled. The establishment of an elaborate structure of control then becomes a necessity. It is necessary because the very concept of otherness symbolically demands it, even if the individual or group marked as other poses no real threat at all. 131.

      "abstract": "Being-seen-by-the-other is the truth of seeing-the-other. Jean-Paul Same The Self and the Other Hegel has written, exists in itself and for itself, in that, and by the fact that it exists for another self-consciousness.1 The meaning of one's existence is relational, and in every respect we are dependent upon others for our identity. Our own self-consciousness attains to the truth of its self-consciousness only through achieving its recognition by the other person.2 According to Hegel, we resent this dependence upon others for the meaning of who we are, and find in this dependence an alienation. This resentment and alienation cause us to inaugurate a struggle with the Other over the power to control these socially determined definitions. Self-consciousness has lost its own self, since it finds itself as an other being.3 In the dialectics of our social life we are continually being confronted with another self that is our self, yet is the property of another, related to an Other's being, and different from that self we had been accustomed to claiming as our own. Somehow our self has come outside us and confronts us as the possession of another. But it is not as if I was in possession of myself in the beginning. At the outset, I was able to locate my self only as the reflection of others' recognitions; I have always been lost. According to Hegel and his commentators, life is a project of uniting myself with a self that I have never fully possessed and can never fully possess, yet a great deal of social conflict is motivated by the obsession to obtain full control over this self. This is an effort that is doomed to failure, and the brilliance of Hegel's analysis lies in his account of the impossibility of success, of the contradictions of these common social pursuits, and of the impossibility of hegemony. I do not, and cannot, control my own self. I see my self in the other, just as the other sees him- or herself in me. No self-consciousness exists alone, but each exists for the other. is the mediating term to the other, through which each mediates and unites itself with itself.4 As other people are recognizing me, I am recognizing them. Each is dependent upon the other, but dependent for what?-for the truth of one's being. In the Phaedrus Socrates remarked that the lover is one's mirror in whom one beholds oneself. That is, when I love another, what I am really in love with is myself, with this marvelous reflection that the other provides for me. The enormous pain of separation is not so much the loss of the Other as it is the loss of one's self. Objectifying the Other Just as we wish to affiliate with some static unity of our self (believing it to be a reunion when in fact one's self is always derivative), we pursue a static recognition of the Other. We objectify the identity of the Other, while the Other is engaged in a task of objectifying us. is quite indifferent to the objectification of the Other but very sensitive to others' objectifications of us and the manner in which they rob us of our being. One does not see the other as an essential being but in the other sees only one's own self.5 Each subject objectifies the Other, i.e., each subject produces an object. Following such objectification a competition takes place over the enforcement of these recognitions. expects (even requires) others to conform to these objectifications; and to a great extent they do, as do we. It is in part by acting out others' objectifications of us that we discover who we are. The dialectic consists of the objectifications being appropriated but being modified as they are being applied. Such modifications lead to new recognitions, new objectifications, which are again adjusted and revised. Despite the instability of these objectifications there is a compulsion to stabilize them. But the Other's objectifications of us cannot be stabilized until the Other him/herself is stabilized. …",

      "abstract": "Both not seeing what is perfectly visible and seeing something other than what is there are surprisingly common occurrences in our normal perceptual lives. One is a case of phenomenal invisibility, while the other is case of misperception. When we do not see what is there or see something other than what is there, it is frequently the result of the same visual processes that are responsible for our seeing what is there. These phenomena are discussed and the parallel between one of them, inattentional blindness, our failure to see what is there when we are not paying attention to it, is likened to our failure to see those we consider \"other\" revealing how our prejudices influence what we see and what we don’t.",

      "abstract": "I USE here not (in the first instance) in the sense of not harming or not intending to harm, but in the sense of not being accountable for the consequences (possibly harmful, although this is no longer essential to the meaning of the term) of not having knowledge one does not happen to have-knowledge that one might have or even be expected or assumed to have. Innocence in this sense is not the same thing as ignorance, but it presupposes ignorance. Of course the two senses are connected, since it was tasting the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge that constituted the traditional first loss of innocence, but that is not a line I wish to follow here, even though it is not without relevance to the issues I shall be discussing. There are some things one can't come to know without losing one's innocence in some respect or other-coming to know which reveals hitherto unrealized possibilities of error, either already committed (as in the evangelical conviction of sin) or encountered for the first time, whether as risk or temptation. Such knowledge may be disquieting, but it may also be liberating, since error does not necessarily ensue, nor is it the only new possibility. In this short article I want to deal with a kind of knowledge of language, which has consequences for the understanding of literature, that I think falls under this description. A useful paradigm case of loss of innocence in the sense I mean, and that I have described elsewhere, is something that happens frequently in the history of individual religious belief. Somebody growing up in a closed community, and learning only one set of beliefs, may die in the faith without ever having felt a challenge to it. But just knowing that an alternative set of beliefs exists and is held, let us say, by infidels may start a chain of thought like this: here are two sets of beliefs that contradict one another; they cannot both be true, so one of them must be false; but if one is false the other may be false also, so there may be no true belief. Language has this in common with religious belief, that the one we start with is characteristically that of the culture we grow up in, and it may be a long time before we grasp the significance of the fact that there are others. It need not ever be grasped: people (English tourists on the Continent used to be one of the stock examples) can observe that foreigners",

      "abstract": "A symbol usually represents an object, concept or thought. In the case of ‘magic’ the word does not stand for something; it does not represent a certain object, but rather presents a certain meaning. The meaning itself may be manifold. Magic can be performed, and it can have consequences – if you believe in it. Individuals may have certain superstitions, or they might wear lucky charms. When did you last throw a penny into a fountain? Even if one does not believe in magic or has never performed magical practices, certain incidents may still lack a rational explanation. When falling in love, for example, one might feel as if one is under someone’s ‘spell’. If we actually believed that a spell was laid upon an individual, the articulation of linguistic forms would be ‘endow[ed] … with the potency of real objects or actions’. But do we really ‘believe’ in magic? Is it not only something for the ‘primitive’ mind? In this article, it will be shown that the belief in magic has not (yet) disappeared, and that it may even be of protective value for an individual’s well-being.",

That is to say, an identification via projective identification has taken place, which heightens intrinsic omnipotence, to allow what has been termed the identificate to believe that it has become the desired object--and thereby that within this spuriously organized ego-structure exist the characteristics and functions of the object or part object that has been taken over. Varying forms of such identificatory process are illustrated. The functions of these 'successful defence' manoeuvres are to obviate any feelings of an awareness of envy, although they may be overtly envious attacks within themselves, secondly they nullify any awareness of dependence, and also nullify awareness of need and illness, and thirdly they maintain the narcissistic organization by producing a successful identificate.",

For people absorbed in mourning, cases of depression, or people with autistic characteristics, the perception of movements that are too rapid or unpredictable and displacements can cause spatial fears that make them unavailable for the relation. Identification and relationship become possible if the therapist is attuned to their rhythm, usually very slow and delicate. Comments on the interior experiences also help to regulate experiences that are too intense or fracturing, either at a sensory, emotional, or relationship level. For people that are somehow “transparent” and cannot manifest themselves, the reactions are first delayed, before they become synchronized.",

This chapter begins with the proposal that to be genuinely with one another, persons must be jointly aware of their mutual openness to mutual relating. It follows that being-with is a second-personal phenomenon in the sense discussed in SPS. People who are with each other are in one another's presence, where the latter involves a second-personal standing or authority, as in the divine presence, or the king's. To be with someone is therefore to give the other second-personal standing, implicitly, to claim it for oneself, and therefore to enter into a relation of mutual accountability. Second-personal relating requires a distinctive form of empathy, projective empathy, through which we imaginatively occupy others' perspectives and view ourselves from their point of view.",

It is a contrast which has been ignored by much modern philosophy of mind which has seen desire as a component of all actions, and the reasons for all actions as involving desires of various kinds. The ignoring of the distinction between desire and the active component in every action (call it ‘trying’ or ‘seeking’ or ‘having a volition’) leads a man to suppose that he can no more help doing what he does than he can help his desires. But ‘desires’, in the normal ordinary language sense of the word, are natural inclinations to actions of certain sorts with which we find ourselves. We cannot (immediately) help our natural inclinations but what we can do is choose whether to yield to them, or resist them and do what we are not naturally inclined to do.",

Gestures are symbols that mean the same thing to the sending and receiving parties in interaction. In symbolic interactionism, then, individuals are conceptualized as reading the gestures of others – words, facial expressions, bodily countenance, or any behavior that carries common meaning – in a process of mutual role-taking in which people mentally place themselves in the place or role of the other. From mutual role-taking, individuals adjust their respective lines of conduct in ways that facilitate the smooth flow of interaction or, if desired, disrupt and breach the interaction. During role-taking, individuals not only see others as objects in a situation, they also see themselves as objects. For interactionists, it is this behavioral capacity for self (or the ability to see oneself as an object in a situation) that is the central dynamic of all social interaction.",

When begging, they are intensely absorbed in their emotion. The beggar's behavior seems dually characterized: the childish behavior with insufficient control over the self and the tactical one for negotiation. Also in situations other than begging, they are often deeply involved in immediate interactions. They, as participants in the interaction, persist in having their way and display the unperturbed self. They refuse anything provisional about themselves. Also within the level of assumed reality which attendants in the gathering sustain, they persist in refusing anything provisional. They affirmatively front whatever is presented. They never bother themselves with whether the reality sustained is true or false. While they are lively within the reality which is shared by all attendants, they are in any situations required to be deeply involved in their activities.",

      "title": "Pride and Moral Responsibility",
      "abstract": "Abstract Having the emotion of pride requires taking oneself to stand in some special relation to the object of pride. According to agency accounts of this pride relation, the self and the object of pride are suitably related just in case one is morally responsible for the existence or excellence of the object of one's pride. I argue that agency accounts fail. This argument provides a strong prima facie defence of an alternate account of pride, according to which the self and the object of pride are suitably related just in case one's relation to the object of pride indicates that one's life accords with some of one's personal ideals. I conclude that the pride relation, though distinct from the relation of moral responsibility, is nonetheless a relation of philosophical interest that merits further attention. … the objects which excite these passions [pride and humility], are very numerous, and seemingly very different from each other. Pride or self‐esteem may arise from the qualities of the mind; wit, good‐sense, learning, courage, integrity: from those of the body; beauty, strength, agility, good mien, address in dancing, riding, fencing: from external advantages; country, family, children, relations, riches, houses, gardens, horses, dogs, cloaths. [I] afterwards proceed to find out that common circumstance, in which all these objects agree, and which causes them to operate on the passions. —David Hume",

      "abstract": "It was not easy to pin down the true identity of an occasional self that normatively acted and presented itself differently on different occasions according to the ever-changing and recombining relations in which it stood to other people – a self moreover, whose occasional character was tirelessly promoted by conduct books prescribing the proper conduct of the same person in different social and interpersonal relations (as master and servant, husband and wife, parents and child, mistress, companion, daughter, sibling or friend, etc.). Considered empirically, such a self was almost inevitably deceptive – as deceptive as only viewing the side of Plato’s table that presented itself to one’s gaze and assuming or imagining the rest. As we saw in the Introduction, Locke described ascriptions of identity to this empirical self as forensic fictions – constructions of some part(s) of the subject that shifted according to the interlocutor, the observer and the occasion on which a self was invoked, and left the subject’s true being as indeterminate and mysterious as “the thing in itself” to an observing eye. As Locke stressed, no one could observe what was really going on inside someone else’s head or heart; and what was going on inside one’s own was changing all the time. The problem was compounded by a culture of politeness, which required the well-bred to conceal their thoughts and passions behind agreeable sentiments, complaisant conduct, and an amiable demeanor. Since polite letter-writers too assumed any character required by the occasion and the relation in which they stood to their addressee(s), letters were paradigmatic instantiations of the deployment of shifting occasional selves, and of the problems of identity they posed, especially since, like people posing on the internet, letter-writers could assume characters that did not exist.",

      "abstract": "Humans are immersed in an ocean of words — we understand them, think with them, repeat them, play with their sounds and meanings, and create novel combinations that are understandable to other humans adrift in our part of the ocean. The skill with which a human uses words in speaking has long been a key element in the perception of his or her intelligence. We have a marked tendency to treat people who are articulate as more intelligent than those who are speak poorly. For example, I am startled when a well-spoken ‘customer service representative’ on the telephone is unable to spell psychology or to retain a seven-digit phone number. I am surprised in the opposite direction when someone who speaks English poorly, or with a large proportion of uninterpretable slang, suddenly conveys a subtle and discerning point or quickly fixes a complex problem with my computer software. This language test also has traditionally been used to separate the intellectual ability of humans from that of other animals. Put simply, if other animals can’t understand and generate words or signs in sentencelike combinations, we judge them as less intelligent than humans. The language-based divide that we have constructed between humans and other animals is well defended. During the last 30 years, work suggesting language-related communication in species ranging from chimpanzees to sea lions has attracted a firestorm of criticism that questioned its accuracy, efficacy, and importance. Objections have included claims of outright fraud, inadvertent cuing, and dismissal of results as ‘mere trial-and-error learning’. Perhaps the most common academic complaint is that the language-like productions of nonhumans lack the grammatical constraints and generativity characteristic of human language. Why are humans, certainly academic humans, so intent on distinguishing human language reception and production from the abilities of nonhuman animals? One possibility is that language is the key to a number",

That there should be hands to receive and to manage this tender visitant, is not more obviously a benevolent adaptation, than that there should be hearts to sympathize with its cries of impotency or distress. The maternal affection is as express an instance of this as the maternal nourishment—nor is the inference at all weakened, by the attempts, even though they should be successful, of those who would demonstrate of this universal fondness of mothers, that, instead of an original instinct, it is but a derived or secondary law of our nature. Were that analysis as distinct and satisfactory as it is doubtful and obscure, which would resolve all mental phenomena into the single principle of association—still the argument would stand.",

      "title": "Altruism in behavioural, motivational and evolutionary sense",
      "abstract": "This paper discusses the relations between three forms of altruism: behavioural, evolutionary and motivational. Altruism in a behavioural sense is an act that benefits another person. It can range from volunteering to a charity and helping a neighbour, to giving money to a non-profit organisation or donating blood. People often dedicate their material and nonmaterial resources for the benefit of others to gain psychological, social and material benefits for themselves. Thus, their altruistic acts are driven by egoistic motivation. Also, the final goal of an altruistic act may be the increase in the welfare of a group or adherence to a certain moral principle or a social norm. However, at least sometimes, the welfare of others is the ultimate goal of our actions, when our altruistic acts are performed from altruistic motivation. In evolutionary sense, altruism means the sacrifice of reproductive success for the benefit of other organisms. According to evolutionary theories, behaviour which promotes the reproductive success of the receiver at the cost of the actor is favoured by natural selection, because it is either beneficial for the altruist in the long run, or for his genes, or for the group he belongs to. However, altruism among people emerges as a distinctly human combination of innate and learned behaviours. Not only do we benefit the members of our own group, but we are capable of transcending our tribalistic instincts and putting the benefit of strangers at our own personal expense as our ultimate goal.",

Capturing, moving and restraining a person can be carried out both by deception or abuse of the victim's confidence, and with the use of violence or the threat of violence, or without it. The fact that the guilty persons do not have a goal of further restraining the victim indicates the absence of corpus delicti of kidnapping, while the presence of other corpus delicti in the actions of the guilty parties is not excluded.",

      "abstract": "In discussing the extent of personal agency at the end of Chapter 7, I raised the issue of unconscious action. It is not at all unusual for us to see people doing something that they appear to be completely unaware of. By this I don't just mean that they might be doing things that are just outside the focus of their consciousness, like twitching or tapping their feet. We always exhibit behaviour that we are not conscious of in this sense. This sort of 'preconscious' behaviour is not controversial (Freud, 1957). But it may be that I think they are purposefully and subtly putting me in a difficult position, irritating me or making me feel guilty. If challenged, they would strenuously deny what I think they're doing, disavowing it as a purposeful action. Now it could be that it's just me who is being oversensitive. Perhaps I often think other people are trying to irritate me or make me feel guilty — it's a characteristic of my construing and not a feature of their personality. There is always a danger of confusing what we read into or project onto other people with what is really their property.KeywordsCausal PowerInternalise HomophobiaCartesian DualismObject Relation TheoristUnconscious MindThese keywords were added by machine and not by the authors.

      "abstract": "According to a Zulu proverb a human being can only become truly human because of others. Each person can only become more human, more himself- regardless of his sex - through the co-involvement of others. It is the love for one’s neighbour and the respect one has for him/her as a person which makes one consider the other party's feelings, viewpoints and circumstances. In order to arrive at a situation of peaceful coexistence it is important to realize that human attitudes and a mature life style evolve through a process of learning and interaction with others. It is a timeconsuming and costly process which starts at infancy and continues throughout someone's life. Instruction concerning interpersonal relations and the teaching of respect cannot be confined to individual lessons or working sessions at home or in school. Discussions and conversations concerning interpersonal relations need to form an integral and natural part of a child’s life within the home environment and throughout the pupil's school career. It is senseless if educators talk about the importance of teaching respect only to reveal disrespectful behaviour themselves, or to talk about the importance of self-esteem in the paying of respect whilst causing children to feel negative about themselves. To be able to express respect to other human beings, one needs to be respected. A child needs to experience how it feels when homage is paid. The following rule of life applies in this regard: one can never give if one has never received respect.",

Affective forces, such as sexist or racist abuse hurled at bodies online or in the street, are entangled with more recognisable, codified emotions (fear, shame, hate). Affect conceptualises feelings as relational rather than as discrete states of being inhering in separately bounded bodies. Affect displaces reason/emotion, mind/body, self/other binaries and offers alternative – and more affirmative – explanations of how and why sensation and feeling matter. Affect studies have a long philosophical history, reaching back to Spinoza's interest in the capacities of bodies and how bodies can affect and be affected. Sad and joyful affects are implicated in reducing or expanding embodied capacities.",

Las ECM pueden incluir algunos de los siguientes elementos: experiencias fuera del cuerpo o separacion de la conciencia del cuerpo fisico, incremento en la percepcion sensorial, emociones intensas, viaje hacia o a traves de un tunel, observacion de una luz brillante, encuentro con seres misticos o familiares y amigos fallecidos, sentido de alteracion del tiempo y el espacio, revision de la vida, visualizacion de paisajes celestiales indescriptibles, encuentro con una barrera o limite, aprendizaje de un conocimiento especial y el regreso voluntario o involuntario al cuerpo fisico.

Las caracteristicas de las ECM son parecidas en todo el mundo y en personas de diferentes culturas.

      "title": "The Values of Life",
      "abstract": "In Life's Dominion Dworkin aims at defusing the controversy about abortion and euthanasia by redefining its terms. Basically it is not a dispute about the right to life, but about its value. Liberals should grant that human life has not only a personal, but also an intrinsic value; conservatives should accept the principle of toleration which requires to let people decide for themselves about matters of intrinsic value. Dworkin fails, however, to distinguish between two kinds of personal value: (1) the value of something to a person, when he actually or dispositionally desires it, or finds it pleasant; and (2) the value of something to a person, when it's objectively contributes to his well-being, as defined by reference to his personal point of view, whether or not he ever perceives it as so contributing. He also fails to distinguish between two meanings of the concept of 'intrinsic value': (3) ultimate, i.e. non-instrumental personal value of kind (2); (4) the impersonal value of something which is not good-for-anybody, but simply good, i.e. not a constituent of someone's well-being. Dworkin argues that the human fetus from conception onwards has a value, that it is not a personal value of kind (1), and therefore must be an intrinsic value. But the value of the life of the fetus is not a personal value of kind (2) either and therefore not an intrinsic value of kind (3): it is normally a constituent of the well-being of the pregnant woman, but that doesn't constitute its value, and it is not good 'for' the fetus itself in the relevant sense, because it doesn't have a personal point of view. If, however, the fetus' life is allowed to have an intrinsic value of kind (4), the conservative cannot be refuted by appeal to the principle of toleration, for this only concerns intrinsic value of kind (3). The liberal, indeed, should recognize that the fetus' life has a value, but it is neither a personal value (1) or (2), nor an impersonal value (4), but rather a relational value which gradually develops from some point substantially later than conception.",

      "title": "Stranger Anxiety: When Children Face Strangers",
      "abstract": "Till about seven months, the baby mostly flees from contact with strangers, often avoiding eye-contact without the parent’s awareness. A reaction of resistance and anxiety when approached by a stranger is commonly seen around eight months. In this paper I explore this emotional responding in the context of a novel re-conceptualization of healthy narcissism processing as an emotional immune system. Whereas recent discussions in the literature have focused on the anxiety reaction, I propose that key to understanding this commonplace phenomenon is the understanding of how healthy narcissism works to safeguard that which is familiar and resist that which is strange. The operation of these psychic processes may be likened to those of the biological immune system, which safeguard the familiar codes of the body and repel alien invaders. In safeguarding that which is familiar and repelling the alien, healthy narcissism operates as an emotional immune system. It is promoted by good-enough attachments (object relations) characterized by our being loved the way we are (true self), in separateness and not according to someone else’s blueprint (false self), one that risks invading our familiar self. The more we are loved for who we truly are, our self-integrity is more immune to invaders, and throughout our lifespan, we are more immune to alien influences, and to the incursions of others’ hurtful words and deeds. Healthy narcissism is thus understood as providing, from birth, emotional immunity to our sense of self-familiarity. We come to recognize ourselves and the partners of our various relationships via continually being alerted to and subsequently resisting or rejecting strangers/strangeness (i.e., invaders), and by gradually tolerating and even befriending the otherness. Befriending is possible when we are able to discover some familiarity embedded within the stranger. The appearance of eight-month resistance/anxiety, a normal alertness to strangers, signals that the baby has a rudimentary sense of both self and object constancy and is able to differentiate between his familiar “not-I,” such as the parent/caregiver whom he experiences as familiar and is attached to, and the unfamiliar “not-I” stranger. The parent/caregiver is then experienced as a bridge between that which is familiar and that which is strange and anxiety-provoking/overwhelming. Parents’ reactions to the “not-I” (of their baby) can help the infant differentiate between a “not-I” he might befriend, and one that is best avoided. The normal emotional immune reaction reflects a good-enough balance between preserving the familiar and true self, and befriending the otherness, to which one remains appropriately but not excessively alert.",

All power of fancy over reason is a degree of insanity; but while this power is such as we can controul and repress, it is not visible to others, nor considered as any depravation of the mental faculties: it is not pronounced madness but when it comes ungovernable, and apparently influences speech or action.*",

      "abstract": "Introduction: Self-esteem is a widely used concept both in popular language and in psychology. It refers to an individual's sense of his or her value or worth, or the extent to which a person values, approves of, appreciates, prizes, or likes him or herself (Blascovich & Tomaka, 1991). The most broad and frequently cited definition of self-esteem within psychology is Rosenberg's (1965), who described it as a favorable or unfavorable attitude toward the self. Self-esteem is generally considered the evaluative component of the self-concept, a broader representation of the self that includes cognitive and behavioral aspects as well as evaluative or affective ones (Blascovich & Tomaka, 1991). While the construct is most often used to refer to a global sense of self-worth, narrower concepts such as self-confidence or body-esteem are used to imply a sense of self-esteem in more specific domains. It is also widely assumed that self-esteem functions as a trait, that is, it is stable across time within individuals. Self-esteem is an extremely popular construct within psychology, and has been related to virtually every other psychological concept or domain, including personality (e.g., shyness), behavioral (e.g., task performance), cognitive (e.g., attributional bias), and clinical concepts (e.g., anxiety and depression). Purpose: The purpose of the study was to compare the self-esteem variable between trainees of Bachelor of Physical Education and Bachelor of Education. Methodology: The purpose of the study was to assess the level of self-esteem variable between under graduate Education and Physical Education trainees. The raw data pertaining to self-esteem variable of these Physical Education and Education trainees of Shivamogga and Bhadravathi talluk were selected as subjects on random sampling technique. Totally 120 Subjects were selected, 60 subjects from physical education and 60 students from education. The data was collected by administering standardized questionnaires. Self-esteem assessment questionnaire formulated by Williams (2000) was used to test the level of self-esteem. Results: To achieve the purpose of the study data collected was subjected to statistical analysis. The mean, standard deviation and t-ration were obtained by using standard statistical package for social sciences (SPSS 20th Version). Conclusion: Within the limitations of the present study and on the basis of findings in psychological variables, it is observed from the study was self-esteem variables in some areas such as Intelligence, Personality, Success, and Freedom from Guilt is not significant.",

The word “professional” has a number of connotations. It ranges from the description applied by the sporting amateur (with perhaps a slight air of condescension or self righteousness) to one who quite frankly earns his living by the exercise of his aptitude in some particular sport, to the practitioners of vocations hallowed by antiquity and revered because of their one-time remoteness from the common herd. To be a “professional” is to use a facility for sames or sport for a living; and in consequence to be regarded with something only a little better than horror by the “amateurs.” To be a “professional man” or “woman,” or to be a member of one of the “professions” implies a standing, in some eyes, only a little less than divine and certainly very far removed from the taint of “professionalism” as applied to sport.",

      "title": "Signi¢cant Others andthe Self",
      "abstract": "We subscribe to the assumption that the self is fundamentally relational-that is, entangled with signi®cant others -such that key elements of the self are experienced in relation to signi®cant others, even when others are not present. In our social- cognitive model of transference, transference occurs when a mental representation of a signi®cant other is activated by cues in a new person that resemble the other. As a result, the self in relation to this signi®cant other is activated, eliciting changes in affect, expectancies, motivations, and behaviors, as well as in the nature of the working self-concept, all reecting the version of the self one is when with the sig- ni®cant other. Moreover, when people experience a threat to either a signi®cant- other relationship or the self in the context of an encounter with a new person who triggers transference, this sets into motion self-regulatory processes, which play out in relations with the new person. Overall, we argue that the evocation of prior experiences with signi®cant others tells us something about the nature of the self, affect, and self-regulation that has implications for both resiliency and vulnerability. Our approach to the self and self-regulation is grounded in our interpersonal social- cognitive theory of the self, which draws on social-cognitive, personality, and clinical theory (Andersen & Chen, 2001). Its main thrust is that signi®cant others are inuential in shaping self-de®nition, self-regulatory processes, and personality as it is expressed in relation to others. We argue, in particular, that an individual's reper- toire of selves, stemming from the signi®cant others in his or her life, is a major source of the interpersonal patterns that characterize the individual. In this sense, people may have as many selves as they have interpersonal relationships (Sullivan, 1953; see also Kelly, 1955). These relationships capture a profoundly important sphere of the self, a sphere that includes shared realities with relationship partners (e.g., Aron, Aron, Tudor, & Nelson, 1991; Baldwin, 1992; Hardin & Higgins, 1996)",

      "title": "Pleasure",
      "abstract": "From Plato and beyond, pleasure has been thought to be a basic, and sometimes the only basic, reason for doing anything. Since there are many forms that pleasure can take and many individual views of what pleasure consists in, much attention has been given to how pleasures may be distinguished, what their motivational and moral significance might be, and whether there may not be some objective determination of them, whether some may be good or bad, or some better as pleasures than others. But first there is the question of what pleasure is. It has been variously thought to be a state of mind like distress only of the opposite polarity; merely the absence or cessation of or freedom from pain; a kind of quiescence like contentment; or the experiencing of bodily sensations which, unlike sensations of pain, one does not want to stop. We also identify and class together particular sources of pleasure and call them pleasures of the table, company, sex, conversation, solitude, competition, contemplation or athletic pleasures. In this sense there may be some pleasures which we do not enjoy. But most generally pleasure is what we feel and take when we do enjoy something. This raises the questions of what is encompassed by ’something’, what it is to enjoy anything, and the extent to which theories of pleasure can accommodate both our passivity and activity in pleasure. The most influential theories have been those of Plato, Aristotle and empiricists such as Hume and Bentham.",

      "title": "Mysticism and Sense Perception",
      "abstract": "In this paper I propose to examine the cognitive status of mystical experience. There are, I think, (at least) three distinct but overlapping sorts of religious experience. (1) In the first place, there are two kinds of mystical experience. The extrovertive or nature mystic (in some sense) identifies himself with a world which is both transfigured and one. The introvertive mystic withdraws from the world and, after stripping the mind of concepts and images, experiences union with something which (in some respects at least) can be described as an undifferentiated unity. Introvertive mysticism is a more important phenomenon than extrovertive mysticism. (2) Numinous experiences are complex experiences involving dread, awe, wonder, and fascination. One (apparently) finds oneself confronted with something which is radically unlike ordinary objects. Before its overwhelming majesty and power, one is nothing but dust and ashes. In contrasting oneself with its uncanny beauty and goodness, one experiences one's own uncleanness and ugliness. (3) The experiences bound up with the devotional life of the ordinary believer (gratitude, love, trust, filial fear, etc.) are also religious in character. Nevertheless these more ordinary experiences should, I think, be distinguished both from numinous experiences and from mystical experiences, for they do not appear to involve the sense of immediate presence which characterises the latter.",

These reflections, then, comprise a series of related but not necessarily connected thoughts, observations, and notes whose sole, common link is the contemplation of the body of work of a master. This work, despite the many years during which I preoccupied myself with a close study of it and even carried out in my own work ideas and tendencies directly derived from and based on it, still puzzles and disturbs me and gives me no complete satisfaction because I find in it much, though fascinating, that does not convince me. And yet, for all that, the serious lacks or imperfections or, even now, alien elements (as I see them) of his art do not obscure or overbalance or diminish the compelling power and beauty of portions of his work and, occasionally, entire compositions. The stance of my particular approach to the problem of coming to grips with Schoenberg is best conveyed by this journal entry of Delacroix dated November 1, 1852:",

The word anthropomorphism derives from Greek and, literally translated, means humanlike ( ánthrpos ) in shape or form ( morphos ). In our daily lives, we do not have different languages to describe humans versus nonhumans. Therefore, humanlike characteristics are often used in a metaphorical sense to facilitate understanding (Lakoff &amp; Johnson, 1980). For example, we might say our car refuses to start, but this does not require that we actually think the car has ill intentions. Nevertheless, anthropomorphism may have important psychological and social ramifications. In some cases, anthropomorphic agents may be thought of as actual persons in the lives of those for whom they are real. These personified agents may be deemed to have rights, responsibilities, or the potential for social interactions.",

      "abstract": "In the BDI paradigm, much attention was devoted to beliefs, intentions, choice and commitment, whereas desire has traditionally been seen as given. However, desire is the key connection to the agents' creator, and the ultimate source of behaviour. Desires are allowed to be incoherent, irrational, or at least a-rational. Agent environments establish a motivational context for agents to act upon. Agent societies are never truly autonomous. We argue that pre-designed utility-based behaviour search strategies not only hinder the adaptability of an agent but also prevent the emergence of novel social behaviour. In this paper, we propose a new model of desire acquisition and evolution. Agents continuously adapt their desires by means of both their intrinsic motivations, as well as a mimetic mechanism inspired in Rene' Girard's theory. Agents acquire new goals not through fitness or novelty but out of mechanisms such as envy, imitation and competition. To achieve their goals, agents have to sometimes discard them and just overcome their neighbours.",

As anyone familiar with either the Mahabharata or India's second great epic, the Ramayana, knows martial techniques have existed on the South Asian subcontinent since antiquity. Both epics are filled with scenes describing how the princely heroes obtain and use their humanly or divinely acquired skills and powers to defeat their enemies: by training in martial techniques under the tutelage of great gurus like the brahmin master Drona, by practicing austerities and meditation techniques which give the martial master access to subtle powers to be used in combat, and/or by receiving a gift or a boon of divine, magical powers from a god. On the one hand, there is Bhima who depends on his brute strength to crush his foes, while on the other, we find the ‘unsurpassable’ Arjuna making use of his more subtle accomplishments in single point focus or his powers acquired through meditation.",

It may also occur following loss or may arise from intrapsychic conflict, as in conflict between inner drives and external demands or between conflicting value systems. Anxiety is a distressing emotion usually associated with bodily discomfort. In contrast to depression, which is a reaction to loss and is oriented toward the past, anxiety is a reaction to threat and is directed toward the future. The threat may involve danger, lack of support or what is unknown. Normal anxiety prepares the individual for a protective response. Low levels of anxiety are helpful in coping with adversity, but high levels cause impairment and can even be disorganizing. Anxiety becomes abnormal when its intensity and duration are disproportionate to the potential for harm, when it occurs in situations known to be harmless, or occurs without any recognizable threat.",

      "title": "The Self and the Subject: A Psychoanalytic Lacanian Perspective",
      "abstract": "AbstractIn current research, the self, or the \"first-person perspective,\" is often studied in terms of its cognitive functions (agency, \"mind reading,\" body representation, etc.). As clearly shown by Decety (2002), these studies are based on the assumption that mental processes must be \"described in terms that make it clear that they are achievable by one brain.\" It has been well established, however, that though one human brain is necessary, it is not sufficient for the development of a psychic subject capable of mental processes. Indeed, to do so, the brain must be connected with a particular language system, which is external and exists prior to the birth of each human brain. Psychoanalysis demonstrates that such a process not only yields human individuals who consider themselves as autonomous egos with a cognitive representation of the external world, but that these humans also suffer a particular \"lack\" or \"want,\" which makes each of them a desiring subject. Regardless of the conscious representations of the \"self,\" the psychic life (including cognition) of this subject is governed by the repeated—though vain—search for a repressed object that cannot be represented. The contribution of psychoanalysis to understanding what constitutes the \"self\" was first indirectly demonstrated through the psychoanalysis of neurotic patients. The study of psychiatric or neurological pathologies, in particular psychosis (Cotard, Fregoli, and Capgras syndromes) or the right hemisphere syndrome (in particular, somatoparaphrenia), confirms these findings. This paper represents a contribution to the understanding of subjectivity through a psychoanalytic perspective on the Fregoli syndrome and somatoparaphrenia.Keywords: selfspecular imagebody imageidentificationmisidentificationsomatoparaphrenia",

Mental or psychological substances are not however to be identified with Cartesian selves. For Lowe’s selves stand in a unique and intimate relation to their living bodies. I outline an alternative: persons are complex substances, unities of tropes; no person is a self; every self or soul is a complex substance, a unity of tropes; the tropes making up a person are mental; the tropes making up a self are psychological and bodily. Persons, on this view, are indeed mental but are not Cartesian substances because of the unique and intimate and relation in which they stand to bodies and souls or selves.

In some cultures a technique used for such a purpose would be thought of as magic or religious and involve supernatural powers; today, we would be more likely to look for an explanation in the natural world, one which we would attribute to what we call ‘science’.

While every person is assumed to have selfesteem, whether positive, negative, or ambivalent--while everyone is assumed to esteem oneself, whether favorably, unfavorably, or ambivalently not everyone respects himself or herself as a worthwhile human being. How can it make sense to propose that there should be a right to selfrespect, or even, as it is claimed in this essay, a human right (that is, a universal moral right)? It can make sense only if we first accept following three propositions. (This is necessary, but not, as we shall see, sufficient.) The first proposition is that every human being is or has a self, in a sense that includes an awareness of being a human individual, capable of making choices that affect one's life and that of others. In a recent discussion Morris Rosenberg cites common view that of all animals, human alone has self-consciousness. After discussing some of complexities of selfconcept, he offers following definition: the totality of individual's thought and feelings having reference to himself as an object.' Even to survive, physically and socially, every human being must give some thought to one's own identity and other characteristics.",

This book gives a full account of how emotions work in the mind and the body, according to both medieval and modern theories (Introduction, Saunders); how they function within a society or a group, notably that of the Round Table, or of the audience and readers of Arthurian literature (Gilbert, Lynch, Radulescu); the disjunction between emotion and effective action (Lynch); the mechanisms by which the emotions of a fictional character can be mirrored in a reader (Larrington); the capacity of sounds – even sounds with no semantic content – to convey feeling (Brandsma); and whether (or how far) emotions can be transferred across cultures (Rikhardsdottir). Their overlap and intersection with other schemata, of the passions or the vices, are discussed, along with the specific terms used to describe fear or anger or shame (Fuksas). The bodily expressions most commonly attached to specific emotions are explored, of going pale or red, changing expression, flinching or weeping. Medieval authors will typically portray emotions so as to suggest some kind of social function for their readers: how a king, or a knight, should act as well as feel. The model underlying all of these is the assumption that emotions are communicated socially. Even if the character feeling the emotion keeps it to him- or herself, the reader is granted privileged access to their unexpressed thoughts or feelings. Kings may be under an obligation not to be too open about their emotions (Baden-Daintree), but the readers will be shown what they feel; lovers may blush in public before retreating to their chamber or some other isolated spot to lament their state, as an abundance of Arthurian and other romances demonstrate, but the symptoms will be thoroughly familiar to readers trained to recognize them. But what happens when a bodily sign of emotion carries neither a familiar meaning nor an explanation within the text?",

      "abstract": "Joint attention is an everyday phenomenon in which two or more individuals attend to an object, event process or property in the presence of each other, such that their attention to that object is to some degree intertwined with the other's attention to it. This paper argues that joint attention has the normative role of enabling subjects to coordinate their actions in a way that would contribute to the rational execution of a joint action in accordance with a prior shared plan or shared intention. This understanding of the normative function of joint attention underpins a particular understanding of the nature of joint attention: what I shall call Rich Relationalism. Rich Relationalism argues for the view that joint attention acts as an epistemically significant interface between the world, other people, and their background plans and concepts. It understands joint attention as an object-dependent, conceptually structured, token experiential state that is shared by two (or more) people. It can be contrasted with non-relational (i.e., Representational or Enactivist) accounts of joint attention on the one hand, and Lean Relationalist accounts on the other (such as John Campbell's influential account).",

      "title": "Suffering is bad: experiential understanding and the impossibility of intrinsically valuing suffering",
      "abstract": "Abstract Suffering, I argue, is bad. This paper supports that claim by defending a somewhat bolder-sounding one: namely that if anyone—even a sadistic ‘amoralist’—fully understands the fact that someone else is suffering, then the only evaluative attitude they can possibly form towards the person’s suffering as such is that of being intrinsically against it. I first argue that, necessarily, everyone is disposed to be intrinsically against their own suffering experiences, holding fixed their specific overall degree of emotional aversiveness , because any evaluative attitude other than ‘being against’—including mere indifference—would in certain key circumstances make our suffering less emotionally aversive and thus different from the suffering experience (stipulatively) at issue. Second, fully understanding that someone else is having a given experience—Mary’s experiencing a vividly blue sky, say, or Job’s experiencing heart-rending grief—requires that we represent experientially their very instance of that experience-type (it requires, in other words, token phenomenal concepts ). The result is that what goes for our own suffering goes for others’, too: maintaining an accurate experiential representation of the fact that someone else is having a suffering experience with a specific degree of overall emotional aversiveness is only compatible with coming to be intrinsically against their suffering. So suffering is—‘objectively’—bad: it’s only possible to respond with indifference towards anyone’s suffering if we don’t fully understand that they are suffering in the first place.",

      "title": "Nihilism and terrorism",
      "abstract": "Nietzsche characterized nihilism as a psychological state arrived at by three phases. First, the loss of human purpose; when we look for meanings in things and find them void of meaning, then we discover there is no aim or meaning to life.61 Second, the loss of the sense of unity and belonging; when we look for, and do not find, a totality, a unity to belong to and to give sense and value to our individual existence. Third, when losing aim and unity we invent a beyond, a metaphysical world, and find it does not exist, that it was fabricated by the human mind, by our need for meaning, then we lose the sense of truth, we kill God, as Nietzsche's madman cried: 'God is dead and we have killed him ourselves!' (GS: III, 125). One reaches, then, the will to nothing, an aversion to life, a revolt against the fundamental preconditions of life because 'Men prefer to have the will to nothing rather than have no will' (Nietzsche GM: I, 28).",

      "abstract": "One does not see a possibility for moral justification of the cloning of humans, or of any other experiments and manipulation of human embryos other than on the grounds of materialistic anthropology which reduces human spirituality to the dimensions dealt with by natural sciences. If, however, man is a person, and if \"to be a person\" constitutes an ontological situation and is not the result of some kind of social contract, and if the human embryo is, at least potentially a person, then the Kantian personalistic norm will demand a ban on the cloning of humans and on experimenting on human embryos, and will also exclude any attitude of ownership towards each human being. This demand seems all the more clear if we look at the personalistic norm from the point of view of what is most wonderful in being a person namely, that the person is capable of receiving, learning and giving love. The deficiency of love received at the beginning of somebody's life - even if he or she was conceived out of love - may be a cause of this person becoming closed to higher values. Thus, the idea of cloning human beings means to structurally remove love from the beginning of human life and to introduce technology instead. One cannot really do more harm to another person than by depriving him or her of love at the very beginning of his or her life. I think that the well known stories about Golem or Frankenstein express a presentation of just this truth - and that is why they are so terrifying.",

According to one prominent approach, this privilege is due to a special epistemic access we have to our own present states of mind. On an alternative, deflationary approach the privilege merely reflects a socio-linguistic convention governing avowals. We reject both approaches. On our proposed account, a full explanation of the privilege must recognize avowals as expressive performances, which can be taken to reveal directly the subject's present mental condition. We are able to improve on special access accounts and deflationary accounts, as well as familiar expressive accounts, by explaining both the asymmetries and the continuities between avowals and other pronouncements, and by locating a genuine though non-epistemic source for first-person privilege.",

      "title": "7 THE CLAIMS OF SCIENCE",
      "abstract": "There are few employments of life in which it is not sometimes advantageous to pause for a short time, and reflect upon the nature of the end proposed.\n 1 The pursuit of knowledge is one of those in which this occasional relinquishment of the field of action for that of meditation, is especially needed. We enter upon it at a period when the feelings are quick and ardent, when the desire of distinction is strong, and when many amiable feelings of our nature, the personal affection which we owe to our dearest friends, and the reverence which seems almost to be due to their very opinions, impel us to engage with eagerness in a task which the all but universal consent of mankind has pronounced to be useful and honourable. There is not one of these motives of which I would desire to weaken the force. But valuable as they are as incentives to exertion, they obviously constitute an incomplete ground for any systematic devotion of our maturer powers. The claims of the pursuit of science, like all other claims with which we are concerned, must ultimately rest upon some intrinsic excellency or special suitableness of the object. Qualities such as these can alone give to it an enduring title to our regard. I design, upon the present occasion, to consider the claims of science in the light of the principle just stated. More especially, I wish to direct attention to the ground of those claims, in the immediate or implied relations of science to human nature; in its relations, namely, as an answer to some of the distinctive wants of the human mind, an exercise to its faculties, a discipline of the character and habits, [and] an instrument of conquest and dominion over the powers of surrounding Nature. In the present divided state of public sentiment, particularly in this country and with reference to this institution, there seems to be need of such a discussion; need also that it should not shrink from occupying the whole field of the inquiry. To ourselves at least it cannot but be useful to endeavour to form an intelligent conception of what is really implied in the pursuit of science, of the spirit which that pursuit demands, and of the ends to which it points. It is proper to state in the outset, that under the term Science, I include all general truths, discoverable by the human understanding, whether they are physical truths relating to the material universe, or moral truths relating to the constitution of our own nature, or truths of any other kind. And the order which I design to pursue is the following:",

      "title": "Room without Room",
      "abstract": "Not only is it weirdly hard to evaluate what you yourself look like … but it turned out that consumers’ instinctively skewed self-perception, plus vanity-related stress, meant that they began preferring and then outright demanding videophone masks that were really quite a lot better-looking than they themselves were in person. High-def mask-entrepreneurs were ready and willing to supply not just verisimilitude but aesthetic enhancement. — David Foster Wallace, Infinite Jest (148) To combat the physical and emotional effects of Zoom Face, “cosmetic injectables … give a natural, rejuvenated appearance.” — Stacey Leasca, Forbes (quoting medical aesthetician Gabby Garritano) Technological forms of life are disembedded, they are somehow “lifted out”. As lifted out, they take on increasingly less and less the characteristic of any particular place, and can be any place or indeed no place. This lifted-out space of placelessness is … characterised not so much by a multiple of identities, but by an absence of identity. Its context is no context at all … . In all cases, social interaction is on a different level from ordinary forms of life. — Scott Lash, Critique of Information (21) Introduction: Communication-Image To zoom, in its original verb form, describes a decisive movement of a body through space, as in the abrupt upward climb of an aircraft, or a modulation of the space between two bodies, as in the play between the film camera and its subject (“Zoom”). The term carries connotations of speed, distance, proximity; it is suffused with kinetic energy and intensified affection. Zoom, Inc.—the pandemic era’s prevailing video communications platform—inverts these received senses of the word, as it liquidates the body, prunes away affective charge, and promotes an insipid aesthetic of atomised talking heads, rigid grids, noise suppression, and facile customisation. Along the way, the screen experience becomes increasingly dominated by a preponderance of talk. As we acclimate more to the look and feel, and to the attendant routines of working and learning and socialising from home, the platform refashions the screen from an aesthetic surface to a channel of multimodal communication, from a vehicle for the circulation of affect to one for the circulation of verbal, visual, and text-based information. This essay takes aim at Zoom in its principle, normative form, as enterprise software developed for professional and educational uses. The ensuing critique is thus not directed at art and craft adoptions, at hobbyists, or at the many creative, experimental, or otherwise alternative deployments of the software. Rather, in enumerating some of the more numbing, oppressive features and effects of the Zoom standard, I hope to supply some basic benchmarks for what such alternative uses might strive for, beginning with a resuscitation of affect, embodiment, and aesthetic experience. For Massumi, affect derives from movements of and in the body, circumscribing a “real-material-but-incorporeal” dimension of experience (5). Affect studies, in turn, part ways with the “linguistic model” that had held sway over poststructuralist cultural theory for decades (Massumi 4). As a communications channel, Zoom dampens the affective dimension of any encounter, discouraging movement in its privileging of information exchange. (“Don’t … walk around during the class meeting”, read a multitude of college and secondary school guidelines for Zoom etiquette.) With Shannon’s classic diagrammatic model of communication in mind, we could say, on Zoom, the bodies of sender and destination are forever obscured by the mechanisms of transmission and reception. The eclipse of aesthetics and embodied affect by information in the contemporary screenscape is hardly unique to Zoom, nor is it a particularly novel trend, but one whose genealogy harks back to film newsreels and broadcast television’s nightly news. It is akin to the way the podcast has in recent years captured much of the sonic attention that had once been disposed toward music listening, or to the way, with the adoption of the PC some four decades ago, the screen has become an at-home workspace. In a pandemic year, Zoom has for many become a quintessential mediator of synchronous interaction in both work and educational contexts. In mediating two or more speaking bodies, it also mediates our relationship with ourselves, as we see ourselves speaking more closely and more often than ever before. My approach in this essay draws on critical discourse analysis, affect theory, and science and technology studies to interrogate the standard Zoom experience and its disciplinary effects. My primary case study takes the shape of auto-ethnographic exposition of Zoom teaching in a university setting. Within this framework I probe the “technological forms of life” screened on Zoom (Lash 21)—the emerging behavioural and perceptual norms, and new forms of standardised experience manufactured by and through the platform. At work, in school, and in social life, Zoom has reorganised our habits and redesigned our capacities to experience and reflect on ourselves. Through its formal constraints and basic audio-visual setup, as well as through the common practices and etiquettes in effect for business and classroom usage, Zoom extends and intensifies many trends of our algorithmically mediated scopic field: a surge in self-reflection paired with a twin expulsion of otherness and environment; an occlusion of expressive and perceptive acts by rapidly accumulating instances of communication. Fulfilling David Foster Wallace’s 1996 premonition of a videophonic culture “spiral[ling] totally out of control”, Zoom has the power to monstrously augment modes, habits, and customs of self-reflection (148). It thus makes an archetypal communications medium for our age of extreme self-concern. My analysis of Zoom—as a ubiquitous “site” for social reproduction in the classic disciplinary spaces of the school and the workplace—reveals a suite of mutations around self-self, self-other, and self-environment relations, between my body and my sense of self, and between my body and the bodies of others (Foucault, Discipline 135–169). At stake is nothing short of how we organise and narrativise our lives and the space for spontaneity, otherness, equality, and bodily autonomy therein. In the specific constellation of powers and parameters of the standard Zoom experience—the fixed close-up on the face, the constraints on gesture, the stillness and frequent mute(d)ness, and, of course, the constant glitching—subjectivity is remade around diminished affective powers and ubiquitous self-reflection. From Talking Head to Glitching Gaze: The Dispositif of the Face At work, in school, and in many social settings, the communication-image on Zoom is typically an image of a face, a few faces side by side or nested one in the other’s frame, or an entire grid of faces. The Zoom standard exemplifies what in documentary cinema is known as the talking-head format: experts and eyewitnesses are interviewed on screen, framed typically from the shoulders up and set against a generic backdrop. Whether it is Edward R. Murrow on the CBS Evening News or Edward Snowden in Citizenfour, the interviewee, as talking head, projects authority and authenticity; in the Zoom room, we are all such talking heads. While facial expressions and mise-en-scène also contribute information, the prevailing emphasis remains on the discourse issued forth from the mouth on the face. Zoom generalises the talking-head format so that, particularly during pandemic lockdowns, all our conversations, lectures, and meetings look the same, and each of our interlocutors—whether a student taking a turn to talk in class, an eminent speaker at a conference, a colleague at work, or a friend in the throes of a nervous breakdown—speaks through the visual trappings of authenticity and expertise inherited from the documentary tradition. That, through a “picture-in-picture” format, we see ourselves commanding such authority may boost the ego, fuel neuroses, or both. In his seminar on the psychoses, Lacan locates the origins of psychotic delusion in a basic feature of the relationship between language and sensation: we hear ourselves speak and, even when not speaking aloud, we continue to “hear” our thoughts as if they are speech (Lacan 161–62). Zoom propagates a potent visual supplement to this phenomenon: not only do we hear ourselves speaking, but we see ourselves speaking, too. Although Lacan ridicules those who refuse to recognise the (typically) latent psychotic in themselves, my point is not that Zoom (along with similar video-chat apps that nest a mirrored self-image in the picture of the other) is making psychotics of us all; rather, as we grow more accustomed to this view, new dimensions and experiences of subjectivity open up. Our “self-view” becomes a constituent factor in the schema of the normative subjective. In describing the solipsistic state of public discourse after a decade of social media saturation, we commonly reach for terms like disinformation, alternative facts, and fake news. In its standard, most common usages, Zoom proffers an image of ourselves to match. The platform has positioned itself as the foremost expositor of what I call the dispositif of the face. I use dispositif in Jean-François Lyotard’s sense, as a setup or trap for libidinal drives, as well as in Foucault’s sense, as a “thoroughly heterogeneous ensemble” of architectures, visibilities, and propositions that metes out “history’s destruction of the body” (Lyotard, Dispositif 246; Lyotard, Libidinal 23–25; Foucault, “Confession” 194–95; Foucault, “Nietzsche” 148; Crano 3–8). A dispositif synchronises the coordination of libidinal, corporeal, and industrial production. On Zoom, the face functions as such a dispositif, as its form appears in uncompromising close-up and interminably multiplied, and as its promise sustains social harmony and economic efficiency through an extended public health crisis and waves of state-mandated isolation. In its disembodying and “disembedding” of communication (Lash 21), Zoom crystallises the iconicity of the face, and, while an iconised and overcoded face is perhaps as old as human civilisation itself, never before has the face—not the face of a queen or a tyrant or a god, but my face and your face and any face whatsoever—been exposed up close so often to so many people. The self-care industry has been quick to respond. Glamour describes how “excessive video conferencing can trigger damaging repercussions for our mental health and our body image” and offers a series of predictable tips to stay positive and put on your best “Zoom face” (Turner). Similarly, with special attention to body-dysmorphic disorder, Vogue reports on “how staring at our faces on Zoom, is impacting our self-image” (Valenti). In classrooms, students plead to keep their cameras off, and, while some may do so simply to mask their distractedness, it would not be unreasonable to take a preponderance of black screens as an index of increasing anxieties around being seen—and seeing ourselves speaking and seeing—in this way. Elsewhere in the self-care industry, one might even get a new face. The “aesthetic doctor” Sarah Hart explains: “the increase in the use of Zoom seems to have caused a post-lockdown boom in patients seeking facial improvements. … Not only are more people getting cosmetic injectables, they’re also looking into plastic surgery … . Jowls, double chin, frown lines and lip lines are the top features people tell me they would like to correct” (Hart). In the era of the ubiquitous closeup, success and self-optimisation might hinge on the refurbishment or reconstruction of one’s own face. Coworkers, teachers, students, and even some friends are not used to seeing each other’s faces this closely, and, even though this hardly amounts to seeing each other, many are turning to Zoom Face Experts (ZFEs) for tips on (as a Forbes headline reads) “how to look and feel your best on those constant video calls” (Leasca). Although a scant few may go so far, “cosmetic injectables like wrinkle reducers and dermal fillers are a great place to start”, or so advises one of the Forbes-featured ZFEs, whose firm seeks to produce “a natural look” in “adding lost volume to improve the overall dimensions and contour of the face” (Leasca). One might reasonably contend that this has little to do with Zoom, that these cosmeticians and plastic surgeons are simply seizing the pandemic moment to ply their trade; I concede this point, but it remains subsidiary to the revelation in popular discourse of a heightened regard for self-image now that we attend meetings, classes, and social gatherings in front of a mirror. Zoom parades the face in an immobile, long-take close-up, and, in a socially competitive consumerist society, it is only natural that some in this scenario would feel compelled to “fix” their face along the lines suggested by the ZFEs quoted above. Indeed, Kember and Zylinska situate cosmetic surgery within a broader context of “makeover culture” and the neoliberal imperative of perpetual self-improvement (134–136). In this vein, face-fixing could hardly appear farther removed from the practices of posthuman metamorphosis and post-disciplinary modularity that scholars have typically invoked to think plastic surgery alongside the novel affordances of digital cultural production (Duckett 209–224; Shaviro, “Post-Cinematic” 13–15). While many have found the proverbial virtual realm to be conducive to identity play and self-transformation (e.g. Turkle, Life), I am tracking a countercurrent: Inhabiting the communication-image on Zoom, one strives to become more like oneself. Face-fixing feels as banal as changing one’s virtual background; lured by the self-expressive promise of customisation, we hollow out our contexts and lift ourselves out (Lash 21, 148), conforming ever more to our own self-identity, becoming increasingly the same. Turkle has long warned of the civilisational threats posed by digital communication technology and practice, seeing the easy affordances of text messaging and social media as so many means of sidestepping the awkward and difficult moments that make conversation meaningful and make us full participants in human sociality (Turkle, Alone; Turkle, Reclaiming). Only in face-to-face interactions, she argues, can we fully develop our empathetic powers, and, despite its highly marketable promise, Zoom comes up short (Pasternack). While Turkle roundly disputes “the idea that [Zoom] is successful communication” (Pasternack), the ZFEs contract to help one achieve a verisimilitude commensurate with the platform’s success. Despite their differences, Turkle’s cautionary work shares with the ZFEs and the Zoom marketers a paradigm-defining, all-too-human devotion to and investment in the face. As dispositif, the face is venerated and desired perhaps more than ever before, something to reveal or withhold strategically, an icon of the person, a synecdoche for the body. The larger problem for human communication is not that we see too little of the face; it is rather that we see too much, and too much of our own. As it lubricates the social and institutional machinery of capital, Zoom likewise marks a retreat into the human, a reinvestment in the dispositif of the face. It is here that we arrive at what Kember and Zylinska, in a different context, name “the limits of becoming” (136). No matter how we look or feel about our self-image (and no matter how creative or revealing or obfuscating our backgrounds), the platform will always render impossible any shared emplacement or reciprocity between self and other. This is in part because, in speaking and listening, I cannot look at another’s face and make eye contact at the same time: I can look like I am making eye contact, but to do so I must look into the camera. This is commonly recommended in professional circles. According to Forbes, “looking into the camera is the equivalent of making direct eye contact” (Goman). Turkle likewise adopts this strategy but is ultimately dissatisfied with its results (Pasternack), as we all should be. My conversation partners surely know that I am in fact not looking at them, as I gaze into the green light atop my laptop screen. The alternative is for me to look directly at the other’s face, but without looking like I am making eye contact. In one case, the other might well understand that I am looking at them, even though it does not look as if I am; in the other case, I show an effort to try to find them, to search (confusedly, or perhaps with a feigned, Forbes-inspired dose of confidence) for their eye through the tunneling eye of the camera. Either way, the contact is only ever indirect and asymmetrical. The implication is that, to Zoom, eye contact is inessential for “successful” face-to-face communication, no longer codified as part of the message. Everywhere my eye might meet the gaze of the other, it gets displaced onto the camera-eye or deflected into self-reflection. This experience—of a communicative act with all trappings of face-to-face contact but nothing of the reciprocal gaze—is only further complicated in group settings. As a teacher leading class, I frequently scan the grid of faces on my screen, out of habit, as if to simulate what in an emplaced setting would signal recognition. As I lean in, those on the other end might notice my eyes darting around my laptop screen, perhaps able to acknowledge that I am acknowledging them, but this comes through an attunement to micro-movements of the eyes rather than to my body moving through space. Without direct eye contact, there can be no genuine reciprocity between the I and the other. To Levinas, the face of the other acts as a check on my self-certainty and my otherwise limitless capacity for self-extension into the world of things. On Zoom, as the power of the other—that is, the other’s counter-power of “total resistance” (Levinas 197–98)—breaks down, the powers (as well as the psychical maladies) of the self expand. In the Zoom room, I am but a floating head, framed in close-up, consigned to the spiritlessness of indirect eye contact and hyper-mediated expression. In the Zoom room, the gaze no longer binds two or more bodies in talk; my look finds not the other but only myself looking, and so builds the infinite circuit of self-reflection. My point here is not simply to advise turning off “self-view”. Having self-view as the default alone speaks volumes about our everyday experiences of and in technoculture more broadly. Whereas media scholars have for decades been keen on the powers of digital mediation to decompose the liberal humanist individual, I see Zoom, in its standard operations, to be tacking the other way. We would do well to recall Benjamin’s observation of the dire consequences of a revolution in communications technology without a concomitant revolution in property relations (236). Zoom can afford a safe and easy means of expression, but only so long as we steer our desire for mutuality towards the platform’s own proprietary transmission and the spotlighted properties of the face. No Object, Still Life If there is anything revolutionary about Zoom, it is in its freezing up, glitching, and breaking down, which I return to below. When functioning smoothly, Zoom, at a macro level, sustains the communication and sociality essential to the maintenance and growth of capitalist institutions; at a micro level, it marks the apogee of digitally induced narcissism (Han 1–9). In the Zoom room, the other is no object; all modes of non-self get squeezed out. Neither my interlocutors nor the environment present an obstruction to my pursuit of self-regard. Zoom illustrates in real time what Han identifies in social media culture more broadly as “the expulsion of the other” (Han 40–43). The other becomes less ob-ject than ab-ject, thrown out rather than thrown in the way, their body cast aside instead of being something my body might be cast into. Kristeva explicates the abject as “not me. Not that. But not nothing, either. A ‘something’ that I do not recognize as a thing. A weight of meaninglessness that … familiar as it might have been in an opaque and forgotten life, now harries me as radically separate” (Kristeva 2). I take this to neatly capture the status of the body—my body, other bodies—in the Zoom room. In Irigaray’s work, as in Levinas’s, the other provides a necessary and healthy yet also troublesome counterweight to the gravity of sameness and self-interest that pulls so hard on modern lives. “The other interrupts the system of cross-references of my world, re-opens my horizon and questions its finality. As such, the other undoes the familiarity that was mine. The other is always a stranger who crosses the limits of my territory and upsets my habits” (Irigaray 97). As I have been charting here, this formidable otherness is perhaps not impossible but exceedingly hard to come by in the rarified air of your or my personal(ised) Zoom views, with each of us visually confined to our own box in the grid, our bodies drawn so far apart that the distance between them becomes immeasurable, dissolves, transmutes into the flattened reticulation of our inviolable compartments and our impermeable worlds. Over three-and-a-half semesters of Zoom teaching, I have regularly deployed on-the-fly polling and informal follow-up interviews to glean what students have missed most about in-person learning. The leading response has to do with the spontaneous conversations that happen right after class, rehashing a lecture or a text on the way out of the building. Another frequent response has to do with the embodied act of covering distance; students (and teachers too, I would wager) miss ranging across campus in a crowd, the collective rambling, or the commute by bike or by foot or by bus, as physical activities that are purposeful and goal-directed yet at the same time marginal and transitional, in between events or destinations, where a serendipitous encounter might prove illuminating or might even throw one off course. Again, Massumi’s framing of affect in terms of movement—“phase-shifts of the body”—provides an instructive cross-reference for our grasping the somatically restricted world of experience that Zoom has helped usher us into (5). A body moving through space is a body modulating space and modulated by its various currents and moods. In the experience of distance—which is space considered from a temporally subjective point of view, space temporalised—an affective body is made. Embedded in space, one makes oneself an affective body. In collapsing space and distance, Zoom drains affect from the body and the body from the subject, instead anchoring selfhood in the immobile, implacable form of the face. While hardly alone in doing so, Zoom expedites the ongoing unsnarling of self and other and the subsequent thickening of the former and “expulsion” of the latter (Han). In the loop of self-reflection, under the spell of the dispositif of the face, no relation between bodies can be forged. Evacuating the body from the scene—displaced from the office and the classroom as easily as it is cropped from the frame—Zoom detours us from everyday architectures of spontaneous encounter. Even with friends, our conversations—which is to say our talking, our everyday inhabitation of language—become more intentional. No longer does one bump into a colleague and strike up an exchange. Unannounced telephone calls grow increasingly rare; one sends a link or an invite in advance. Occasion for discourse becomes increasingly planned. Like language, so too our habitual actions have, in pandemic times, been reconstructed to cut out contingency. Without a commute, our arrival to work and school remains distraction-free. Chance interruptions are limited to domestic affairs: a leaky appliance, a noisy neighbor, a bothered pet. Here, getting sidetracked entails shoring up the space of the same. Otherness, in the form of the unexpected, is barred from the scene. This weeding out of randomness in everyday life occludes corporeality, dampens cultural creativity, and directs libidinal energies exclusively towards predetermined investments. Like all electronic media, Zoom promulgates an “atopic info space-time”, as it accelerates communication while promoting somatic inertia (Lash 147). In a great irony of its branding, Zoom, Inc. forecloses the very action that its eponym describes. Zoom immobilises bodies and accommodates little in the way of movement on screen. The affective intimacy of the cinematically zoomed-in close-up, for example, can be feigned but never fully achieved, as there is no initial distance that must be overcome. Nothing in the Zoom view pulls closer; nothing drifts away. There is no “swift movement” or “rapid change” (“Zoom”), no distance to cover, and neither “resonation” nor “sensation” of such (Massumi 14). Both the face in the frame and the body at the desk must tend toward stillness to minimise noise and streamline the communication. Gone are the shared sounds of the classroom, the ambient and incidental noises, the constant soundtrack of co-presence, of scores of bodies gathered in the same space: the unzipping of jackets and backpacks as students come in, the abundant small talk before class, the controlled cacophony of small-group breakout sessions, the comically overwhelming sounds of an airplane overhead or a nearby grounds crew. By contrast, the ubiquitous silence on Zoom is deadening—a ripe score to our increasingly pervasive processes of asocial reproduction. One might be prompted to recall, again noting the obvious irony, the onomatopoetic, mid-nineteenth-century origin of zoom: to make a zoom-like sound, “as made by something traveling at speed” (“Zoom”). In the soporific stillness of the Zoom classroom, there can be but an alienating silence, save the sound of my own voice, doubly discombobulating in the intermittent echoes and distortions attendant to the algorithmic compression and buffering that take the place of spatial experience. There is something lost in the way of proprioception here as well, understood as “the sensibility proper to the muscles and ligaments”, which “effects a double translation of the subject and the object into the body” (Massumi 58–9). In the classroom, my voice projects and resonates in ways that are shaped by the space; as I pace the front of the lecture hall, or around the seminar table, I get a sense for my environment in part by hearing the sound of my own voice bouncing around the room. By contrast, alone in front of the laptop camera, not only am I trapped in silence, but I am also locked in place, facing the screen. If I stray too far, or if I fail to direct my speech sufficiently towards the microphone, the communication may collapse. Those subtle sonic reverberations of the classroom permeate my sensory apparatus, register my movement, help bind me to a space, and inform my dispositions. And others hear them too, in more or less the same way, but adjusted slightly according to their relative location and orientation in the classroom. The sounds of shared spaces—and the shared sounds of a space—help fuse an ephemeral group subjectivity, a being-together in the sonic body of language. In the placeless place of the Zoom room—the room without room—the body is bound before the desk, its gestures distilled to generic icons, its broad movements reduced to micro-expressions, clicks, and swipes. One sees other spaces without hearing them or feeling them; the faces and voices issuing from them come “lifted out”, with background noise and room resonance algorithmically sifted away. In short, the success of Zoom comes at a tremendous cost to the body: Fatigue compounds. Eyes strain. Backs ache. The body itself becomes abject—that which escapes the subject but is itself neither an object nor an other—that which makes something other of the self (Kristeva 5). Conclusion: Frozen Frames Zoom abounds in aesthetically pleasing and socially creative uses, but what I have been after are the normative, standardised sorts of everyday experiences one has on the platform, in the scenarios it was designed for, and the function of those experiences in the formation of subjectivity. It is left to artists and other experimenters to expose and undermine the workings of power in the standard corporate, neoliberal modes of engagement I have been interrogating here. Short of such alternative uses of the platform, it is in the glitch—bearing witness to the cutup versions of ourselves (freezing, muting, skipping, jumping, pixelating)—that affective embodiment returns in unanticipated ways. The ZFE quoted above proclaims that, with their naturalistic injectables, “the days of frozen faces are over” (Leasca), but, if there is any universal to the Zoom experience, surely it is the intermittent lags, the regular but unpredictable freezing and glitching of voice and face. These visual stumbles reveal the duplicitous space-time of the medium: the time is no more “real” than the “room” is roomy. All the blips and glitches and frozen faces unmask the ruse of co-presence—the shared experience of temporal continuity always subject to sudden and indeterminate breakdown. In the glitch, in the moment of lag, right when the image freezes up, when a party to the conversation suddenly disappears, or when a teacher’s audio cuts out, or when you yourself keep speaking after everyone else became stuck only to realise that you are the one stuck to everyone else—in these moments of uncertainty (Will the connection resume? When? Can I quit trying to reconnect yet?), embodied experience gets a jolt; proprioception no longer divides into the rooms on the screen. So we see ourselves speaking as neve",

      "abstract": "This research identifies and classifies environment capabilities by reviewing environmental psychology as well as analyzing and defining environments based on different theories. Identifying and applying these capabilities in designing ideal and high quality educational environments in terms of structure leads to a deliberate and thoughtful architecture. To briefly explain the concept of capability, it can be said that environment capabilities are the physical configuration belongings of a behavioral object or place that makes it usable for certain activities. Some demands are met by an environment or object, live or cultural, easier than others; some activities which are formed in a specific configuration of environment meet some people needs and do not others. The important thing is that the capabilities of a physical environment, whether good or bad, is what the environment suggests with its configuration characteristics and materials it is made of. It seems that the quality of an object can be defined as “a set of specific characteristics or traits which distinguish one object from others and enable us to judge about superiority, similarity or inferiority of something in comparison to something else, and from esthetical aspect judge and give a verdict about being ugly or beautiful, good or bad, as well as its goodness or badness and efficiency or inefficiency with regard to functionality. In this article, by studying environment elements and capabilities and reviewing some qualitative elements and parameters in designing educational spaces and urban environments, we attained two generalized models for environmental capabilities and qualitative parameters in designing educational spaces. Finally, in the first model, two series of indicators were categorized in form of a single model including principal environment capabilities and environment physical capabilities. In the second model, qualitative parameters of environment design are divided into superficial, real and mental components and according to the obtained results, the environment receives mental qualities from environment only if the capacity components are considered in designing correctly and with high quality.",

Disability is not just about what people with impairments are prevented from doing and being, but about what they are required to do and be instead. Whether this involves taking on roles as passive recipients of others’ benevolence or involvement in demonstrations of the unimportance of impairment, either way negates the lived experience of impairment and signifies the desirability of normality. It is suggested that embracing rather than attempting to disassociate the impaired self from disability identity – recognising disability as oppression and absurdity and resolving to face this - enables this self to claim impairment as valid and ordinary human experience and to resist the invalidating requirements of the disabled role.",

      "title": "Seeking Communal Emotions in Social Practices That Culturally Evolved to Evoke Emotions: Worship, Kitten Videos, Memorials, Narratives of Love, and More",
      "abstract": "In many instances, emotions do not simply happen to people by chance; Often, people actively seek out an emotion by engaging in practices that have culturally evolved to evoke that emotion. Such practices tend to be perpetuated and spread if people want to experience the emotion, like to recall it and tell others about it, want to give the emotion to others and experience it together, and/or regard the emotion as a sign of something wonderful. We illustrate this with a newly delineated emotion, kama muta. Many social practices around the world are structured to evoke kama muta. In those culturally evolved practices, and outside them, what typically evokes kama muta is a sudden intensification of communal sharing, or a sudden shift of attention to a communal sharing relationship. It seems probable that other social-relational emotions are also evoked by sudden changes in relationships or the sudden salience of a relationship. This change or saliencing may be incorporated in social practices that are perpetuated because they evoke the sought-after emotion. We suggest that such practices, as well as sudden changes in relationships that occur elsewhere, are especially promising places to discover social-relational emotions.",

      "title": "Personal Integrity within Society",
      "abstract": "In the most general sense, integrity is a concept that can only be understood in relation to another. The Latin \"integritas\", from which the word “integrity” is derived, refers to the indefinite and irreproachable, untouched condition of an object. Initially, it was used to describe the indeterminate power of the body, but also the chastity or purity of a person, in opposition to an unclean character. Of course, the term can be used with respect to anyone or anything, who/that can have integrity, as long as they/it are intact or untouched. Anyone or anything who has retained their natural characteristics can be regarded as integral. Anyone who is morally weaker in comparison with previous state has lost his integrity. Thus, if we consider this explanation, it can be observed, on closer examination, that this meaning of integrity has a very strong normative connotation because it implies an ideal, a standard from which any rambling is not only a transgression, but an aberration that leads in a worse state. However, there is no measurement system for any object or person that clearly indicates loss of integrity. Not every change means a loss and not every violation represents a loss of integrity. Some changes do not endanger physical or spiritual integrity, because, if they were, no form of life would be integral, because life involves changes and, often, these changes can be seen as real disturbances, but normal from an evolutionary point of view.",

So the suggestion that dogs entertain idle wishes is, apparently, vacuous, i.e. untestable, or nonsensical. Nonetheless, we can imagine situations in which we would be tempted to say of a dog that it had an idle wish, but since idle wishes so often and typically require language, we should be reluctant to impute it.",

But this constitution is not absolutely unlimited or free, but restricted, determined, following norms, rules, -isms, patterns, customs, traditions, social, cultural, historical, inter-subjective and many other rules, limits, aims, objectives, purposes, goals, etc. Concepts, conceptual practices, usage and meanings are loaded and associated with pre-determined-isms, pre-suppositions, assumptions, attitudes, beliefs, restrictions, perspectives, frames of reference, and other phenomena that will determine how they are used, their effects, results, consequences, etc.The above is earth- and anthropo-centered and restricted. The origins, nature, past, present and future is explored. This is suggested as point of reference and not the minute and irrelevant planet earth. Changes, modifications even the destruction of this planet will have little effect on and consequencs for our galaxy and the universe. Against or in this universal context the nature, the functions, aims, objectives, methods, techniques, relevance, meaning and possibility of philosophy and philosophizing is explored.Reductionistic humans are obsessed with and drawn to minimalist and generalized patterns or sets and systems of ideas as explanations and underlying foundations of complex realities and phenomena.",

      "title": "Characters and Creatures",
      "abstract": "Humans not only err, they often err willingly and explicitly, for both pleasure and edification. We accordingly “find” faces everywhere . . . most frequently, in the “faces” in paintings. And if we look at stars, clouds, and shadows we can find anything we want to find, so great is the indeterminacy of such finding places and so willing are we, for certain purposes, to accept the most minimal likenesses as “like.” Adena Rosmarin, The Power of Genre (1985) Adena Rosmarin's comment is part of a wider discussion of E. H. Gombrich's idea of the role of “schema” in perceptions of art—a concept he uses to explain, among other things, how it is that observers can perceive a face in a collection of lines and dots, and, more generally, why it makes sense to say that all art begins not with nothing but with something. A snowman starts with the schema that is snow, for example, and we “work the snow and balance the shapes till we recognize a man.” And not only do we work the snow to achieve some approximation of human faces and bodies, but we find human characteristics in—or, more accurately, make characters out of—all sorts of things, living and not. Certainly, we project character onto living nonhumans, such as cats, dogs, birds, and plants, imagining that they share our feelings of love, loneliness, and desire, but we also assign character and characteristics to inanimate objects and assorted phenomena: ships, cars, and hurricanes all get names; we may talk to the toaster, or grumble at a shoelace that, we imagine, stubbornly refuses—refuses!—to untie. Thus it is hardly surprising that literary characters, intended expressly as vehicles for imaginative occupation, take on a similarly outsize quality in our psyches. Words on a page, constructions of language, they invite us to consider them as soulmates and doppelgängers; nightmare—or perhaps ideal—versions of parents, brothers, sisters, friends, and selves: the families we might have chosen if we could; the me (or not me) nobody knows.",

      "title": "Does Trait Loneliness Predict Rejection of Social Robots?",
      "abstract": "Since chronic loneliness is both a painful individual experience and an increasingly serious social problem, robot companions have emerged as a result of robotization of social work to confront this issue. We foresee that social robots will become pervasive in the near future. Thus, it is crucial to pinpoint the relationship between chronic experiences of loneliness (i.e., trait loneliness) and both anthropomorphism and acceptance of such artificial intelligent agents. Previous research demonstrated that experimentally induced state loneliness increases anthropomorphic inferences about nonhuman agents such as pets. However, in the present research we found that trait (vs. state) loneliness - a permanent personality disposition that is not easily relieved (vs. transitory experiences caused by circumstance, and easily relieved) - reduced participants' anthropomorphic tendencies and acceptance of a social robot (regardless of the form: a picture of the robot, an on-site robot, or direct interaction with the robot). In particular, believing that the robot lacks good \"unique humanness\" traits (i.e., Humble, Thorough, Organized, Broadminded, and Polite) is one reason why dispositionally lonely participants are less likely to anthropomorphize a robot, which further prompts reduced acceptance of it. This finding suggests that unique humanness, exemplifying secondary emotions, is vital, not only in interpersonal contexts, but in establishing connections with social robots.",

      "title": "Die Rolle der Zeichenmaterialität in Interaktionen zwischen Mensch und Tier",
      "abstract": "The materiality of signs is much more important in interaction with animals than it is in human dialogues. Animals identify familiar humans olfactorily (individual smell), acoustically (voice, pattern of walking), and visually (shape, pattern of motion). For them, the intonation of utterances and the mood of gestures are more expressive than the words or gestures themselves because they inform about the sender’s mood (joy, fear, anger…) and the speech act (praise, warning, order…). Additionally, nose animals smell strong emotions. On the one hand, during their common history, men learned to interpret characteristic expressions of animals like wagging the tail or ruffling feathers. On the other hand, pets and domestic animals understand the facial expressions of men. Further indices of mood are body tension and proxemics. Greetings like giving the paw (dog) and giving the head (cat) come from the natural behavioral repertory and are reciprocated by humans – unlike the equally friendly licking of cows. Signs in a narrow sense are produced in order to communicate specific information to somebody else. Guide dogs, for example, learn numerous orders as well as signs for telling humans something specific. Riding animals and draft animals are guided by shouts (“Giddy up! “) and motoric signals (leg pressure, pull of the rein or guiding rope). A last group of signs are gestures for luring or chasing away which are mostly combined with specific shouts like “Here boy!” or “Pssssst!!!” Die Materialitat von Zeichen ist in der Interaktion mit Tieren viel wichtiger als in zwischenmenschlichen Dialogen. Tiere identifizieren bekannte Menschen olfaktorisch (individueller Geruch), akustisch (Stimme, Gangart) und visuell (Gestalt, Bewegungsmuster). Fur sie sind der Tonfall von Auserungen und die Gestimmtheit von Korperbewegungen aussagekraftiger als die Worte oder Gesten selbst, denn sie informieren uber die derzeitige Stimmung des Senders (Freude, Angst, Arger…) und den Sprechakt (Lob, Warnung, Befehl…). Nasentiere riechen zusatzlich starke Emotionen. Im Laufe ihrer gemeinsamen Geschichte lernten Menschen artspezifische Ausdrucksbewegungen von Tieren (Schwanzwedeln, Federn strauben usw.) zu deuten, umgekehrt verstehen Haus- und Nutztiere die menschliche Mimik. Weitere Anzeichen der Stimmung sind Korperspannung und Distanzverhalten. Grusgesten wie Pfotchengeben (Hund) und Kopfchengeben (Katze) stammen aus dem naturlichen Verhaltensrepertoire und werden – im Gegensatz zum ebenso freundlichen Ablecken von Rindern – vom Menschen erwidert. Echte Zeichen produziert man, um anderen etwas Bestimmtes mitzuteilen. So lernen Blindenhunde zahlreiche Befehle sowie umgekehrt Zeichen, die dem Menschen etwas Bestimmtes mitteilen. Reit- und Zugtiere werden durch Zurufe (“Hu!”) und motorische Hilfen (Schenkeldruck, Zug am Zugel oder Leitseil) gelenkt. Eine letzte Zeichengruppe sind Lock- und Scheuchgesten, die man meist mit artspezifischen Rufen wie “Putt-putt-putt” bzw. “Ksch!!! “ kombiniert.",

      "abstract": "One problem associated with the identification of modest anthropomorphic figurines dedicated at Greek sanctuaries is their degree of specificity. Especially in the Archaic and early Classical periods, distinguishing representations of divinities, or even divinities and mortals, is difficult because their attributes are often non-specific, ambiguous or unidentifiable (at least by us), or because they lack identifying features altogether. This ambiguity and flexibility could have been intentional for both technical and ritual reasons. Manufacturers definitely benefited by producing figurines with broad iconography that could be used for different purposes and serve various cults. Clients also benefited: non-specific figurines of divinities or mortals could be dedicated at various sanctuaries, acquiring specificity and significance through cultic context and function. At the same time, workshops could also respond to clients’ demands or to new cultic needs by creating or adapting types. Generic figurines could be endowed with a more specific meaning by the dedicator: they could have been personalised through the oral prayer accompanying the dedication or by the construction of a personal narrative through the grouping of offerings. On the other hand, in some cases, the merging of divine and mortal features, assimilating the dedicator with the god, may have been intentional.",

The coronavirus pandemic has shown that distance can unexpectedly become necessary and desirable.

This of course provoked a denial from the philosophers, for whom \"consciousness\" and \"mental\" were identical, and who protested that they could not conceive of such an absurdity as the \"unconscious mental.\" There was no help for it, however, and this idiosyncrasy of the philosophers could only be disregarded with a shrug. Experience (gained from pathological material, of which the philosophers were ignorant) of the frequency and power of impulses of which one knew nothing directly, and whose existence had to be inferred like some fact in the external world, left no alternative open. It could be pointed out, incidentally, that this was only treating one's own mental life as one had always treated other people's. One did not hesitate to ascribe mental processes to other people, although one had no immediate consciousness of them and could only infer them from their words and actions. But what held good for other people must be applicable to oneself. Anyone who tried to push the argument further and to conclude from it that one's own hidden processes belonged actually to a second consciousness would be faced with the concept of a consciousness of a thing of which one knew nothing, of an \"unconscious consciousness\" - and this would scarcely be preferable to the assumption of an \"unconscious mental.\" . . . The further question as to the ultimate nature of this unconscious is no more sensible or profitable than the older one as to the nature of the conscious.(1925d [1924], XX, 31-2)",

      "title": "ON THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN INDIVIDUAL AND SCIENTIFIC CONCEPTS ABOUT HUMAN IN CONNECTION WITH INCREASING DIFFICULTY OF PATIENT CARE. INTRODUCTION",
      "abstract": "Ideas about a person help you understand or explain your own actions or the actions of others. Individual and scientific images of a person are transmitted through upbringing and education, possibly also through \"genetic\" memory. These images of people form the structure of human perception. Human actions are ultimately based on this perception. Thinking about one's own image of a person and deciphering other people's images of a person always have a reductionist character. This may explain why action-oriented disciplines such as a doctor, psychologist or nurse have a specific view of the person. The successes of individual scientific disciplines are the result of a deep division, or rather, the dismemberment of the whole in order to supposedly better explain or understand a person. But putting the pieces back together is often overlooked. The process of disassembling or deepening and thus constantly recognizing the essence of a person is an ongoing task. However, people often make decisions against the background of current (everyday) observations. But this also means that before making decisions for the future, we must think in advance about their consequences for a person. The formulation of such foresight or scenarios of the future must be made on the basis of the perception of the entire human being, and not only take into account the consequences for partial concepts of the human being. In the health care system, patients, professions and institutions meet each other. These professions, equipped, by the way, with an excellent repertoire of scientific discoveries made for humanity within the framework of individual sciences, are faced precisely for this reason with conflicting images and perspectives of humanity. The latter influence practical actions. Parallel to this, a growing individualization of therapeutic therapies can be observed in practice. This increases the complexity of the activity. It also means the development or, rather, a clearer differentiation of subjects into specialists and generalists. In other words, we are talking about processes based on the division of labor, in which the specialist receives a higher status in terms of competence in decision-making, economics and social power. The article examines the subjective orientation in the treatment of diseases and the need for care, the consequences of a supra-institutional perspective of therapeutic processes and the solution of the problem of divergence of competencies and interests of actors through the perspective of a person in his essential unity.",

A child may become a <italic>deprived child</italic> when deprived of essential features of home life. Lack of hope is then a basic feature, but the antisocial act is an expression of that hope, and needs to be thought of in this way in treatment. The child who steals, for example, is not looking for <italic>the object stolen but the mother over whom he or she has rights</italic>. These rights derive from the fact that (from the child’s point of view) the mother was created by the child. It is therefore a picture of the child’s unconscious omnipotence and control over the mother that has led to the stealing of the object. The child’s greediness, manifest in stealing, is part of the early infant self’s compulsion to seek for a cure from the mother who caused the initial deprivation. At the basis of the antisocial tendency is a good early experience that has been lost.",

They would lead to the unrestrained creation and change, or even irreversible damages to the landscape. Eventually, human beings may bury ourselves in the abyss of desire. Fortunately, such a doom could be avoided if humans can wisely utilize the ecosystem services (landscape services) obtained from nature, instead of immoderately consuming natural resources, to maintain the harmonious relationship between human (desires) and nature (landscapes). This can not only meet human’s primary needs like survival and safety, but also realize higher-level desires.",

Four cases will illustrate that in psychosomatic patients a as if actionability, e.g. as a mere over-adaptation following life-events of significant others, is predominantly given replacing a self-conform action-ability, and that the assertion of self-feeling is preponderantly fixed to the somatic phenomena. Thus the historical life-performance remains arrested by the predominance of unachieved affective moments in the condition of an affective ambivalence, though psychosomatic patients are well aware enough of the existential necessity to arrange temporality as an existential quality of the futural aspects of their life-performance.",

But it often is expressed in the world in state-like terms—in response to challenging but often unpredictable situations where it is unclear who will rise to the challenges or even how we could know in advance who would be able to address the challenges at hand. Whereas traits tend to be stable, long term, and somewhat predictable in their manifestations, states tend to be unstable, often short term, and frequently unpredictable in the ways they manifest themselves. This article introduces the concept of state-giftedness. Because state-giftedness is not easily identifiable, everyone needs to be taught how to respond to the unexpected and unpredictable situations that will be consequential for their and others’ lives. Because of the unpredictability, these will be situations for which a ready repertoire of responses is neither available nor easily constructed.",

      "abstract": "The sense of precarity is specifically human. It accompanies the consciousness that “what is” is in becoming and can stop being. All lifeforms live through signs, but we humans are also endowed with a capacity for metasemiosis. As semiotic animals, we have self-consciousness, feel responsibility, and feel apprehension: we are consciously aware of our subjection to precarity. G. Semerari called it insecuritas, in relation to both self and others. Fear “of the other” entails a threefold genitive: object, subject, and ethical (“for” the other) genitives. When concern for the other becomes overwhelming, the self may pass from non-indifference to indifference, an escape through identity: given competing identities, the other is not my concern. Yet the other remains inextricably involved, especially in globalization. Apprehension for the other cannot be eliminated. Semiotics explains this in terms of sign-network interconnectivity while “semioethics” develops the relations between signs and values. It insists that life can only flourish in relation to the other (including nonhuman life) and calls for responsibility.",

      "title": "Noms De Guerre: The Power of Naming in War and Conflict in Middle-Earth",
      "abstract": "I.R.R. Tolkien skillfully Deploys deep understanding of the mythic and psychological power of names and naming throughout his legendarium. Among other aspects of naming, his stories highlight many ways in which names, naming, re-naming, and un-naming can be used as strategies in war and conflict. Names are, in one sense, the outward indication of power negotiation. The namer, the one who bestows new name or uses an already-given name, reveals, through the choice of name they use, their relationship to that which they name. It may be more or less equal relationship; may be one of exerting power over someone or something by imposing name on or by using name that will influence those who hear it; or may be one of subordination, using name to flatter or placate someone or something more powerful. A name may be used in magical sense, as form of logizomai--that is, naming something as that which you desire to be or become--or to give something greater power by distinguishing from others of its kind. A person may rename him- or herself--out of desire for anonymity, to indicate an alliance with someone or something else, or out of pride or hubris. (1) Here I wish to examine several examples of how names and naming are used in these ways in war and conflict in Tolkien's legendarium: weapons that are named, noms de guerre that are chosen by or given to individuals, new names adopted for variety of reasons, and names that are taken away. The use of naming as magical power in war ultimately leads us to Sauron's great and magical act of naming. NAMED WEAPONS Why might be named? Not all cultures have tradition of naming weapons. The Iliad describes the appearance, weight, symbolism, and lineage of Achilles's shield and spear at obsessive length without naming them; neither is Odysseus's bow, the one that proves his identity, named in The Odyssey (Grindley 151-53). But in the Northern and medieval literature with which Tolkien was personally and professionally engaged, named swords abound: Sigurd's Gram, (2) Beowulf's Naegling and Hrunting, Arthur's Excalibur, Roland's Durendal, Charlemagne's Joieuse, and so on. (3) With name, gains its own identity, even personality of sorts (Poudrier 35); name also marks as an heirloom tying generations together and legitimizing the heir who holds it. A named may be further distinguished by runes and inscriptions of power enhancing the abilities of the warrior who bears it (Burdge and Burke 703), ensuring victory or protection and further ennobling its bearer (Bribois 94), or bringing luck in battle (Davidson 67); the name itself may endow [the bearer] with [...] special powers (Bliss 77). In story, the hero's particular provides a concentrated symbolic functionality (Grindley 151), even more so if named, and the hero and his are inextricably linked (Flieger 147). Literary sword names often emphasiz[e] their power to do harm [and] to test the opponent [...]. [T]hey show imaginative personification of the weapon (Davidson 102). (4) Of the named weapons in Tolkien's writings, the vast majority are swords; the sword, as Ewart Oakeshott argues, possesses a potent mystique which sets above any other man-made object (qtd. in Whetter and McDonald 5). (5) There are only few singular examples of other types of named weapons. Aeglos (6) was the spear of Gil-galad, broken when he fell in combat against Sauron. Belthronding, borne by Beleg, is the only named bow, and Dailir its particular special arrow. (Bard did use his Black Arrow in combat against Smaug, and the Red Arrow was token of the agreement of Rohan to aid Gondor in war if needed, but those are not names on the same level; they fall somewhere between names and simple descriptors.) Dramborleg was the great axe favored by Tuor in battle; Durin's Axe is special heirloom weapon, but as with the Black and Red Arrows, the name is not true name like Dramborleg. …",

This seems true for some behaviours in early childhood autism. Ethology has specialized in analyzing such non-verbal behaviour. Ethological motivation analysis, the study of context dependence and of the development of such behaviours in the individual patient should be exploited for their interpretation. Mere description of behaviour is not likely to contribute much. Psychiatric thinking on the interaction of genetic and environmental factors does not fully agree with ethological and biological views.",

      "abstract": "truth for the pure joy of knowing it? Let those believe it who may. For my part, such an opinion would seem to me strangely blind, in view of the overwhelming mass of contrary evidence. No: the philosopher of this passage seeks of the essence of the universe for the same reason all the men of his time (and even of much later times in India) sought it: because he believes if he knows One, and identifies it with his own true self, he can by knowledge control all cosmic forces, and therefore his own destiny. His that art thou is motivated in the same way as the Brhad Aranyaka's I am Brahman. He who knows he is mystically the All, partakes of its essence, is at one with It, and therefore cannot be subject to any outside influence which might cause any fear, danger, sorrow, or unsatisfied desire. That for once the author does not say so in definite terms means only to him it was a perfectly obvious matter of course.36 It went without saying. It is really surprisingly lucky practically all other similar passages do take the trouble to state it so definitely. This belief in the power of knowledge gives us the clue to the employment of the term braihman as a name for the ultimate, First Principle, about which there has been such endless discussion. Brahman means simply holy knowledge , or, concretely, a Vedic hymn or incantation, is, a concrete expression of this mystic wisdom; the Vedic mind feels no difference between the abstract and the concrete sides of this concept. Moreover, all knowledge is, to the Vedic mind, holy, mysterious, religious or magical knowledge. It always possesses this magic power. The wise man and the priest or religious (magical) practitioner (vipra, WM'ui brahmndn mase., etc.) are completely identical from the Vedic 3a As in BrhU. 2. 1 it is also not stated, but clearly must be understood, for the reasons explained in footnote 28, above. Apart from these two, 1 can find no other early Upanisad statement of this doctrine (the unity of the human soul with the world-principle) which does not make clear the fruit or benefit to be derived from knowing it. Certainly the YAjfiavalkya dialog, BrhU. 3, is not an exception. It not only indicates at various points in its course (e. g. 3. 1 passim, see p. 102 above; 3. 2. 12 = MAdhy. 11; 3. 3. 2; 3. 5 Madhy. 4; 3. 8. 10) knowledge of its mysteries is to bring fruition of desires; but it concludes with the climactic statement Understanding, bliss, the Brahman, the highest goal of the giver of bounty, belong to him who stands steadfast in knowledge of this (3. 9.",

      "title": "Egosystem and EcosystemMotivational Perspectives on Caregiving",
      "abstract": "In this essay, we consider the motivations people have for caregiving, and the consequences of these motivations for the self and others. We argue that there are at least two fundamentally different views, or motivational perspectives, that people can have about caregiving. Caregiving in the egosystem is viewed as a means for people to satisfy their own needs and desires; although their behavior may appear selfless or self-sacrificing, they provide care because of what they will obtain, or what it means about them. In contrast, caregiving in the ecosystem results from genuine concern for the well-being of others; although such caregiving often has benefits for the self, those benefits are not the primary reasons why people provide care. These two motivational perspectives on caregiving have paradoxical effects; we describe evidence that caregiving in the egosystem, which aims to obtain benefits for the self, actually undermines the support the caregiver receives from others, undermines relationship quality, decreases the caregiver’s self-esteem and mental health, and even decreases the regard the care recipient has for the caregiver. Because caregivers often are unaware of these paradoxical effects, when they feel that their needs are not being met, they can persist with giving care in the egosystem, creating just the opposite of what they really want. In contrast, caregiving in the ecosystem, actually does benefit the self, in the form of increased support received from others, increased self-esteem and mental health in the caregiver, and increased regard the recipient has for the caregiver.",

Indeed, both thinkers do the same thing: they expose a real and deeply hidden tendency in men: not the desire of knowledge, but the desire of not knowing anything about their own souls. They expose what people want to keep in the dark: the certitude or the falsehood of their judgements, the limits and the pursuits of our thought.

From the point of view of diagnostic symptoms, these disabilities in learning stem from processing sensory information differently, and apparently extracting and processing meaning differently. Children with autistic spectrum disorders may over- or under-respond to different sorts of sensory stimuli: A child with autism may hear something and ignore it; or he may hear something chat is so apparently intense that he covers his ears with his hands or flaps his arms and vocalizes in a frantic perturbed fashion. A child with autism may see something (or someone) and seemingly “look right through” what he sees; or he may seize the object with one hand, hold it to the periphery of his vision with a strong vertical orientation, and stare fixedly at it out of the corners of his eyes, while rotating it slightly back and forth. A child with autism may assiduously ignore strangers, but selectively approach anyone with fluffy hair and grab the hair and smell it.",

      "abstract": "The nature of psychological harm is an immaterial nature that does not affect money or the body, but affects emotion, honor, moral values and social status. Therefore, jurisprudence has long hesitated to accept the idea of compensation for psychological damage. This type of damage affects the so-called social aspect of moral, literary or psychological edema, usually to be associated with physical damage, or affects the emotion or feeling of pain caused by the self and sorrows. Hence, he attributes the emotional aspect of moral and psychological edema, so that he alone is not accompanied by material damage, and has inflicted on other things of a financial nature, such as religious belief or moral ideas. Human dignity is based on the principle of human equality.

In other words, since we have no means of going beyond the restricted window that our senses provide of reality, the latter is too complicated and substantially inaccessible to complete knowledge. All that we can do is to limit ourselves to constructing a representation of reality based on information gained from experience. In this vision, therefore, our knowledge is always relative to a perspective and is conditioned by a point of view, a product of the human mind, and not something inherent to the order of things. Science, therefore, does not study the physical world per se, but rather our way of depicting some regularities selected from our experience, that can be observed in certain conditions and from a particular perspective.",

Higher dimensional patterns are rarely if ever encountered. Pattern recognition can be further divided into recognizing existing features that have a well‐known effect on an image, or the search for coherent subpatterns that may have a common cause. A pattern therefore consists either of features that are known to exist, but are somehow difficult to identify, or of features that may get a specific meaning afterwards (i.e. after they are detected).",

(section 9.3); in what sense do the partners in such a relationship have need of each other and of their relationship and therefore experience desire or eros? (section 9.4); in what sense is the attitude of the partners toward each other one of unconditional giving or agape? (section 9.5). In discussing these aspects of love, we will distinguish between the roles which they have within the following ‘dimensions of love’: romantic love, neighbourly love, our love for God, and God's love for us. In all this we must remember that God is not like other people. What then are the limits of using the model of love in talking about our relationship to God, and what is the conceptual price we have to pay for doing so?",

      "abstract": "A disposition’s trigger is its circumstances of manifestation or stimulus condition. Examples of triggers include striking, stretching, and submerging in water. Some argue that no dispositions have triggers. However, such a view leaves it unclear how dispositions can be testable or action guiding. Furthermore, triggers are events, and events involve an object acquiring a property. This leads to a regress problem for pandispositionalism, the view that all properties are dispositions. Some dispositions need a stimulus in order to manifest, and some do not. Dispositions that manifest spontaneously and those that are constantly manifesting do not have triggers. However, some dispositions have a latent or dormant state, and only manifest in certain circumstances.",

But unlike learning some other physical operations (those which require skill, like playing the piano, cooking, sewing, or driving a car) the notion of excellence or expertise cannot be applied unmodified to the performance of ritualized action; for ritualization itself tends to undermine the link between the purposes for which an action is performed and the form the action takes. In performing an act in ritualized form, as a ritual act, you perform it as you do, and not some other way, just because it is so prescribed, and not because it makes sense to you to do so, or because you have reasons for doing so. You have reasons only for ‘enacting the ritual’, and whatever those purposes may be, the way to ‘get it right’ as a physical act remains the same. Nevertheless, the relation between purposes and ritualized action is not altogether straightforward.",

Granting that such conditions obtain at the beatific vision, I suggest beatific enjoyment requires a specific kind of knowledge of God; namely, fundamental personal knowledge. However, attaining such personal knowledge necessitates the divine gifting of a special grace, that is, a power to know God’s infinite essence. Furthermore, this power, and so, this knowledge, can come in an infinite number of degrees. Granting this, one saint could come to a greater degree of fundamental personal knowledge of God than another, and therefore, one saint might experience a greater intensity of joy than another. Despite this difference in intensity, however, both saints may have their joy ‘complete’.",

Among the variety of behavioral forms in animals, in dogs in particular, a special place is occupied by behaviors that are expressed in the form of aggression. Establishing the place of unmotivated (idiopathic) aggression of animals (dogs) in this series, as behavior, is important when developing certain legislative acts that determine a certain attitude towards animals in general, especially aggressive in their behavior towards humans. When solving issues regarding humane and responsible attitude towards animals, in relation to the concept of “unmotivated aggression of animals” it is necessary to understand what animal behavior is, forms of their behavior, whether unmotivated aggression of animals is a particular form of behavior. In general, unmotivated aggression in an animal (dog) should be understood as its defensive behavior, expressed in going beyond the stereotypical behavior typical of an animal of a given species and manifested in the form of aggression towards a person and (or) an animal, not caused by any external cause (factor).",

Neither brain identity nor memory convergence are adequate grounds for ascribing identity, even in the absence of DID. Someone suffering from DID is no less responsible than a drunkard for the crimes she commits when not in her right—or at least her usual—mind, and perhaps no more responsible than someone suffering from some other mental disorder. We may decide to punish someone suffering from DID for her crimes only when she and her presumed alter both share a brain (as obviously they do) and might—at least after therapy—have memories in common, and only when the alternate personality that led to the crime is herself sane. But we should not pretend to ourselves that this judgment rests upon a clear and uncontentious notion of identity.",

The variety of sociologies is no less disconcerting—not should we forget the sociological psychologies and the psychological sociologies. Formerly man was considered to be an animal rationale , a rational being; now he has become simply a vital being, not further qualified. Since man lives in community with his fellows, it was formerly the practice to inquire into the structure and organization which society ought to have in order to correspond to the rational and human nature of its members. But today no such question is raised; it is taken for granted that man, as a social animal, must adjust himself to his environment or suffer the consequence to his well-being and his happiness. It is no longer a question of whether one may or one should adjust oneself to certain social conditions: it is now only a question of what is the most effective means or technique of adjustment.",

Mental reports fall into different categories. Some report something of a dispositional nature – they do not imply anything about the person's present state of consciousness. Reports of someone's beliefs seem to be of this kind, as do reports of his likes and dislikes. To say that at a certain time one person liked cheese and another person disliked cheese is not to say anything about their actual states of consciousness at that time – about their actual experiences, or thoughts, or feelings.

      "abstract": "The focus of another person's gaze is an important cue in social interactions, helping us to understand others' intentions, predict their behavior, and allocate our own attention appropriately. The perception of gaze vergence provides information about the distance at which another person is fixating, but has yet to receive much empirical attention. Here, we report that observers display systematic biases when perceiving others' gaze vergence and depth of fixation. Specifically, they perceive others as having convergent gaze and fixating at closer distances, especially when gaze is directed downward or observed under conditions of sensory uncertainty. These biases may reflect the predominance of convergent over divergent gaze in everyday social interactions and implicit knowledge of the physical structure of the environment, in which objects below our line of sight are typically closer. These findings demonstrate the sophistication of social vision, in which our visual perception of others is shaped by statistical regularities, and help to establish the perception of others' gaze vergence and fixation distance as a subject of psychological investigation.

The distinction provides an especially apt explication of the concept of existence and is for this reason especially pertinent to pragmatics and intensional logic, encompassing as they do such areas as tense, epistemic, deontic and modal logic.2 For example, apropos of tense logic some attributes, such as being red, being round, being hard, etc., cannot be possessed at a time except by objects existing at that time. Other attributes, especially relational attributes between objects whose lifespans need not overlap, such as being an ancestor of everyone (someone) now existing, being remembered by someone now existing,3 etc., may very well be possessed by objects which no longer",

Bestial fury is the tale of the self-destructive consequences of attempting to use ferocity and fury against one's own enemies, and the endeavors to keep these forces in check and bend them towards one's own ends. However, the fact that man displays anger and wrath is not the sign of a descent towards the feral, animal realm, but, on the contrary, of an ascent. Man has risen up towards civilization. With this have come collective furies - the common angers of a human multitude, where the single personality is nullified.

The proclamation of Prometheus, 'in a word I detest all the Gods,' is her own profession, her own slogan against all the gods of heaven and earth who do not recognize man's self-consciousness as the highest divinity. There shall be none other beside it.” Now this attitude of defying God goes hand in hand with an attitude toward the world: one who cannot endure the idea of God's sovereignty often resents even the “givenness” of things with specific natures. It is not just that he senses that they would lead him back to God, but also that they, each with its own inner logos which imposes itself on man, are themselves felt to belong to the detested gods. Such a man approaches these things to destroy their givenness, and to make new objects out of them which reflect himself and his powers, and depend on him. The Austrian art historian, Hans Sedlmayr, describes this attitude as follows: Dem Menschen, der sich ganz autonom proklamiert, muss es unertraeglich sein, Kreaturen zu begegnen, die offenbar nicht seine Geschoepfe sind. Es ist ein prometheischer und im Grund narzistischer Traum, sich durch Technik und naturfreie Kunst eine menschliche Umwelt zu bauen, in der man nichts und niemandem begegnet als den Schoepfungen des eigensten Menschengestes.",

Este desafio convoca al analista y su quehacer- sobre todo en las instituciones publicas - a brindar tratamientos a partir de una practica interdisciplinaria pero sostenida desde la etica psicoanalitica.\r\nPalabras clave\r\nEleccion Objeto Goce Designacion\r\n\r\nABSTRACT\r\nON ELECTIONS Intoxication is a nonsymptomatic answer that tries to annul a subjective position, that is characterized by not wanting to know nothing, that it is guided by doing, and that shows a clear divorce with the inconciente. A series of interviews - with a patient brought by its mother by its consumption of paco they allow to locate a first moment where it does not slide in the speech. His “paquero” being leaves it designated only in an act, and compulsive, leaving it single and out of play. The toxic in this case the PACO works like yoico it does not want to wake up, it does not want to know to nothing on its own determination and its capacity to choose. Nevertheless the encounter with an analyst allowed a lodging of its way to enjoy so that it can be transformed into something singular, in something more symbolic than it guards the identification to the sweepings, to the remainder. “Waste basket”: designation this completes that it makes in a bow with others, beyond the unique relation that maintained before with the substance. This challenge summons to the analyst and its task mainly in the public institutions - to offer treatments from a interdisciplinary but maintained practice from the psychoanalytic ethics\r\nKey words\r\nElection Pain Purpose Enjoyment",

Unlike the color of a car or the loudness of a piece of music, both of which can be more or less directly perceived by the respective sensory systems, the trustworthiness of a person or the aggressiveness of a social exchange can only be inferred or construed from various indirect cues. People have to go beyond the information given in order to arrive at a social judgment. In this sense, social perception is an active and constructive process of the perceiver. Not surprisingly, then, the same social situation or the same person may be “perceived” quite differently by different perceivers, or by the same perceiver in different situational contexts.",

Destiny is thought of as contradictory, ambivalent beginning. It is able to help or hinder. Carriers of the Polish language are ambivalent in their relation to the destiny. Presence of the destiny may either be approved or denied. Poles have different views on the nature of destiny. On the one hand, destiny is presented as unchangeable and predefined from above. On the other, there is a view that it is created during the life (existence), and, for example, a person can have a significant influence on it. Metaphorically in Polish destiny is represented by the signs of person, connecting or disconnecting, gracious or formidable beginning.",

However, documentation stresses on the responsibility of the observer for her or his observation, descriptions, interpretations and explanations. Meaning does not come from seeing or observation alone. It comes from the acts of interpretation. Documentation is not about assessing whether a child is conforming to a set of standards. By contrast, it is mainly about trying to see and understand what is going on in the pedagogical work and what the child is capable of without any predetermined framework of expectations and norms. Processes of observation and documentation are never objective and hence not neutral. Objectivity is a subject's false view that observing can take place without him. We have to realize and admit that documentation always holds our own subjective feelings, wishes and values which should not be seen as something negative but rather as something positive, not something to avoid but rather to understand how these enter into the process of documentation.",

How do we know that the excellences recognized in our practices and form of life – even if they should contribute to our flourishing in ways described in Chapter 13 – are worthy of clear recognition with praise by all persons from all points of view, whether or not those other persons can appreciate or even understand the practices or excellences?",

God’s transcendence presupposes that he is completely different from human beings. Therefore, one may think that there are some reasons for God’s hiddenness that do not interfere with His love. In addition, God’s silence must be distinguished from His hiddenness. In fact, silence does not reject the act of communication, but only points to other – more personal – forms.",

If the having of intellective attitudes, however, is simply a corollary of the having of intellect and will, then Aquinas's relational method mandates attributing joy and pleasure to God. Patterned on the attribution of pleasure and joy, active divine love is a corollary of intellective appetite in God. Aquinas approaches the associative aspect of God's love when he takes as primary what appears to be God's volition of union with other things, and then uses that as the basis for one of his arguments for the thesis that God loves himself and other things. Aquinas argues that some virtues, such as truthfulness, justice, and liberality, which are sources of activities devoid of passion, are divine attributes. Liberality is the virtue most pertinent to the subject matter of this chapter because liberality is the one that is indispensable to love.",

      "abstract": "Theories that reject the existence of altruism presume that emotional benefits serve as ulterior motives for doing good deeds. These theories argue that even in the absence of material and reputational benefits, individuals reap utility from the feelings associated with doing good. In response to this normative view of altruism, this article examines the descriptive question of whether laypeople penalize emotional prosocial actors. Six studies find that emotion serves as a positive signal of moral character, despite the intrapsychic benefits associated with it. This is true when emotion motivates prosocial behavior (Studies 1, 2, 3, and 5) and when emotion is a positive outcome of prosocial behavior (i.e., \"warm glow\"; Studies 4, 5, and 6). Emotional actors are considered to be moral because people believe emotion provides an honest and direct signal that the actor feels a genuine concern for others. Consequently, prosocial actors who are motivated by the expectation of emotional rewards are judged differently than prosocial actors who are motivated by other benefits, such as reputational or material rewards (Study 6). These results suggest that laypeople do not view altruism as incompatible with all benefits to the self.",

      "abstract": "When we wait for a significant other, it is not as if we are waiting for someone who looks like her, talks like her, or even walks like her. Instead, what we want is her. And, the same goes for the afterlife: if there is an afterlife, we long to see our loved ones. Not those who look like our loved ones, who sound like them, or even smell like them, but we actually want them. In the study of human nature, this is, arguably, one of the modern insights on humanity. The question of the “particularity” of human beings matters. In technical philosophical studies, the question of “particularity” is a question of thisness (i.e., the fact that objects are countable as discrete in virtue of some property or feature that makes an object what it is). What makes one person this person rather than that person? By showing how the concept of thisness is important in modern and contemporary theology, I will argue for a specific view as that which accurately captures both the historical consensus and the modern emphasis of personhood.",

The thesis that an agent’s well-being just consists in the occurrence of events wanted is rejected. Overvold replaces it by the view that the motivating desires involve the existence of the agent, alive, at the time of their satisfaction. This view seems counterintuitive. The whole desire-satisfaction theory is to be rejected partly because we dont’t think an event worthwile if it is not liked when it occurs, and partly because the theory cannot give a sensible account of what is good for an individual when his desires change. A more satisfactory view is that the goodness of an event for a person is fixed by his total gratifications as a result of its occurrence, provided they would occur if the person were fully informed about facts knowledge of which would change them if it existed. But self-sacrifice seems to involve not only voluntary diminution of well-being in this sense, but belief that the action is taken for the benefit of someone else. Overvold’s view leaves open the possibility that acting morally is never contrary to self-interest, if one of the agent’s major interests is that he act morally. This is an ingenious suggestion, but seems a bit counterintuitive.",

What motivates that stranger to act, causing absolute harm to himself and death with no reward received in return? What motivates the dying man who has nothing to gain from charity decide to give away his fortunes to complete strangers? One answer is pure altruism, the selfless concern for others’ well-being at the cost of one’s own well-being, time, or energy. This would be a satisfactory answer that seems to have been accepted society, that selflessness can truly exist. However, there are serious concerns about the selfless aspect of altruism with some scholars, such as evolutionary psychologists and proponents of the social exchange theory, claiming that it is not merely unlikely for it to exist, but that it is outright impossible, while others counter these claims be it through innate, biologically, or religious conviction of divinely acquired selflessness or Batson’s infamous empathy-altruism hypothesis. Regardless of which route one takes, the means to the end do not require proper identification to notice that humans do participate in behavior that penalizes them and benefits others, but the question is can and do they do so independently of self-interest?",

However, it is possible for him to adapt himself well to the environment, when the psychological equilibrium be formed on the basis of biological equilibrium. Man acts in various ways in order to maintain such equilibrium. Personality develops itself into a new form through adjustment to the environment, and also through creating a new environment. Human needs should be met adequately to achieve the desirable adaptation to the environment through the continuos processes of control and creation for adjustment. When human needs not be met or met to excess, an emotional instability would result, that is the cause of maladjustment. Psychological mechanism is used to overcome emotional needs and tensions, while anatomical mechanism isused to protect the organization of human body from maladjustment. Especially psychological mechanism appears differently according to the individual; as it were, it appears as the from of mechanisms, of escape, defense, and aggressiveness. Among these there are those accepted socially and those rejected socially. The Mechanisms accepted socially lead to the low level of personality development. Therefore, guidance programs should be made so that pupils may not take the unacceptable mehcanisms.\r\n The following methods are recommended to guide pupils in terms of adjustment mechanism:\r\n 1. To eliminate factors for frustration through controlling conditions of envioronments.\r\n 2. To give the opportunities to evaluate himself, so that he may know whether or not behaviors to meet his needs be acceptable sociallly.\r\n 3. To train perseverance in case the pupil be frustrated psychologically.\r\n 4. To foster ability to determine the adequate standard of psychological needs.",

Yet only when we have conceptualized thing in some way, only then, can we think about it. Nature does not give anyone instructions about how things are to be conceptualized. We must create that conceptualization, alone or with others. Once conceptualized, thing is integrated by us into network of ideas (since no concept or idea ever stands alone). We conceptualize things personally by means of our own ideas and socially by means of the ideas of others (social groups). We explain one idea by means of other ideas. So if someone asked us to say what friend is, we might say, as the Webster's New World does, a person whom one knows well and is fond of. If asked to say what it means to know someone well, we would likely respond by introducing yet further ideas or concepts. Humans approach virtually everything in experience as something that can be by the power of our minds to create conceptualization and to make inferences on the basis of it (hence to create further conceptualizations). We do this so routinely and automatically that we don't typically recognize ourselves as engaged in these processes. In our everyday life we don't first experience the world in concept-less form and then deliberately place what we experience into categories in order to make sense of things. Rather, every act in which we engage is automatically given social meaning by those around us. To the uncritical mind, it is as if things are given to us with their name inherent in them. Thus we see not shapes and colors but trees, clouds, grass, roads, people, children, sunsets, and so on. Some of these concepts we obtain from our native language. Some are the result of our social conditioning into the mores, folkways, and taboos of particular social groups and particular society. We then apply these concepts automatically, as if the names belonged to the things by nature, as if we had not created these concepts in our own minds. If we want to help students develop as critical thinkers, we must help them come to terms with this human power of mind, the power to create concepts through which we, and they, see and experience the world. For it is precisely this capacity they must take charge of if they are to take command of their thinking. To become proficient critical thinker, they must become the master of their own conceptualizations. They must develop the ability to mentally remove this or that concept from the things named by concept and try out alternative ideas, alternative names. As general semanticists often say: word is not the The word is not the thing! If students are trapped in one set of concepts (ideas, words)-as they often are-then they think of things in one rigid way.. Word and thing become one and the same in their minds. They are then unable to act as truly free persons. Command of Concepts Requires Command of Language Use To gain command of concepts and ideas, it is important, first, to gain command of the established uses of words (as codified in good dictionary). For example, if one is proficient in the use of the English language, one recognizes significant difference in the language between needing and wanting, between having judgment and being judgmental, between having information and gaining knowledge, between being humble and being servile. Command of distinctions such as these (and many others) in the language has significant influence upon the way we interpret our experience. Without this command, we confuse these important discriminations and distort the important realities they help us distinguish. What follows is an activity which you can have students do to begin to test their understanding of basic concepts: Testing Your Understanding of Basic Concepts Each word pair below illustrates an important distinction marked by our language. …",

The classic animal models for human psychiatric conditions involves rodents As prey species, their normal behaviors of avoidance would be considered pathological in humans and dogs. Hence, such models may not be homologous for similar behaviors found in psychiatric pathology in humans. 2. Dogs exhibit pathological behavioral conditions that may be equivalent to certain human psychiatric conditions. These canine conditions appear spontaneously or endogenously in the absence of genetic or neurochemcial manipulation, and as such, may be homologous to the human condition. 3. If canine conditions approach homology with human conditions they should have excellent face, predictive, and construct validity. 4. The canine conditions of separation anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder, cognitive dysfunction, dominance aggression, and panic disorder have good to excellent validity at all explored levels for human generalized anxiety disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, Alzheimer's disease, impulse control disorders, and panic disorder. 5.

Corresponding to these highly aggressive meanings, philobatic people are usually imagined as robust, upstanding, conquering heroes, enjoying their independence, unflinchingly facing dangers, and defiantly going their own way. Auto-erotic activities, in fact all sexual activities as well as thrills, have a good deal in common. The grammatical forms—middle voice, reflexive or intransitive forms—are also used for the expression of another most important relationship, the field of auto-erotic activities, from scratching to masturbation. It has long been known that over-indulgently brought up children masturbate on the whole much more intensely than the average child. If the environment is greatly indifferent right from the start and the neglected child hardly ever experiences loving human contact, both his object relationships and his auto-erotic activities will become stunted, as was clearly demonstrated by R. Spitz's films on severely deprived children.",

      "title": "Caring is Costly: People Avoid the Cognitive Work of Compassion",
      "abstract": "Compassion—the warm, caregiving emotion that emerges from witnessing the suffering of others—has long been considered an important moral emotion for motivating and sustaining prosocial behavior. Some suggest that compassion draws from empathic feelings to motivate prosocial behavior, while others try to disentangle these processes to examine their different functions for human pro-sociality. Many suggest that empathy, which involves sharing in others’ experiences, can be biased and exhausting, whereas warm compassionate concern is more rewarding and sustainable. If compassion is indeed a warm and positive experience, then people should be motivated to seek it out when given the opportunity. Here, we ask whether people spontaneously choose to feel compassion, and whether such choices are associated with perceiving compassion as cognitively costly. Across all studies, we found that people opted to avoid compassion when given the opportunity; reported compassion to be more cognitively taxing than empathy and objective detachment; and opted to feel compassion less often to the degree they viewed compassion as cognitively costly. We also revealed two important boundary conditions: first, people were less likely to avoid compassion for close (vs. distant) others, and this choice difference was associated with viewing compassion for close others as less cognitively costly. Second, in the final study we found that with more contextually enriched and immersive pleas for help, participants preferred to escape feeling compassion, though their preference did not differ from also escaping remaining objectively detached. These results temper strong arguments that compassion is an easier route to prosocial motivation.",

      "title": "Is the mind a substance for Hume?",
      "abstract": "David Hume, like Locke, is very sceptical about the nature of substance, whether material or immaterial. And he goes much further than Locke's agnosticism, saying that both sorts of substance are inconceivable. He thinks we cannot get beyond our impressions (roughly, our sensations) to know anything whatever about their causes. For all we know, our impressions could be caused by any of the following: material objects (whether similar to our impressions or wholly unlike them); God (as Berkeley might say); our own minds (either dreaming or hallucinating), that is, nothing at all external; an arch deceiver; any other as-yet-un-imagined cause. But knowledge of these causes is in principle impossible for us: like Berkeley, Hume holds that we only ever know or have experience of mental items. We thus have no standing to hypothesize, let alone any grounds for inferring, the existence of anything that is, as Hume says, “specifically different” (of a different species or kind) from impressions and ideas: the two sorts of mental items that are the only ones he recognizes and which he refers to in general as “perceptions” (T I.ii. vi, 67–8).",

      "abstract": "The figures and speech of passion are clinically polymorphous and heterogeneous: from the baroque of the mystical ecstasy, the iconophily of religious and political ideologies, the collector's usual fetishism and the paranoiac insanity of hatred to the passions of knowing and loving. These are at the same time a passion for life as well as for self-destruction, for showing oneself as well for not knowing oneself, for representing oneself as well as for non representing oneself. Passion bares the impossible of mourning, its real point that gives a boost to the continual work. Passion confronts us to the essence of the being, to its fundamental distress. The being, whose shadow is projecting itself on the object of the passion, gives a name and a face to that object, and receives back its marks. That explains why passion is always accompanied by suffering. Moreover, passion is suffering according to its etymology: until the XVIth century, the word \"passionate\" meant somebody who suffered physically. The nature of the object of the passion (a relic, a part of a sentence, an indication, the track of an object or any other subject) changes nothing to the structure of the speech of passion.",

This poem occurs in Kālidāsa’s dramatic work The Recollection of Śakuntalā. Indian poets and critics have cited it for centuries, using it to get to the heart of rasa. In the play, a young warlord on a hunting expedition encounters a girl, Śakuntalā, who has been raised in a cloistered forest ashram by her mendicant father. Prince and girl fall for each other and consummate their love in a wooded glade. By India’s old conventions, this is a “gandharva wedding”—a ceremony sanctified by the gandharvas, celestial musicians who watch over human love. The young couple strolls through the woods after their lovemaking and literally trip across a severe recluse, disrupting his meditation. In a fit of rage, the powerful yogin hurls a curse: when the prince returns home, no matter his vows, all memory of Śakuntalā will be obliterated. In a subsequent scene, the warlord is back in his life of wealth and rank when he hears a strain of music drift through the palace. A former lover of his plays on a musical instrument in her far-off quarters, the song a subtle reproach for his neglect of her. His heart, unexpectedly pierced, becomes paryutsuka, troubled, full of longing, brimming with uncertain desire and regret. The audience knows that a trace of Śakuntalā, some thin strand of passion, runs through his body, too buried by the curse to rise into consciousness. It is at this moment in the play—most likely accompanied by ceremonial dance—he recites, ramyāṇi vīkṣya … For poets, the stanza is the perfect isolation of rasa, bedrock emotional territory that underlies our surface passions. The purpose of poetry is to access that subconscious material, to provide a “taste” of the underlying white-hot encounter with what’s real. To the philosopher this taste is a “foretaste” of spiritual liberation. Most Indian accounts of the origins or the purpose of art have proceeded from the concept of rasa, ever since the Kashmiri poet-philosopher Abhinavagupta set down its metaphysical basis in the tenth- or eleventh-century treatise Abhinavabhāratī. The eight (or at times nine or ten) rasas are the names of emotional states: erotic love, humor, [End Page 43] grief, rage, revulsion, horror, heroism, and wonder. Laid out in a visual psychology, each has a color, a direction, a deity, a time of day or year, and many other associations. Originally meaning juice, sap, semen, rasa came to mean the essence or life-juice of anything, its “taste.” René Daumal translated rasa as saveur. The questions raised by this poem edge into psychoanalysis, evolutionary biology, and ecology. What is the wild unnamed edginess a person approaches in art? Why should things of beauty provoke desire instead of allay it? How far does memory reach, and through it do we actually touch other persons? How is art able to make us feel as though we’ve brushed against former life memories? The poem uses technical terms hard to match closely in English. Ramyāṇi are things that are gorgeous because they provoke bodily desire, from the verbal root ram, to make love. The bhāva-sthirāṇi are deep-seated personal emotions—almost “complexes”—at the core of the individual...",

Biblical and rabbinic texts reveal that the essential consideration in assessing a person’s humility is not that person’s relative assertiveness or timidity but rather with how much he or she subjugates personal self-interest to higher purposes. As articulated within the Jewish tradition of self-development called Mussar, humility inheres in directing one’s will toward sensitive service of the needs and wants of others within one’s social sphere as well as in line with one’s allegiance to the divine. Virtuous humility expresses itself in everyday contexts in the measure of the “space” (be that in the physical, emotional, verbal, financial, or another realm) that a person occupies. The ideal is to take up just as much space as is necessary to fulfill one’s mission of service in his or her life, neither more nor less. Moses fits (as well as defines) this paradigm.",

But since some face-to-face groups are not primary groups (e.g., formal institutions) and since some primary groups are not face-to-face (e.g., a widely scattered kinship group), the spatial contiguity is not essential. Temporal priority is not essential, since many primary groups are formed by adults. These are accidents, the essence of the primary group being the relation which corresponds to ideas, images, and feelings of a specific and easily identified character. A family is a primary group only if these relations exist. Discipline in school and home may follow institutional forms or primary group patterns, but the family is not a primary group merely because of a common dwelling. The essence of the primary group is its functional and emotional character. Temporal priority and spatial contiguity are accidents.",

      "title": "Self-alienation through the loss of heteronomy: the case of bereavement",
      "abstract": "Losing an intimate other to death belongs to the most uprooting experiences in human life. Not only is it accompanied by a range of negative emotions such as sorrow, longing, anger etc., but profound grief is a limit experience that causes a rupture in the sense of self of the bereaved. This experience is often expressed in identity statements such as ‘I no longer feel like myself’ or ‘I am missing part of myself’. Although such experiences are richly reported in empirical studies on grief and implemented in diagnostic criteria for pathological grief, their experiential meaning is largely left unexplored. In this article, I suggest that being bereaved of an intimate other is self-alienating because our sense of self is a distributed phenomenon relying on daily confirmation through interaction with our habitual environment. When our lives are intertwined with intimate others, this habitual identity become a dyadic structure, relying on a heteronomy. Being bereaved of this intimate other leads to a profound impoverishment of the habituated sense of self, leading to self-alienation. Finally, I discuss the process of returning to a non-alienating state and suggest that this is not exclusively a cognitive process, but equally an embodied process of appropriating a habitual identity.",

Reciprocity is a human inclination towards mutual assistance and manifests itself in people's willingness to act together to secure their mutual benefit. Two key features of philanthropic activity are often mentioned: Philanthropy is said to involve behaviour that is in some sense, often left rather vague, benevolent or altruistic, involving one-way transfers or gifts of money from donors to recipients; Such disinterested behaviour is often said to involve the donors of largesse identifying with others and thereby forging a sense of their own identity. If it is true that certain human capabilities most notably the capacity for reciprocity and mutual assistance are central both to commerce and philanthropy, then those capabilities are likely to give rise to behaviour.",

Others might focus on physical health, conjecture on the achievement of personal goals or conceive of well-being by negation: as the absence of illness, negative emotions or worries. Yet, this would be all but a complete picture. It is in fact possible to think of well-being as a far more complex phenomenon: something other than comforting and fleeting emotions, and different from mere individual feelings of joy or vitality. Well-being may be considered first and foremost as a social issue, pertaining to the composition of conflicting values and the fulfilment of collective needs. All the more so, against the background of global phenomena such as climate change and economic inequality, well-being cannot be reduced to a patchwork of good emotions or to the absence of disease or social unrest. The interconnected and quick transformation of contemporaneity calls for a trans-individual and multidimensional understanding of the concept: encompassing the fields of physical, mental, and social health.",

      "title": "Discussion: The Values of Life",
      "abstract": "In Life's Dominion, Dworkin aims at defusing the controversy about abortion and euthanasia by redefining its terms. Basically, it is not a dispute about the right to life, but about its value. Liberals should grant that human life has not only a personal, but also an intrinsic value; conservatives should accept the principle of toleration, which requires to let people decide for themselves about matters of intrinsic value. Dworkin fails, however, to distinguish between two kinds of personal value: (1) the value of something to a person, when he actually or dispositionally desires it, or finds it pleasant; and (2) the value of something to a person, when it 'objectively' contributes to his well-being, as defined by reference to his personal point of view, whether or not he ever perceives it as so contributing. He also fails to distinguish between two meanings of the concept of 'intrinsic value': (3) ultimate, i.e., non-instrumental personal value of kind (2); (4) the impersonal value of something which is not good-for-anybody, but simply good, i.e., not a constituent of someone's well-being. Dworkin argues that the human fetus from conception onwards has a value, that it is not a personal value of kind (1), and, therefore, must be an intrinsic value. But the value of the life of the fetus is not a personal value of kind (2) either and, therefore, not an intrinsic value of kind (3): it is normally a constituent of the well-being of the pregnant woman, but that doesn't constitute its value, and it is not good 'for' the fetus itself in the relevant sense, because it doesn't have a personal point of view. If, however, the fetus' life is allowed to have an intrinsic value of kind (4), the conservative cannot be refuted by appeal to the principle of toleration, for this only concerns intrinsic value of kind (3). The liberal, indeed, should recognize that the fetus' life has a value, but it is neither a personal value (1) or (2), nor an impersonal value (4), but rather a relational value which gradually develops from some point substantially later than conception.",

      "title": "Seven Modalities of Silence",
      "abstract": "Abstract Silence is analysed in seven concealed modalities: the unthinkable, the unspeakable/unsayable, the ineffable, the inarticulable, the unnoticeable, the unknowable, and the unconceptualizable. The unthinkable mainly refers to unacceptable or highly unlikely occurences. The unspeakable is considered too repulsive or outrageous to voice. It both overlaps with and differs from the unsayable inasmuch as the latter can signify something that cannot be said because there is no possibility of either saying or naming it. The ineffable often relates to sacred or divine qualities, or approached through Derrida’s notion of différance. The inarticulable can follow from a deficiency of linguistic expression or be identified in psychoanalysis as repression, blockage, or trauma. The first four modalities concern the ways in which silence intervenes in and manages human expressiveness. The sixth and seventh relate to silences at the very limits of epistemological or ontological reach. The unknowable pertains to a fundamental lack of information, while the unconceptualizable refers to the unavailability of an intellectual and cultural apparatus through which certain kinds of knowledge can be processed. The fifth—the unnoticeable—is an outlier both to the first four and to the last two. It shares with the former the presence of epistemological constraints on conveying knowledge. It shares with the latter the presence of circumstances that sever the accessibility of human agency to evidence or knowledge. They are reflected in Bourdieu’s phrase ‘it goes without saying because it comes without saying’.",

      "abstract": "That the schizophrenic is \"out of contact with reality,\" and hence impervious to it, has been recognized from the time that the term \"schizophreniz\" was coined. That the members of the schizophrenic's family are also \"impervious\" (Lidz et al., 1958), and hence also \"out of contact with reality,\" has only comparatively recently been recognized (Bateson et al., 1956; Wynne et al., 1958; Laing and Esterson, 1964). Imperviousness is here defined as an individual's inability (or unwillingness) to consciously grasp. become aware of, register, and acknowledge another person's interpersonal perception despite the fact that this perception has been clearly stated or presented to him.-1 This paper will focus on the levels of imperviousness that are characteristically established within the parent-child sub-system in the schizophrenix's family. This is not meant to deny the presence of imperviousness in the other subsystems within the family - i.e., between husband and wife or between the children themselves - for they, too, exist and are significant. However, to simplify matters, only imperviousness in the parent-child sub-system will be focused on here.",

Research observation of people with dementia is that they have \"a rigid set of social standards\" or are not wanting to be touched.

If we had more of that culture, we would not be so fearful of what we don't understand or call less than human someone who is self-evidently one of us.

What enables this thought to latch onto that particular object? It cannot be how the Ferrari looks, for this could not distinguish one Ferrari from another just like it. In general, how a thought represents something cannot determine which thing it represents. What a singular thought latches onto seems to depend also on features of the context in which the thought occurs. This suggests that its content is essentially indexical, contextually variable much as the content of an utterance such as ‘I am hungry’ depends on who utters it and when. The indexical model of singular thought is not limited to thoughts about individuals one perceives, but applies also to thoughts about individuals one remembers or has been informed of, such as an old bicycle or Christopher Columbus. In each case, a certain contextual relation, based on perception, memory or communication, connects thought to object.",

      "title": "DIRECTED ACTION AND ANIMAL COMMUNICATION",
      "abstract": "Abstract Human action theory, with its emphasis on intentions and reasons, does little to enhance our understanding of the actions of nonhuman animals. Many animal (and human) actions are directed to objects in the world, including other animals. The notion of directedness can be analysed without attributing intentions or reasons to the agent. An action is directed to object X if and only if: (1) the agent singles out X, either by orientation or by selective performance of the action in the presence of X; (2) the agent recognizes X as a suitable object; and (3) the goal of the action is that X should be in a certain relation to the agent or to some other object. The goal of an action is not necessarily attributable to the agent as the agent's goal in acting. Moreover, an agent can have a goal in acting without understanding how the action achieves the goal. The usefulness of the concept of directed action in the study of animal communication is illustrated with examples from the recent ethological literature.",

This is different from the popular view which regards happiness as the achievement of wealth, reputation, fame, or honour. From a Daoist perspective, being connected with one's innate nature paves the way to developing one's potentiality and creativity fully, and thus to reaching an ideal, or even unexpected, perfect outcome in an effortless and spontaneous manner. In Daoist religion, happiness can be achieved through an inward-seeking experience of oneness or unity between oneself and the source of the universe, e.g. the Dao, through cultivation-orientated meditation. In contrast with Confucianism, which emphasises the importance of collective happiness above that of the individual, Daoism focuses on individual happiness and wellbeing. Yet, Daoism still suggests that wellbeing requires an individual not only to take care of their own health and personal cultivation, but that this is a prerequisite for having a good relationship with others in society.",

What I know about the contents of my own mind I generally know without investigation or appeal to evidence. There are exceptions, but the primacy of unmediated self-knowledge is attested by the fact that we distrust the exceptions until they can be reconciled with the unmediated. My knowledge of the world outside of myself, on the other hand, depends on the functioning of my sense organs, and this causal dependence on the senses makes my beliefs about the world of nature open to a sort of uncertainty that arises only rarely in the case of beliefs about my own states of mind. Many of my simple perceptions of what is going on in the world are not based on further evidence; my perceptual beliefs are simply caused directly by the events and objects around me. But my knowledge of the propositional contents of other minds is never immediate in this sense; I would have no access to what others think and value if I could not note their behaviour.",

      "abstract": "The Igbo term for a good person is ezigbo mmadu. It is a term that is descriptive of good character or positive moral conduct in a person or group of persons. Among the Igbo, a person is designated as ezigbo mmadu, who possesses good conduct or moral fibre – qualities that are worthy of emulation by others. But ezigbo mmadu is not merely  descriptive of a person‟s character or conduct; it is also expressive of a person who is equable, unflappable, even-tempered and level-headed. Ezigbo mmadu has as its converse, the phrase ajo mmadu. Ajo mmadu is a term used to describe a bad man or woman, where the word ajo means „bad‟, that is, the opposite of „good‟. A person is ajo mmadu who is flawed or defective in character. With particular focus on ezigbo mmadu, the Igbo identify some special qualities of life a person must possess before he or she can be so described. In the pre-colonial setting, for example, apart from the possession of good moral conduct, a person was considered ezigbo mmadu who respected the customary laws of community and was loyal to the preternatural forces that ruled in the cosmic order. In this paper, however, it is discovered that the challenges of modernity and the harsh social environment in which the modern Igbo have found themselves seem to greatly tint their conceptualisation of who an ezigbo mmadu is. The paper does not only identify reasons for the devaluation of this once venerated concept or positive social attribute; it also proffers possible remedies to overcoming this social dilemma.",

      "title": "Varieties of disgust in self-harm",
      "abstract": "This chapter explores how self-disgust may manifest as part of the experience of self-harm. In its primary form, disgust implies a set of behavioural and physiological rejection responses against contamination or incorporation of contaminant material. It involves a sudden arousal of feelings, physiological changes, and action impulses that aim to prevent the threatening object from crossing the body boundary or from spreading within it. People who self-harm are, prior to the act, either in a state of high arousal, in which overwhelming anger, anxiety, or a mixture of unidentifiable emotions is typically experienced, or they are depersonalised. Feeling out of control involves an experience of a lack of autonomy and agency over one's internal states. The self-harm act \"catches\" emotions that were previously felt to be \"untameable\" and amorphous; the wound, scar, and/or blood become a representation of the experience that can be attended to, contemplated, and something that the individual can act upon.",

      "abstract": "We live in the world where the existence of only one reality is not disputable for everybody. The name of it is an everyday life absorbing practically entirely the Absolutes of distant cultures. But it is also wrong to think that nature/ the Universe, God and society vanished from sight of the present-day human being. It is undoubtedly wrong to think so. The thing is that all these things God and world and the other are given in the light of daily routine. The world of everyday life may be characterized by such a feature as concreteness. «Concretus» in Latin means «adnateness». Now we also have a reduction of human being to the world of everyday life as the result of realization values of the Renaissance and the Age of the Enlightenment intention deliverancing everybody and everything (secularization, subjectivation and such other processes). Opposing and struggling with transcendental human being created its` own postworld. A person of everyday life may/ commonplace person is accustomed to rut, comfort and stability. He prefers to dream about a reality, about his personality to be a real personality or a real Human being. Nevertheless a present-day person has a little thirst for transcendence. In the situation of fulminant going out of date some models of things it is become clear, that a human being is aimed at a consumption not only use value, but something other it (meta-). It means that he buys not only goods, but his own status, (public) image, success, wealth, fortune, and not only… On our opinion nowadays person together with goods tries to buy transcendental, to buy metaphysics proper. Reconstruction of everyday life senses goes to transcendence of emerging opportunity for the: a) transfiguration of reality (Palamism) in which Jesus Christ has come and has become the ever-present: b) «the world shining with sense» (A. Schutz); c) «the world where everything is becoming» (I. Prigogine) Transcendence has some own risks. For example, everything may close up on human being or it may dissolve into unconsciousness. This also may follows to social reality worship (stability as cult). It is also possible the way of dissolving in trans-cendent, which follows to mystical turn. All existence under the significance sign is very problematic, opened and accountable, complicity and eventful.

      "abstract": "Abstract Our universe is populated, at bottom, by a vast number of partless particulars of a few basic kinds. Each of these particulars instantiates some of a small range of primitive qualities and stands in primitive relations with other particulars. We may conceive of qualities as immanent universals that are numerically identical in their instances, along the lines championed by David Armstrong (1978), or as ‘tropes’ that are non-identical but exactly resembling in their instances, following C. B. Martin (1997). (Nothing of what follows hangs on which alternative one prefers.) In calling these qualities ‘primitive’, we are contending that they are real existents whose being does not consist, even in part, in the existence or instantiation of other entities. The nature of these qualities is irreducibly dispositional: they are tendencies to interact with other qualities in producing some effect, or some range of possible effects. (Or, in certain cases— as we shall consider below— they may instead confer upon their possessor a tendency towards, or power to produce, some such effects.) It may be that the dispositional profile of a quality does not exhaust its nature, so that it has a further ‘qualitative character’, or quiddity. Here again, we may be neutral on this question for present purposes.",

      "abstract": "Voluntary service refers to the social public welfare in which human kinds take part in social activities, facilitate social progress and push forward human development of their own free will for no material or any spiritual rewards. Yet, volunteer spirit refers to a sort of altruistic and voluntary attitude or concept for public welfare but not for any reward. This sort of concept has something different in approach but equally satisfactory in results with the thought of “universal love” by Mo-tse. The thought of “universal love” by Mo-tse is a kind of thought that is altruistic, mutual love and mutual benefit, which comes down in one continuous line with the thought of “universal love” by Mo-tse. Of course, connotation of the volunteer spirit we are going to mention can no longer be contained by the thought of “universal love”. To a certain extent, these two have something in common.Based on love for the entire human kind, Mo-tse advocated that the universal love could transfer people’s self-interest, that human kind expanded their love of themselves to love of others, extended their care of the land of the living to each class and hierarchy under obedience to the “will of the heaven”, and gradually re-established the social order that had gradually lost its order. He expected to change the atmosphere at that time in which people struggled with and invaded each other through promotion of the thought of “universal love”. Mo-tse invented the theory of “universal love”, and resorted to the target of “mutual love and mutual benefit” to convince the king at ancient times to play their role of “where the wind passes, the grass bends”, so as to direct people in making contributions and showing fraternal love and mutual benefit and reciprocity. Therefore, his concentrated attention and efforts were clearly known. Through our analysis of the thought of “universal love” and explanation of the volunteer spirit, we can find out the similarities and differences lying between the two, which helps us to better understand the connotation volunteer spirit and explore, therefrom, the ideological succession relationship of traditional Chinese moral culture implied.",

Children in their development become a person proper when they begin to construe themselves as an entity that not only is public in relation to others, who is entrusted with the capacity to judge and evaluate, but also accountable, entrusting others to judge and evaluate the self. The explicit sense of what’s right or wrong, acceptable or not acceptable—hence, what we typically understand by morality—is rooted in self-consciousness as described here. Of importance is the fact that at one point in our development we begin to construe ourselves as characters perceived and evaluated by others. These characters are embodied in our actions and acted out in dispositions, beliefs, and thoughts. We become persons and, ultimately, moral persons. This development is the necessary prerequisite for the corollary development of lying and deception.",

The present paper argues that it is valuable for your conduct in such circumstances to be regulated by a character trait the possession of which constitutes one way of having one’s life be centered upon others as opposed to centered upon oneself. The trait in question, which we shall call “others-centeredness,” is a disposition to promote goods of others rather than one’s own goods when the values of these goods are equal or incommensurable. We argue that possessing this trait makes one more likely to maximize total value, because in addition to promoting the goods of the other, this trait also promotes goods of interpersonal union. We explain why this conclusion is significant, and we defend our argument for it against several objections.",

      "title": "Laboratory Methods for Assessing Experts' and Novices' Knowledge",
      "abstract": "Expertise, by definition, refers to the manifestation of skills and understanding resulting from the accumulation of a large body of knowledge. This implies that in order to understand how experts perform and why they are more capable than non-experts, we must understand the representation of their knowledge, that is, how their knowledge is organized or structured, and how their representations might differ from those of novices. For example, if a child who is fascinated with dinosaurs and has learned a lot about them correctly infers attributes about some dinosaurs that was new to them by reasoning analogically to some known dinosaurs (e.g., the shape of teeth for carnivores versus vegetarians), we would not conclude that the \"expert\" child has a more powerful analogical reasoning strategy. Instead, we would conclude that such a global or domain-general reasoning strategy is available to all children, but that novice children might reason analogically to some other familiar domain, such as animals (rather than dinosaurs), as our data have shown (Chi, Hutchinson, & Robin, 1989). Thus, the analogies of domain-novice are less powerful not necessarily because they lack adequate analogical reasoning strategies, although they may, but because they lack the appropriate domain knowledge from which analogies can be drawn. Thus, in this framework, a critical locus of proficiency lies in the representation of their domain knowledge.",

      "title": "Case Studies in Interdisciplinary Research",
      "abstract": "Humans are capable of understanding an incredible variety of actions performed by other humans. Even though these range from primary biological actions like eating and fleeing, to acts in parliament or in poetry, humans generally can make sense of each other’s actions. Understanding other people’s action, called can transcend differences in race, gender, culture, age, and social and historical circumstances. Action understanding is the cognitive capability of making sense of another person’s action by integrating perceptual information about the behavior with knowledge about the immediate and socio-cultural contexts of the action and with one’s own experience. Since it is necessary to integrate multiple sources of information, it is not surprising that failures to understand a person’s behavior are also common. Well known is the case of an autistic professor who compares herself to an anthropologist from Mars. Incapable of spontaneously understanding why someone cries, she has learned rules that help her to infer that people who rub their eyes while tears are running down their cheeks are weeping and probably feel unhappy (Sacks, 1995). By contrast, normal individuals automatically allow stereotypes, prejudices, self-interests and the like to influence their understanding a person’s behavior (Bargh & Chartrand, 1999). More generally still, humans can easily misunderstand unfamiliar symbolic actions or rituals if they rely too much on their own socio-cultural expertise (Gadamer, 2004). Given the importance of action understanding in every domain of human life and society, and in light of the complexities that surround it, a comprehensive scientific understanding of this capacity is needed. Apart from satisfying intellectual curiosity, such insight would serve to improve our action understanding and mitigate several forms of misunderstanding. Indeed, in studying action understanding, we as scientists are engaged in the very process that is central to our concerns (Gergen & Semin, 1990, p. 1). Scholars are increasingly dissatisfied with mono-disciplinary approaches to understanding human action. Such one-sidedness can rest upon various motives. For example, hermeneutic interpretations of action understanding tend to emphasize historical and cultural influences while overlooking that ultimately such influences depend upon individual cognitive processes.1 This has led to a critique of the assumption that humans are born as a blank slate and that culture is solely responsible for all cognitive contents. However, such critique easily slides into an overemphasis on the biology of human nature and a denial of socio-cultural influences on cognition (Pinker, 2003). Fortunately, recent interdisciplinary endeavors have shown that an interdisciplinary approach is preferable when investigating complex functions like action understanding. Such research often involves developing a new interdiscipline such as cultural psychology (Bruner, 1990) or combining insights from the social sciences and psychology (Shore, 1996; Sperber, 1996). Evidence shows that throughout human evolution there have been mutual influences between biological and cognitive processes that shape human capacities and socio-cultural influences on those processes (Bogdan, 2003; Donald, 1991; Tomasello, 1999). In addition to these interdisciplinary investigations, computational sciences and artificial intelligence research are developing computer models of human understanding that allow new types of experiments and simulations (Churchland, 1995). Such insights underscore the necessity and fruitfulness of disciplinary boundary crossing and require that various disciplinary methods, concepts and theories be combined in innovative ways.",

It is a tendency against which, in the interests of true psychology, a timely protest may well be made; for its interests cannot in the end be served by pretensions to a knowledge which it is far from possessing and by unwarrantable claims to authority based upon such pretensions. If all criminals are, as the theory postulates, of defective or diseased mental organization, we must needs go on to acknowledge that few, if any, persons are well formed or sound mentally. Every Christian who listens reverently to the reading of the Ten Commandments and prays devoutly that God will incline his heart to keep them, feels, or ought to feel if he be in earnest, that he has in him the potentiality of committing every crime or sin forbidden by them. That he does not commit a particular crime which another person does is not owing always to a stronger and better nature in him, nor to an opportune infusion of prevenient grace, but to the absence of the adequate temptation in the circumstances of his life and calling. Time and the occasion count for much in the production of crime, as in the production of other human events; and it is quite possible that behind the crime of one who succumbs to an overwhelming temptation there may sometimes lie more merit than in the open virtue of another who has never been greatly tempted.",

I then argue that a recent view on which it can be fitting to be grateful to nature faces counterexamples. Finally, I argue that it cannot be fitting to be grateful to nature, because it is fitting to be grateful to someone/something only if they manifest the right kind of goodwill or care toward one. In particular, I argue that it is fitting to be grateful to someone/something only if they manifest a level of final care toward one beyond what can be legitimately expected or demanded of them. However, because nature does not manifest any level of goodwill or care, it cannot be fitting to be grateful to nature. I end by noting that it can still be fitting to be grateful that certain things are true about nature (e.g. that it provides many benefits to humans).",

Velika večina – in ti so daleč najrazumnejši – pa ne verjame ničesar od tega, ampak časti neko edino božanstvo, ki je nepoznano, večno, neizmerno, nepojmljivo in zunaj dosega človeškega razuma ter se ne v fizičnem, pač pa v duhovnem smislu razteza po vsem vesolju. Imenujejo ga Oče. Le njemu pripisujejo nastanek, razvoj, napredek, spreminjanje in konec vsega. Božanskih časti tako ne posvečajo nobenemu drugemu božanstvu.",

      "title": "The voluntary operant and the operant nature of volition: Three views",
      "abstract": "Many philosophers, psychologists, and lay folk associate volition with autonomy (actions are independent of an individual's environment) and free will (individuals originate their actions). Most behaviorists hold these views to be incompatible with behavior analyses. The present paper describes volition as interpreted by B. F. Skinner, Howard Rachlin, and Allen Neuringer. Skinner relates volition to positively reinforced operant behavior. That works because, like operants, voluntary actions are free, in the sense of not physically constrained; they affect their environments, often resulting in positive outcomes, and are sometimes unpredictable. Rachlin, while incorporating Skinnerian methods, interprets volition within his own Teleological Behaviorism framework. For Rachlin, reinforcement of an individual response is often incompatible with voluntary control, thereby disagreeing with Skinner. Responses are voluntary only when they are members of extended response patterns. Neuringer also begins with Skinner's operants, but argues that, under the control of reinforcing consequences, both voluntary actions and operant responses are sometimes predictable and other times \"truly\" unpredictable. Neuringer does not assume that environments determine voluntary actions, thereby disagreeing with Skinner and Rachlin. Taken together, the agreements and disagreements among these three behaviorists may help to shed light on the relationship between operants and volition.",

      "abstract": "Encounter a stranger in need and, sometimes, you will feel empathic concern—an other-oriented emotional response evoked by and congruent with the perceived welfare of that person. What determines whether you will? Perhaps the most common answer among psychologists is that empathic concern is felt when you adopt the perspective of the person in need (see Batson, 1987; Davis, 1994; Stotland, 1969). But in this answer, what is meant by adopting the person's perspective? First, it is an act of imagination. One does not literally take another person's place or look through his or her eyes. One imagines how things look from the other's point of view. Second, it is not the same as perspective taking in the symbolic-interaction tradition (e.g., Mead, 1934). In that tradition, one adopts the perspective of another—often a significant other—to imaginatively see oneself through the other's eyes (and values). The perspective taking that evokes empathic concern involves imaginatively perceiving the other's situation, not oneself.",

Of course, I know that a relationship can be healing, and I also know that every psychopathology has been created by relationship. So, step by step, I try to explore some components of the therapeutic relationship, which could narrow our focus and contribute to unfolding and understanding what happens in this specific face to face encounter. Intimate is an interesting concept because it belongs to both the innermost and a special kind of close way of being together. Perhaps, encounter might be considered as an extension of our paradigm of contact, when contact rises and grows between two people. Love is often referred to, in our therapeutic context. Is it an appropriate reference? What about tenderness, which seems to designate better a therapeutic attitude that does not exclude confrontation or distance. A few tracks that need to be pursued.",

Part 2 of this book describes the good goals that God might be seeking to produce in his Universe—beauty; creatures having knowledge (in a largely internalist sense), having their good desires satisfied, with a free will to do actions that promote each others’ well‐being, being of use to others, and worshipping God. Part 3 shows how the possibility of moral evil, and the actual occurrence of natural evil (providing knowledge of possible good and bad actions, and the scope for good response) are necessary to secure these ends. God has the right to allow some creatures to suffer for the benefit of others, so long as he compensates them in this life or after death. The expected value of allowing the evils in order to achieve the good goals is positive.",

      "abstract": "Abstract A Large Group Within the category I have called the bit players is comprised of personal attendants: the servants, stewards, armor-bearers or “lads” of kings, prophets and other dignitaries. Like the briefly mentioned and unnamed mothers, husbands, and children, they are given scant narrative attention. What distinguishes personal attendants from unnamed family members, though, is the nature of the designated role itself. The servant participates in a hierarchical relationship in which he or she is the subordinate party. Because the task of the servant is to serve, the servant’s activity draws attention to the needs and desires of the one being served. In this way, servants identify the one they serve as a person of wealth and power. The nature of the servant role itself therefore adds another layer to the veil over the personal identity of these sketchy characters. Personal attendants are formally identified in a variety of ways. A youth (illl, o1illl) is not necessarily a personal attendant except when defined as such by the possessive form, such as “his young man” (iilll; 1 Sam 9:5, “the boy who was with him”), or the narrative context, as in 1 Sam 20:21, in which Jonathan tells David that he will send “the boy” (,i,m) to tell him whether he should flee from Saul. The designations servant (,:ii,) and youth (illl) can denote either a slave or servant.1 Most narratives featuring slaves/servants do not address their legal status.",

This could be shown e.g. in view of job-stressors and their consequences for cardio-vascular disease. As important the single risk factor may be, as limited is their impact when we look at the amount of explained variance, mostly only around 10%. On the other hand each examined population includes a larger amount of individuals who will not fall ill in spite of identical stressors as those getting sick. This ability to resist, based on special interior and exterior resources, is now called salutogenesis. It stands opposite to the term pathogenesis. More recent research in that area examines favourable exterior resources such as structures in \"social support\", favourable conditions at the work-place, in the family and so on. Other more personality oriented abilities include optimism, hardiness, etc. The founder of the theory on salutogenesis, Aaron Antonovsky, describes a concept of \"sense of coherence\" including (1.) comprehensibility, (2.) manageability, (3.) meaningfulness. More recent therapeutic concepts are based on these assumptions and have proved to be successful.",

The havoc created by disruptive autonomy pampers the psyche paving the way for ignominy which shuts the doors against enlightenment. The detachment from  pre-ritualand less potent convictions of the new rites, the individual  yet to hold, thrusts him in a valley of confusion where the sanity is confiscated by  the demands posed by the challenging rituals of both the states.During liminal periods of all kinds, social hierarchies may be reversed or temporarily dissolved, continuity of tradition may become uncertain, and future outcomes once taken for granted may be thrown into doubt(Thomassen1) . The threats of liminality are open in any society the reasons vary depending on the situations prevailing, but the menace is more open for in a small – scale societies (Arnold van Gennep2). The reasons are often commanded by the  institutions that decide the fate of the individual and pronounce the verdict  as they do lie within its jurisdiction. The male protagonists of  Hawthorne’s short stories are thrust into  liminal sphere owing to their tussle  with the dreamlike state and the reality, ultimately crowning  them as the sovereigns of unpredictability and irrationality.

Most frequently, the term refers to Sexual abstinence or abstention from alcohol or food. The practice can arise from religious prohibitions or practical considerations. Abstinence has diverse forms. Commonly it refers to a temporary or partial abstinence from food, as in fasting. Because the regimen is intended to be a conscious act, freely chosen to enhance life, abstinence is sometimes distinguished from the psychological mechanism of repression. The latter is an unconscious state, having unhealthy consequences. Freud termed the channeling of sexual energies into other more culturally or socially acceptable activities through “sublimation”. Abstinence may also arise from an ascetic element, present in most faiths, or from a subjective need for spiritual discipline. In its religious context, abstinence is meant to elevate the believer beyond the normal life",

      "abstract": "For many people, the phenomenon of divine hiddenness is so total that it is far from clear to them that God (roughly speaking, the God of Jewish and Christian tradition) exists at all. Reasonably enough, they therefore do not believe that God exists. Yet it is possible, whilst lacking belief in God’s reality, nonetheless to see it as a possibility that is both realistic and attractive; and in this situation, one will likely want to be open to the considerable benefits that would be available if God were real. In this paper I argue that certain kinds of desire for God can aid this non-believing openness. It is possible to desire God even in a state of non-belief, since desire does not require belief that its object exists. I argue that if we desire God in some particular capacity, and with some sense of what would constitute satisfaction, then through the desire we have knowledge – incomplete yet vivid in its personal significance – about the attributes God would need in order to satisfy us; thus, if God is real and does have those attributes, one knows something about God through desiring him. Because desire does not require belief, neither does the knowledge in question. Expanding on recent work by Vadas and Wynn, I sketch the epistemology of desire needed to support this argument. I then apply this epistemology to desire for God. An important question is how one might cultivate the requisite kinds desire for God; and one way, I argue, is through engaging with certain kinds of sacred music. I illustrate desire’s religiously epistemic power in this context, before replying to two objections.",

The first cause has not left man to develop the mere scope of his natural ability, great as that is. God has freely bestowed on him, as an overflow of his goodness, supernatural powers of knowledge and love which leave the natural pattern of human nature unimpaired, but make possible the attainment of a higher kind of perfection and a much greater happiness, consisting in consciously being so like God that man can have the same divine object of his thought and love that is proper to the life of God himself. Whether we think of man, then, as coming from God's creative hand, or as in process of conscious return to him, in either case we see ourselves as conditioned by that relationship, that company, the society of God. It is interesting to notice how very close the Church and the world are in the subject-matter of their chief preoccupation nowadays. Secular thought is concerned as never before with man’s relation to human society, and the Church is particularly concerned to elaborate man’s place in a divine society too.

      "title": "Sreya dan Preya Dalam Persfektif Teologi Hindu",
      "abstract": "Life presents a variety of choices. Humans choose it according to tendentiousness and goals to be achieved. Happiness is the ultimate goal that each individual wants to achieve. Efforts are made to gain happiness, recognition and respect from others. In Hindu theology, happiness is divided into two types, namely sreya and preya. Preya means fun, one that immediately catches attention. Whereas sreya means that which gives true welfare, which is truly beneficial. Sreya and Preya have the same object, namely happiness, but get different outcomes. Preya is in shackles whereas sreya frees. Preya is actually another name for maya. Preya is very seductive, alluring and addicting to the senses. Humans work hard and invest their time to achieve sreya, but those who are less introspective think of preya as sreya. This error stems from a desire for quick results, a lack of understanding and an unwillingness to follow a long process.",

      "title": "MAN, A QUESTIONING BEING",
      "abstract": "It is a questioning being that faces the world when man looks at things, turns to his fellow men, reflects upon himself. Whether he asks for counsel and information regarding his everyday needs or, far beyond any practical considerations, strives for insight, whether his concern is with the first or the last questions, he does only what he cannot leave undone. He can inquire into things ; he can question himself ; he can direct his questions to others or be interrogated by them ; he can run away from perplexing situations or turn his inquisitiveness to the uncovering of problems. In so doing, he only demonstrates and fulfills a basic mode of human existence. When he attempts to evade painful questions, to withdraw from « re-sponsibility », questions follow and pursue him even into sleep. They emerge from his past ; they threaten him from the future ; they haunt him in the present. Questions themselves never disappear, because questioning never ceases. Although particular questions can be transmitted to others and accepted by them as their own, the act of questioning cannot be taught. Nor does it require a teacher. The first question arises early in the life of every healthy child, from the very roots of its existence. We are able to ask single questions because we are questioning beings at our very core. We must therefore distinguish, though not separate, the relationship",

      "title": "Naturalistic Faces and Faces in Paintings: An Overview",
      "abstract": "Faces are the most important social signal in our society. Nevertheless, there is a problem with faces: they are all made up of the same features in the same general order (the eyes are above the nose, which is above the mouth). To process faces one uses a special kind of processing, which is holistic, considering the integration of the face’s features and their relative distances. One may distinguish the recognition of known faces and the processing of unfamiliar faces. Face processing abilities may be lost due to either a lesion or developmental reasons, i.e., prosopagnosia. To further explore these reasons, one could consider pictorial representations of faces—such as faces in paintings. These are particularly interesting because different art styles differ in how realistic/distorted they are relative to real faces, which allows for exploring people’s sensitivity to face-likeness. In a way, individuals are not sensitive to face-likeness. In face matching part–whole tasks, performance does not differ across art styles. Still, individuals are not fully impervious to distortion: early markers of face processing (N170 component) are sensitive to face-likeness, with more realistic (vs. distorted) art styles eliciting responses more in line with those of real faces.",

      "abstract": "The living social reality was for Cooley the society of which he was a part, which he approached by objective introspection. Society is an affair of a consciousness that is necessarily social. The self is not a presupposition of consciousness but arises in communication and is dependent on others who are as immediate as the self. In imagination both self and other have their origin. Public consciousness is the organization of the separate individual experiences. The self is not an immediate character of the mind, for we are not first individual and then social; the mind itself arises through communication. This represents an advance on Baldwin, Tarde, and even James. A self that can reach other selves only through the interpretation of states of consciousness can never be primarily a social self. A difficulty arises when the parallelism of \"ordinary psychology\" is accepted by Cooley. His ethical views ignored primitive impulses and insisted on standards already established. He was not interested in the scientific study of society. But does not the self belong to an objective phase in the tendency to take the role of another? Cooley did not find selves and society arising in primitive processes of communication so that he could grasp their reality in early human behavior. His sociology was in a sense an account of the American community to which he belonged. The gospel of Jesus and democracy were of the essence of it. But if we carry back the social behavior to a point which antedates the psychical as distinct from an outer world, it is to this primitive behavior that one can trace the social patterns that produce society as well as to criticism and reconstruction. To this type of analysis Cooley's assumption closes the door. But Cooley's establishment of the self and others on the same plane of reality and his impressive study of the primary group are positive accomplishments for which we are profoundly indebted.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The Eventive Verbs Of Pie were subdivided into two form/ function categories (albeit all but unmarked by formal differences), namely they were either punctual or durative. (Other terms are encountered for the same concepts.) The distinction hinges on whether the action or event is conceived of as requiring an elapse of time; the membership of a verb in one category or the other is therefore a matter of the meaning of the verb itself: ‘look for’ or ‘travel’ or ‘carve’ are inherently durative; ‘find’ or ‘arrive’ or ‘stab’ are inherently punctual. However, durative events can be conceived of as POINTS in future or past time (Alice traveled in Europe last year, punctual in contradistinction to the durative Alice was traveling in Europe when she met her husband), and punctual notions readily can be used in transferred (figurative) senses which are durative: I’m finding that Howard is possessive is an ordinary kind of sentence, whereas I’m finding a cat under the bed is so odd as to be unprocessable.1",

First, close relationships and caring are reasonably considered part of a well-lived life, and curiosity is important for caring both about people and about things in the world. Second, curiosity helps us to define an appropriate way for persons to be affected by certain situations. Perhaps most important, curiosity can help one to live well because it addresses the most fundamental existential task humans face, the need to see their lives as meaningful. I argue that curiosity is a distinctive virtue but suggest that related virtues (e.g., receptivity, reverence) may contribute to different kinds of worthy engagement with the world.",

      "abstract": "... The standard of personhood is gaining increased attention and prominence. The essential claim is that only individuals with capacities for significant cerebral functioning possess a morally unique claim to existence. Persons are defined as individuals who are self-aware and capable of self-direction (Engelhardt), able to enter meaningful relationships (McCormick), capable of minimal independent existence (Shelp), and in possession of a minimal 20-40 I.Q. (Joseph Fletcher). These are \"high standard\" personhood positions (those holding higher-brain related criteria). It is a commonplace with most such positions that newborns -- all newborns -- are not, strictly speaking, persons. That is, newborns are not self-aware, intentionally choosing individuals.... The thesis of this essay is that a developing individual's right to life increases as he or she approaches the threshold of personal life. That is, the more a newborn approximates -- or is proximate to -- undisputed personhood (e.g. the status of readers of this essay), the greater his or her claim to life. The two pivotal criteria for determining personhood are the potentiality for and development toward becoming an undisputed personal being. I am presupposing, for purposes of argument, that the handicapped infant would not be an excessive familial burden or an inordinate financial load for society, one an ancient and the other a modern criterion. That condition granted, this essay contends that if an imperiled newborn is reasonably projected to reach at least minimal personal capacity, treatment should be given.",

It is reflected in the physical appearance of vacuity, a drab lack of vitality; it is experienced as not feeling, a lack of object constancy, a not knowing who one is or what one wants. Two case studies are presented: one of Lorretta, who, because of emotionally and physically absent parents, has no sense of entitlement or of self. She can't image what she looks like and is completely puzzled as to how people think or manage their lives. The second case is of Thomas Merton, the Trappist monk, poet, social critic, and hermit. Greatly admired by his parents, he felt from earliest childhood that he was special, with a special destiny awaiting him. His life of silence and poverty presents a special kind of selflessness: a loss of self that is freely chosen in order to more deeply experience himself and God. Healthy and unhealthy understandings of Christianity are examined as aspects of selflessness.",

      "title": "Intra-Trinitarian Love",
      "abstract": "The most powerful speculative argument for a three-consciousness view of the Trinity probably lies in the consideration that ‘God is love’ (1 John, 4, 8). The argument is that if God is essentially loving, then there must be someone for God to love. Richard Swinburne defines love partly as ‘giving to the other what of one's own is good for him’ (Swinburne, 1994, p. 177). God is omniscient and omnipotent, and if God is to give fully what is God's own, then God must create another omniscient, omnipotent being. There is a question about whether an omnipotent being can create another omnipotent being. Obviously not if ‘omnipotence’ means, or entails, that one has complete power over every other being so that one can create or destroy it at will. If God exists necessarily (that is, God exists whatever else may or may not exist and could not possibly fail to exist), then it may seem that no created being exists necessarily, since it could not exist without its creator. It may be, however, that God necessarily creates another being which, given the existence of God, could not fail to exist. That would entail that God could not destroy it. Yet their relation would be asymmetric, because God would be the cause of the created being, and it could not be the cause of God. The created being would be wholly dependent on the creating being, since the creator has given what is ‘its own’ to the created. The created being receives its power and knowledge from the uncreated being and could not ever oppose it or know anything that it did not know. This would not be an instance of mutual causation, so they would not be omnipotent in quite the same sense.",

      "title": "Aesthetic regulation of objectionable representations.: A semiotic approach to memorials and religious architectural space.",
      "abstract": "Whenever a material object is selected to represent a physically absent, but emotionally present referent, such as a religious figure or a deceased relative, we have a complex representation situation that involves what we could tentatively label “transgressive cognitive acts”. A transgressive cognitive act is here meant to involve a part that is experienced as present, and as having an effect, but not evidenced from a rationalist or scientific perspective on existence. Sometimes, the complexity of this type of representation is such that argumentation beside the theological, e.g. aesthetic, comes to stand as vicarious to theological or existential opinions about the matter. The semiotics of such vicarious representation have to consider a “leaking” communication model where one part in the trinity - of the sender, the receiver or the referent - escape a coherent or evidenced definition (God can be all three, depending on type of communication). The fact that empirically non-existing referents have been recognized and theorized in semiotics (Eco; Sonesson; and others) does not explain why certain cases of absent semiotic agents, linked to religious belief, or to sense of presence in grief of a deceased person, may give rise to such extreme degree of emotion or sense of existence.Departing from a narrated episode written by J M Coetzee, about the controversy brought up by a crucifix, turning into a quarrel about aesthetic preferences, this paper discusses a series of designed or spontaneously created spatial representations of physically absent, but indirectly and emotionally present referents, as they appear in memorials, cemeteries and funeral chapels. In public acts of memorialisation, the physical objects that represent the deceased – like gravestones or memorial objects placed at sites representing the dead – are often strictly regulated, differently in different cultures. When for instance they appear at unexpected places in the urban environment, or with unfamiliar looks, memorials and their material culture can become highly controversial or be regarded as objectionable.These materialisations with a relation to religion, or existential belief, may give rise to arguments where the aesthetic aspect is the last chance to state a principle order in the cultural scheme in which they are debated. Such arguments are actualised in the current debate about post-secular societies, where it is for instance stated (Habermas) that both religious and secular mentalities must be open to a complementary learning if we are to balance shared citizenship and cultural difference in the post-secular society. It is an objective of this paper to show that the recognition of a semiotics that involves the paradoxical presence of emotionally strong, but fundamentally absent parts in communication can contribute to the aesthetics of physically present, but existentially debated objects, as well as to the discussion about the confronting as well as conjoining elements of regulation of these issues in society.

Reputation is the current standing the person has gained from previous actions or refusal of actions in helping others. Human dignity is the basic element amongst other human rights and thus right to reputation comes under the basic inalienable right to enjoy a decent and dignified life. Defamation laws enables an individual to keep his reputation whenever it is attacked by other person. Defamation occur in two ways, libel or slander, where both are detrimental to a person's reputation.

Nevertheless, the term “autonomy” is not in everyday usage, and, it must be admitted, it is a philosophical term of art. Still, it does not follow that people have no way of talking about autonomy or that they don’t talk about it. Colloquially, the exhortations “Be true to yourself!” and “Don’t cave in!” express the value people place on autonomy, and the declarations “She lives by her own lights,” “Now I know what I really want,” and “I feel solid [right in my skin, at one with myself] about this” voice their achievement of autonomy. Think, too, of the soaring refrain of the Sinatra tune, “I did it my way”—a paean to autonomy. Likewise, there are idiomatic expressions associated with heteronomy. People may bemoan their lack of autonomy—”! feel at sea [adrift],” “I’m at odds with myself,” or “How could I have given in?” And they may stand up for their autonomy and claim it as a right—”Mind your own business!” or “Butt out!” When people feel confused, irresolute, pressured, and so on, they may lament their lack of autonomy or protest incursions on it. When people are clear about what they truly want, who they deeply care about, what they genuinely believe in, and so forth, and when they are able to act on these desires, affections, and values, they may attest to their own autonomy.",

We report that: 1) people often prefer to interact with an entity that they believe is more associated with a negative source rather than an entity that is less associated but has made physical contact with the same negative source; 2) while an associative account requires that contact enhances association, a study of memory for visual pairings of objects indicates that when objects are touching, their associative link (recall) is no greater than when they are in proximity; and 3) subjects continue to show aversion to (prefer to wear gloves to handle) an object that contacted a negative entity even if they are handling the object in order to physically destroy it, hence strongly signaling their rejection of that object. Association and social communication are at best partial accounts for contagion effects.",

It is the good that we give to and choose for the persons we meet. Still, the more genuine our wish is, the more universal the good in question. The will aims at the universal: we desire the good without any restrictions for those we love. Being an intellectual desire, the will must be informed by the intellect. In the maze of life, the intellect distinguishes the outlines of the real good to be given; it liberates. Without it man is abandoned. The true rhythm of our life consists in distinguishing by means of the intellect and putting up by means of the will. The strong and pure will edifies. For the sake of the really human in us, the intellect and will must dominate over the imagination and emotions.\r\n\r\nKeywords: love, liberty, abstraction, nature, ethics.",

      "abstract": "Although this is neither always nor fully appreciated, African in African psychology is best when unexpressed. At its strongest point, like a deeply held belief, African in African psychology is the presumed . A way of seeing. A way grounded in, for instance, the sense of hearing, thus listening and speaking and ultimately language – a key subject in cultural debates on the effects of colonialism on African intellectual thought, but also in African psychology when it comes to the question of whether we can fully understand and heal people's emotional and mental pain if we do not understand the language in which they are most at home. A way grounded in the sense of touch and its situated meanings; taste and its literal and figurative denotations and connotations; and smell and its associations, including the smells of food, in the air, about places, of bodies, smells that attract or repel us just outside of our conscious awareness. This claim is founded on the understanding that there are no value-neutral ways of seeing, feeling or thinking. None is unaffected by power. Certainly, there are no value-barren modes of being, no forms of existence outside the reach of what is desirable, good, right, worthy or valued – and of their opposites. African in African psychology is, therefore, an enunciation. A situated practice. A wordless act involving the whole of your being. It articulates and enacts your position in the world. It is an act that reads, the world looks like this from here . Here , to be clear, is not just a place. Here is more than simply the place where the body stands looking, the eyes in the head that look out. The self itself is here. Here refers to the self that is inside, and extends (from) the body. You say, telling the other over the phone, I am here . What do you mean? Are you only saying that your body is sitting in a chair in a coffee shop, in a town, in a certain country, in the world? Ultimately you want it to be understood that you , all of your self , is here. Here, then, is the self that looks. We look with the whole of our selves.",

      "abstract": "When moving from one place to another, people encounter a variety of things and persons. They encounter physical things, meet other people, and interact with them in a way that might be sensed as ‘divine’. The meanings emerging through human interactions in life appear when there is a presence of other human beings in the surrounding. Humans realise their meaningfulness within themselves when others find the same thing as well, that is, in realising the presence. Life turns into a meaningful experience when human beings treat their neighbours as a human being, and not as an object that does not react or respond when encountered. Regarding the others as a representation of our own relatedness with the divine may enable us respect human life, more than we value ourselves, for we realise that our relationship with fellow human beings is not the same as with objects around us. Our relation with the divine is situated in connectedness with other people so as to experience the beauty in relation. The divine needs humans not because he is weak, but because he has the desire to save and to make human’s life meaningful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;",

      "abstract": "Well-being is the state of being happy, healthy and prosperous. Well-being or welfare is a general term for the condition of an individual or group, for example their social, economic. Psychological, spiritual or medical state: high well being means that, in some sense, the individual’s or group’s experience is positive while low well- being is associated with negative happenings. Well-being is equated with the experience of pleasure and the absence of pain over time. The less psychological pain an individual is experiencing the more he or she is going to expenence well-being. When someone is experiencing positive well-being they are also experiencing a few other things. It involves a sense of self-fulfilment, which is the feeling of being happy and one is doing something that fully uses your abilities and talents. The feeling of having a purpose in life and connection with others are also contributors to the idea of well-being when people feel as though they have a purpose in the world they feel like they belong. They feel like they matter and it goes back to be idea that we were created for and by a purpose. Mental Health Week in 2015 has drawn attention to a new evidence-based research study that focuses on workers in the entertainment industry. The report found that entertainment industry workers are at a higher risk of experiencing a mental health problem than the rest of the general population. Because of the lifestyle and the hours that people in the entertainment industry actually work, their ability to access mental health services suffers. There is significant difference in the general well-being among male and female students in the field of performing arts. It means that the general well-being of male students is better than that of female students in the field of performing arts. It implies that there is greater negativity, anxiety and frustration among the female students. There is greater stress, depression and competitiveness amongst them affecting their general well being.",

      "title": "'Doing Ngoma': a Dominant Trope in African Religion and Healing",
      "abstract": "A widespread ritual institution in Central and Southern Africa is often referred to, or carries the name, of ngoma, at once the term for drum, as well as drumming or other musical instrumentation, singing, dancing, and the complex of constituent behavior and concepts. Particular manifestations of the institution often carry names denoting a regional or local variant that emerged at a certain time and spread into neighboring regions. Across the region where ngoma type rituals are located-much of Central and Southern Africa, and certain areas of Equatorial Africa-common characteristics include recruitment of those afflicted by a disease, chronic handicap, or social pathology; an initiation-like therapeutic course of several months or years leading from novice to fully-qualified healer status; a redefinition of the self or social group that has been defined as sick, and subsequently stabilized; an etiology of spirit possession that may occasionally be reflected in overt trance, but is often merely hypothesized and dealt with analytically; the tendency to think of the process of going through affliction and healing as a kind of legitimation for other leadership positions in society. This set of features, occasionally in association with the notion ngoma, has usually been studied and presented by scholars as a local, or tribally-particular phenomenon. This view distorts and trivializes the institution. The present paper is a distillation of a decade-long study of ngoma that has been historical and comparative in scope. This work will be published shortly in a complete monograph.1",

      "title": "The Environmental Crisis In Human Dignity",
      "abstract": "The environmental crisis in human dignity lies not just in the overuse, the misuse, and the decay of physical settings, but far more significantly in how we conceive of the individual in relation to any such setting. In the design and organization of physical settings, the human properties of the individual are ignored, oversimplified, or implicitly assumed, because of the influence of such socioenvironmental values as scientific‐technological progress, urbanism, pseudoprogress (novelty and change), and the value placed on an ever increasing acceleration of technological change. Spaces and places are improperly designed not only in physical terms; designs overlook human needs for privacy, territoriality, freedom of choice, etc., and the conceiving of the individual as a simple “machine man.” Unintended consequences are often ignored and no attempt is made to evaluate just how well the setting actually works. The danger is that the person will adjust and at the price of a continuing erosion of the properties that make him distinctively human. It is imperative that as behavioral scientists turn to the systematic study of man/environment problems they recognize the need to maintain the contextual reality and integrity of any such problem as it evolves, develops, and becomes modified in the time framework of a complex society.",

Substandard structures are erected, and collapse, with loss of lives. Doctors in intensive care units fail to wash their hands between patients, and contribute to the problem of cross-infection. There are many situations like these in which harm flows from an action which, in contrast to an error, is quite deliberate in its conceptualisation and execution, even though no harm was intended. We have said that errors are entirely involuntary. The moral implications of an injury are quite different if some element of choice by the actor was involved in the actions which led to its causation. A mistake (mistakes being that subset of errors in which the flaw lies in the decision or plan) is defined as an error precisely because the actor believes that the action is an appropriate way of achieving an objective safely. He or she is acting in good faith, trying to do the best possible thing, but failing. A decision or plan can no longer be considered a mistake (or any other kind of error under the definition in chapter 3) if the person concerned knows that there is a more acceptable alternative, or an alternative more likely to achieve the given objective safely, and yet deliberately chooses the less satisfactory alternative.",

On some occasions, he uses ‘object’ to mean a thing in so far as it possesses a formal quality by which it defines a related action, habit, or power. To illustrate, as the colour of something (not its smell or taste) defines sight, so distinctive differences in what is willed determines whether human actions are morally good, evil, or indifferent, and whether they belong to more particular moral species such as almsgiving or adultery. On other occasions, Aquinas has a second meaning for ‘object’, namely, a proximate end. In this case, when he says an object specifies, he means that a proximate end (such as ‘taking an innocent life’) determines a moral species (such as ‘murder’), and that no further end an agent may pursue (such as wealth) is necessary to make this determination.",

      "abstract": "In talking of using the media to mental health, we are up against a difficulty from the start. We cannot promote mental health in the same sense as we might an object or a personality not even in the same way that we might, in the interests of physical health, a diet or a set of exercises or even a life-style. The factors that contribute to the mental health of an individual or a society are too subtle, too tenuous; and the means by which they are achieved, on purpose or accidentally, are too diffused and too deeply enmeshed in our social roots to be easily affected by direct action. Even indirect action in this area is complex. Professionals in mental health might well decide that its interests would be served if, for example, more mentally handicapped people were shown in TV dramas to be leading comparatively normal lives, or if those who have nervous breakdowns were dealt with more sympathetically; they might think it better for characters to be shown coping with their problems mainly on their own or in their families, rather than invariably calling in a doctor. It might be thought a step forward, in our fragmented society, if there were more positive images of people living successfully on their own, rather than so often finding fulfillment only in a happy-ever-after partnership; it might help if someone with an alcohol problem were seen to tackle it successfully, rather than being portrayed only as a drunken lout. We could devise endless ways in which the media might further the cause of mental health; but there would be no obvious means by which we could induce editors and producers of programs to fall in with our wishes.",

      "title": "Ideals of Perfection",
      "abstract": "According to perfectionism we should strive for what is best. The self-regarding\nversion tells us to concentrate on our own perfection. The impartial version\nstresses that we should aim at the fullest realization of what is best in ourselves\nand others. There is also the version which has as its goal the maximization of\nintrinsic value in the world rather than human ﬂourishing or well-being. Intrinsic\nvalue here is understood objectively as something that is of value independently\nof human desires or choices. Things such as knowledge or beauty are not\nintrinsically valuable because human beings desire them or choose them. Rather,\nhuman beings should choose such things because they are intrinsically valuable.\nOn a weaker version of perfectionism human beings should pursue excellences\nsuch as knowledge and artistic achievements because by doing so they develop\ntheir true nature. Such a view involves a sort of conditional perfectionism.\nAssuming that we need to pursue human excellences in order to fulﬁll our\nnature and ﬂourish, we should set as our goal the promotion of human excellences. If, however, it turns out that human nature requires something quite\ndiﬀerent, such as the pursuit of security or solidarity, then we should pursue\nthese other activities in order to ﬂourish, even if this involves an abandonment\nof the pursuit of excellence. The idea that the best for an individual consists only\nin perfectionist achievements is controversial. Welfare considerations also seem\nrelevant as constituents of human ﬂourishing.\nPerfectionist ideals can be moral or non-moral. The moral ideals require us tobe virtuous and to strive for excellence in morals. Non-moral ideals include the\npursuit of excellence in arts, science and culture. The pursuit of ideals, especially\nof moral ones, can sometimes lead to considerable self-sacriﬁce. On some views\nthe self-sacriﬁce is really required for self-realization. Moral perfectionists tend\nto regard the pursuit of perfection in morality as intrinsically good. Kant thought\nthat the good will is the only thing that is unconditionally good. Some others\nwould claim that perfection in non-moral areas too can be unconditionally good\nin the sense of intrinsically good. Kant thought that non-moral skills and\nachievements can be abused for evil purposes. But this only shows that whenthis occurs they are instrumentally evil, not that they are intrinsically evil. Not\neveryone thinks that the pursuit of moral ideals is of more value than the pursuit\nof other ideals. Aristotle thought that the life of contemplation had greater\nworth and for him the pursuit of moral virtue was a second best, as most people\nwere not capable of proper contemplation.\nOscar Wilde said, “We are all in the gutter. But some of us are looking at thestars”(Wilde 1995: Act 3). Ideals of living can provide us with a vision, not only\nto look at but to be inspired by. If our lives are to be signiﬁcant it is necessary\nthat we commit ourselves to ideals and follow them with zest (James 1908/1899).\nThis view is very plausible; those who simply drift from day to day hardly lead\nmeaningful lives. But which ideals one is attracted to may vary with one’s temperament, talents and social environment, and one’s beliefs about human nature\nand the afterlife. Ideals of living that some ﬁnd awesome, others may ﬁnd\nrepulsive. Moral ideals can be evaluated by appealing to moral, factual and\nmetaphysical considerations. The ideal of perfection to be reached through\nrenunciation and self-sacriﬁce, as preached by Christ, Gandhi and others has\nbeen criticized by those who think that there is no afterlife. Humanists insist that\nwe should only appeal to this world and this life in constructing our ideals. Even\nif we conﬁne ourselves to this world, there would be much disagreement about\nwhich ideals are worth pursuing in morals as well as in other areas; the perfection that Nietzsche favored was to be attained by the self-assertion (rather than\nself-denial), in this world, of those who had superior talents, and he was dismissive of what he called the ascetic ideal (Nietzsche 1969: Essay 3). There is also\nmuch disagreement regarding the weight to be attached to moral ideals compared\nwith non-moral ideals.\nLiberal perfectionists in the West tend to be Aristotelians who stress a highlevel of excellence in knowledge and conduct, but there are other perfectionists\nworth mentioning. Gandhi thought his ideal of the good life could be followed\nby the simple peasant; indeed, he thought that villages were less corrupting of\nthe human spirit than much of modernity. Admittedly, existing villages have\ntheir own vices (such as untouchability in India), many of which may be less\nprevalent in the big cities. But the villages that Gandhi admired were to be\nmodeled on ideals of Truth and Love and Non-violence. Excellence in non-moral\nareas such as science, art, sports may be much more diﬃcult to achieve if one\nleads a simple peasant life, but Gandhi would say that such excellences are much\nless important than purity of heart and moral excellence.\nIdeals of excellence can be attainable or unattainable. Some people think thatwe should be realistic and pursue ideals that are attainable. Unattainable ideals\nare unnecessarily demanding and can lead to the ideals getting discredited.\nOthers such as Tolstoy and Gandhi (Gandhi 1986-: Vol. 2, 284-5) believe in the\npursuit of perfection even though it can never be attained in this world. Complete perfection has an awesome quality and can stir us to action in a way in\nwhich moderate perfection cannot. Though we can never hope to attain ittotally, the ideal provides us with a vision that can inspire us; our job is to make\nprogress on the road to perfection. A person on a lower level but moving\ntowards perfection “lives a more moral and better life than one who, though on\na much higher level of morality is not advancing towards perfection.” Therefore\n“the movement towards perfection … of the woman who was a sinner or of\nthe thief on the cross is a higher degree of life than the stagnant righteousness\nof the Pharisee” (Tolstoy 1935: Ch. 3).\nOn some inegalitarian versions of perfectionism lives that are higher on thescale of perfection should be regarded as having greater worth: “the lower well\nbeing – it may be ultimately the very existence – of countless Chinamen or\nNegroes must be sacriﬁced that a higher life may be possible for a much smaller\nnumber of white men” (Rashdall 1924: Vol. 1, 238-9). There are non-racist\nvariants of such inegalitarian perfectionism. According to Nietzsche ordinary\nhuman beings should when necessary be sacriﬁced for the great achievements of\nsuper-individuals like Napoleon and Goethe. The Tolstoy-Gandhi version of the\npursuit of perfection is much easier to reconcile with ideals of human equality.\nFor it is possible for us all to strive towards perfection.\nVersions of perfectionism that tell us to maximize the sum of intrinsic valueare inherently prone to sacriﬁce the interests of the less talented. Even the\ninterests of the gifted can be sacriﬁced; a person may excel in morals or in other\nareas at the expense of his overall well-being. One possibility is to adopt moral\npluralism and to commend perfectionism and respect for persons as two ultimate principles. Another possibility would be to construct an egalitarian (or\nrespect-for-persons) theory and to use perfectionist considerations (along\nwith welfare considerations) to work out its implications (Haksar 1979). Thus\nFrankena suggests that the state should make the same proportionate contribution to the best life of everyone, so that everyone has the same chance to enjoy\nthe best life he is capable of (Frankena 1976). On such views perfectionist considerations, as well as welfare considerations, are brought in for the good of the\nindividual person rather than the individual being used as a mere means for\nincreasing perfection and/or welfare in the world.",

In the first place, there is power over human beings and power over dead matter or non-human forms of life. Power over human beings may be classified by the manner of influencing individuals, or by the type of organization involved. The most important organizations are approximately distinguishable by the kind of power that they exert. Naked power is usually military, and may take the form either of internal tyranny or of foreign conquest. A very different type of character comes to the fore where power is achieved through learning or wisdom, real or supposed. The two most important examples of this form of power are traditional China and the Catholic Church. The power of the intellectual depends upon superstition: reverence for a traditional incantation or a sacred book.",

      "abstract": "Abstract We are concerned in this paper with the question of what more there is to human nature than cognition, with what it is to be a person (or animal) in the sense of something that would justify our sympathy. We examine pain, emotion, and the abrogation of values as sources of our sympathy for one another. We further argue that our sympathy over each of these unfortunate events is connected with our sense that they are beyond a person' s (or an animal' s) will. Computers, we suggest, ought not to engage our sympathy not because of their limited cognitive capacity, and not because they lack intent, but because their wills are too free.",

      "title": "Solidarity or objectivity?",
      "abstract": "There are two principal ways in which reflective human beings try, by placing their lives in a larger context, to give sense to those lives. The first is by telling the story of their contribution to a community. This community may be the actual historical one in which they live, or another actual one, distant in time or place, or a quite imaginary one, consisting perhaps of a dozen heroes and heroines selected from history or fiction or both. The second way is to describe themselves as standing in immediate relation to a nonhuman reality. This relation is immediate in the sense that it does not derive from a relation between such a reality and their tribe, or their nation, or their imagined band of comrades. I shall say that stories of the former kind exemplify the desire for solidarity, and that stories of the latter kind exemplify the desire for objectivity. Insofar as a person is seeking solidarity, she does not ask about the relation between the practices of the chosen community and something outside that community. Insofar as she seeks objectivity, she distances herself from the actual persons around her not by thinking of herself as a member of some other real or imaginary group, but rather by attaching herself to something which can be described without reference to any particular human beings.",

      "abstract": "In sociology, psychology and also in philosophy trust is often taken be basic or fundamental in the sense that only trust allows us to be and engage in the world, to develop a healthy ego-identity or to gain knowledge about other people’s opinions. Without basic trust in the world, in others or in other’s testimony, that is, we would not, as Luhmann says, get up in the morning, we would lack the self-confidence necessary to interact with others or would be unable to take their statements as trustworthy which seems to be a prerequisite for all learning processes. I question this model of basic trust not necessarily because I find it wrong but because I find it less informative than is often assumed. The fuzzy notion of trust gains in semantic richness and distinctivess, I assume, if we “defundamentalize” it and accept it as always surrounded by alternative psychological and emotional attitudes. Trust is thus treated as an achievement never to be taken for granted though easily naturalized. Following some conceptual clarifications I discuss phenomena such as violence and terror in order to clarify in what ways they destroy basic trust. This also opens the possibility to historicize trust and treat it less as an anthropological or psychological given.",

      "title": "Does God Have a Nature? by Alvin Plantinga",
      "abstract": "616 BOOK REVIEWS Does God Have a Nature? (The Aquinas Lecture: 1980.) By ALVIN'j PL.ANTING.A. Milwaukee: Marquette University Press, 1980. Pp. ii + 146. Among the divine attributes important for Christians and other theists is God's aseity, which Alvin Plantinga in this excellently crafted book initially glosses as God's \" uncreatedness, self-sufficiency and independence of everything else\" (p. 1); \"all things depend on him, and he depends upon nothing at all\" (p. 2). But the existence of abstract objects, according to Plantinga, poses problems for belief in God's aseity. \" [P]roperties, propositions, numbers and states of affairs [for instance] ... are objects whose non-existence is quite impossible\" (p. 4). God cannot be said to create them, since they are beginningless; and since their non-existenec is impossible, they do not seem to depend on God in any other way either. But if such objects are parts of the world which God just has to accept, their existence appears to impugn God's aseity. The problem is made more acute by considering God himself. If God has a nature, that is, if he has some properties essentially, then it is not within his control whether or not he has those properties. \"So God's having a nature seems incompatible with his being in total control\" (p. 8). In the history of philosophical theology, nominalism, possibilism, and the doctrine of divine simplicity have been presented as solutions to this problem. Nominalism attempts to solve the problem by denying the existence of abstract objects such as properties and propositions. Plantinga argues that there are a number of difficulties with nominalism as a solution (one of them, he says-p. 85-is its obvious falsity), but chief among them is the fact that nominalism is simply irrelevant to this problem, which remains even if we pare our ontology down to concrete objects only. On Plantinga's interpretation of it, the doctrine of God's aseity is the doctrine that all things, including all truths, are up to God. Given that interpretation, the p11oblem with God's aseity is not really addressed by nominalism. Although nominalism denies that properties, divine or otherwise , have independent existence, certain propositions about God's nature nonetheless remain necessarily true; and these truths are not within God's control. Therefore, even if nominalism were correct, there would still be truths about God's nature which are not up to God and which consequently impugn his aseity. Possibilism attempts to solve the problem by claiming that God has no nature; all truths, including truths about God himself, are up to God. Much of Plantinga's discussion of possibilism is occupied with the question of whether Descartes was a possibilist. Plantinga concludes that he was and that he held a somewhat confused version of possibilism, an in- BOOK REVIEWS 617 consistent mixture of \" limited possibilism\" (the view that some truths are necessary though God could have made them otherwise) and \"universal possibilism \" (the view that there are no necessary truths, only contingent ones). Plantinga argues that contrary to appearances universal possibilism is a coherent position. And he maintains that, of the traditional solutions to the problem of God's ascity, universal possibilism is the only one really relevant to the problem because it alone puts everything , including all truths, within God's control. As for the doctrine of divine simplicity, on Plantinga's view, it is like nominalism in that both positions, besides their other flaws, have the overriding failing of irrelevance to the problem since according to each of these putative solutions some truths are not up to God. The strategy of Plantinga's own solution to the problem is the mirror image of that of nominalism. Nominalism attempts to resolve the apparent incompatibility of abstract objects and God's aseity by denying the existence of abstract objects. Plantinga attempts to resolve it by denying God's aseity. At the beginning of his last chapter he asks his \"final question\": \"should we follow Descartes in giving full sway to the sovereignty -aseity intuition, thus denying that God has a nature'\" (p. 126); and his answer is 'No'. He concludes by maintaining that God does have a...",

Hence the idea that rare acts, like rare objects and rare metals and gases, exist which are distinct and have particular psychological, cognitive, emotional, and social psychological effects. Human activities in general are not satisfied with the banality induced by repetition and the perfect knowledge that frequent acts bring, but they are guided more by a desire for innovation or progress, in other words, by a more or less chaotic tendency toward types of rare actions at a given moment. In many cases, the rare act can be considered as the goal of frequent acts, as something that gives them meaning and which, by transcending each of them, proves to be invaluable in moments of doubt, fatigue, and despondency.",

      "abstract": "How does nonhuman primate innovation compare to our own? Many primates innovate, for example to get otherwise inaccessible food or to increase their social standing, and nonhuman primate innovation can be broken into three component steps. It begins with the initial invention, which is then transmitted to other members of the inventor’s group, and is then adopted by other individuals and maintained within the society. These three steps – invention, transmission, and maintenance – are all required for innovation and in this review, I discuss the factors (social, environmental, and cognitive) that influence each step. I also highlight the comparable and contrasting features between human and nonhuman primate innovation. In contrast to human innovations, primate innovations are relatively simple and are typically self-serving. Nonhuman primates do not invent new products explicitly for the use of others (although group members certainly copy others' innovations) and nor are their inventions artistic or abstract in nature. Intriguingly, although chimpanzees and other nonhuman primates appear to be expert at copying others’ inventions, there is far less evidence of their ability to build upon others’ inventions (i.e., to show cumulative culture). At the core of our complex cultural world is the fidelity with which we copy others and our specialism at building upon the ideas of others. Thus, it is the cumulative nature of our innovative process that has created our complex material cultural world and is a key difference between how we innovate, learn and transmit knowledge, and how our chimpanzee cousins copy one another. Another difference is our ability to work collaboratively in teams to innovate and develop new technologies, as well as our potential to cooperate in an altruistic way that allows for planning for future generations. In conclusion, perhaps primate innovation can be most usefully likened to human ‘user innovators’ who typically innovate products or techniques to fill a personal need, rather than by being driven to create a product to go to market.",

Manny innovation scholars like Kanter (1983) have stated it to the generation, acceptance and implementation of new ideas, processes, products or services. There could be no specific model to describe the process, but as said it originates from the generation of new ideas that is eventually manifested in the extraordinary achievements we encounter in any field of human activity. The essence of individual innovation lies in its uniqueness of the intellectual power or capacity expressed. The developmental foundation of an individual innovation is associated with the childhood development of the innovators. It is the period in which he or she undergoes high levels of cognitive manifestations. This is the duration whereby it accelerates the propensity to contribute something 'new' of its kind. It may not be termed as a gift or a chance of event but a result of a specific organisation of an individual's experience.",

I use the term “microdialogue,” rather than the more familiar notion of “internal conversation” or “society of mind,” to refer to a silent and invisible series of dialogues we hold for ourselves with the images and voices of others, which can emerge in surprising and unwilled ways. I suggest that this micro-dialogue is important in understanding the dialogical interactions between persons, as not all aspects of the self will enter into dialogue with others, leading to miscommunication, misunderstanding, and misrecognition. It is also possible for people to fail to articulate all the latent voices or vocal tones in their own micro-dialogue, leading to an understanding of how voices and selves can become divided and allowing us to take a different perspective on a dialogical unconscious.",

It is a path that leads and helps the person to achieve a limpid gaze, capable of seeing the person in the flesh of the beloved, unifying the various elements the make up the rich experience of love –sexual attraction, emo- tions, the will 's choice, reason– within an action that is ordered towards the true good of the other. If these precious elements are not kept together though, love is not just impoverished, but most importantly it is threatened to fall apart.\r\nMan needs therefore to find those ways of unification and har- monization of love, which are none other than the virtues, espe- cially the virtue of chastity. Human virtues are true resources for acquiring the art of a qualitative love, which continues to seek its fullness and excellence. Thus the virtues do not render us immu- ne or opaque towards reality, they do not do away with the onto- logical vulnerability to the world and to the other people. Instead, \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthey help us to eradicate that malady which disintegrates us mo- rally and which abandons us to our weaknesses, which then become wounds that can never heal; a fragmented eros make us drown in the tragedy of not being able to reach what eros promises\r\nHuman love thus harmonized is in fact an eros touched and reborn of Eternity, which embraces time –instead of escaping it– edifying a strong and genially creative love, a love which always affirming its bodily mediation. Agape does not destroy eros, but it cherishes and exalts it, offering man the necessary freedom to love: to love preserving the concept of difference involved in a relatio- nship; to love responding to the gift with a gift of self; to love the fruitfulness that true love implies, since true love is never sterile.",

In Gemeinschaft they stay together in spite of everything that separates them; in Gesellschaft they remain separate in spite of everything that unites them. As a result, there are no activities taking place which are derived from an a priori and pre-determined unity and which therefore express the will and spirit of this unity through any individual who performs them. Nothing happens in Gesellschaft that is more important for the individual's wider group than it is for himself. On the contrary, everyone is out for himself alone and living in a state of tension against everyone else. The various spheres of power and activity are sharply demarcated, so that everyone resists contact with others and excludes them from his own spheres, regarding any such overtures as hostile. Such a negative attitude is the normal and basic way in which these power-conscious people relate to one another, and it is characteristic of Gesellschaft at any given moment in time. Nobody wants to do anything for anyone else, nobody wants to yield or give anything unless he gets something in return that he regards as at least an equal trade-off.",

From an evolutionary point of view, this is really important because if the new object is similar enough with a class we already know, it means that we know how to deal with it (or what to expect from it).

      "title": "Artists in Liberia and the United States: a Comparative View",
      "abstract": "In summary, six striking parallels have been found between the artist archetypes in Liberia and the United States, each of which appears to be rooted in some structural similarity between the two societies at the material and social levels. The structural factors which have been suggested as pivotal in determining the nature of the artist archetype have included: (1) the atypicality of the carver/artist/s labour process via-à-vis that of other workers; (2) the development of an alternate value profile congruent with that atypical process; (3) the need for itinerancy/migration to ensure a large enough market for self-support; (4) dependence on the élite class for patronage; (5) relative economic insecurity; and (6) a definition of the product which necessitates solitary labour. These factors combine to create in the general public the image of the artist described earlier. Some carvers and artists may appear to exhibit the traits imputed to them, and even ‘play into’ their expected image; but this phenomenon can be explained without invoking some innate ‘artistic temperament’ or transcultural ‘artist's rôle’. Rather, we can conclude that carvers and artists, like other human beings, are subject to specific material and social constraints that shape their own consciousness and that of their public. Though individuals make art, it is as true of art as of history, that ‘they do not make it under circumstances chosen by themselves, but under circumstances directly encountered, given, and transmitted from the past’.",

      "title": "Relational Agency and Spiritual Well-Being: An Argument for a Denisian Passibilism",
      "abstract": "According to one conception of God, God is completely self-sufficient: nothing can affect or influence God outside of God. According to a second conception of God, God is emotionally responsive to others. These two conceptions of God reflect different ideals about agency. For the first conception of God, it is important that God is autonomous; that is, completely self-governing and able to act, unconstrained by any external agents or influences. For the second conception of God, it is important that God has relational agency; that is, that God can be affected by God’s creatures such that God’s creatures can cause God to feel joy or sorrow. Theists face an apparent dilemma in choosing between these differing conceptions of God: either they must forfeit God’s absolute autonomy, or else they must forfeit God’ relational agency. In either case, it seems, they must deny that God has perfect agency. This paper proposes a way out of this dilemma, in the form of what I call ‘Denisian passibilism’, according to which God transcends not only positive but also negative language about God.",

In that sense, they value the beloved's existence and flourishing as an end in itself. It is compatible with considering beauty to be an objective end in itself that people take the particular instantiations of beauty to be replaceable for each other. So the source of the beloved's objective end-hood and irreplaceability must lie elsewhere. Something that ought to be pursued in all conceptually possible situations must be something that ought to be pursued for its own sake.

      "abstract": "Can one person's mental states, such as intentions or emotions, affect others even in the absence of any action or expression on that person's part? Contrary to a widely shared assumption, I argue for a positive answer. The assumption, I claim, rests on the view that a person's thoughts are by themselves neither knowable by others nor do they have causal efficacy with regard to them. The assumption can be refuted, accordingly, by recognizing other cases in which a person will be said to be affected by an event about which he knows not and in the absence of a causal link. Our willingness to acknowledge that a disaster befell a father whose son was killed in an accident, unbeknownst to him, provides such an example. The account of this case I propose highlights the fact that being a father is a relational property: it is defined in terms of the father's relation to the son, whom I call \"the relational term.\" The accident can be said to have affected the father despite the absence of a causal link because it did causally affect the relational term, i.e., the son. The crucial step in the argument is to recognize that one person's mental state can also be the relational term that defines another's relational property, thus providing a medium for non-causal effects on the latter. The argument has wide normative implications, illustrated by a discussion of the legal treatment of hate speech, and broader philosophical ramifications, concerning \"externalist\" views of the mind and their bearing on the limits of individualism.",

Without the right hemisphere, the world would be flat, deprived of general and spatial attentions, pointing preferentially to the right side of the space, lacking visual experiences and emotions, exhibiting diminished awareness of the self and environment. Clinical-related syndromes of the right hemisphere are unilateral spatial neglect, object and face visual agnosia, the anosognosia for hemiparesis and/or hemianopia, misidentification syndromes, mania, and other obsessions for the food and the body. Another key function of the right hemisphere is the modulation of the emotional processes of the linguistic communication (as prosody and facial expressions), and the tuning of some holistic aspects of language as the understanding of the abstract and figurative characters. The great mysteries of the right brain hemisphere concern the origin of the emotional nature of the human being, the way by which cognition interacts with perception and finally the human consciousness. Multidisciplinary researches in the domains of neurology, cognitive psychology, neuropsychiatry, functional neuroimaging, and neurophysiology will reveal in the future some of these mysteries.",

      "title": "Sulking as a declaration of dependence",
      "abstract": "Adult sulking is an emotional state and behaviour, characterized by misery and sometimes hostility, that occurs within intimate relationships. A remnant of unmet needs in infancy, it is enacted when omnipotence, grandiosity and feelings of entitlement are threatened. Sulking signals the sulker's feelings of dependency and powerlessness in relation to a significant other while defending against feared consequences of self‐assertion. As protest, appeal or coercion, sulking may be the recourse of any individual when words fail or are refused. This paper examines sulking in couple relationships because sulking is intrinsically interpersonal: a sulker requires someone to sulk at or to. While the sulker overtly cold‐shoulders the other, emotionally he is far from indifferent to the other's response. Sulking sits on a narcissistic continuum, with relatively benign moodiness at one end and coercive control at the other. Section 1 of this paper explores sulking firstly in childhood and then in adult relationships, together with the way spatial metaphors – the cave and tent – may assist the clinician's understanding of the sulker's self‐positioning in relation to his object. Sulking's purposive aspects are also considered. In Section 2, psychic agony is discussed to demonstrate how some people may become prisoners of their own or the other's sulking.",

      "title": "Do Others Exist?: Buddhist Perspectives on “The Other”",
      "abstract": "Do Others Exist? Buddhist Perspectives on “The Other” Rita M. Gross (bio) duality, nonduality, interdependence, Thich Nhat Hanh, inter-being, compassion From my perspective as a Buddhist, I have to say that all the questions about “the other” are secondary questions, not the primary question or the primary reality. When we begin to perceive and talk about others, we are in the realm of duality. Therefore, we are already removed from the clear, basic awareness that surrounds and supports our projection or creation of the seeming reality of self and other. While this point may seem subtle and esoteric, it is actually completely basic. If we assume the existence of self and other as separate, metaphysically real entities and take that as the starting point of our discussions, our discussions will be limited and unsuccessful in my view. We are starting our discussions at a point well into a process, without ever becoming grounded in the underlying realities. We need to look into what precedes duality, not as a temporal absolute beginning, but in the moment by moment flickering of consciousness. We need to understand that there is an “other” only in the experience of a self, that self and other are co-created or, in better Buddhist language, arise together. And, we need to understand that, at least in Buddhist terms, duality is a secondary and somewhat mistaken perception. While it is important and useful to talk of self and other, such talk needs to be put in proper perspective, to be grounded in fleeting awareness of the vast space in which self and other co-arise. I understand that these claims are very much against everyday assumptions about the nature of reality. Usually, we take ourselves to be the center of the world and experience others as momentary, sometimes pleasing, sometimes unpleasant or painful, arisings in our consciousness. But, we also assume that others, like ourselves, are separate, fixed, and metaphysically [End Page 139] real entities. The profundity of the Buddhist message is to challenge as fundamentally erroneous these views to which we are so habituated about the substantiality of self and other and about the ultimate reality of duality. Buddhism also challenges us to recognize that these fundamentally mistaken views are the source of our misery, much of which arises from our unsatisfactory relationships with “the other.” In addition to my training as a Buddhist, I have also been deeply influenced by other streams of thought that are deeply suspicious of duality. Especially in the early literature of the second wave of feminism, sexism and male dominance were often analyzed as the results or the expression of the “othering” of women, of the way in which men, who created culture and thought, experienced and saw women as “the others,” the ones who were different and perhaps not even completely human. This was a powerful explanatory tool for many of us, helping us understand why we so often felt like outsiders and victims in a world that was male-dominated despite a superficial rhetoric of equality. We were always associated with the downside of a long list of dualities. Duality quickly became the code word explaining what was wrong with conventional ways of thinking and acting. 1 I will claim, as a Buddhist and as a feminist, 2 that, when we seek to understand otherness and “the other” and relate with them, whether or not we consider duality to be ultimately real and the underlying fact of our existence could make a great deal of difference. It will be harder to solidify and demonize “the others” if we recognize that duality is ultimately only apparent, that all persons and all things live and move and have their being in an interdependent matrix of nonduality. It will be harder to categorize them as sub-human and to set artificial limits to their humanity and their achieving. Even if nonduality is not seen as more logical and persuasive than some form of dualism as the ultimate reality, which would probably be the case for most monotheists, it is nevertheless important to understand that, by any analysis, self and other are interdependent and co-arising, not separate and independent.

We may praise them for being courageous, charitable, just, sensitive, or magnanimous, or we may condemn their foolishness, envy or deviousness. We may neither praise nor blame, but wonder whether they were not fully responsible for what they did. Perhaps they were coerced or pressured or, perhaps, just did not know what they were doing. This language of moral evaluation does not only apply to adult human beings, but that is its primary and most typical use. Children may be selfish or act unfairly, but we accept that they only gradually acquire full moral responsibility for their actions. Animals, too, may be courageous or altruistic, but we may suspect a degree of anthropomorphism in extending moral language too far in their direction. The moral status of animals is a matter of debate, but no one thinks butterflies can have or lack charity or that jackdaws are dishonest. The rest of the world lies outside the moral realm altogether, except, perhaps, for our moral responsibilities towards it. Rocks and stones and trees do not have moral responsibilities.",

      "abstract": "Humans have evolved three different brain systems for mating and reproduction. While the first is for sex drive, the second is for romantic love and implies tenderness, commitment, passion, desire, giddiness, euphoria, jealousy, and possessiveness towards the partner. The third is attachment, i.e., the sense of security you can feel with a long-term partner. Love is a greater impulse than the sex drive and it is rooted in the most ancient brain areas, alongside the urges of hunger and thirst. As such, love participates in the shaping of human nature and individual identity. In this chapter, I will try to describe this perspective of love, focusing on what happens in the brain and rejecting the romantic picture. When falling in love, you are not only overwhelmed by romantic feelings; you also feel deeply attached to the object of your affection. Moreover, when the reward brain circuit is active, the subject feels a strong motivation to risk everything to win life's biggest prize: the partner. Finally, it will be argued that love is a kind of addiction able to force people in pathological pathways when other typical circumstances occur.",

Darwin (1871/1982) repeatedly referred to the “moral sense.” He asserted, “Any animal whatever, endowed with a well-marked social instinct, the parental and filial affections being here included, would inevitably acquire a moral sense of conscience, as soon as its intellectual power had become as well or nearly as well developed as in man” (p. 95).

      "title": "Envy and Grace",
      "abstract": "Envy and Grace Lloyd W. J. Aultman-Moore (bio) Envy is ugly. It's an inner constriction and contraction of the human spirit. In its effects, it is a malicious withholding of what is, rightfully, due another. The medievals classed sins as \"warm\" or \"cold.\" Thus, lust, as one might have guessed, is placed among the warm. It seems that sins connected to one's bodily being are, generally, so classed. Interestingly, sins in the warm category are not viewed as seriously by the medievals as are sins in the cold category. Recall that Paolo and Francesca, who had sex outside of wedlock, are placed by Dante at the very upper level of Hell while sowers of discord, hypocrites, and the like have their place much lower in his Inferno. Envy, an affliction of the mind and spirit, is in the cold category. Lust may not be rooted in genuine love but, at least, it wishes well to another at some level. Envy would contemplate with pleasure the thwarting or even destruction of another. I don't know when, exactly, envy began to sink its icy talons into me, but I believe it began when I decided to become an academic. Academics are prone to compare themselves to each other and to constantly assess their worth (academic and otherwise) by sizing up the competition in terms of scholarly achievement, publications, institutional prestige, [End Page 163] and so forth. We tend to keep a close eye on each other. Or, at least, I do. Traditionally, envy is one of the \"seven deadly sins,\" but it's often confused with jealousy, which is not nearly as ugly. Jealousy is a desire to get what another has or to measure up to another's achievement. The root of the word jealousy goes back to the Latin zelosus and to the Greek zelos of which our English word \"zeal\" is a cognate. It is a \"positive\" vice in that it spurs one on to achieve what another has. Envy is purely negative. It is the experience of pain at another's achievement or success, accompanied not by zeal to also achieve or measure up but by the malicious desire to deprive the other of the good he or she has. It may be a stab of pain upon hearing of another's success and the wish that he or she had not achieved it. Why this reaction? My experience is that the other's success makes me feel insecure, as if what I've achieved has been belittled in my eyes and in the eyes of others, and I find that lessening a humiliation. Another's achievement should call forth my joy and admiration, but I can experience it as a threat. I don't feel this with the achievements of my children or my wife, and I don't feel it all the time. Most often, envy is evoked in me by the achievements of other academics or by someone who has been egregiously successful and happy. The root of the word envy is in the Latin invidia, which is related to invidere, \"to look upon with malice.\" Though it may not be etymologically related to the Latin word, the Greek word phthonein, \"to begrudge,\" is certainly related to the essential nature of envy. The Greeks certainly knew about this phenomenon. The Homeric gods and those of tragic drama constantly begrudge humans raising their heads too high. Swift punishment comes to those who try it. Plato, in his bold challenge to Homeric theology, says in his dialogue Timaeus that the god who framed the universe is good and, as such, is aphthonos, that is, \"free from begrudging.\" This is the charter for a new kind of divinity. \"The envious man,\" as the eighteenth-century thinker Immanuel Kant once put it, \"does not merely want to be happy; he wants to [End Page 164] be the only happy person in the world; he is really contented only when he sees nothing but misery around him. Such an intolerable creature would gladly destroy every source of joy and happiness in the world.\"1 The envious person, then, begrudges others their happiness or, in vampire fashion...",

By “importance” I do not just mean basic survival value, for although we can survive without sight and hearing, and (perhaps with more difficulty) touch, our full engagement with the complex social and cultural world so vital to human flourishing depends on the pre-eminence of these senses. In contrast, although our senses of smell and taste can bring us pleasure, and in certain cases alert us to potential dangers, they can seem much less vital to our existence and well-being, and the pleasures they provide of far less interest and consequence than the objects we contemplate in sight and sound. Hence the scepticism frequently directed, for example, at claims that there can be objective standards of taste, or that food and drink can be genuine or serious objects of aesthetic interest, claims that we shall examine in some detail later.",

Any person in the condition in which he may be properly called \"dead drunk\" is completely narcotized. His entire nervous system is paralyzed. He may have taken a half pint or a pint of whisky or brandy. Either of these amounts is a large quantity, the former for a child, the latter for an adult. The person overcome by a complete alcoholic stupor has lost for the time being the functions of the special senses.

Human beings engage in relatively little direct eye‐to‐eye contact. For humans and other animal species, eye behavior plays an important role in survival, reproduction, and building/maintaining social and role relationships. Being watched is as important as watching others. As the target of another's eye gaze, a person's performance is infused with significance – in either positive or negative ways. Because of its importance to human interaction, people are sensitive to the absence of gaze when it is expected and its presence when it is not. We often perceive eye‐to‐eye contact when the eyes are actually tracking many points around the area of the eyes.",

      "title": "A COMPARATIVE STUDY OF ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT OF HIGH AND LOW ADJUSTMENT LEVEL STUDENTS",
      "abstract": "Human situation is a constant one. New conditions and problems are constantly setting the individual right from his infancy to his deathbed, and he is invariably engaged in trying to find a satisfactory and pleasurable solution to them by employing his intelligence and other gifts of the mind and body. In other words, life is the name of unceasing process, the process of adjustment. “Adjustment is the process by which a living organism maintains a balance between its needs and the circumstances that influence the satisfaction of these needs” accordingly, the process of adjustment has two primary or main elements: one, the needs of the living organism; and two the conditions of circumstances influencing these needs. These needs can be biogenic, Originating in the society, personal or community, or arising from any other conceivable source. On the other hand, circumstances influencing these needs also can be either inside individual or outside him. Factors within the individuals that influence these needs are his physical and mental states, capacity, attitudes interests, etc. Three Elements in Adjustment An analysis of the process of adjustment of the processes of adjustment will reveal the presence of three main elements: - Motive: The very process of adjustment in the living being is set in motion by the presence within him of some motive or need or requirement. - Thwarting Condition: When the environment does not present any features that tend to become obstacles in the fulfillment of these needs, then the adjustment in natural, facile and effortless, and does not problem in result. However, if circumstances create obstacle in the path of such fulfillment, then the process of adjustment progresses further. -  Varied Responses :  Once the fulfillment of a need has obstructed, individual indulges in various actions, which are a reaction to the obstacle. Such a reaction can be normal just as much as it can be abnormal. -  Solution: Because of these reactions and responses, the individual achieves a degree of adjustment with the circumstances. The problem of adjustment in there by solved. - Motive and adjustment :  Generally speaking, the process of adjustment can be set in motion by any motive.  For example, our physical needs are constantly being manifesting in the form of adjective behavior patterns. However, from our point of view, these needs do not have much importance, for life, itself ceases in the organism, thus obviating all further adjustment activity. Need of study : - present time all people are salves of their problem in presently situations and his determinative life goals. Present time all people have set their life goals to earn a lot of money. In Past time all human being decided his life goal “mocha”. The persons do efforts to gain a lot of money in any situation or from any work .All situation have balanced human behaviors; this work’s main factor is adjustment level. Based on previous research finding conclusion the well adjustable persons have conducted their work very smoothly, and all decisions taken were correct.  From This concepts question arises. What does high adjustment level students achieved on high academic achievement?   Adjustment works normally in every circumstance of human life. Similarly, adjustments on learning achievement would work normally, considering how logical this fact is this study has done. Statement of the problem : - “A comparative study of academic achievement of high and low adjustment level students”",

Hence, for Kuranko, wale (duty or work) is \"that which you have to do\", by contrast with desire, which is what you might want to do. To express one's feelings or speak one's mind without taking into account the feelings or thoughts of others, is frowned upon; but so too is slavish adherence to social norms. Accordingly, a viable social life consists in making emotionality serve rather than subvert the common weal, a matter of giving equal expression to freedom and restraint. For Kuranko, this involves a continual adjustment of the bush (associated with antinomian impulses) and the village (associated with law and order).",

      "title": "Matter, Form and Object: Rejoinder to Sidelle",
      "abstract": "Aristotelian notions such as matter, form and substance (or object) should be used carefully; not only is the rich tradition in their background marked by variety of interpretation, even Aristotle's own use of these concepts is far from uniform. In his different works, matter, form and (primary) substance display contents that do not always agree. There is reason for believing that in the Metaphysics Zeta the notion of form embodies (or amounts to) essence, and that accordingly something without essence does not qualify as substance. This cannot be generalized or regarded as Aristotle's standard view, however, for in the Physics there are contexts in which the form is not conceived as (or does not embody) essence. There, “the form or shape” is the arrangement of the substance's parts, or the object's shape, in addition to either all or some of its qualities (i.e., the sensible shape). Outside the Metaphysics , substance, too, seems to be a less distinguished entity. In the Physics , and especially in the Categories , substance is anything capable of independent existence, any particular concrete thing that is a bearer of attributes. To the extent that our modern “object” corresponds to Aristotle's primary substance, it has a similar polysemy. While in some contexts it will mean an articulated object belonging to a specific kind, in others it will denote bodies without organized structure, that is, it will have as extension the particular bits and pieces that fill the world. A similar diversity applies to matter. When understood, for example, as a chunk out of which an artist casts her statue, matter is an object (a substratum), a body, itself endowed with a boundary (a form) and a multitude of properties. But matter can be much simpler than that; it can be a plain homoeomere , a mere element, or as in prime matter, may lack every actual attribute. When in my “Matter and Objecthood” I criticized Henry Laycock's views propounded in “ Some Questions of Ontology” I found comparable ambiguities transposed to contemporary discourse. In the paper just cited, Laycock examines the ontic status of matter, contrasting it with objects as particular concrete things; throughout his discussion no radical distinction is made between articulated objects and unorganized bodies. In my criticism I employed ‘object’ in the same inclusive sense.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Toward the end of the last chapter, I argued that domination threatens individuality. Anyone who endures the (nearly) unlimited power of another—be it a husband, an “oriental despot,” or a popular majority—is robbed of the capacity for self-authorship. I argued that this theft can take several forms: the powerless can be coerced outright or intimidated into conformity and obedience, or they can constrain themselves out of fear. Worse still, they can be socialized and manipulated into welcoming the conditions of their subjection. A well-designed democracy is, for Mill, a means of limiting and dividing power and thereby emancipating individuals from these several forms of domination. I also suggested, however, that individuality was something more than an ideal of equality or non-domination. It has other, more positive elements. Conformity, though sometimes a consequence of domination, is, in other cases, simply a matter of habit or comfort. In fact, Mill holds that it is the human intellect’s natural point of repose. To succeed in living deliberately is to succeed, therefore, in overcoming some of the habits of mind that come easiest. In this chapter, I explore Mill’s account of the demands that individuality places on individuals. I focus especially on Mill’s conception of the “active mind,” which he thinks an integral part of individuality.",

      "title": "Placebos and Placebo Effects",
      "abstract": "To summarize, the placebo effect occurs if and only if: 1) the patient is a thinking, experiencing, conscious, belief-holding subject; 2) the patient is a member of a culture; 3) the patient has symptoms; 4) the patient stands in a special relation with others who are recognized by the surrounding culture, and by the medical culture, as expert healers or medical authorities; 5) the patient is administered a treatment for his or her disease or disorder by a medical authority or expert healer; 6) the patient's disorder or disease is changed; 7) the change in the patient's disorder or disease is not caused by the hypothesized characteristic factors of the treatment; 8) the change in the disorder or disease is caused by the incidental factors of the treatment.There are several advantages of this definition over Shapiro's, Grünbaum's, and Brody's. First, it recognizes (with Bootzin and Caspi [2002]) the synergistic, multidimensional, and interpersonal nature of the placebo effect. A placebo is not a static and discrete thing like a sugar pill; it is more like an event than a thing. Moreover, the placebo effect is not, strictly, ‘inside the head’ of the patient. It is a culturally situated and interpersonally constituted event; no one responds to placebos in a social and cultural vacuum. Second, the defini tion preserves the centrality accorded to patients’ beliefs in the placebo effect, while also emphasizing (unlike the other definitions) the role of patient affect and conscious awareness; the placebo effect is made possible by the complex interplay of belief, hope, expectation, and emotions, among other variables. Third, the definition is more explicit than the other definitions in what it rules out as possible placebo responders. Anything that is not a conscious, experiencing, belief-holding and culturally situated subject is not a placebo responder. Fourth, the definition offers a more robust and detailed account of what Grünbaum sparingly calls patients’ ‘life processes’ and what Brody sparingly calls ‘healing context’.",

      "abstract": "Psychogenic experiences occurring prior to the onset of eating disorders had previously been ignored as not corresponding to the symptoms. Recently, we have been considering these experiences as outbreak conditions, and have done phenomenological analysis of the experiences themselves with the following results. We found that patients have experienced 1.) \"shame\", and following that, and from the phenomenological consideration of the experience of \"shame\", we have observed 2.) \"alienation\" occurring in each patients, leading to \"isolation.\" In \"isolation\", the patient is driven to despair due to existential anxiety, and as the ultimate in despair, the patient shows the attitude of 3.) \"One wishing to be oneself in despair.\" (Kierkegaard, S.), or \"haughtiness\" which is the attitude of \"a person who understands himself or herself to be a free design, and considers others as 'existence-others' reached through this design.\" (Sartre, J. P.) Here, the patient shows \"consumption\" as a symptom in either of the forms of surfeit (bulimia) or the consumption of one's own body (anorexia): wasting. 4.) These are defined as \"conspicuous consumption\" (Veblen, T. B.). 5.) Conspicuous consumption has been analyzed as a primitive form of exchange by Mauss, M., and has been mentioned repeatedly in the intellectual lineage of Bataille, G., Baudrillard, J., et al. This action is concerned with the acquisition of social status in order to save one's own face, and shows what forms the depth-psychological base stratum in the \"class system\" of human beings, as well as illuminating the \"social functions of dignity and class distribution.\" We have discovered a continuous course from the psychogenic experiences occurring at the onset and previously considered trifling and therefore ignored, proceeding to the symptoms and to the structure of the symptoms. In particular, by using a phenomenological analysis of shame and symptom structure, we show a new hypothesis about the structure of symptoms which is completely different from those created according to various previous opinions. Such understanding throws new light on this disease.",

Many moral philosophers, unfortunately, seem to agree with them, to the extent, at any rate, of taking it for granted that there is some one divison of actions into two classes, which division is of some especial or even unique significance. Actions, they have supposed, are either right or wrong. If they are right, then they must and ought to be done, and to do them is our duty. If they are wrong, then they must not and ought not to be done, and it is our duty not to do them. If we do what is right, and do this because it is right, and not just because it suits us, then we have performed a morally good action, and we deserve praise or commendation. If we have done something which is wrong, then we have performed a morally bad action, and deserveblame, and possibly punishment. Finally, a man manifests his moral goodness by performing, from a sense of duty, those actions which belong to the first class, and omitting those which belong to the second class; since there are no other ways in which actions may be classified morally, he has ample oppo tunity for exercising his talents, and the morally good man, or the conscientious man, or the dutiful man, becomes the archetype of what a man ought to be.",

Protagoras made reference to both particular virtues, such as justice, respect and temperance, and also to virtue (aretē) in general; does he see the former as parts of virtue, or are they simply different names for the same single thing? Protagoras replies that they are parts. In that case, continues Socrates, are they heterogeneous in the way that eyes, ears and nose are parts of the face, or are they homogeneous like the parts of a lump of gold? Protagoras says that they are like the parts of the face. And do different people possess different virtues, or is it the case (as the analogy would seem to suggest) that if you possess one virtue you must necessarily possess them all? No, says Protagoras, many people are courageous (andreioi) but unjust, and many again are just but not wise (329e5–6).",

In particular, it is worth to note not only terms of address and terms of reference but also terms of body concerning Artificial Intelligence Helen. She is mostly addressed by her first name (Helen) and other terms such as machine, apparatus, bag of networks, fancy tin-can telephone, distributed process, multidimentional shape, etc. Also, Artificial Intelligence Helen is a symbol of A (a twenty-two year old woman and post-graduate student) and imitating A, some terms like ‘a gifted cockatiel’ and ‘twin’ are used for Helen in terms of reference. In comparison, Rick is addressed in various ways, that is first name, surname, affectionate names and other nicknames. In addition, Artificial Intelligence Helen has no nose, mouth or fingers and only she has partially functioning eyes and ears. Thus Helen is not able to fully understand metaphorical language expressions concerning emotion. For instance, in some expressions like ‘your stomach in knots’, ‘embarrasment shrinks you’, or ‘amazement strikes you dead’. Helen could not feel the meanings and thus she has a lack of knowledge in similar linguistic circumstances. Lastly, Artificial Intelligence Helen is Imp. H. It means that Helen has been evolved from Imp. A, Imp. B, Imp. C, and so on. So the shut down of herself in the novel suggests and hints at the revival of a new version of Artificial Intelligence may be named “Galatea 3.3”.",

      "title": "On the Structure of Personality",
      "abstract": "1. In order to treat the various problems concerning personality, it may be convenient to consider that the personality consists of the three parts listed below. (cf. Fig 1).(1) Role-action: The exterior sphere of personality, which is altered in accordance with the given status-role, and not to be taken as an expression of the \"inner need-dispositions\". The significance of this conception has been emphasized by LINTON, PARSONS and others. (This term is here adopted from KLUCKHOHN and MURRAY).(2) Core-peripheral personality: The second sphere and an aggregate of specific attitudes, which vary in accordance with the given situation and object.(3) Core-nucleus personality: The central part of personality, constructed by general attitudes as the keynote of personality.2. Thus the personality of a person, as soon as he has secured a new status, changes according to the following process: at first only his role-action is successfully conformed to the given status-role, but, when repeated, this role-action is gradually internalized and becomes a specific attitude; then, when this new specific attitude is dominant and repeated, it is inwardly generalized and turns further into general attitude, which means that the core-nucl. personality undergoes a change. Thus so much time is taken for the influence of the new status-role to diffuse into the core-nucl. personality, that this central part of the mind, which was formed during childhood, remains almost unchanged through life. This fact is especially important in examining the influence of any sudden culture-change, for generally in such cases the influence is limited only to the outer two. spheres (e. g. a mode of the post-war democratization of the Japanese people).3. Concerning problems of personality-measurement, it must be noted that only a few methods can really diagnose the core-nucl. personality. It is, for example, often the case that by \"observation\" it is possible only to understand role-actions and that an \"attitude test\" can only touch the core-periph. personality, and even the result of the \"projective tests\", such as the Rorschach Test or TAT, can only reflect these two outer spheres.",

      "abstract": "Let us assume for now that we at least sometimes interpret, explain and predict one another’s behaviour by employing something like FP. We do not attribute beliefs and desires to other people in a vacuum. When we do so, we take for granted not only that the other person is already in a world but that we are both in the same world. Furthermore, it is not simply a matter of assuming the same shared context in every instance. Aspects of an interpreter’s situation will be shared with that of the interpreted to varying degrees and interpersonal understanding may be aided considerably by an appreciation of what both parties have in common. This need not take the form of an analogy between self and other, which starts with ‘I take the world to have a certain character’ and moves from this to ‘he takes the world to have the same character’. Instead, as I will show, it can take the form ‘the world has this character’ and ‘we are both in it’. In other words, an understanding that at least some aspects of a situation are shared is not assigned to others in the form of a belief system but presupposed. For example, when trying to pass a person in a busy shop, one might think ‘he wants to get to the checkout’ but one would not ordinarily think ‘he believes he is in a shop’. That we are in a shop is not a belief that each party attributes to the other. It is an appreciation of how things are that both assume each other to share in advance of attributing any mental states.",

      "abstract": "Virtuous violence theory proposes that the perpetrator intends to harm or kill in order to constitute a social relationship to make it correspond with a prescriptive model of what the relationship ought to be – what it must be made to be. For our purposes, a social relationship consists of complementarity between the actions of the participants: each participant’s actions fit previous actions by the other and presuppose “fitting” actions by the other(s), such that the actions of each are incomplete without the congruent action by the other(s). That is, the acts of each are part of a whole that none of them can bring off alone. We encompass in the terms “act” and “actions” not simply the morphology of movements, but also, crucially, the participant’s intentions, moral judgments, and motives (often consciously experienced as emotions). Furthermore, each participant implicitly or explicitly aims to induce completion of her acts: she intends to motivationally evoke and morally invoke the congruent actions that will complete or dynamically sustain the jointly constructed pattern. That is, a participant expects the other(s) to do their part, in the predictive sense, in the hopeful sense, and in the evaluative sense of judging the others’ actions according to how well they complete the intended gestalt. A football game is only football if the opposing players hit each other as hard as they can; the offense can only play offense, blocking and knocking down defenders, against a tackling defense.",

      "title": "Ambivalencia moral: ¿Qué significa engañarse a sí mismo?",
      "abstract": "En vessels of Evil, Laurence Thomas expresa que es casi inconcebible que un individuo sea e integro porque el concepto de ser totalmente malo implica que el individuo realizara sin cejar actos malvados a todas las personas que encuentre, independientemente de lazos familiares o de otros vinculos que pudieran existir. Este tipo de persona sigue cometiendo actos malvados a lo largo de toda su vida y no hay nadie con quien esta persona no actue con Con esta descripcion, no es extrano que haya muy pocas personas a las que se pueda clasificar como Ademas, es bastante improbable que a las que si se puede tildar de tales sean las unicas causantes de todo el mal que hay en el mundo, de modo que sigue siendo necesario determinar el tipo de agentes que son los causantes de que se cometan esos otros actos de maldad. Thomas dice que una persona puede tener un caracter maligno y no ser clasificada como mala si solo comete actos malvados durante ciertos periodos de su vida. En esas circunstancias los rasgos de maldad puedensurgir de repente en el caracter de una persona durante una fase particular y despues desaparecen en una fase posterior. La aparicion y desaparicion de esos rasgos es lo que nos obliga a reevaluar los componentes morales del caracter de ese individuo, puesto que no esta claro de inmediato si hay que clasificar al individuo como moralmente bueno o malo. Por ejemplo, ?se puede decir de una persona que tiene un buen caracter moral si cometio una serie de actos malvados hace anos, pero en la actualidad participa en actos moralmente buenos? Las preguntas como esta ilustran que determinar la condicion moral del caracter moralmente ambivalente de una persona es mucho mas dificil que determinar la de un individuo maligno, puesto que la persona no esta tratando activamente de cometer el mal en todas las situaciones. De hecho, en casi todos los casos, los individuos moralmente ambivalentes ni siquiera consideran sus acciones como malas. Por ultimo, como es mas probable que se clasifique a una persona como moralmente ambivalente que como mala, tiene bastante importancia, para el proyecto de disminuir el mal, entender que un individuo puede actuar moralmente con unos e inmoralmente con otros. En consecuencia, cualquier descripcion totalizadora del mal ha de tratar de explicar no solo las acciones malas de la persona, sino tambien las de las personas calificadas de moralmente ambivalentes. Teniendo en mente la importancia de este proyecto, evaluare la idea que expone Thomas de ambivalencia moral, examinare las circunstancias en las que se puede dar y analizare si es disparatado hablar de una persona que consta tanto de un yo bueno como de uno malo. Por ultimo, sostendre que los individuos clasificados como agentes moralmente ambivalentes en realidad son individuos malvados de los que se piensa que son ambivalentes debido a una clasificacion erronea por parte del observador. Asi pues, los individuos clasificados como moralmente ambivalentes son en realidad individuos con caracteres malos que son capaces de proyectar un personaje alterno. Dada la opinion de que aquellas personas clasificadas como moralmente ambivalentes son en realidad simplemente individuos con caracteres malignos, anticipare un modelo de actualizacion para contribuir a explicar como surgen esos rasgos de maldad. Para demostrar esto ultimo, extraere pruebas de una discusion sobre la suerte moral y el papel que la comunidad moral desempena en el desarrollo del caracter de cada quien. Con estas metas en mente, vamos a abordar el analisis que hace Thomas de la ambivalencia moral.",

To this end, research in artifi-cial intelligence and human-robot interaction face two major challenges. Firstly, robots need to cope with uncertainty during interaction, especially when dealing with factors that are not fully observable and hard to infer (latent variables) such as the states representing the dynamic environment and human behavior (e.g., intents, goals, preferences). Secondly, robots need to communicate their behaviors to agents (humans and other robots in the environment) in a clear and understandable manner. Therefore, robots need to be context-aware: being able to perceive and understand their surroundings, and adapt their functionalities accordingly.",

To begin with, an example, which it seems that knowing something is not as simple and unambiguous a condition as one might imagine: A businessman is talking about his partner and friend of many years. He chooses his words carefully. With obvious reluctance, he says that it is possible that this man has been cheating him. He is silent for a moment, then he says quietly that he thinks he has known this in a way for a long time. Finally, he adds, But you don't know it until you say it out loud. Thus we learn that there are two kinds of knowing: knowing in a way and really knowing. Furthermore, the transition from one to the other occurs upon saying it out loud. The difference, other words, is not a matter of acquiring additional information, but of conscious articulation of what was already some sense known but not articulated. One might call it a process of consciousness raising. The earlier state was one which the speaker did not know (and did not want to know) what he knew; the final state was one which he realized what he knew, admitting it to his listener and to himself at the same stroke. It appears, therefore, that there is a distinction between what one feels or believes about something and what one imagines oneself to feel or believe.'

Nor does He need these signs for the human mind to be laid bare to Him. But in this way a man excites himself to pray more and to groan more humbly and more fervently. I do not know how it is that, although these motions of the body cannot come to be without a motion of the mind preceding them, when they have been made, visibly and externally, that invisible inner motion which caused them is itself strengthened. And in this manner the disposition of the heart which preceded them in order that they might be made, grows stronger because they are made. Of course if someone is constrained or even bound, so that he cannot do these things with his limbs, it does not follow that, when he is stricken with remorse, the inner man does not pray and prostrate himself before the eyes of God in his most secret chamber. (Augustine: De cura pro mortuis 5.7) One smiles and tells the expert chef how good the sauce béarnaise is, not so much to inform him about the sauce (he knows better than we do how good it is) as to assure him that we are enjoying it and that we appreciate his efforts. But when a man kneels in his pew and repeats a litany of thanksgiving it is not, it seems, that he means to be informing God of anything—not even of his thankfulness.

Autonomy in its primary sense is to be understood as the actual living of an autonomous life; autonomy in its secondary sense is to be understood as the capacity to live autonomously. To be autonomous, agents have to meet three conditions: they must possess certain mental capacities, they must have an adequate range of valuable options, and they must enjoy independence from coercion and manipulation. Autonomy should be distinguished from self‐realization, as autonomous persons may choose not to realize their capacities. Autonomy itself, in an environment that supports autonomy, is not similarly optional, as living autonomously is the only way of flourishing within an autonomy‐supporting environment.",

A group or community in which there is a well‐functioning division of cognitive‐epistemic labor can achieve levels of understanding that a single agent who relies exclusively on her own capacities would probably never achieve. However, is understanding also collective ? I.e., is understanding something that can be possessed by a group or community rather than by individuals? In this paper, I develop an account of understanding phenomena according to which understanding a phenomenon requires reasonably endorsing an adequate and intelligible epistemic mediator that accounts for this phenomenon. I then show that understanding, conceived along these lines, can be attributed to collective entities. An important result of my arguments will be that a collective entity's understanding cannot (always) be reduced to the sum of the understandings of the individuals belonging to it. This is because a collective entity can sometimes be rightfully claimed to understand a phenomenon while none of its individual members understands it.",

      "abstract": "The human language possesses features that distinguish it from other non-human languages - if this expression is correct - it determines the humanity of man. Without it society would be without spirit and man and animals would be equal in this respect. Language is a human phenomenon; because only man can place his mental activity in linguistic symbols, and accordingly, creatures other than man cannot acquire any human language in one form or another; because it is not prepared or equipped for that, it does not have the mental capacity to acquire the language, and it does not have sufficient intelligence to develop linguistic symbols through which they can formulate a language suitable for understanding, with its own connotations, and its distinctive phonological manifestations. If these animals are unable to place their mental activity in linguistic symbols, then the basis of human mental activity is the use of linguistic symbols, as he has awareness of the signs that he uses as means to achieve his purposes, and he also has a conscious intention when using them, and then he chooses from among them what he deems appropriate. For the position that it expresses. As for the animal, it does not have this perception, or this intention, because the person possesses an innate apparatus called the linguistic faculty (the linguistic ability) or what is called (the latent competence) in the mind, which makes the person ready to acquire any language that lives in its surroundings without effort. In addition to the fact that a person is able to pass on this language that he acquired to the generations that follow without intentionally or preparing, so language is acquired and inherited without effort or planning. Although researchers on the issue of the genesis of human language have not reached - with certainty - to determine how it arose, and in what form it arose, no one denies the importance of language for all of humanity; because research in language is a search in the human being himself. For this reason, God Almighty has distinguished man with language, language has distinguished him from other animals, and those who think that language is merely a means of expressing ideas, or a means of communication between man and those around him are mistaken; because language is often in response to man’s innate tendency to prove His social presence.",

      "abstract": "Along with a classical immune system, we have evolved a behavioral one that directs us away from potentially contagious individuals. Here I show, using publicly available cross-cultural data, that this adaptation is so fundamental that our first impressions of a male stranger are largely driven by the perceived health of his face. Positive (likeable, capable, intelligent, trustworthy) and negative (unfriendly, ignorant, lazy) first impressions are affected by facial health in adaptively different ways, inconsistent with a mere halo effect; they are also modulated by one's current state of health and inclination to feel disgusted by pathogens. These findings, which replicated across two countries as different as the USA and India, suggest that instinctive perceptions of badness and goodness from faces are not two sides of the same coin but reflect the (nonsymmetrical) expected costs and benefits of interaction. Apparently, pathogens run the show-and first impressions come second. Lay Summary: Our first impressions of strangers (whether they seem trustworthy, intelligent, unfriendly, or aggressive) are shaped by how healthy their faces look and by our unconscious motivation to avoid infections.

      "abstract": "People, with very few exceptions,1 are moral agents. In other words, their actions are governed by rules, explicit or implicit, which can be subjected to ethical appraisal. We may praise them for being courageous, charitable, just, sensitive, or magnanimous, or we may condemn their foolishness, envy or deviousness. We may neither praise nor blame, but wonder whether they were not fully responsible for what they did. Perhaps they were coerced or pressured or, perhaps, just did not know what they were doing. This language of moral evaluation does not only apply to adult human beings, but that is its primary and most typical use. Children may be selfish or act unfairly, but we accept that they only gradually acquire full moral responsibility for their actions. Animals, too, may be courageous or altruistic, but we may suspect a degree of anthropomorphism in extending moral language too far in their direction. The moral status of animals is a matter of debate, but no one thinks butterflies can have or lack charity or that jackdaws are dishonest. The rest of the world lies outside the moral realm altogether, except, perhaps, for our moral responsibilities towards it. Rocks and stones and trees do not have moral responsibilities.",

      "abstract": "Autonomy, self-legislating and self-determining individuality, is the foremost achievement of modernity and its despair. What looks like the essential structure of autonomy designates a movement of the will whereby if it is governed by anything other than itself alone it loses itself, it becomes heteronomous. Heteronomy refers to any determination of the will that governs it from without, where what is without, outside, other is simply what is not the will either metaphysically (essentially) or through the work of incorporation. Which is why attaining autonomy has meant either isolating the will, through doubt or conceptual refinement, from everything that could be considered, logically or actually, external to it in order that it might then be in a position to will only itself, its freedom; or, especially in political contexts, reclaiming for the will what originally belonged to or was produced by it but has become alienated or reified in opposition to it—what has become separated from it and come to rule it from without. Despite appearances to the contrary, this latter move equally requires the isolation of the will from its products, even if they are truly morally or metaphysically its, since unless there is a means of identifying the will as intrinsically my or our will, unless the will has a specifiable character and integrity apart from what it wills, then there will be nothing for its products to stand over and against, overwhelm, dominate, and control. Autonomy depends upon locating, above all through the self-reflective self-purification of sceptical doubt, some essential characterization of the will in order that its true, legitimate and rightful, scope and provenance with respect to what lies outside it can be established.",

The first form of communication between the self and external objects, is a direct consequence of internal communications that take place between internal part objects, which can be projected into external objects by means of projective-introjective identifications. Ego elements are often projected in the transference, as when patients project into the analyst unconscious beta elements together with the alpha function or thinking mind capable of containing and metabolising them. Feelings such as \"helplessness\" and \"hopelessness\" are at the centre of any form of pre-conceptual trauma, resulting from the discrepancy existing between the child's vulnerability and the parental domination. Interaction between introjected and projected correlated elements represents a reproduction of what takes place between these same parts inside the mind.",

      "abstract": "Spencer judged that his own personality was a failure. He could boast that he had created himself, but the human core was absent. His inner life seemed barren and without passion. However, he was more successful when he constructed a social environment for himself. This exterior world was more responsive than his inner one. In the outside world he could address his two basic needs: humour and love. The first of these came in the form of a playful interest in the manipulation of symbols. Typical of this was his youthful insistence on wearing caps – rather than hats – both as a matter of politics and as a joke. The second need was more urgent and required him to be creative. It stemmed from his inability to experience physical love. By implication this meant marriage and children were beyond him. He felt nothing towards women, and he feared that if he forced himself to consummate a sexual relationship he would then replicate his father's systematic cruelty towards his mother. Spencer's solution to this dilemma was to create a substitute family that would provide love without an element of risk. This surrogate also had the advantage of being less likely to expose his emotional flaws to criticism. A new family would replace the dictatorial one that had crushed his youthful attempts to rebel and gain independence. It would also relieve his immediate distress. However, such relief was not a cure, but only a palliative.",

However, it appears no less important than positive emotions, positive traits, and positive institutions. Unlike positive emotions, it is always synergetic: It brings benefits not only to the developing person, but also to other persons surrounding him or her. Unlike positive traits, it is something a person cannot reach, but rather must cultivate all the time with incessant efforts. Unlike positive institutions, it is something for which a person can take full responsibility. What Seligman calls the Nikki principle—”by identifying, amplifying, and concentrating on these strengths in people at risk we will do effective prevention” (Seligman, 2002b, p. 5)—is not so much about the strengths themselves, but rather about the process of their actualization.",

      "abstract": "What is the good for human persons? If I am trying to lead the best possible life I could lead, not the morally best life, but the life that is best for me, what exactly am I seeking? This phrasing of the question I will be pursuing may sound tendentious, so some explanation is needed. What is good for one person, we ordinarily suppose, can conflict with what is good for other persons and with what is required by morality. A prudent person seeks her own good efficiently; she selects the best available means to her good. If we call the value that a person seeks when she is being prudent “prudential value,” then an alternative rendering of the question to be addressed in this essay is “What is prudential value?” We can also say that an individual flourishes or has a life high in well-being when her life is high in prudential value. Of course, these common-sense appearances that the good for an individual, the good for other persons, and the requirements of morality often are in conflict might be deceiving. For all that I have said here, the correct theory of individual good might yield the result that sacrificing oneself for the sake of other people or for the sake of a morally worthy cause can never occur, because helping others and being moral always maximize one's own good. But this would be the surprising result of a theory, not something we should presuppose at the start of inquiry. When a friend has a baby and I express a conventional wish that the child have a good life, I mean a life that is good for the child, not a life that merely helps others or merely respects the constraints of morality. After all, a life that is altruistic and perfectly moral, we suppose, could be a life that is pure hell for the person who lives it—a succession of horrible headaches marked by no achievements or attainments of anything worthwhile and ending in agonizing death at a young age. So the question remains, what constitutes a life that is good for the person who is living it?",

In either case they belong to the first two of the three-phase sequence of mammalian pair-bonding and erotosexuality , namely, proception and acception. Proception is the phase of mutual arousal, attraction, solicitation, and courtship. Acception is the phase of mutual participation in body contact, especially contact with the sex organs. Acception may be followed by conception, the third phase, which includes pregnancy, parturition, and parenthood. There are paraphilias of displacement and paraphilias of inclusion. In a displacement paraphilia, a stimulus image that is typically a phyletic component of the erotosexual sequence of arousal and orgasm usurps the place of other components and assumes inordinate or exclusive power. For example, in frotteurism the stimulus of fondling, rubbing, and stroking a partner is displaced from being a component of a relationship with a known, or at least compliant, partner and instead is directed to a stranger in an anonymous crowd and becomes of paramount importance, in imagery",

An example might be Mark’s statement above that “he thought there were haunted things in his house.” Of course, charting children’s concepts by examining their everyday language is not simple. On the one hand, children (and adults) may use terms like think, know, or want without any conception of, or reference to, beliefs and desires. For example, they might learn to say “Know what?” to gain a listener’s attention without any deeper understanding of notions such as knowledge or knowing. Or they might say “I don’t know” in a ritualistic way, as perhaps Ross does above. On the other hand, children might understand something of beliefs and desires but never talk about them. Or they might talk about such mental states but never use conventional terms like think and want. In these ways, among others, children’s language might underestimate or overestimate their understanding.",

      "title": "[The ego--defense mechanisms and coping].",
      "abstract": "If the aims of defense and coping are considered, it can be concluded that essentially the different kinds of defense should serve to cope with reality. They intend either to inhibit the pressure of the unconscious drives and emotions or to bring them in tracks which are better to overlook. Or they tend unconsciously to reduce the demands of the surroundings and/or to make it possible to use former patterns of coping, as e.g. in regression and transference, or to reduce the cognitive and emotional reception of it, as in autism. Whereas those defense mechanisms, which preponderantly serve to deal with the drives and emotions, may lead to a better coping with the given situation, those defense mechanisms, however, which mostly serve to a reduction of the perception of the environment or to a decrease of expectations of the surroundings, are not increasing the coping capacities with a really given situation. But also when defense is rigid or excessive, which can, if a certain genetic predisposition is given, also be visible in autoimmune-processes, the coping with reality is more difficult. Thereby it is, however, to consider that a rigid defense diminishes the danger of ego-fragmentation and, especially when a psychotherapy is done, leads with the time on this way to a better coping with the outside reality and the inner possibilities. In serious terminal diseases a defense, which permits an active life, seems to have a better prognosis than a resignated acceptation of the illness, which originates in the activity of the superego. Heavy pain-syndromes in diseases which are not life-menacing can apparently be dealt with the better the more the concerned people succeed to turn the anxiety which is little related to objects in object-related fear. With that potencies of the ego are free which otherwise would have to be invested in the defense of anxieties.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Human identity is a complex process linked to the subject and his environment, both constantly evolving. Personality is developed and changed throughout lifetime, but it has a core that remains constant. Thus a person can secure his continuity; he recognizes himself and is recognized by the others as time goes by. In fact, we are all the same, even after experiencing changes and years later. The constitution of the other and the self are – from the phenomenological point of view – two components of the same process, which is the origin of the subjectivity of self and the objectivity of me. These are conditions for the identity’s construction, a continuous process that takes place throughout time. (Ballerini, 2005) Human tendency to the community emerges with priority from the above definition. That deep desire of being part of a social group interprets others as constituent of the identity of the self. (Pulcini, 2002) “Having an identity” actually means not only a set of characteristics noticed by ourselves after actions done or the “image” of us, but also to be recognized by the rest of society. (Andrea, 2004) Therefore, community turns out in the ultimate horizon that responds to an individual’s recognition need. The recognition of self by me is linked to the issue of the recognition of self through the other until mutual recognition as reciprocal act is reached. (Ricoeur, 2005) Hence, “gift” becomes an emblem of mutual recognition, highlighting the relational and inter-subjective structure of the person. The identity development goes through the mutual recognition experience and gift. (Castiglioni, 2008) Somebody who gives himself recognizes the others and simultaneously, participates in his constitution and his self-understanding.",

      "abstract": "Values are important: a person’s views of moral ways of living are significant determinants of that person’s behaviour – where some people’s moralities might not seem very “moral” to others. People in a society might agree on what is moral behaviour in some circumstances, and disagree in others. Different societies have different agreements, different moralities with different ethical ways of living; and different groups in a particular society might have different moralities with different ethical ways of living. We, from our own social perspective, might not find other moralities acceptable – be those the moralities of other societies or of other groups within our society – and there are basic questions of how we accommodate moralities not our own, or which is the “correct” morality. There are those who think they know what is right and what is wrong, and others who take a more nuanced approach, though they might prefer a certain morality/ideology. On the one hand, Adam Smith, for example, knew there was a true morality which came from God (or the Deity) and thus cultural relativism was based on an incorrect premise – “Part III, Chapter V: Of the influence and authority of the general Rules of Morality, and that they are justly regarded as the Laws of the Deity” [Smith(1759, 1790)]. In a famous/infamous article, Francis Fukuyama when discussing the natures of different types of society (fascist, communist, democratic) made the ideological difference almost one of morality, and he foresaw the ultimate dominance of the morality/ideology of “economic and political liberalism”. He argued that, when talking about changes in communist societies, commentators “sense dimly that there is some larger process at work, a process that gives coherence and order to the daily headlines.” (“The End of History?”, The National Interest, Summer 1989).

      "abstract": "Things are everywhere. They fill the world with their presence. Whereas it is possible to avoid the Other (person), to reject the encounter, to be solipsistic without condescension; to exempt oneself from an encounter-any encounter-with things is to die. Sensibility, having a body, is to be exposed to things. The body is the exposure. Yet, there are no things for Levinas. He encounters them within the economy of the Same, within a movement (of labor, of enjoyment) that takes its bearings from the Same and returns to the Same. Or he encounters them as gifts (TI 77), as the offer that the Same makes to the Other to welcome her/him, to cover her/his nakedness, and to enact the ethical relationship. It is the Other, however, who constitutes the principle of the donation, not the things themselves.2 In other words, things are for the Same, or for the Other, but not for themselves. That is, for Levinas there is no Otherness of things.3 Conversely, there are things in Heidegger. For him, things are the place where the gathering of the Fourfold-the mortals, the gods, the earth, the sky-comes to pass.4 But the intimacy of things and Fourfold is not fusion, it is dif-fering. Each thing remains other in hosting the Fourfold in its peculiar way: other than the Fourfold and other than any other thing; other than the mortals, who can dwell by things in their thinging only if they can take care of things as things, if they can let them be in their otherness. The purpose of this essay is to lay the theoretical foundations for an approach to things that does not ignore their Otherness. According to Heidegger, the enactment of this respectful relation encrypts the path human beings must follow to be faithful to their destination as mortals. Sharing Heidegger's conviction, this essay claims that in face of their relation with things, human beings determine the authenticity of their mortality, that is, of their being human. According to Levinas's suggestion, the place-which is not a place-where a relation with the Other can be achieved is ethics. Undoubtedly there is ethics in Levinas, even if his notion of ethics extends only to the other person (certainly the other man, hopefully, also the other woman and child).5 Conversely, there is no ethics in Heidegger, at least according to the most common reading. If the two thinkers are forced faceto-face in a confrontation that neither of them would advocate enthusiastically, the result is a chiasmatic structure,6 whose branches connect a double negation-non-ethics and nonthings-and a double affirmation-ethics and things. Since Socrates, philosophy has walked the path of negation. If there is ethics, it is not of things; and if there are things, they are not ethical. The path of affirmation is a narrow strip, which has seldom been explored.7 It leads to an ethics of things, where ethics cannot be traditional ethics in any of its formulations (utilitarian, deontological, virtue-oriented), and things cannot be traditional things (objects opposed to a subject). At the intersection between ethics and things, Levinas and Heidegger meet. The former offers the notion of a non-traditional ethics, the latter of non-traditional things. Some remarks are in order with respect to the modality of the meeting. Despite the common rootedness in Husserl's phenomenology, their encounter is not that of two Aristotelian friends; nor is the one the forerunner of the other; nor is the one in absolute opposition to the other. Levinas and Heidegger do not complement each other, either existentially or historically or philosophically (opposition being only the counterpart to complementation). They stand on their own as two separate, autonomous philosophical figures, one of whom, for chronological reasons, can exercise a sharp criticism of the other, which would be reciprocated, if chronology were to allow it. Their relation, escaping friendship, enmity, complementarity, is better characterized by the Derridian notion of supplement. …",

Such possible beings would deserve moral consideration similar to that of human beings. Our duties to them would not be appreciably reduced by the fact that they are non-human, nor by the fact that they owe their existence to us. Indeed, if they owe their existence to us, we would likely have additional moral obligations to them that we don’t ordinarily owe to human strangers – obligations similar to those of parent to child or god to creature. Given our moral obligations to such AIs, two principles for ethical AI design recommend themselves: (1) design AIs that tend to provoke reactions from users that accurately reflect the AIs’ real moral status, and (2) avoid designing AIs whose moral status is unclear. Since human moral intuition and moral theory evolved and developed in contexts without AI, those intuitions and theories might break down or become destabilized when confronted with the wide range of weird minds that AI design might make possible.

If their power reached the top, they fly under the path of everyday life until they become conventional expressions, that have no connection with the primeval experience; their meanings are growing narrow and their deep essences are disappearing; other symbols change them. When their time arrives again they come to the surface and begin to flourish. Texts that have some symbolic meaning ( literary works, poems, myths, tales, the Holy Scriptures, the texts of intellectual trends ) can be explained in more than one level. In this sense it means the three levels of interpretation. However, the fact, how one explain a text cannot refer to any qualifications, judgements. These levels exist because of the different demands on searching for the essence. 1. The level of historical interpretation: It has an analogical connection with the material, physical approach. 2.The level of mythological interpretation: It has an analogical connection with the level of unconsciousness and partly collective unconsciousness. 3.The level of intellectual, mental interpretation: It has an analogical connection with human and archetypal contents of men. The examination leads us to the final reality and truth through the symbols.",

Fortune being essentially changing, unpredictable, it would be erroneous to found one's life on it, but it must be taken into account: one should reduce its possibilities, and learn to handle its favours and blows. One can best limit its effects by avoiding mortal sin, developing activity-related virtues (fortitudo, iustitita), and handling consciously its interference with one's life: not overestimating its favours, and developing our virtues in connection with moderation and constancy (prudentia, temperantia, patientia). If one can, to some extent, handle fortune, one can become more independent, can significantly influence one's own destiny: instead of forfeiting happiness in the afterlife, one can live a life in harmony with that.",

The phenomenon of bilocation, for instance, has been widely mentioned in different philosophical and religious systems such as Shamanism, Christian mysticism, Hinduism, Paganism and others as the ability that some individuals (often saints, monks or mystics) would have of being in two, or more, places at the same time. The advent of the Internet, new technologies and social networks has opened up new and unexpected possibilities in this respect, enabling one to expand oneself. If not long ago, these experiences had to be ‘lived’ through cinema and literature; today, it is possible to undergo them in first person: everyone is allowed to create other selves, other profiles, avatars, entities or doppelgängers that can operate in the world (remotely) as extensions of him or her. Consequently, the image has also undergone a change in function and status, opening new possibilities through its digitalization.

      "abstract": "Peripersonal space (PPS) is a spatial representation that codes objects close to one's own and to someone else's body in a multisensory-motor frame of reference to support appropriate motor behavior. Recent theories framed PPS beyond its original sensorimotor aspects and proposed to relate it to social aspects of the self. Here, we manipulated the ownership status of an object (\"whose object this is\") to test the sensitivity of PPS to such a pervasive aspect of society. To this aim, we assessed PPS through a well-established visuo-tactile task within a novel situation where we had dyads of participants either grasping or observing to grasp an object, whose ownership was experimentally assigned to either participant (individual ownership), or to both participants (shared ownership). When ownership was assigned exclusively (\"this belongs to you/the other,\" Experiment 1), the PPS recruitment emerged when grasping one's own object (I grasp my object), as well as when observing others grasping their own object (you grasp your object). Instead, no PPS effect was found when grasping (and observing to grasp) an object that was not one's own (I grasp yours, you grasp mine). When ownership was equally assigned (\"this belongs to both of you,\" Experiment 2), a similar PPS recruitment emerged and, again, both when the action toward the shared object was executed and merely observed. These findings reveal that ownership is critical in shaping relatively low-level aspects of body-object interactions during everyday simple actions, highlighting the deep mark of ownership over social behavior.

In both cases, the presumption can be defeated, as we learn more and get into specifics. We still might insist that to be genuinely virtuous is to be able to pass the more familiar sorts of tests of virtue, and to be reliably virtuous also in the ordinary business of life, especially in things that really matter. Something like this is a necessary condition for virtue. Factors of motivation, especially those related to what a person's basic concerns are, can vary enormously. Imagine an extreme case. Someone might be inherently indifferent to what happens to other people, and have no sense of the inherent dignity or worthiness of moral principles, but also be totally convinced that God is watching his or her every move, and that the prospects of heaven or hell depend heavily on one's following accepted morality at every step.",

      "abstract": "Abstract This chapter develops the language of rector, actor, and other, and of \"persons with projects\" to work toward a new theory of power. It does so in dialogue with pragmatist theories of action and the theories of Orlando Patterson, Rene Girard, James Coleman, Judith Butler, and G.W.F. Hegel. In hierarchical relations, a figure is elevated to a superior position with enhanced capacity, and to such a figure discretion accrues. This is the person or group who rules, and rule enables the accomplishment of projects. Such mastery—which accrues to rectors—is dependent upon allies and subordinates (actors, who become agents) to whom tasks are delegated and from whom knowledge and expertise are gained, advice is taken, profits are stolen, and value is extracted. Power is dependent on its dependents, and an agent both stands in for, and works on behalf of, the rector. Actor becomes an agent by abdicating, in part, actor's own projects. If actor is an ally to rector, other stands outside the project, profaned. The radical uncertainty that other represents to rector and actor can become an synecdoche for the uncertainty of the world itself. There are four types of extreme alterity: enemy in war, slavery, invisibility, and scapegoat.",

      "abstract": "The concept of conscience is not an unambiguous term and is not infrequently exposed to the danger of reducing its characteristic depth. This danger appears especially where it is understood above all, or, in extreme cases, merely as man’s ability or his specific power involving pronouncing judgements on particular deeds or attitudes, in terms of moral good or evil, passing over, and sometimes even forgetting about what makes it capable, as well as the space in which this distinctive process takes place, thus constitutively belonging to the nature of this specific human reality. An opposed view of understanding of conscience as a judgement, the existentially experienced conscience perceived as distinctive spiritual space marked with the sense of humanness appears – with a privileged place for meetings and growth. Meetings with oneself, with another man and with God, as well as growing in freedom and love, towards complete humanness. What best characterises it is the experience and understanding that authentic self-fulfilment as a person – open with the Absolute, as well as with the whole reality – means our welfare and obligates. The emerging responsibility for oneself calls on to search for forms and ways, not just any, but harmonious with the discovered sense of one’s own existence, in order to accomplish this moral good. Whereas, the gradually emerging horizon of sense, constitutively contributing to man’s moral awareness, not only lightens self-understanding, but also makes us capable of appropriate grasping of the deepest essence of good or evil of our particular decisions. In this way, conscience becomes „the light”, „the guide” and „the judge” of our being, our self-fulfilment in freedom. Many a thing indicate that moral awareness and ability to pronounce specific judgements, though diverse in terms of proprium typical of each of them, indeed constitute one, dynamic and indivisible entity. Breaking it inevitably leads to limiting, and sometimes even distortion of one’s own humanness.",

Few textbooks even index the term. To help remedy this odd neglect, the author postulated the protective motive as a biologically given “thrust to wholeness,” modified by experience and dependent on social support. Utilizing mechanisms of homeostasis, defense, prevention, healing, and “outreach” (i.e., wholeness expressed), the motive disposes the individual to maintain and express the functional integrity of body and self (including “all that is mine”). Seemingly unrelated phenomena (e.g., immune response, quest for immortality, forgiveness, sharing, urge to procreate) are thus afforded common explanation. Prospectively, the thrust to wholeness affords conceptual unity, parsimony, and pedagogical utility. Also, it may furnish a conceptual anchor for well-being and its paradoxes, self-defeat and suicide.",

      "abstract": "A he outstanding feature of a man's life in the modern world is his conviction that his life-world as a whole is neither fully understood by himself nor fully understandable to any of his fellowmen. There is a stock of knowledge theoretically available to everyone, built up by practical experience, science, and technology as warranted insights. But this stock of knowledge is not integrated. It consists of a mere juxtaposition of more or less coherent systems of knowledge which themselves are neither coherent nor even compatible with one another. On the contrary, the abysses between the various attitudes involved in the approach to the specialized systems are themselves a condition of the success of the specialized inquiry. If this is true for the various fields of scientific inquiry it is for even better reasons valid for the various fields of practical activity. Where our practical interests predominate we are satisfied with our knowledge that certain means and procedures achieve certain desired or undesired results. The fact that we do not understand the Why and the How of their working and that we do not know anything of their origin does not hinder us from dealing undisturbed with situations, things, and persons. We use the most complicated gadgets prepared by a very advanced technology without knowing how the contrivances work. No car driver is supposed to be familiar with the laws of mechanics, no radio listener with those of electronics. One may even be a successful businessman without an insight into the functioning of the market, or a banker without a smattering of monetary theory.

      "abstract": "Abstract What is strange? Or better, who is strange? When do we encounter the strange? We encounter strangers when we are not at home — when we are in a foreign land or a foreign part of our own land. From Freud to Lacan to Kristeva to Heidegger, the feeling of strangeness — das Unheimlichkeit — has marked our encounter with the other, even the other within our self. Most philosophical attempts to understand the role of the Stranger, human or transcendent, have been limited to standard epistemological problems of other minds, metaphysical substances, body/soul dualism and related issues of consciousness and cognition. This volume endeavors to take the question of hosting the Stranger to the deeper level of embodied imagination and the senses. It plays host to a number of encounters with the strange. It asks such questions as: How does the embodied imagination relate to the Stranger in terms of hospitality or hostility? How do we distinguish between projections of fear or fascination, leading to either violence or welcome? How do humans sense the dimension of the strange and alien in different religions, arts, and cultures? How do the five physical senses relate to the spiritual senses, especially the famous sixth sense, as portals to an encounter with the Other? Is there a carnal perception of alterity, which would operate at an affective, pre-reflective, preconscious level? What exactly do embodied imaginaries of hospitality and hostility entail, and how do they operate in language, psychology, and social interrelations? What are the topical implications of these questions for ethics and practice of tolerance and peace?",

On the one hand, this act might not be done for its own sake, but may fit into some ongoing long-term behavioral pattern that is personally beneficial to the person crossing the street—such as regularly buying groceries in the supermarket (which happens to be across the street). On the other hand, crossing the street might be done simply for its own sake. If such an act were considered to be autonomous, regardless of its temporal context, its autonomy would be unconditional .

      "abstract": "Anonymous authorship can be defined as encompassing any publication that appears without the author's name printed either on the title page or in any other paratext such as a preface or dedication. Pseudonymous authorship, it follows, is a form of anonymity; the author's name is concealed, while a false name is presented to the public. Anonymity, in this definition, is constituted formally by the absence of a name, or the presence of a false name, in the medium of publication. Friends, family, colleagues, editors, and publishers, naturally, are frequently aware of the identity of an anonymous author (but they are also frequently kept in the dark). The anonymity of a publication, as I define it, is not affected by whether a few people are in on the secret, or whether the identity of the author is in fact an open secret to many. For example, consider a first edition that has been published anonymously while the second edition has been signed; the author is now known, but the first edition continues to be an anonymous publication.",

This condition is unfair and not ideal because man, other animals, plants, and other human manipulations (AI) from nature constitute varying levels of being; therefore, they possess varying levels of rights. Hence there is need to espouse the nature/levels of being, on the one hand, and to adumbrate the nature/types of rights and as related to being as such—which is the imperative of this article. Dwelling on the cornucopia of literature/and common biological (and other) features in nature as basis for analysis, this article, first, seeks to establish that man, other animals, plants, and other human manipulations from nature constitute varying levels of being; and second, argues that each level of being as such possesses some rights associated with it. It argues further that either all beings have rights, or they don’t. The work concludes that if one accepts that all the levels of being possess rights (accordingly including plant, cloned and AI agents), then one has certain obligation to all levels of being; but accepting either poses the most existential and ontological threat to humanity and all of nature.",

      "title": "Synchrony and sympathy: Social entrainment with music compared to a metronome.",
      "abstract": "We synchronize movements with other individuals in our everyday life (e.g., when shaking hands), in sports (e.g., rowing), or on dancefloors. Especially this last kind of social entrainment can lead to states of pleasure and ecstasy. In some situations, we even unintentionally mirror another person's gestures or movements, for example, when we are walking with another person and the phase of our steps becomes aligned with the other person's steps. Depending on the relationship we have with this person, such a situation can be awkward or pleasant. All of these examples show that movement synchronization and social bonding are tightly linked. In the current study, we examined affiliation and pro-social behavior following a synchronous or asynchronous interpersonal tapping task with music or a metronome.Interpersonal Coordination and MusicInterpersonal coordination-be it behavior matching, such as mimicry, or interactional synchrony, such as simultaneous rhythmic movements (Bernieri & Rosenthal, 1991)-is a fundamental way to form socioemotional connections. Behavioral mimicry describes the mirroring of another person's gestures, postures, or other movements (e.g., speech gestures, foot shaking; for a review, see Chartrand & Lakin, 2013). Factors that increase the tendency to mimic the behavior of another person include pro-social attitudes (Leighton, Bird, Orsini, & Heyes, 2010), being in a good mood (Likowski et al., 2011), and the likability (Stel et al., 2010) or the goal to get along with this person (Lakin & Chartrand, 2003). In turn, being mimicked can positively affect feelings of liking toward the mimicker (Chartrand & Bargh, 1999), feelings of interpersonal closeness (Ashton-James, van Baaren, Chartrand, Decety, & Karremans, 2007), and pro-social behavior in adults (van Baaren, Holland, Kawakami, & van Knippenberg, 2004) and infants (Carpenter, Uebel, & Tomasello, 2013).In contrast to behavioral mimicry that usually includes a time lag of a few seconds, interactional synchrony describes movements that are temporally matched. The social entrainment model of McGrath and Kelly (1986, as cited in Clayton, Sager, & Will, 2004, p. 10) makes the assumption that many human behaviors are oscillatory or rhythmical. The model proposes that the oscillations or rhythms are created endogenously, that the endogenous oscillations or rhythms can become aligned in phase and frequency within an individual and between individuals, and that the temporal patterns of an individual or a group of individuals can become entrained to an external timekeeper. A variety of research suggests that the interpersonal synchronization of movements, such as walking, pendulum-swinging, chair-rocking, body-swaying, or finger-tapping, promotes affiliation and pro-social orientation (Demos, Chaffin, Begosh, Daniels, & Marsh, 2012; Hove & Risen, 2009; Marsh, Richardson, & Schmidt, 2009; Reddish, Fischer, & Bulbulia, 2013; Valdesolo & Desteno, 2011; Wiltermuth & Heath, 2009). By using a moving visual timekeeper, Hove and Risen (2009) showed that the degree of synchrony between the participants' and the experimenters' finger-taps was positively related to how much participants liked the experimenter. Such effects may even be stronger when moving together while listening to music: When rocking in a chair with a partner, the degree of synchronization with music is positively correlated with the feeling of interpersonal connectedness (Demos et al., 2012).Listening to music has a strong emotional component and, similarly to social bonding, engages the endogenous opioid system (Tarr, Launay, & Dunbar, 2014). Related to this, Tarr, Launay, and Dunbar (2016) showed that pain thresholds increased after synchronously dancing (i.e., identical movements while listening to the same music) in groups of four. The authors link this effect to the release of endorphins. In contrast, partial synchrony (i. …",

      "abstract": "HE insane have often been spoken of as children.To generalize broadly, one might say that if we except simple states of emotional exaltation or depression, very many of the remaining psychoses tend to lead their victims in one of two directions: either toward the pleasure state of the child or of the superman or god.This tendency corresponds with racial dreams.Mankind has always striven to escape from the ills of the present either by progress, actual or imagined, to greater knowledge and power (well exemplified by the philosophies of H. G. Wells, Nietzsche, Max Sterner and others) or by attempting, through discarding the\" complications of civilization, a return to a child-like or Edenic state.This striving is in fact an important element in Christianity,-\"Except ye become as little children ye cannot enter into the kingdom of Heaven.\".Our heavens are always far beyond us or far behind us.Assuming, then, the presence of this 'flight from reality,' •which we know to be such a prominent feature (one might say an essential feature) in many psychoses and psychoneuroses, it is obvious that it may be a forward striving or a backward or a mixture of the two.If forward, the delusional formations tend to take on a grandiose character.Last year I reported a case in the Psychoanalytic Review (\"A Manic-depressive Episode Presenting a Frank Wish-Realization Construction,\" The Psychoanalytic Review, April 1915, Vol.II, No. 2) of an unmarried woman, aged fifty-five, who, after the death of her mother with",

      "abstract": "Rameau's nephew, it seems, is a bit of a cipher: by turns foolish and sagacious, dissolute and upstanding, beggarly and magisterial. Diderot (1966: 58) would have us question the nephew's sanity; radical personal inconsistency seems to signal a breakdown of mental health. Yet it's not crazy to think that someone could be courageous in physical but not moral extremity, or be moderate with food but not sex, or be honest with spouses but not with taxes. If we take such thoughts seriously, we'll qualify our attributions: “physical courage” or “moral courage,” instead of “courage,” and so on. Would things were so simple. With a bit of effort, we can imagine someone showing physical courage on the battlefield, but cowering in the face of storms, heights, or wild animals. Here we go again: “battlefield physical courage,” “storms physical courage,” “heights physical courage,” and “wild animals physical courage.” Things can get still trickier: Someone might exhibit battlefield courage in the face of rifle fire but not in the face of artillery fire (Miller 2000: 54—9). If we didn't grow sick of it, we could play this little game all day. Such sport is more than simpleminded diversion, however; it is the beginning of an empirically adequate alternative to globalism. But I've not yet fully established the need for such an alternative: There are defensible interpretations of the data more friendly to globalist conceptions of character than is mine. Nevertheless, I’d like to think I’ve come by my views honestly; comparing the going alternatives, I now try to show, gives us good reason to favor my way of doing things.",

We conclude that there are no traits present in humans and absent in other animals that in isolation explain our species' superior cognitive performance; rather, there are many cognitive domains in which humans possess unusually potent capabilities compared to those found in other species. Humans are flexible cognitive all-rounders, whose proficiency arises through interactions and reinforcement between cognitive domains at multiple scales.",

      "abstract": "Based on the theories (of personality traits’, situational, followers’, psychological) related to the emergence of political leadership, on the basis of comparative and qualitative methods, the characteristics of political leadership have been studied in the post-Soviet era. A leader uses the situation, relies upon the followers, and, in most cases, the great leaders awarded with charisma are characterized by a whole range of psychological features, but in all cases the determining role is played by the qualities of a leader, the majority of which are inherited. In our opinion, the argument provided by researchers that regular mortals may be gifted with the traits of a leader, is not convincing in disproving “the theory of traits ” due to two reasons: first, a leader is a human being, a social creature (human is a political being and separately, as a self-sufficient entity, it is either a beast or a god – Aristotle) and naturally they possess human features; second, a leader has to be characterized by a high degree (dosage) of distinguishing attributes and, most importantly, they are the main force in the process of striving towards the governance and all the other actions subordinate to them. This judgement is concerning the great leaders distinguished in the history of humankind, the actions of whom have changed the vector of the history development, and there are no leaders with such skills and capacity on the post-Soviet political stage yet. The hypothesis of the topic to be researched is as follows: the traits of leadership in the political arena of post-Soviet countries are determined by the dominance of the subject political culture, heavy social-economic background, the specifics of a national-psychological and mental development of a given nation, foreign policy orientations. Each of the above-mentioned variables influence the process of selecting leaders in different degrees (for example: in the reality of Georgia the foreign policy orientation is a significant condition to the position of a leader in the government, because the key of country’s independence lies outside the country and the inclination towards “looking up to the foreign/a foreigner” is relevant to Georgian mentality and the mindset of electorate, while in Russia a leader is mainly characterized and inspired by the Russian geo-political interests, orthodox-messiah ideas and mainly has to support the national idea consolidating the “Great Russian chauvinism” and Russian “Sovereign Democracy”, but in all settings the determining factor is the excessiveness of the subordinate political orientations (except for the Baltic countries) in the presence of which, according to Almond and Verba’s concept of political culture, the majority of citizens expect the desirable actions from the leader – the savior of the country and the state; all of this, in the environment of poor economic development and weak institutions, consequently leads to excessive number of populist, authoritative leaders in national governments.",

      "title": "Dehumanization and mental health",
      "abstract": "Dehumanization is a fearsome word, calling to mind the gravest atrocities of the past and present. People seen as less than human have suffered and suffer violence, deprivation, exclusion and dispossession, and that suffering has been and is routinely ignored or minimized. However, although dehumanization is usually understood as an extreme phenomenon confined to wars, genocides and conquests, it falls on a spectrum. Two decades of social psychological research have shown that it has significant repercussions in everyday life1. The burgeoning literature on dehumanization offers three key insights. First, dehumanization ranges from blatant and verbalized to subtle and unconscious: people can be explicitly likened to animals, but also implicitly denied fundamental human qualities such as rationality, self-control and complex emotions. Second, dehumanization takes varied forms, from seeing others as bestial or robotic, to rejecting their individuality or agency, to failing to spontaneously grant them minds. Third, although dehumanization often accompanies negative views of others, it is psychologically and even neurally distinct from prejudice. Seeing people as less than fully human is not the same as disliking them. We can dehumanize those about whom we are indifferent, not only those we hate. Indeed, studies of close relationships show that we can subtly dehumanize those we love. The vast literature on stigma reveals how people with mental illness are often viewed negatively by the general public, pictured as dangerous, blameworthy and shameful, with adverse implications for equity, well-being and recovery. It has recently become clear that, in addition to these negative perceptions, they are often also denied humanity. People are seen as less human when they receive mental rather than physical illness labels, and people with mental illnesses – especially schizophrenia and addictions – are even more blatantly dehumanized than some vilified ethnic or religious minorities2. Dehumanizing attitudes to the mentally ill are not confined to the public, but can also be held by mental health professionals. Researchers have begun to document the causes and consequences of these attitudes. One contributing factor is emotional self-preservation: professionals may dehumanize patients as a way to protect themselves against emotional exhaustion and distress3. The anticipation of emotional demands may motivate professionals to deny humanity to others and result in the withholding of empathy and care. Studies like these shine a new light on burnout, one of whose primary manifestations is the loss of empathy for others. In clinical settings, this dehumanization-like tendency may lead professionals to disengage from patients, failing to appreciate their emotional experience and reducing them to their diagnosis. Adverse working conditions that foster burnout, such as excessive workloads and organizations that treat employees as interchangeable cogs in an industrial machine, can lead mental health professionals to dehumanize patients, with the adverse effects on clinical care that burnout researchers have documented. One study found that psychiatric nurses who felt unsupported by their organizational superiors were more likely to experience burnout and depression as well as to dehumanize their patients (e.g., showing a greater willingness to bypass their consent)4. People who seek mental health treatment need not be denied humanity on the basis of their illness to suffer the impacts of dehumanization. Dehumanizing perceptions of racial minorities might contribute to racial disparities in mental health diagnosis and treatment, such as significantly elevated rates of chemical sedation in African American patients presenting to emergency departments with psychiatric disorders5, just as race-based dehumanization contributes to harsh discipline in criminal justice and educational settings. People who believe they are being denied humanity by others typically respond negatively. Just as believing that one is dehumanized based on one's race or political views has been shown to generate antagonistic reactions, so patients' engagement with psychiatric treatment may be undermined by experiences of dehumanization from demeaning media representations, dismissive interactions with professionals, and deindividuating encounters with the health care bureaucracy6. Dehumanizing perceptions can also be internalized rather than resisted. People who believe that others see them as less than human may come to \"self-dehumanize\". This phenomenon may have significant clinical implications. A study of patients with severe alcohol use disorders found that those who self-dehumanized more had lower self-esteem and engaged in less functional coping7. Research such as this indicates how dehumanization can create vicious cycles that compromise therapeutic aims. Being dehumanized can lead to feeling dehumanized, which can sabotage treatment. Being perceived as less than human may exacerbate an existing mental illness, but dehumanization might also be a risk factor for developing it. Indeed, studies point to adverse effects of dehumanization which are known psychiatric vulnerability factors. Being perceived as less than human increases people's feelings of social exclusion and also decreases others' willingness to help and show empathy1. The resulting social disconnection may amplify risk especially for internalizing and substance use disorders. In addition to reducing social connection, dehumanization increases tendencies to actively harm people and to tolerate harm perpetrated by others. People with stronger tendencies to dehumanize others are more likely to engage in bullying; men who dehumanize women are more prone to sexual violence and harassment; and people who dehumanize their opponents in ethnic conflicts are more likely to support violent actions towards them1. Exposure to violence is a significant psychiatric risk factor, and dehumanization fosters it. At a more systemic level, dehumanization based on race, social class, and immigrant status may reinforce the public acceptance of social disadvantage and economic hardship, known contributors to mental health inequities. The concept of dehumanization has proven to be a fruitful one for thinking about many forms of interpersonal and intergroup conflict. It complements more familiar constructs such as prejudice, stigma, stereotyping and discrimination by focusing on whether we perceive and treat others in ways that recognize our common humanity. Failures to do so have now been demonstrated in perceptions of diverse social groups, and their destructive implications are increasingly well understood. Research on dehumanization in the psychiatric realm is in its infancy, but strongly suggests that failures to fully humanize people with mental illness are widespread and have significant consequences. How dehumanization related to mental illness should be addressed is not a straightforward issue. At a population level, a cultural change is required for public perceptions of mental illness to become more humanizing. The promotion of dimensional models may lead people with mental illness to be seen as less drastically \"other\". Some aspects of dehumanizing media representations of mental illness have measurably declined in recent decades8. It is equally important to lessen dehumanization in clinical practice9. Dehumanization can be reduced by enhancing empathy in professionals, through selection and training, while recognizing that empathy and problem-solving can sometimes be in conflict, and by promoting face-to-face contact between professionals and patients despite the growing intrusion of medical technologies. Dehumanization can also be diminished by ensuring that patients and professionals are presented as individuals with uniquely identifying attributes, boosting patients' sense of agency by increasing their say over treatment, and attenuating the real and perceived dissimilarity between patients and professionals. The goal of humanizing care, within and beyond the mental health field, should be widely recognized and shared, and concrete strategies to address this goal should be identified and implemented.

      "title": "DEVELOPMENTAL TRENDS IN THE ABSTRACTION ABILITY OF CHILDREN1",
      "abstract": "ion is mental process in which some attribute or characteristic is observed independently of other characteristics of an experience as a whole. Werner (26) emphasizes that the ability to abstract does not appear suddenly in the course of the individual's development; rather it is present from the very beginnings of life but changes qualitatively with progress in maturation. Different organizational patterns of response to environmental stimuli are observed in children of varying age levels (26). The abstraction behavior of very young children seems to be primarily on a sensori-motor level and can be designated as perceptual. In such a response the individual yields to demands of the situation, and the organization of the material is determined by the nature of the stimuli as well as by the limited maturity of the subject. A more mature individual would be expected to consciously impose organi- zation on the material (i, 7, 14, 17, 19, 26) and classify the material into deliberately conceived categories. This is the conceptual level of abstraction. The hypothesis that the younger the child, the more perceptual are his organizations has been stated (i, 7, 14, 26) but a search for specific details of the development encounters a paucity of data. The present study was undertaken to obtain information regarding changes in abstraction abil- ity during the elementary school period.",

      "abstract": "The modern philosophical doctrine usually termed “human exceptionalism,” which holds that human beings, because of their perceived intellectual superiority over other animal species, have a moral value that cannot be claimed by other species which entitles humans to use other animals to serve their needs, has its philosophical roots in Greek philosophy, especially in the works of Aristotle and in the Stoic doctrine of oikeiōsis, which holds that human beings share a kinship with other humans but not with other species of inferior intellectual endowments. The doctrine of “human exceptionalism” is used in the twenty-first century to justify the wholesale slaughter worldwide of non-human animals for food, clothing, medical and entertainment purposes. The claims of “human exceptionalism” are countered in the present day by animal rights philosophers and by animal welfarists of various types who argue either that non-human species have a sufficient degree of reason to entitle them to inclusion in the sphere of human moral concern, or that the possession of reason is itself an irrelevant criterion for moral consideration, and that animal suffering must be taken into account in human interactions with other animal species.",

A large part, at any rate, of the badness of bad men seems to consist in their lack of real concern for other people, and a large part of the goodness of good men consists in the regard they have for their fellows. Could a man who never felt with of for another be regarded as good, or even as a moral being at all ? We should be inclined to say that this was impossible were it not that some philosophers appear to maintain that reason is the fundamental moral requirement and that unsympathetic beings might act rightly from some purely rational principle. Kant, for example, in a well-known passage, contrasts the man who helps others because he is sympathetically inclined towards them with the man who is too unhappy to feel with them but nevertheless helps them because he thinks he ought to. It is the second of these men, in his view, whose action is most clearly moral. In reply to this we may say that although a man's personal griefs at a particular time may render him at that time unable to feel with others even though he helps them as he ought, nevertheless he could not have performed such an act of heroic beneficence if his heart had never warmed towards anybody.",

If so, we fail to see why we cannot accept that animals (at least some species) also can be happy, sad, etc. Therefore, if it is a fallacy to attribute human characteristics to other animals, it must also be fallacious to claim that because we do, they don’t, because we can, they can’t.

      "title": "Individualism and Personalism",
      "abstract": "The nature of the self is qualified in varying ways in philosophy but, as we shall see in detail, one thing is constant: the self is the object of a subjective reflexivity or self-involvement. By this inner folding, a person maintains not only a relationship with himself, but also ascribes a reality value to what he relates to. The self is seen, for example, as the genuine deeper reality of the ego, as that which underlies every relation to the external world. Or just the opposite: it is nothing but a part of that external world, I relate to that self as to a thing in the world. Some thinkers even doubt the existence of such a self: for them, the belief in something like a self is created by certain peculiarities of language. For instance, to what does ‘self’ refer in a statement like “I wasn’t myself”, “I will help myself”, “I should give myself some rest”, etc? I will discuss two opposed conceptions of the nature of the self and indicate the shortcomings of each approach, in order to go on to show something about self-involvement and singularity that is often overlooked. The two opposed conceptions deal with the self in different ways because they also deal differently with the relation between consciousness and the self as such. In the first conception, this relation remains external: reflection is not of the same order as the self and, conversely, the self is something that always falls outside of reflection, something against which a position can be occupied and a (critical) distance taken. Here, the self is an object whose nature does not in the least affect the nature of reflection. To the contrary, the ego must explicitly identify with that object if there is to be any trace of a connection with it at all. I will refer to this position as that of individualism. The second conception sees the self and reflection as forming an organic unity preceding any conscious identifications. They are both fused into an organic totality in such a manner that any reflection becomes an expression of the self and is affected by it. There already exists, between the self and reflection, a preobjective relationship by virtue of which the self can never be considered as an object of identification. It is not an object: I have a link with myself that is more intimate, not the result of an identification but of an intuition, a feeling or a creativity. This is the personalistic conception of the self. The self and reflection share one and the same nature, and the relation between them is internal. I am always already myself without needing to identify with a self, and without needing to take a position with respect to a self. Moreover, I can never take the same position with respect to the self as I would take with respect to an object. If I did, I would have misconceived the authentic reality of that self, or of my ‘person’ and the intimate relationship that I maintain with it. What is original in the individualistic conception appears, from a personalistic viewpoint, to be only derived and inauthentic. Individualism confuses the deeper self (le moi profond) with a social marionette (le moi social). Personalism, as we shall see, also developed in reaction to an individualistic (Bergson would say: mechanistic) conception of the person. In this article, I will draw a distinction between the two approaches on the basis of their differing descriptions of the problem of freedom.",

It demonstrates the epistemological inferiority, even uselessness, of the psychologists' approach. Anxiety and fear belong to so-called general feelings (<i>Gemeingefühle</i>). Fear is an atavistic emotional heritage serving protective purposes against a threatening event, impending danger, or risky performance. This psychological emotion is a cortical function with repercussion on the diencephalic autonomic nervous system. Alteration of respiration, pulse rate, or blood pressure; blushing or pallor; inhibition of salivary secretion; or weeping are witness thereof. Anxiety is fear without extrinsic cause, without a substratum, not fear of something. It is an autonomous feeling aroused by intrinsic cortical processes, conscious or subconscious memories and associations originating from past experiences and life situations. It is a pathological outlet of mental processes involved",

This applies not only to their acquisition of technical and intellectual accomplishments, but to their character as well. Emotions or affections (pathē) play an important role in that development; they have an interesting ‘passive-cum-active’ character. Although their experience is not determined by choice, it is due to understanding and evaluating the particular situation. Reasoning is therefore in a way involved in the formation of human affections by habituation. The process of habituation determines not only how human beings act, but also how they feel. The affective part of the soul, though it is non-rational, is capable of ‘listening’ to reason more or less well and thereby the person acquires good or bad dispositions to act. Thus, in a human being, affections can be reasonable or unreasonable: The distinctive reason-responsiveness of the affections helps to explain why, despite certain natural predispositions, successful human development cannot simply be attributed to nature.",

Such approximations make us forget everything that the introduction of a dream sequence – fiction within fiction (a fictional character makes a fictional dream) – brings to the film’s progress. In cinema, the dream has three main functions. It sometimes is an event that influences a character, troubling him or revealing something about him. It also is, in certain cases, an autonomous segment, a sort of parenthesis in the middle of the projection. It finally helps to show unusual images, with a very fast or slow editing, which break the predictable progress of the story. These functions do not exist by themselves; they depend on the strategy of enunciation, that is to say on the way the film implicates the spectator, by warning him (a character falls asleep) that he is going to watch a dream, or by letting him uncertain. Beyond a relative analogy, one must not forget that a film, unlike a dream, is a rhetorical piece of work.",

Such differentiating practices may be aimed at identification with a certain ideological group, for example, or with a concrete \"fashion\", and involve the use of jewelry, clothes, unusual attire, hairstyles, mutilations, etc. In this context, the present review addresses certain aspects of mutilation practices from both the general and specifically dental perspectives. Mutations imply permanent or lasting sectioning or lesions of a part of the body, and comprise skeletal deforming, dental mutilations, circumcision, ablation of the clitoris, scarification, tattoos, and perforations (particularly of the soft tissues). In this sense, tattoos and perforations or piercings are popular -- particularly among adolescents. This trend may be interpreted as a form of communication, identity expression, or as a type of body cult (i.e., so-called \"body art\"). Such mutilating practices reflect different motivations including fashion, rebelliousness, differentiation, sexual motives, the remembering of events, physical sensations, and ethnic or tribal influences. However, these practices can cause complications such as infections, laceration and soft and hard tissue damage, hypersensitivity reactions and other alterations of variable severity. Under these premises, questions are raised concerning the competence of those who perform these mutilations, the preventive measures adopted, and the legal conditions under which tattoos and piercings are made in our society.",

The cause of entropy is human intelligence and the falsified superiority of human consciousness that leaves the body unsatisfied and the soul to writhe; for it creates a resistance in the flow of consciousness that makes the human loose its value of life and all that resides within. Egoism enhances superiority promotes an indestructible feeling; denies consciousness that flows within and across the system; a loss of revere to the cosmic bridge of consciousness that links the body, mind and soul to the universe. Satisfaction can be gotten when one clearly differentiates the subjectivity from the objectivity of consciousness; for the subjectivity of consciousness cannot be taken for granted over its trailing objectivity that ceaselessly deceives.",

      "abstract": "The crimes against reputation is an act to lower external valuation on ‘person’ according to statutes, common views and precedents, etc to let the third party meeting with expression act not to know who is an object being given valuation lowering act.\r\n As ‘Name in full’ represents a man who is subject of honor in real world. so ‘ID’ performs same function on cyberspace. Being different from natural association of meaning with the ones who have ‘name in full’ in real world, ‘ID’ on cyberspace has only meaning of personal identification symbol that identifies the one who exists behind the scenes so that it cannot be thought to be same with a ‘person’ from point of view of natural meaning: Therefore, normative equality of both can be admitted only limitedly.\r\n When ID is classified into four types, that is to say, completely unrecognizable type, semi-unrecognizable type, semi-cognizable type and completely cognizable type, completely cognizable type only admits of normative consistency between ID and the one who exists behind the scenes except for exceptional case that the one discloses his or her identity by himself or herself and either an actor in the use of website or the third party acknowledges such a fact. In other words, the ID cannot be thought to be ‘person’ who is an object of crimes against reputation from point of view of intentional acts of an actor at remaining types, and it cannot be thought to make a specification of the victim from point of view of the third party's recognizable possibility. In such a case, therefore, either defamation or insult on ID is difficult to admit of it.\r\n When lowering of valuation on ID in either defamation or insult is punished from point of view of needs of realistic penalties despite such a theoretical fault, such aoreticis al faulbe thought to be proper from point of view of the Principle of “nullum crimen, nulla poena sine lege”. If such a punishment is thought to be required, the act shall be carefully reviewed to legislate it based on the principles of appropriateness.",

      "abstract": "One of the major concerns of this book is with those properties of people which are intertwined with their sociality, yet are irreducible to it. These properties make for personal identity and their emergence is the subject of this chapter and the next. Introspectively, we are all constantly aware of the main property upon which this emergent process depends. As human beings we know that we live a rich inner life: that we are in continuous communion with ourselves and that we engage in a continual running commentary with the events going on around us. We are aware of how our inner lives monitor our responses to external situations in which we find ourselves and indeed modify some of the circumstances to which we willingly expose ourselves, be these natural, practical or social. For example, it is doubtful if there is a (normal) human being who is unaware of an internal dialogue which silently voices sentiments like, ‘Isn't he ever going to stop talking?’, ‘Careful, that truck's pulling out’, or, ‘I can't face that again.’ Moreover, we all also know that these are not just idle commentaries.",

According to one prominent approach, this privilege is due to a special epistemic access we have to our own present states of mind. On an alternative, deflationary approach the privilege merely reflects a socio‐linguistic convention governing avowals. We reject both approaches. On our proposed account, a full explanation of the privilege must recognize avowals as expressive performances, which can be taken to reveal directly the subject's present mental condition. We are able to improve on special access accounts and deflationary accounts, as well as familiar expressive accounts, by explaining both the asymmetries and the continuities between avowals and other pronouncements, and by locating a genuine though non‐epistemic source for first‐person privilege.",

      "abstract": "Kwong-loi Shun argues that our reactions to situations of danger to others needn’t be understood in terms of empathy for those others, but can be fully anchored in what is bad about the situations themselves. My reply begins by pointing out cases where the desire to help and/or emotional reactions to what is bad for others don’t seem to involve empathy and then showing how empathy actually works in those cases. It goes on to argue that empathy allows a deeper and more nuanced explanation of our responses and non-responses to dire situations than the appeal to the badness of those situations makes possible. Bringing in empathy forces one to go beyond Shun’s attempt to stay within Chinese tradition.However, the reply to Shun goes on to demonstrate how our understanding of empathy and of many other aspects of our moral psychology can be deepened and enhanced by bringing in the distinctive Chinese ideas of yin and yang—conceived as complementary rather than as opposites or contraries. Via a revived and fine-tuned notion of yin/yang Chinese thought has much to teach Western philosophers.",

      "title": "Borderline desire",
      "abstract": "Abstract The borderline personality unconsciously seeks emotional turbulence because this complex of affect is the shape of the object of desire. Whether these people were intrinsically disturbed as infants, or, whether the early object world was itself disturbing, they knew the maternal object as disruptive effect. This effect then became the shape of the object, so, in seeking turbulence they are in fact constituting the primary object. As painful and disturbing an event as this is, it is nonetheless desired and finding themselves in states of distress is unconsciously gratifying. This person cultivates “borderline objects” which evoke turbulent frames of mind. Such an object usually has an escalatory potential to it, so that the borderline may turn to ordinary distressing facts of life—environmental pollution, harassment of workers in the work place—and transform these facts into self stimulating objects. They bring about a toxic response which constitutes the object of desire. The borderline personality often seeks moments of misunderstanding with the psychoanalyst paradoxically enough in order to feel closer to the clinician. If he feels that he is bringing about irritation or distress in the analyst, the patient feels that he and the analyst are sharing the primary experience together. By persistently interpreting to the patient the unconscious desire of his character the analyst can effectively deconstruct the analysand's pathological attachment and help the patient to understand a complex dynamic that has always put this person at acute odds with himself, let alone with others.",

Land, stories, resources, equanimity, and loyalty are all examples of materially incommensurate things a person might possess. Even without material wealth, for example, one might be said to be in possession of a wicked sense of humor or a good memory or despite all else, one's own life story. Possessing one's own life story, however, is not a given. Thinking of one's life as a story, as something that can be narrated, involves social processes and conventions operative well beyond individual processes of reflection or experience. Narrating one's life, then, is to situate oneself and to be situated in dialogue with society. 1 As such, whether one's narrative is consensual with or contradictory to social norms, such narration signals possession of shared structures of possibility, including normative understandings of history, memory, knowledge, and truth. To narrate one's life is not just an issue of how, but also a matter of if .",

      "title": "Whose Sati?: Widow Burning in Early 19th Century India",
      "abstract": "Whose Sati? Widow Burning in Early 19th Century India Anand A. Yang Intentionally interrogatory, the title of this essay emphasizes the speculative nature of my remarks regarding the phenomenon of sati. Derived from the Sanskrit term for pure or chaste (sef)—the very term \"sati,\" therefore, is a misnomer—sati has come to signify both the act of immolation of a wife on the funeral pyre of her husband (in some areas a widow was buried with her deceased husband or took poison) and the victim herself rather than its original meaning of \"a virtuous woman.\"1 Generally, a woman was burnt together with her deceased husband, a practice termed sahamarana or sahagamana (dying together with). But if concremation was not possible, such as when a husband died in a distant place or a woman's pregnancy required that she wait till after delivery, a sati conformed to the practice of anumarana or anugamana: burning with the husband's ashes or with some other memento representing him, for example, his sandals, turban, or piece of clothing. * The title also has another meaning, a double trajectory: an interrogation of the historical literature on the subject and an interrogation of sati as a practice involving women of different times, places, and backgrounds. Both lines of inquiry seek to converge on the same objective: better questions and answers regarding the phenomenon of sati. Hitherto, much of the literature on sati has tended to favor an institutional approach.3 Not surprisingly, the most familiar aspect of sati is the British campaign against it culminating in the promulgation of Regulation XVII in 1829 \"declaring the practice of suttee, or of burning or burying alive the widows of Hindus, illegal and punishable by the criminal courts.\"4 Viewed from this angle, the history of sati has been appropriated by some scholars to represent the beginnings of \"a deliberate policy of modernizing and westernizing Indian society,\" as embodied in the person and policies of Governor-General Lord Bentinck who directed the official campaign against sati, and in the emergence of a Bengal \"Renaissance\" under the guiding hand of the \"Father of Modern India,\" Raja Rammohun Roy, who acted as the Indian architect of this and other social reforms.s The legislative prohibition of sati has also \"become a founding moment in the history of women in modern India.\" To continue in the words of this scholar, colonial rule, with its moral civilizing claims, is said to have provided the contexts for a thoroughgoing re-evaluation of Indian \"tradition\" along lines more consonant with the \"modern\" economy and society ©1989 Journal of Women-s History, Vol. ι No. 2 (Fall)____________________ 1989 Anand A. Yang believed to have been the consequence of India's incorporation into the capitalist world system. In other words, even the most antiimperialist amongst us has felt forced to acknowledge the \"positive\" consequences of colonial rule for certain aspects of women's lives, if not in terms of actual practice, at least at the level of ideas about \"women's rights.\"6 But as Lata Mani's deconstruction of the colonial discourse on sati reveals, women were neither the subjects nor the objects of this discourse, \"but rather the grounds of the discourse on sati .... For the British, rescuing women becomes part of the civilizing mission. For the indigenous elite, protection of their status or its reform becomes an urgent necessity, in terms of the honor of the collective—religious or national.\"7 For the political and ideological context in which the government campaign for social reforms was waged, whether focusing on sati, infanticide , lhagi (ritual murder), or human sacrifice, aimed at entitling the British with the right to proclaim the superiority of their own values, and ultimately , to justify their right to rule. Only they could usher in the morality they found wanting in the indigenous civilization. Consider the tenor of the following government pronouncement on sati: Of the rite itself, of its horror and abomination not a word need be said. Every rational and civilized being must feel anxious for the termination of a practice so abhorrent from humanity. . . .

      "title": "Five-Factor Model of Personality",
      "abstract": "The five-factor model of personality (FFM) is a set of five broad trait dimensions or domains, often referred to as the “Big Five”: Extraversion, Agreeableness, Conscientiousness, Neuroticism (sometimes named by its polar opposite, Emotional Stability), and Openness to Experience (sometimes named Intellect). Highly extraverted individuals are assertive and sociable, rather than quiet and reserved. Agreeable individuals are cooperative and polite, rather than antagonistic and rude. Conscientious individuals are task focused and orderly, rather than distractible and disorganized. Neurotic individuals are prone to experiencing negative emotions, such as anxiety, depression, and irritation, rather than being emotionally resilient. Finally, highly open individuals have a broad rather than narrow range of interests, are sensitive rather than indifferent to art and beauty, and prefer novelty to routine. The Big Five/FFM was developed to represent as much of the variability in individuals’ personalities as possible, using only a small set of trait dimensions. Many personality psychologists agree that its five domains capture the most important, basic individual differences in personality traits and that many alternative trait models can be conceptualized in terms of the Big Five/FFM structure. The goal of this article is to reference, organize, and comment on a variety of classic and contemporary papers related to the Big Five/FFM. This article begins with papers that introduce the Big Five/FFM structure, approach it from different theoretical perspectives, and consider possible objections to it (General Overviews, Theoretical Perspectives, and Critiques). Next, it discusses papers providing evidence for the Big Five/FFM as a model of basic trait structure (Big Five/FFM Structure). Third, the article considers hierarchical trait models that propose even broader personality dimensions “above” the Big Five, or more-specific traits “beneath” the Big Five (Big Five/FFM in Hierarchical Context). Fourth, it references a series of handbook chapters that each considers an individual Big Five domain in depth (Individual Domains). Fifth, it references several widely used Big Five/FFM measures as well as papers examining the accuracy of Big Five self-reports and observer-reports (Measurement). Sixth, the article discusses the biological and social origins of the Big Five (Biological and Social Bases). Seventh, the article considers stability and change in the Big Five across the life span as well as the developmental mechanisms underlying stability and change (Development). Finally, this article cites evidence that the Big Five influences a variety of important behaviors and life outcomes, from political attitudes to psychopathology (Predicting Behaviors and Life Outcomes).",

This sense of basic purpose, of what fundamentally animates us, is not some function of the human condition, or of its capacity for reflection and action, though it may sometimes seem that way, but on the contrary, extends to everything that can be said to have an existence, whether that be other animals, other living organisms, or even those features of the world, such as rocks and waterfalls, that flourish or fail to flourish, have worth or fail to have worth, despite the fact that they themselves play no active role, whether deliberative or otherwise, in securing either their flourishing or their worth.1 That said, as human beings we have a distinctive, some might call it a special, relationship to this shared purpose, one that is born of our distinctive capacity to perceive and to discharge the many and complex responsibilities of living well. So living well is a human project but not merely a human project.",

Nevertheless, in its popular acceptation, the term is limited to that form of freely written characters usually adopted by one person in sending messages to another person. In its restricted sense, therefore, handwriting may be considered as the written speech of the individual; like his oral efforts-and, indeed, like his every act-it soon becomes impressed with characteristics peculiar to himself, and tending to differentiate him from all other individuals. This establishes for him a customary and distinctive style, in writing, which may be more or less varied, from time to time, by accidental causes, such as haste, carelessness, position in writing, excitement, weakness, or disease. A writer's style gradually becomes so much a part of his nature that the physical act of writing is then scarcely a conscious effort on his part, but is rather an automatic production, resulting from his mere mental determination to write. This almost unconscious production includes (inter alia) two distinct parts, viz.: the physical method of performing the act, and the pictorial forms resulting from such performance; of these two divisions, ordinarily but few of the details of the first are (or can be) known to the person using them, and many of the details of the second are also unknown to him.",

My interest here is not in developing a theory of relational aesthetics per se,1 rather it is in exploring some of the ways that aesthetic value involves relations or forms of connections and interactions. I discuss four kinds of relations: perceptual, sensitive, meaningful, and temporal. These are not intended to be exhaustive or mutually exclusive. To talk of perceptual relations is to talk of a foundational but non-trivial relation. On my view, aesthetic qualities belong to the category of phenomenal properties or things that we grasp primarily through perceptual experiences. They are response-dependent, coming into existence when the subject2 is in a perceptual (and spatial) relation to something in the world. The aesthetic value, worth, or good that the subject places on something depends upon the conditions of perception and the situation of the subject: listening to music, sitting in a garden, climbing a mountain, swimming in a lake, beholding a cathedral, choosing something to wear for a night out, preparing dinner, watching a film, reading a poem, and so on. These perceptual experiences draw upon sensory (and bodily) capacities, thought, emotion, imagination, and cognition and are nested within particular appreciative contexts and communities.",

      "abstract": "In this article, the subject is considered by the author not as a static object, but as a «project», which is in a state of constant becoming. During the study were obtained the following conclusions: firstly, it was emphasized, that a subject has no predefined essence and that his existence precedes any design or plan. Secondly, it is detected, that a subject constructs its identity not through random circumstances or predefined restrictions of the external world, but through the carried-out choices and own deeds and actions, which manifested in the world. Thirdly, it is installed, that а subject is forced to accept its individual freedom even, if it contradicts his desires or expectations of other people. Fourthly, it is substantiated, that the process of self-identification can be dramatic, as it requires the subject to gap with usual stereotypes and expectations, and also acceptance own individuality and responsibility for its actions. Fifthly, it is accented, that the process of self-identification of a personality involves disclosure and cognition of the essence own «Ego», as a unique and integral structure, which is manifested in the subject’s ability to self-creation, self-fulfillment and self-improvement and in his real possibility to form an image of the future world. Sixthly, it is determined, that absolute freedom for the subject turns into a necessity, which prompts his to responsibility for its existence, choice, actions and deeds. Seventhly, it is allocated, that the subject denies social and moral-religious attitudes to free themselves from external influence, that impede his freedom of choice, which is a reflection of his subjective attitude to any situation. That is in this case we can say that the subject, creating its reality, does not rely on external authority, the existence of which is questionable in the world and is repelled only on subjective choice.",

      "abstract": "It is necessary that the adolescent be prepared to face the bio-psycho-social changes that are implicit in this period of growth. This allows the constructive participation in the second process of separation and individualisation. Should this separation be lacking there is the risk of a developmental breakdown (Laufer and Laufer, 1984). In this situation the appearance of self destructive behaviors can be fatal as seen in anorexia, bulimia, drug dependency and suicide. The roots of these self destructive choices seem to be found in the lack of clear definition of the initial process of separation and individualisation from the first part of the second year to the end of the third due to relational disturbance in the mother-child relationship in the symbiotic phase (beginning of the third month-end of the first year). One of the constants in the behavior of an addict that can be found in most self-destructive behaviors is the concept of one's body as an enemy. In order to maintain a connection to his archaic parental objects that allow him to protect an ideal self image, the addict denies the reality of his body. The extreme consequence of this can be found in the paradoxical and delirious decision to « die so as not to die ». There is a moment in the life of the addict in which a change from addiction as a search for pleasure turns into addiction as a game with death. The addict becomes convinced that it is worth while to risk death so as to live. In other words his behavior becomes very similar to the ordalic, where, challenging death, he repeatedly attacks his own security",

      "abstract": "Empathy is the ability to infer and share the feelings, intentions, and goals of other persons.1 It provides the basis for our extraordinary capacity to help others, including strangers we may never meet, without interest in personal benefit. Its extent has been controversial, but recent studies in neuroscience, empirical psychology, and primatology support a highly empathic understanding of human nature. This view overturns the so-called “Darwinian” paradigm prevalent both in popular imagination and academic disciplines.2 The “Darwinian” account—in quotes because distant from Darwin’s own express views3—holds that “man is a wolf to man” (homo homini lupus); that individuals are self-maximizing and manipulative, even when seemingly kind to others (a common joke among psychologists: “scratch an ‘altruist’ and watch a ‘hypocrite’ bleed”); and that “Mother Nature” rewards the strong and discards the weak (“the devil take the hindmost”).4 As Richard A. Posner writes, “Darwin’s picture of nature is bleak; it is dog eat dog in virtually a literal sense; the adaptionist process that produced us is genocidal.”5 But recent studies support a different picture, a kinder one, in which persons are naturally attuned to one another, cannot help feeling what others feel, and spontaneously reach out to others in need. In The Age of Empathy, Frans de Waal calls for “a complete overhaul of assumptions about human nature.”6 The empathic paradigm is a “radical new view,” writes Jeremy Rifkin in The Empathic Civilization, “with radical implications for the way we understand and organize our economic, social and environmental relations in the centuries to come.”7 Both Rifkin (an economic and social theorist) and de Waal (a primatologist) look to empathy as an important source of moral progress. Rifkin argues that human empathy emerged over time, in conjunction with",

God is the tripersonal super-essence of spiritual nature, above all spirituality that we may understand or imagine. He is the one Who brings everything into existence and that is why there is a fundamental difference between God and creation; the origin and the existence of the creation depend on the will and the creative work of God. As personal super-essence and super- existence, God is completely free because He cannot be closed into a reference system; He is the ultimate instance of all His decisions and acts. Man, created in the image of God reflects at the level of creation the freedom of God. As created existence, he is part of a reference system of the created world, which depends on God in its existence and becoming. As personal existence, in the image of God, the human person is capable of an existence that is not entirely enclosed into the reference system of the created nature; he is called to the free communion with God and it is the ultimate instance that decides his thoughts, acts and words. Man guards and increases his freedom or loses it according to the manner in which he professes it. For within the freedom of man the possibility to state the freedom is involved, at the same time renouncing it. The paradox of the freedom of man consists of the fact that man gives up his freedom through his own freedom because of pride or because he leaves the communion with God, Who offers him the true freedom.",

This is usually due to troubled family histories and a destructive projective identification process. The ego defensively blocks acknowledgment of any symbolizing capacity within the self and within the maternal object out of envy, fear of rejection, and dread of persecution. Destruction of symbolization and the experience of goodness within the self or in the object provides an artificial respite from the threat of annihilation, yet quickly brings on even greater levels of internal chaos and anxiety.

      "title": "Joyful by nature: approaches to investigate the evolution and function of joy in non‐human animals",
      "abstract": "The nature and evolution of positive emotion is a major question remaining unanswered in science and philosophy. The study of feelings and emotions in humans and animals is dominated by discussion of affective states that have negative valence. Given the clinical and social significance of negative affect, such as depression, it is unsurprising that these emotions have received more attention from scientists. Compared to negative emotions, such as fear that leads to fleeing or avoidance, positive emotions are less likely to result in specific, identifiable, behaviours being expressed by an animal. This makes it particularly challenging to quantify and study positive affect. However, bursts of intense positive emotion (joy) are more likely to be accompanied by externally visible markers, like vocalisations or movement patterns, which make it more amenable to scientific study and more resilient to concerns about anthropomorphism. We define joy as intense, brief, and event-driven (i.e. a response to something), which permits investigation into how animals react to a variety of situations that would provoke joy in humans. This means that behavioural correlates of joy are measurable, either through newly discovered 'laughter' vocalisations, increases in play behaviour, or reactions to cognitive bias tests that can be used across species. There are a range of potential situations that cause joy in humans that have not been studied in other animals, such as whether animals feel joy on sunny days, when they accomplish a difficult feat, or when they are reunited with a familiar companion after a prolonged absence. Observations of species-specific calls and play behaviour can be combined with biometric markers and reactions to ambiguous stimuli in order to enable comparisons of affect between phylogenetically distant taxonomic groups. Identifying positive affect is also important for animal welfare because knowledge of positive emotional states would allow us to monitor animal well-being better. Additionally, measuring if phylogenetically and ecologically distant animals play more, laugh more, or act more optimistically after certain kinds of experiences will also provide insight into the mechanisms underlying the evolution of joy and other positive emotions, and potentially even into the evolution of consciousness.",

      "title": "Bodies, Artworks, and Use Values",
      "abstract": "Bodies, Artworks, and Use Values Terry Eagleton (bio) People Like to Feel Useful but not to feel used, a distinction which captures something of our general ambiguity about the concept of use. Not to feel used may be to feel dumped and discarded, which is objectionable; but it may also be to feel treated as an end in oneself, which is not. Perhaps what counts is the difference between being put to use by others and being the agent of one’s own practical efforts. But this is surely not the case. For one thing, others can make use of you in constructive ways, as when they draw upon your medical skills to save their dying child. This is hardly a case of being exploited. We do, after all, speak of using someone well. “Use” here refers simply to the way we treat people, not necessarily to treating them as a means to an end. And even then, as I have just indicated, this may be entirely acceptable. To use somebody in the pejorative sense of the term is not to bend their powers and capacities to certain ends, but to do this while riding roughshod over their own interests and desires. In this sense, what is wrong with using people is akin to what is wrong with sociological functionalism. It is not that social roles and institutions do not have functions, but that they cannot be reduced to them. Nor can people be reduced to what we want from them. But we are entitled to want things from them even so, which is a matter of using them, but not in a way they can legitimately object to. One can also use oneself in unjust or abusive ways, as when one shoots off a finger from one’s hand once a week simply for the cheap thrill of it. A tougher case is when one freely submits to being the mere tool or chattel of someone else. Someone may find supreme self-fulfilment in dressing up as a Victorian maidservant, calling themselves Milly and scrubbing five flights of stairs a day. If it is hard to see why they should be censured for this, it is equally difficult to regard it as a paradigm of the good life. That a liberal society does not prevent its citizens from using and abusing themselves does not mean that it should approve of it. Using oneself, however, has its limits. I can certainly make use of my own body, as when I lie supine in the mud so that Brad Pitt can descend from his limousine without soiling his shoes. This is to treat my body as an instrument, which is by no means always objectionable. Think of [End Page 561] stretching oneself across a cleft in the rocks so that one’s companions can scramble to safely over one’s spine. Nor is it always objectionable to treat other people’s bodies as instruments. If I am too cowardly or arthritic to stretch myself over the cleft, I might secure your consent to stretch your lithe, courageous young person over it instead. A martyr is one who gives his or her body away for the sake of others. Even so, I cannot use myself as an instrument in the same sense that I can use a fork. This is partly because a body is not exactly something that I have, even if we find ourselves speaking often enough in such terms. My relationship to my body is not fundamentally an instrumental one, even though I can speak of having the use of my legs or eyes. I can objectify my flesh to some extent, and could not function as a subject if I could not, but it is not my possession. To say that this body is mine is just a way of distinguishing between it and other bodies, not a way of saying that it belongs to me, and that I am therefore free to (say) pump it full of heroin. Morally speaking, I am no more free to do this than I am to pump you full of heroin. As far as that goes, there is no significant difference...",

      "title": "Anuradha and Anupama: Gender Issues through Nussbaum's Capabilities Approach",
      "abstract": "According to Immanuel Kant's second categorical imperative, every individual should be treated as an end and never as a means. The individual should be treated with dignity, equality, and not just as a tool to achieve certain ends. To develop a universal approach for justice worldwide, Martha Nussbaum emphasizes (2000a, b) the capabilities approach. If this approach applies to all its citizens, we may consider a society as a just society, where all individuals are treated fairly and with dignity. Her list of ten capabilities summarizes what an individual can do and be. These capabilities are life, bodily health, bodily integrity, senses, imagination, reason, emotions, practical reason, affiliation, and control over one's environment (Nussbaum 2000a, b). In Anuradha, the capabilities of reason, emotions, and affiliation are shown to be lacking. The female protagonist stops pursuing her musical talent, her lifelong passion, to give her full support for her husband, who remains engrossed in his professional duties and ignores his wife. In the second film, Anupama, the protagonist's capabilities of reason, emotions, bodily integrity, and imagination are not catered to. Her father fails to provide the freedom of choice and respect to his daughter, the protagonist. Her father's fragile relationship takes a toll on her emotional well-being, and she stops short of manifesting her true potential.",

      "abstract": "Historically, value has been understood largely in economic terms centred on, for example, notions of price, cost, profits and shareholder wealth. However, contemporary understandings of value also point at value being created through and around products and, above all, services, experiences and relationships in creating good, or improving the well-being of people and situations are considered valuable by various stakeholders. This means that value is surrounded by subjectivities. Furthermore, value is created by self-identity. For example, some people may see great value in saving the world’s rainforests but people who rely on logging of those forests for their livelihood may not place the same value on them. Thus, a “value” is grounded in a particular belief that is related to the worth of an idea, behaviour or mutual evaluation of a relationship. Also, ‘price’ is often perceived by many people as a key marker of ‘value’ but curiously, all too often price is quickly forgotten once a commitment to purchase is made and other emotions and factors begin to be foremost in the purchaser’s mind.",

The Third Any identity (an individual, a community, a nation) exists  with  an inherent debt towards the Other, since as an identity — it constructs itself to a large extent through the difference from and of the Other. This ontological predicament inevitably involves an ethical question — the question of reciprocity: one's obligation is to repay the  debt. That ethical question is frequently annulled through an essentialist construal of the concept of identity. if we  reject or want to avoid essentialism, however, we have to recognize the obligation and find ways of fulfilling it:  through obliterating clear-cut boundaries and construing identities  as  nebular densities rather than as reified ob­ jectivities and, consequently, through internalizing the difference and through accommodating the Other into the  space of one's own identity. Yet, since reciprocity is of itself a symmetrical concept and must work both ways, the  question of obligation must also be reversed: what are the obligations of the Other? Can the obligation to recipro­ cate be waived from the Other in certain circumstances? Or will it rather be an incapacitation of the Other through  deprivation of responsibility? The problem becomes particularly acute in the circumstances of displacement:  exile, emigration, or even hospitality. All these circumstances involve a misbalance of power, an interpenetration and a conflict of values, legitimisation of individual and communal expectations. In such a context, while keeping  in mind the ethical aspect of obligation, one must also be aware of its political and axiological implications,  especially when the problem of reciprocity is approached in terms of racial, ethnic and cultural difference. The  objective of the essay is to explore those multifaceted aspects of  the obligation of  reciprocity and to place them in  the context of post-Cartesian notions of subjectivity on the one hand, and of multiculturalism, on the other hand.",

Life regret relates to the insight that an actual developmental state is different from an aspired one, due to one's own actions or inactions in the past. Life longing refers to an idealized expression of life that contrasts with current life realities. Both are accompanied by negative emotions and were found to negatively relate to individuals' concurrent well‐being, especially when uncontrollable. At the same time, they are assumed to serve important self‐regulatory functions: a goal‐ and behavior‐corrective function in the case of life regret, and a directive and compensatory function in the case of Sehnsucht .

One might argue that judgments as such are not experienced at all, but this is a quibble. We experience the world via our judgments, which is why it is said that our emotions are shaped or structured by judgments. Thus, an essential part of the experience of anger is the experience of being wronged or of having one's intentions frustrated. An essential part of the experience of love is the experience of finding another person attractive and desirable, being drawn to her or him, and later finding this person to be more or less indispensable to one's life. An essential part of the experience of grief is having suffered a terrible loss because one was (and is) bound to another person who is now lost. Again, each of these descriptions is not just a description of “items in our public world;” although, to be sure, it refers to those too. But the person who angers us, the person whom we love or for whom we grieve is not just a person in the world but the person as experienced from the peculiar perspective of the emotion and the person who has the emotion.",

      "abstract": "Political wisdom, judgement or genius do not stem from the spirit of science and is not the upshot of theoretical generalizations or learning. There is of course “political science” and “political philosophy” but politicians can properly act without them because it is neither the discovery of laws or generalizations in the field of politics nor “knowledge about political things” but “political sense” that is crucial for his actions. As Isaiah Berlin put it years ago: “What makes statesmen, like drivers of cars, successful is that they do not think in general terms – that is, they do not primarily ask themselves in what respect a given situation is like or unlike other situations in the long course of human history (which is what historical sociologists, or theologians in historical clothing, such as Vico or Toynbee, are fond of doing). Their merit is that they grasp the unique combination of characteristics that constitute this particular situation – this and no other. What they are said to be able to do is to understand the character of particular movement, of a particular individual, of a unique state of affairs, of unique atmosphere, of some particular combination of economic, political, personal factors; and we do not readily suppose that this capacity can literally be taught”. Therefore politics is not a quest for “general terms” or general features of political phenomena but a direct and individual insight into concrete reality. Being a politician takes not learning but talent, not expertise but intuition, not knowledge but sense; it takes looking not at general but the particular dimension of human actions. Politicians can be taunted for their posture as Napoleon, they can be uneducated as farmer George Washington or act against morality as Cardinal Richelieu but frankly speaking all these vices are unimportant in the political realm.",

In the Ru Jia, there are at least five interrelated meanings of Ren, such as, 1) Ren can be taken as a particular virtue which is benevolence and it is to love others in a graded manner. 2) Ren can be taken as a general virtue and as such, it is universal and primary to which all particular virtues are connected. 3) Ren can be taken as an innate moral principle and in this light, an initial moral sensibility that has to be developed in the course of one’s life. 4) Ren can be taken as an ethical ideal and this is Ren in its ultimate perfection with the complete transformation of the self from its disintegrative and selfish concerns towards the responsiveness of the profoundly relational person. 5) Finally, Ren can be taken as a general practice and they are Zhong and Shu. Zhong is positive, doing something for the self and then doing something for others. Shu is negative, thinking about what one should not do to others when one takes oneself as a measure for them. All these are the nuances of Ren and they will be exposed, analyzed and discussed in this paper.",

As people are increasingly expected to publicly legitimate themselves as good and worthy subjects, and as capital increasingly enters the spaces of intimacy and bio-politics, we need to reconsider the limits of our theoretical imaginaries for understanding the value production necessary to the performance of personhood. Specifically, most of the theories we have for understanding the connections between personhood and value reproduce and legitimate the normative, hinging our theoretical imaginary to the dominant symbolic, making proper personhood an exclusive resource predicated on constitution by exclusion; where limits define the norm, the margins the centre and the improper the proper. How then can we understand how people who are excluded from the possibilities of accruing and attaching value to themselves, who are positioned outside of the dominant symbolic as the constitutional limit for the proper self, or as the zero limit to culture, develop value/s? Drawing upon three different empirical research projects the paper builds on my previous critique of the self as a classed concept to develop a different perspective on value. It argues that an analysis of autonomist working-class sociality offers us ways to imagine personhood and person value that are often imperceptible to the bourgeois gaze.",

So an apt belief is attained purely by the competence or adroitness of the believer which excludes any involvement of luck factors. This AAA structure of knowledge is designed to exclude all of the luck-involving factors in epistemic cases, and thereby distinguishes apt-beliefs from Gettierized cases of knowledge.

In spite of his assurance that equality is unrelated to physical or intellectual ability, Godwin makes individual and social liberty contingent upon the types of contributions one’s capacities allow. His political system inevitably produces exceptions (those who do not or cannot contribute to the general good) for which he needs to devise additional measures. People who lack the right kinds of mental and physical capacities prove to be an intractable difficulty. In his fiction, Godwin centralizes the idea that the mind should work in concert with the body, and sees incapacity in either of these as socially and personally problematic. We see this in his repeated use of automata, dolls, and characters who disengage from their bodies in various ways; and in his fictional use of rejuvenation and cure. Godwin speculates that when reason governs society, illness and incapacity will no longer be present. His attitude towards deformity is quite separate from his views on capacity. Deformity, in Godwin’s fiction, is usually a visual sign of an evil character, and he does not articulate the prodigious phase of disability.",

Etymologically speaking, it means joy that is experienced through the object reached or the objective achieved, achievements which presuppose activity and effort. This psychological state is a pleasant, relative and dynamic one and shows itself up through the impulses that lead to spontaneous actions which are in harmony with the fundamental tendencies of the subject. They are not alien to running risks and to the will of victory. Some people believe happiness is attained at random, others think it is an art and a science to be developped by voluntary effort. Limited as it is by the order of universe and human constitution, its being a spiritual condition conveys a transcendency to it but by the same token it implies the sacrifice of immediate pleasure. Love between two people is its paramount paradigm. Love originates in sexual attraction but in its development and at its summit there is tenderness and companionship in a mutual relation between two people who share their genitality. Individual happiness is inseparable of collective happiness and on this idea stands social welfare. From the psychoanalytical point of view, the feeling of happiness relates itself to the personality as a whole and presupposes the cooperation in harmony of all the constituents of the self. It occurs when there is an experience of unity between Ego and World, Id or Ego Ideal, unity which is a consequence of having liberated oneself from the repressive instance. It is the result of a synthetic process, is essentially endogenous and is reached by the linking force of narcissistic libido. It is submitted to internal laws, that is why it possesses a passing condition. Enjoyment of happiness presupposes psychic integration and in this sense it is related to the modern health approach as stated by World Health Organization. In this conference both concepts, i.e., happiness and health are correlated.",

In the context of animal welfare, cascades have often occurred, and more consequential ones are possible. First: In this domain, preference falsification has run and is running rampant. Those who care about animal welfare, or are inclined to want to say or do something about it, often silence themselves. They know that if they speak or act, they might incur social disapproval or worse. Second: People have different thresholds for disclosing their views or for taking action. With respect to animal welfare, some people really will speak out or act, even if no one else does. Others need someone to follow – but only one. Still others need two, or three, or a hundred, or more. Third: Social interactions are and continue to be crucial to the movement for animal welfare. Who is seeing whom? When? Who is talking to whom? Are visible people speaking and acting in ways that support animal welfare? Are they credible? With whom? Fourth: In many times and places, believers in animal rights, animal welfare, or both have created communities of like-minded people. These communities can be highly effective. They create a commitment to a belief that might have been held tentatively. They make that belief salient, potentially part of people’s identity. They increase confidence and unity.",

      "title": "Benevolence Around Us and Awareness: When Ordinary Individuals Get Involved",
      "abstract": "Ordinary individuals in international relations not only embody violence, suffering, and indifference; they also seem totally subordinated to the impotence produced by the burden of responsibility for the fate of all vulnerable human beings across the world. These ordinary individuals also engage in benevolent actions. They adopt practices aimed at the good of others and even of nature, but in proximity. It is indeed at this local scale that benevolence finds its primary and probably most intense dynamic. As Hutcheson pointed out, benevolence, like gravitation, is stronger the closer bodies get ‘and come to touch’. But this scale is by no means disconnected from the rest of international relations, since it remains linked to issues that cross borders, such as environmental protection, the preservation of solidarity links, or, of course, migrations. Such behaviours echo the ‘supererogatory morality’ evoked by Rawls in his Theory of Justice. Fuelled by ‘an acute sensitivity to the feelings and desires of others’, it goes beyond the requirements of justice and ‘is not suitable for ordinary beings’. However, certain moral conducts testify to a movement beyond the ordinary. They tend towards the centre of the benevolence continuum and activate its positive component (to help and improve the conditions of the vulnerable as well as of fellow human beings).",

      "abstract": "Abstract In connection with the traditional principles of Bioethics, we wonder if they are able to make us understand the terminal patient and those who look after him and his family, or if it will be necessary to “go backwards” (Schritt zurück) - to speak in Heidegger’s terms- up to reach that unavoidable principle that guides and inspires the application of the others. The thought of Emmanuel Levinas can place us near an answer. In fact, he insists that it is the “other” in his face the one that it is imposed with its own strength, as a being essentially ethic and before its presence the only response is to recognize him/her as constitutively “indigent”. Precisely, before any other theory or any other argument, the “other” is presented to me face-to-face, his own presence is already existence of his acknowledgment, it is a call and a appeal to responsibility. Since Ethic demands primarily a complete dedication of all the person, that is to say a radical commitment of reason, will and feelings, we ask ourselves in front of these patients to get for them a new shelter. Serenity, availability, comforted mood among threats, patience, gratitude and hope may become founding virtues of interpersonal relationships (Bollnow).",

      "abstract": "An abandoned building contains distinct qualities that cannot be observed in occupied architecture of daily life. However, these distinct qualities are difficult to experience since the moment the building is entered this inhabitation negates, to varying degrees, the very definition of an abandoned building. As a space without regulations and restrictions, when entered an abandoned building can become a transient vehicle fulfilling one’s innate desires. These spaces can play host to a series of alternate functions, limitless experiences and countless possibilities, restricted only by the inhabitant’s imagination. As individual desires and functions occur within the abandoned building, it is possible that these interventions and/or interactions damage the very qualities that we identify as abandoned. How then, might we positively interact with the abandoned qualities encased within these spaces? And, to what degree is it possible that architectural interpretation may preserve and enhance the unique qualities of the abandoned building?",

      "title": "Ultimate Meaning, Suffering, and God",
      "abstract": "Humans, it may be argued, have the distinction of being perhaps the only kind of creatures who can raise fundamental questions about existence. While requiring basic items such as food and drink in order to survive, humans nevertheless are often made aware that the fulfillment of human existence needs more than these.1 Unfortunately, the answer to the problem is rarely clear. What is less unclear is a certain uneasiness or even dissatisfaction with merely satisfying one's immediate needs.2 Hence, questions such as: what makes us truly human? is life worth living? is there a purpose to life? are asked. Humans, apparently unlike other living beings, can and sometimes do wonder about the significance of being alive and interacting with others. A specifically human concern is whether life itself has any ultimate meaning. It would be naive to think that we humans always ask these questions in such an explicit way. Nor do we address the issue of ultimate meaning with uniform concern and interest. Our list of priorities in life would hardly reveal such in-depth existential values. In fact, we generally set ourselves certain goals, strive after them, and, if we attain them, look for others.3 Nonetheless, the question as to whether life has any meaning at all is a human one not only because, as far as we know, humans alone are capable of reflecting on it, but also because every human being-although in most cases implicitly rather than explicitly?is confronted by it.4 As a matter of fact, we more or less presume the meaningfulness of life by carrying on with our daily routine. We assume that there is some sense to life by engaging in the various",

      "title": "KNOWLEDGE, SINCERITY AND EXCELLENCE",
      "abstract": "EDITORIAL: Knowledge is an excellent gift of Allah SWT for mankind and jinn. All humankind compete each other in achieving excellence. This is a natural process. From the Day One of human creation, Allah SWT gifted Adam, peace be upon him, with all needed knowledge, skills and names. Human superiority was established by Allah SWT through excellent knowledge skills which the Angels were not gifted with. Hence Allah SWT commanded all angels to show their respect towards Adam by prostrating before him. All of them immediately obeyed the command of Allah except Iblis, who showed arrogance and pride against Adam, and did not obey the command of Allah SWT. Hence, he was cursed and expelled from the Heavens. This shows that knowledge alone does not guarantee success. Sincerity is an indispensable criterion in learning knowledge and achieving excellence in the present life and the life hereafter. Iblis had pride in his nature, and believed that he was the supreme creation of Allah SWT, and all other creation should show signs of respect towards him. How could he bow down before a man of clay! His arrogance led him to be strayed. Undoubtedly, the knowledge brings us closer to Allah SWT, leads us to success in all our jobs. Knowledge confirms honour and dignity in our life. True knowledge will ultimately save us from the Hell-fire. (Qur’an, al-Mulk 67:10). A knowledgeable person and un-knowledgeable person can never be equal. The learned ones would realize the signs of Allah and devote their life and time to secure the ultimate pleasure of Allah SWT. (Qur’an, Zumar 39:9). Allah praised the knowledgeable people by saying that the learned ones alone are truly conscious of their Lord. (Qur’an, Fatir 35:28). A man who denounced the Signs of Allah In Surah al-A`raf (9: 175-177), Allah SWT recorded the evil behavior of an extremely unlucky man, who was gifted with abundance of knowledge from his Lord, received all favors from Allah SWT, but at the end of his journey in life, he succumbed to Satanic temptations, and surrendered to the temporal worldly gains, destroying his eternal blissful life in Hereafter. By knowledge, he was fully aware that eternal life in Hereafter was awaiting him, and worldly life could never be compared with eternal life. This knowledge and abundance of divine favors did not save him. Allah SWT resembled him like a dog panting and breathing quickly out of search for eating and fulfilling sexual thirsts. This is the beauty of Qur’an that Allah SWT does not mention the specific names of the corrupt people, who were destroyed and became the slaves of Satan and temptations rejecting the divine favors. Now, the Qur’anic interpreters named him as Bal`am bin Ba`ura’, a man during the time of the Prophet Moses, peace be upon him, who was said to be gifted with ‘Mustajab ad-da`wah’, means, all his prayers were immediately answered by Allah SWT. Other scholars named Umaiyyah bin Abi as-Salt (d. 5AH), as the man intended in the ayah. He was from Ta’if, a poet philosopher, a believer in Allah SWT in Jahiliyyah [pre-Islamic phase], never worshipped idols, a great scholar of that time, who had the knowledge of previous divine books and all existing knowledge. All his writings and poetries support Tawhid, oneness of Allah SWT. He knew that there will come a final Prophet, and expecting by heart to be that promised prophet. When he came to know that Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him, already started mission in Makkah, he became upset and jealous. His earlier belief in oneness of God, and profound knowledge did not save him. His pride and internal desire to be a prophet destroyed him. The prophets were chosen by Allah SWT alone, not based on someone’s desire and expectation. A Qur’anic scribe turned apostate In an authentic hadith in Bukhari (n. 3617) and Muslim (n. 2781), it is narrated by Anas bin Malik, may Allah SWT be pleased with him, that a Christian man from Bani Najjar accepted Islam, who had the knowledge of the previous divine books. He learnt and memorized Surah al-Baqarah and Aal ‘Imran from the Qur’an, which made him a respectable person from among the companions of the Prophet. He was assigned the job of scribe or writer of the Qur’anic revelation. Later he turned apostate and joined his Christian folks. Not only that, he claimed that Muhammad did not know anything except what he wrote for him. By this claim, he became famous to his Christian folks. When he died and graved, the earth threw his dead body out of the surface. They tried to put him onto different graves a second and third time, but again he was thrown out. This shows that the man rejected the aayat of Allah SWT which he learnt, and falsely publicized against the Prophet and the Qur’an. He was immediately punished by the earth, and the punishment in Hereafter is more severe awaiting for all anti-Qur’anic people. Anti-Qur’anic people in the current age Not only the time of Prophet Moses or Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon them, the chain of the people who denounce the signs of Allah, after they were gifted with it, prolong day after day. There are people who do not want to believe in Allah SWT, or do not want to accept Prophet Muhammad as the Final messenger of Allah, or there are plenty of them who denounce the divine shari`ah as a whole or part of it, or try to insert their false interpretation to the Qur’anic aayat and shari`ah, and assert that this should be changed from time to time. Mirza Gulam Ahmad Qadiyani (1835-1908) Born in Qadiyan of Punjab in a religious family, was a religious devotee, well educated, had profound knowledge of the Qur’an and strong influence on the masses. At the age of 50, when he noticed that the people respect him wholeheartedly, he declared to be ‘Promised Messiah’ and ‘Awaited Mahdi’. He also declared to be the Prophet of his time. His profound knowledge alone could not save him. Ultimately, succumbed to personal desires, positions, name and fame and sacrificed his religion for worldly gains. Astonishingly, his graveyard was named by his blind followers as ‘Beheshti Maqbarah’ [Gardens of Heaven Graveyard]. If they were aware of unseen information of al-Ghayb, and what the false prophet of Qadiyan was facing in his ‘alam al-Barzakh [intermediate world between dunya’ and Hereafter], they could have named it the opposite. Rashad Khalifa (1935-1990) Born in Egypt, an Egyptian American scientist, from a religious Sufi family, migrated to America in 1959 to further his education. He settled there. To teach his daughters the Qur’an, he attempted to translate the Qur’an. Then he discovered the miraculous number 19 in the Qur’an. He computed the whole Qur’an and propagated the numerical miracles in the Qur’an. He received due recognition and warmth welcome from all over the Muslim world. This made him proud. Then his satanic desires took over, claimed to be the promised Prophet for whom Allah SWT has taken pledge or Mithaq from all prophets. (Qur’an, Aal ‘Imran 3: 81). His profound knowledge did not lead him to guidance. Rather it led him to worldly achievements for which he destroyed his eternal life in hereafter, which Allah SWT has informed to all mankind through all divine Prophets. At the end, he was killed in 1990 by an Afro-American man. It is evident that knowledge alone will not lead one to success. Allah SWT loves His slaves to mark excellence in the field of knowledge and science with humility. Intention should be pure to serve humanity in order to secure pleasure of Allah SWT. If satanic temptations overpower us, we get proud, and the pride may lead us to ultimate destruction. Noor Mohammad Osmani Editor-in-chief December 2022",

It is spiritual like God, and like God it is incorruptible and everlasting. It is free, it is able to foresee and provide, it has its will of which it disposes. Does it not appear to enjoy the privileges of eternity, when it looks into the future, makes the past live again and disposes of the present? But never does it seem more like to God than when, soaring above all that is created it loses itself in the vast abyss of his infinite perfections, and, realising that it cannot comprehend them, is content to remain lost in them forever with no desire to return.",

      "title": "Lost in the socially extended mind: Genuine intersubjectivity and disturbed self-other demarcation in schizophrenia",
      "abstract": "Much of the characteristic symptomatology of schizophrenia can be understood as resulting from a pervasive sense of disembodiment. The body is experienced as an external machine that needs to be controlled with explicit intentional commands, which in turn leads to severe difficulties in interacting with the world in a fluid and intuitive manner. In consequence, there is a characteristic dissociality: Others become problems to be solved by intellectual effort and no longer present opportunities for spontaneous interpersonal alignment. This dissociality goes hand in hand with a progressive loss of the socially extended mind, which normally affords opportunities for co-regulation of cognitive and affective processes. However, at times people with schizophrenia report that they are confronted by the opposite of this dissociality, namely an unusual fluidity of the self-other boundary as expressed in experiences of ambiguous body boundaries, intrusions, and even merging with others. Here the person has not lost access to the socially extended mind but has instead become lost in it, possibly due to a weakened sense of self. We argue that this neglected aspect of schizophrenic social dysfunction can be usefully approached via the concept of genuine intersubjectivity: We normally participate in a shared experience with another person by implicitly co-regulating how our interaction unfolds. This co-regulation integrates our respective experience’s dynamical bases into one interpersonal process and gives the interaction an ambiguous second-person character. The upshot is that reports of abnormal self-other fluidity are not indicative of hallucinations without any basis in reality, but of a heightened sensitivity and vulnerability to processes of interpersonal alignment and mutual incorporation that form the normal basis of social life. We conclude by discussing implications of this view for both the science of consciousness as well as approaches to intervention and therapy.",

      "abstract": "Writings on the Philosophy of Psychology asks: \"Could one imagine a world in which there could be no pretence?\"Again he asks: \"Can one imagine people who cannot lie? -What else would these people lack?,\" and answers: \"We should probably also imagine that they cannot make anything up and do not understand things that are made up.\" 2 The authors whose writings I plan to discuss do not go so far as to envision a world in which the capacity to pretend or simulate is entirely lacking.But in what might be viewed as a compensatory response to the seeming pervasiveness of lying, fraud, and deception in our daily lives, many emotion theorists are committed to the idea that the problem of cheating and dissimulation can be alleviated, if not completely eliminated, because there exist inbuilt mechanisms of reliable or truthful signaling.They adopt the view that honesty, or knowing whom to trust, is guaranteed in advance, as it were, because difficult or impossibleto-fake facial movements and other non-verbal signals have evolved through natural selection to provide accurate information about a person's internal, affective states.We might put it that such emotion theorists believe they have found a solution to the philosophical problem of other minds by appealing to the idea of innately determined emotional \"expressions\" that, under the right conditions, unfailingly signal to us what other people are thinking and feeling because those expressions are hardwired to do so.These same emotion theorists further believe, or proceed as if they believe, that without such a system of communication designed by natural selection to automatically vouchsafe the genuineness and sincerity of emotional signals, trust, cooperation, and indeed genuine altruism are doomed to be undermined by the selfish human tendency to cheat.They therefore propose that the evolution of reliable emotional signals helps answer the basic political question of how it is that unrelated human beings can come to trust and hence cooperate with each other in civic life.ROBERT FRANK AND THE BASIC EMOTION PARADIGM The literature on these topics is enormous.In my essay I want to focus on the claims that have been made about the nature of emotional signaling.One obvious place to begin is with Robert Frank's influential book, Passion Within Reason: The Strategic Role of the Emotions, published more than twenty years ago, in 1988.In that work the author, an economist who combines concerns with game theory and evolutionary psychology, set out to challenge the then commonly accepted view that people always act rationally, which is to say, selfishly, in pursuit of their own financial and other interests.In opposition to such a \"self-interest\" model of human action, Frank proposed a commitment model of behavior.According to Frank's commitment model, our passions predispose us to act \"irrationally.\"By this he meant that our emotions prompt us to act in ways that may be contrary to our own",

      "abstract": "Arousing anxiety is one of the most important instruments of tyranny. Arousing anxiety is a weapon used not only by dictatorial societies, but also by the dictators of the family, school, workplace or organization. The essence of anxiety is the inability to actively control situations perceived as threatening —the experience of this lack of control and the inability to avert the impending threat causes this situation. In the interest of preserving and strengthening their power, the person or group possessing crucial information is able to withdraw the possibility of control, or to portion it out as a reward; in this way anxiety is aroused in those affected. Arousing anxiety is not only an instrument, but can also be the essence of the exercise of power for its own sake. Tyrannical power wishes to ensure full freedom of decision for itself at all times and it therefore does not commit itself, not even in the form of an agreement serving its own interests. This is true for all relationships of dependency in which the more independent partner is able to withhold information, thereby keeping the other partner in a state of “loss of control”. If the plumber does not turn up at the time agreed and does not inform us of this beforehand, if the garage does not repair the car on the grounds of a shortage of spare parts despite the fact that they have parts, we are placed in a state of powerlessness. We encounter various forms of abuse of power and induced anxiety day after day, but do not pay sufficient attention to it, do not recognise it in its essence and do not understand how this slow-acting poison kills. However, we can also arrive at a psychological definition of freedom and democracy through an understanding of the essence of arousing anxiety and of anxiety.",

A great many scientists have reported the use of deception by nonhuman primates. Their accounts have been based on observations of primates in close contact with people, in captive groups, and in the wild. Qualitative descriptions are presented along with experimental evidence for the phenomenon. The accumulated evidence is quite suggestive, implying sophisticated cognitive mechanisms, particularly in the great apes. Primates not only suppress or hide certain signals, but also project false images or seem to react to nonexisting external events to redirect another's attention.

We can notice similarities between human beings and other parts of nature, or differences between them and most other things, or even respects in which they are unique in the world as we know it. Human beings are born and grow and they decline and die. They are the only things in the universe who laugh. Human beings also act. Unlike rocks on a mountainside or branches of a tree, they do not just move, they do things. Other animals also do things, but humans differ from them in the extent to which they think about what to do, and then act as a result of that deliberation. And, not coincidentally, human beings also know things about the world around them. Knowledge is essential to deliberation and to informed action. No one would deny or question these sweeping platitudes about human beings and the human condition. It is equally uncontroversial that humans can become curious and reflect on some of these very general features of human life and try to understand them better. This could be called in the most general sense. Not simply the study of this or that group of human beings, or of this or that social or cultural arrangement among them, but anthropology as the study of human beings in general, or of apparently universal features of human beings or human life as such. If we take an interest in human action in general we might ask what it takes for an event or a movement to count as an action performed by an agent, and how such a thing is possible. The question can be found especially pressing once we acknowledge certain other general facts of the world and understand them in a certain way. Human agency must be understood as occur-",

When one observes the color of the eyes one not in social relationship with the Other.1 Not in a social relationship, one has no chance of engaging the other ethically. Indeed, Rudolf Bernet adds in his gloss on Levinas's remarks, Apprehending the form of the Other's body instead of responding to the infinite demand his 'face' expresses would be both a theoretical and ethical fallacy.2 Eros intensifies the very attention to the flesh that ethics must get beyond, regarding the face not as the site of inexhaustible responsibility provoked by vulnerability, but as a source - perhaps equally inexhaustible - of pleasure, a site for desire in all of its greed and specificity.3 Transcendence encountered through the face seems to imply a sort of theological incarnation, but Robert Gibbs emphasizes that it important to that the divine not made incarnate, even or especially in the face of the other.4 Rather, the other manifests God's transcendence as the space where the difference opens up.5 That unwavering insistence on difference the source of a deeper ethical problem for eros, one that goes beyond its strictly carnal versions. Erotic engagement can blur boundaries; it perhaps the sort of experience in which we are most likely to say that we lose ourselves, and in this we also lose the sharp distinction between other and self so essential to Levinasian ethics. It true that eros in the flesh cannot fuse bodies altogether, but, as Plato long ago had Aristophanes point out, that doesn't mean that it wouldn't like to.6 For Edith Wyschogrod, too, remaining in the immanence of flesh can be a problem, although she's much more direct about also granting the body no small ethical importance - it may well be ethically central. But for her as for the deeper issue with eros ecstasy, and especially the risk of ecstatic fusion. As she emphasizes, The proximity of eros not the proximity of ethics. What - and what, we gather, she fears as well - is the transfer of the intensities of eros to transcendence because the braking power of another's flesh absent and sheer intensity unleashed. No matter how close bodies may be, one distinguishable from the other, but with the transcendent, boundaries disappear. As avers, with Buber in mind, the mystic speaks to himself in the second person, as if he has entered into God.7 This not to claim that never acknowledges eros at all. As Wyschogrod points out, Levinas speaks movingly of the eros of flesh, the pleasures of the caress, which involves one with the other, the near one, but not the Other of ethics.8 Eros all very well in its place, but that place not an ethical one. There eros, and there transcendence, but for they do not work together. Eros disrupts the ethical, but precisely by overcoming the disruption that a boundary creates. …",

Like the total actuality, their coordinative symbol components are specific (corresponding to the coordinative adjustments of the actual thought cell); so the structure of each experience is also specific; it corresponds to the associative series of the actual thought cells (to the structure) and thus to the constitution of the experiencing individual, which can also be called its structure. The hunger actualities are arranged in a wide circle and the anxiety actualities in a narrower one; pain actualities are in twists, sorrow actualities are in short straight lines and joy actualities in long ones. Each experience consists of round and straight series, and the change from round to straight is the threshold.",

      "abstract": "This paper gives us an understanding that we cannot not communicate. In our lives, whether intentionally or unintentionally, we have communicated with the people around us from the moment we are born until we die. Communication is the process of understanding each other's meaning between two fellow humans. Communication occurs when a person's behaviour has been interpreted by others to give meaning to that person's behaviour. That is, we are considered to have communicated if our behavior has been interpreted by others even though we do not intend to convey any message to him. Thus, we cannot avoid communication.The thought that we cannot not communicate can be understood because in communication there are principles of communication, namely: the core content of communication is meaning; meaning is the result of interpretation of behaviour; communication has occurred if someone has interpreted the behaviour of others, both verbal behaviour and nonverbal behaviour, regardless of whether the person is aware or not aware of it; and we cannot control others to interpret or not interpret our behaviour.Communication behaviour can be unintentional or intentional behaviour. Deliberation is not a requirement for communication. Every behavior has communication potential.

Social action, which includes both failure to act and passive acquiescence, may be oriented to the past, present, or expected future behavior of others. Thus it may be motivated by revenge for a past attack, defense against present, or measures of defense against future aggression. Social action is not identical either with the similar actions of many persons or with every action influenced by other persons. Thus, if at the beginning of a shower a number of people on the street put up their umbrellas at the same time, this would not ordinarily be a case of action mutually oriented to that of each other. Purely affectual behavior also stands on the borderline of what can be considered \"meaningfully\" oriented, and often it, too, goes over the line.",

Yet so far the study of such limits has been focused on core systems like attention and memory. Here we explore the limit of self-representation, the ability to represent someone or something as you. Using an associative learning paradigm, we find a limit on a well-known index of self-representation known as the self-reference effect, whereby people perform better for items that they represent as themselves than as others. This effect did not continue to scale additively as people associated stimuli with more than one self-identity at a time (e.g., their younger and older selves). This suggests that even though we can represent various identities as the self, we do so independently in serial.",

      "title": "Hypertrophy versus Hyperplasia",
      "abstract": "Although all tissues and organs of the body are normally subject to the growth-regulating influences of functional demands, some are potentially capable of unlimited growth while others are not. This depends on whether hyperplasia of their functional units ceases prior to maturity or can continue throughout life. In the former case, further growth is limited by the extent to which hypertrophy can enhance physiological efficiency. Some of the body's most vitally essential organs (heart, brain, kidney, lung) lack the ability to make additional structural units in the adult and are therefore handicapped in compensating for the depreciations of advancing age. Theoretically, at least, other organs (glands, renewing tissues) possess unlimited powers of regeneration because they never lose the capacity (latent or expressed) for hyperplasia. There is a strategy in the way growth mechanisms have evolved. It may be significant that the so-called \"hypertrophic\" organs lose the capability for hyperplasia, because not to do so might jeopardize their growth regulation. If size is determined by functional demands, then the latter must not operate continuously lest growth go on without interruption and lead to overproduction of functional units. Only renewing tissues can tolerate perpetual growth because they get rid of excess structures as fast as they are formed. Endocrine and exocrine glands are in most cases known to function discontinuously and are thus not in danger of being overstimulated. The heart, lungs, and kidneys (and brain?), however, must work incessantly. Were their functional units capable of hyperplasia and at the same time subject to control by functional demand, then overgrowth would seem to be inevitable. By giving up the potential for hyperplasia in favor of the necessity for constant function, these organs have adopted a strategy that enables them to become hypertrophic to a limited extent while doing their jobs efficiently. It is a curious fact that the unrestricted proliferation of biological structures cannot occur at all levels of organization. The counterpart of cancer, which is a cellular phenomenon, does not exist among molecules or cytoplasmic organelles, nor is it known to occur at the histological level of organization. Even in organs made up of histological units of function and having the potential for unlimited hyperplasia (for example, liver, exocrine glands, thyroid, ovary), the population of functional units never exceeds the number needed to fulfill the physiological requirements of the body. Above and below the level of the cell, therefore, structures are not permitted to escape the constraints of functional demands which control their production. The fact that cells can occasionally do so when they become neoplastic may reveal as much as it conceals about the problem of growth regulation.",

The terminology generated by such a notional scheme usually takes the form of antithetical doublets (extrovert/introvert, silly/intelligent, etc), selection from which can then map individual instances onto this grid. That grid, the pre-existent notion of what, in this instance, we call character, governs the way we both see and describe people, and may be likened to the schema posited by the art historian, E.H. Gombrich, for the visual arts.1 Artists, he argued, do not simply paint 'what they see'; they see individual objects in terms of 'schemes' or conventional visual representations of them, and they reproduce them by adapting or manipulating that scheme. Similarly, our notions of what constitutes 'character' are to a large extent culturally determined. The accuracy or otherwise of that cultural scheme itself is probably unverifiable, and is not as important as the use made of it in particular contexts to conduct interesting appraisals or make significant discriminations.",

It also seems impossible to make the lists of these characteristics of needs because Love and Belongingness Needs are the sum of hundreds and thousands of elements which have billions of characteristics and effectiveness. Their characteristics are so interrelated and interconnected, that they cannot be segregated from each other. This article will reveal the purity, entity, eternity, morality, stability, reliability, novelty, richness, freshness, aliveness, uniqueness, fairness and worth of the characteristics of the human needs. This will also clear that there should be equity, equality, accuracy, accountability and justice to fill the Love and Belongingness Needs.",

      "abstract": "To assert the primacy of practice is a refusal to accord primacy to language, and this is what is maintained in relation to the emergence of self-consciousness. The effect of asserting it is to make the embodied practices of human beings in the world more important than their social relations for the emergence of selfhood, meaning a continuous sense of self, and for the development of its properties and powers, meaning reflexivity, which only exists in potentia for every neonate. The primacy of practice refers both to its logical and substantive priority in human development. This is not simply a matter of it coming before anything else, though temporally it does just that; it is also a question of viewing language itself as a practical activity, which means taking seriously that our words are quite literally deeds, and ones which do not enjoy hegemony over our other doings in the emergence of our sense of self.",

      "abstract": "The analogy between divine and human personhood derives much of its strength from two different quarters: rationality and relationality. They are not incompatible. Either alone may give a skewed picture. Traditionally, however, rationality has been emphasised, in line with a long philosophical tradition which has also been influential in theology. This view would make personhood primarily a matter of rational qualities of soul and mind.1 Materiality and embodiment would be discounted. Relationality is much broader in its scope. It need not exclude rationality, but, in emphasising that individuality by itself omits a significant and distinctive feature of personhood, namely relationship with others, it also allows for embodiment and temporality to be taken into account. Rationality need not be interpreted narrowly as ‘discursive reason’ or ‘intelligence’, but should include the broader ‘capacity to decide and act freely’. Even so, the rational model remains too narrow. Relationality, which includes, not only the ability to communicate successfully with others and the qualities needed for such communication, but the simple fact of being in relationship, must form an important part of the total picture of personhood. This fact of ‘being in relationship’ will include, not only the foetus and the senile, but so-called inanimate nature. This will not involve an extension of ‘personhood’ to trees and mountains, but will allow the relationship of persons to trees and mountains to be taken into account when trying to understand personhood.",

Based on the explanation in the discussion section, it can be concluded: (1) the terms used in the Qur'an in referring to humans are al-Insan (referring to humans who have special qualities and potential), al-Basyar (referring to humans as biological creatures), and al-Nas (referring to humans as social creatures); (2) The views of the figures on the nature of humans differ but the essence is the same, namely humans as creatures who have different potential from other creatures of Allah; (3) Humans are referred to as ahsan al-taqwin which places humans in a strategic position, namely as servants of Allah and as caliphs of Allah",

We talk of social life, where one seeks enjoyment, sociable life or gregarious life, relating to, connected with, or suited to public or fashionable society, a social event, living or disposed to live in companionship with others, or in community, rather than in isolation and unfriendliness. Social problems are general factors that affect and damage society. A social problem is normally a term used to describe problems within a particular area or a group of people in the world. Social problem often involve problems that affect real life. It also affects how people react to certain situations [1] . Terrorism is psychological strategy of war for gaining political or religious ends by deliberately creating a climate of fear among the population of a State. Terrorism is also defined as the systematic use of terror and terror itself is defined as an alarm, dread, panic, fearfulness [2] . The benefits resulting from combing two or more different groups, people, objects or process or behavior of a system that cannot be predicted by behavior of its parts is called synergy. This work shall seek ways and manner, wherein Law and Social Security shall boost the enhancement of the National Development to the advantage of the citizens. That is where the Law enforcement Agency, through lawful means stop kidnappings and Terrorism. The Nation will be impacted negatively and National development will suffer a decline as nobody would want to remain in a country where life and/or social life, properties will not be secure.

The conventional genre of the consolation mobilized arguments to discourage excessive or prolonged mourning, even as writers recognized that the immediate sense of loss was natural, shared even by animals. What is more, if a beloved friend is another self, then his or her death is a kind of mutilation of one’s own self, and this, as illustrated by Achilles’ mourning over the death of Patroclus, may be the deepest grief of all.",

      "title": "Human infants are aroused and concerned by moral transgressions",
      "abstract": "Humans reason and care about ethical issues, such as avoiding unnecessary harm. But what enables us to develop a moral capacity? This question dates back at least to ancient Greece and typically results in the traditional opposition between sentimentalism (the view that morality is mainly driven by socioaffective processes) and rationalism [the view that morality is mainly driven by (socio)cognitive processes or reason]. Here, we used multiple methods (eye-tracking and observations of expressive behaviors) to assess the role of both cognitive and socioaffective processes in infants’ developing morality. We capitalized on the distinction between moral (e.g., harmful) and conventional (e.g., harmless) transgressions to investigate whether 18-mo-old infants understand actions as distinctively moral as opposed to merely disobedient or unexpected. All infants watched the same social scene, but based on prior verbal interactions, an actor’s tearing apart of a picture (an act not intrinsically harmful) with a tool constituted either a conventional (wrong tool), a moral (producing harm), or no violation (correct tool). Infants’ anticipatory looks differentiated between conventional and no violation conditions, suggesting that they processed the verbal interactions and built corresponding expectations. Importantly, infants showed a larger increase in pupil size (physiological arousal), and more expressions indicating empathic concern, in response to a moral than to a conventional violation. Thus, infants differentiated between harmful and harmless transgressions based solely on prior verbal interactions. Together, these convergent findings suggest that human infants’ moral development is fostered by both sociocognitive (inferring harm) and socioaffective processes (empathic concern for others’ welfare).",

      "title": "Adaptive Behavior and Consciousness",
      "abstract": "Consciousness has resisted scientific explanation for centuries. The main problem in explaining consciousness is accounting for its subjectivity. Subjectivity is an internal point of view or perspective (context) developed from current sensory input and previous experience (perception). Subjective systems may be adaptive; that is, able to respond to change. Humans have the ability to produce voluntary new or novel intentional (adaptive) action and such production is very important for survival. This action is always composed through the choice or free will of the person (voluntary), is always new or novel, and is always directed towards some goal (intentional). Adaptive action is always composed according to the subject‘s point of view or perspective at the moment and is always accompanied by consciousness. Hence the two may be the same. Adaptive action normally arises from perception. Perception directly produces basic programmed action. In order to produce adaptive action, perception must be represented in a new way, so that it becomes explicit, functional, and conscious. This new representation may be accomplished through operation of a positive feedback nonlinear emergent mechanism which is responsible for the generation of a large number of natural phenomena. This mechanism results in the production of explicit stable states from perception which has all the same properties as consciousness and hence may be identical to consciousness. These states are a type of active short term memory and have the ability to produce various types of adaptive action. Consciousness is shown to be natural, material, and functional; utilized in the production of adaptive action.",

As he lies dying with Rama's arrows in him, Vali asks Rama, how he, the epitome of the perfect human, the incarnation of Vishnu, the honourable warrior, could do such a cowardly and unjust thing? Rama replies that it is because Vali had taken the wife of his brother Sugreeva after killing him. Vali says he did not try to kill his brother, that Rama had gotten only one side of the story, and that, in his culture of monkeys, taking care of one's brother's wife after his death was quite common and expected. Besides, why is Rama imposing his human values on him and castigating him and his kind for not following them? Rama tells Vali that he is intelligent enough to know that there are higher ideals, and even if they are human and not monkey ideals, he still expects Vali's kind to meet these higher standards. In effect, Rama is saying: don't give me any of your 'monkey values' argument, what I'm advocating are universal values to which all should aspire. Vali finally acknowledges his inferior way of thinking and concedes that Rama isjustified in shooting him in the back after all; it is his pleasure to die at the hands of such an honourable man and for such a noble cause. This single incident of the Ramayana captures many of the themes contained in this essay.",

Nor can they be clearly distinguished from the feelings discussed in the last chapter under the terms of sneering and defiance. Disgust is a sensation rather more distinct in its nature, and refers to something revolting, primarily in relation to the sense of taste, as actually perceived or vividly imagined; and secondarily to anything which causes a similar feeling, through the sense of smell, touch, and even of eyesight. Nevertheless, extreme contempt, or, as it is often called, loathing contempt, hardly differs from disgust. These several conditions of the mind are, therefore, nearly related; and each of them may be exhibited in many different ways. Some writers have insisted chiefly on one mode of expression, and others on a different mode. From this circumstance M. Lemoine has argued that their descriptions are not trustworthy. But we shall immediately see that it is natural that the feelings which we have here to consider should be expressed in many different ways, inasmuch as various habitual actions serve equally well, through the principle of association, for their expression.",

      "abstract": "Philosophers of Mind often characterize experiences (or sensations) as functional states of an organism. Experiential states-whether somatic states, like having a toothache, or perceptual states, like hallucinating a dagger, are functionally defined in terms of their typical occasions and manifestations (see [4], [14], [16]). Having a toothache is that state which is customarily brought about by damaged or decaying teeth, and which typically results in howls, winces, pain reports, and the like. Being perceptually aware of a dagger is that state characteristically induced in normal observers by retinal irradiation caused by daggers under normal lighting conditions. And so on. That's one way to talk about experience. A well known alternative is the analysis, which embraces a distinction between the act or state of experiencing and the entity which is directly experienced; items such as pains, itches, visual sense-impressions and afterimages are the usual examples of objects with which organisms are, on this view, en rapport during the appropriate experiences. Act-object theories foster well known puzzles: What precisely is the ontological status of sensory objects (whether pains or sense-data)? Do such entities exist when unsensed, or do they just spring into existence concomitant with an appropriate act of experiencing? are they located? How does our knowledge of sensory objects relate to our knowledge of ordinary physical objects? Alternatives to act-object theories, such as the functionalist account, generate fewer metaphysical problems. When the dentist, probing around in my mouth, asks Where exactly is the pain?, we need not construe him as inquiring after the whereabouts of a certain entity, an ache or pain. To have a toothache is to be in a certain experiential state-a state characteristically brought about by damaged dental tissue. When the dentist finds the right tooth-thus sending me through the ceiling-he need not be thought of as having found the place wherein resides a pain; he has rather found the portion of my body causally responsible for my being in the state in question.

A person who achieves this form of existence becomes what Spinoza calls a free man, who lives 'according to the dictate of reason alone' (4pref). Although this ideal consists in the possession of reason or understanding, it is also characterised by the absence of something that Spinoza regards as an imperfection, namely the dominance of affects or passions, whether negative ones such as envy and hatred or their positive counterparts such as love and joy. The passions are therefore viewed as obstacles to freedom, and as long as we are unable to control and transcend them there is a sense in which we are enslaved. 'Man's lack of power to moderate and restrain the affects I call Bondage [servitus]. For the man who is subject to affects is under the control, not of himself, but of fortune, in whose power he so greatly is that often, though he sees the better for himself, he is still forced to follow the worse' (4pref). Correspondingly, only insofar as we counteract our passions can we be said to be free. In defending this alignment of reason with liberty and passion with slavery Spinoza is reiterating an outlook at least as old as Plato, for whom the mind is like a chariot pulled by two horses, one biddable and the other unruly (Plato 1997, 530-33, 253c-7).",

A venerable tradition conceives of reason as a capacity to justify one's beliefs and actions, paradigmatically by deriving them from less-contentious assumptions. Animals face problems of discrimination, and some of them can solve these by distinguishing things according to their properties in a deliberate and considered manner. For the discriminations which underlie animal behavior need not coincide with people verbal classifications, either extensionally – by grouping together the same objects – or intensionally –by grouping objects according to the same properties.

      "title": "Psychological and Biological Perspectives on Altruism",
      "abstract": "This paper presents the case for viewing altruism as an inherent part of human nature. The argument is first made that 'inclusive fitness', the key concept in modern evolutionary biology, dictates that (a) humans are programmed not only to be egoistic but also, under certain conditions, to help another at cost to themselves; and (b) what was selected was not altruistic action but mediators of action, because this provided the necessary flexibility. Psychological evidence is then presented that complements this view. Thus (a) there appears to a general human tendency to help others in distress, which has properties analagous to egoistic motivation and yet comes into play independently of egoistic motivation; and (b) the evolutionary requirements for a mediating mechanism appear to be met by empathy, e.g., it is reliably aroused in humans in response to misfortune in others, it predisposes the individual toward helping action and yet is amenable to perceptual and cognitive control, and its physiological basis may have been present in early humans. The social implications of a biological basis for human altruism are discussed.",

The sense of happynes can be considered as a Stoic ideal – virtue ensures the happynes – or an Epicurian ideal – happynes ensures virtue. In a contemporary ideal version, the coalition betweeen happynes and virtue is considered the greater good. The uncertainty maintained by the lack of coherence and depth of the modern society rhythms is the source of a persistent individual feeling of incompleteness and lack of sense, as well as the burden of free governing his own life. Pathological personalities from cluster B have a limited access to happynes, because they think of it as a “virtue”, which they are looking for all their life in a selfish and anarchic way, but outside themselves, and at the same time always considering unhappy.",

This inherent centeredness biases our experience of our own needs, desires, interests, beliefs, goals, and values as being more immediate and urgent than those of others’, manifesting in a natural self-orientation that—if left unchecked—can lead us to problematically privilege, prioritize, and favor ourselves. The central thesis presented here is that the interfering and distorting influences that arise from this centeredness are most effectively combated, and ultimately quieted, through the cultivation of humility. And further, that humility should be considered a foundational virtue, necessary for the full development and exercise of other virtues, and maturely virtuous character.",

      "abstract": "Human machine teaming has, for decades, been conceptualized as a function allocation (FA) or levels of autonomy (LOA) process: the human is suited for some tasks, while the machine is suitable for others, and as machines improve they take over duties previously assigned to humans.A wide variety of methods-including adaptive, adjustable, blended, supervisory and mixed initiative control, implemented discretely or continuously, as potential fields, as virtual fixture interfaces, or haptic interfaces-are derivatives of FA/LOA.We formalize FA/LOA (and all their derivatives) under a single mathematical formulation called classical shared control (CSC).Despite the widespread adoption of CSC, we prove that it fails to optimize human and robot agreement and intent if either the human or robot model displays \"intention ambiguity\" (e.g., the human's intended goal is unclear or the robot finds multiple viable solutions).Practically, this suboptimality can manifest as unnecessary and unresolvable disagreement (an unnecessary deadlock).For instance, if the robot chooses to go left around an obstacle and the human chooses to go right, CSC only provides two solutions: freeze in place or collide with the obstacle (we provide a wide variety of failure examples in [52], https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.09490).We find that CSC suboptimality stems from arbitrating over model samples, rather than over models.Our key insight is thus to arbitrate over human and robot distributions; we prove this method optimizes human and robot agreement and intent and resolves deadlocking.Our key contribution is computationally efficient distribution arbitration: if the human and robot carry N h t and N R t \"intentions,\" the joint (naively) has N h t N R t intentions.In our approach, deadlock solutions have vanishingly small coefficients and only N min = arg min{N h t , N R t } non-zero coefficients remain: our joint has fewer modes than the individual agent models.We call our approach N min -sparse generalized shared control.",

      "abstract": "Anarchy is rarely or never upheld with consistency. In the pedagogy of Rousseau, there is a set purpose to let the child be guided by natural necessity rather than by human command, and to let him learn from the experience of physical facts rather than by obedience. “Keep the child solely dependent on things; you will have followed the order of Nature in the process of his upbringing. Never oppose to his unreasonable wishes any but physical obstacles or punishments resulting from the actions themselves — he will remember these punishments in similar situations. It is enough to prevent him from doing evil without forbidding him to do it …” (Emile, II). Remarkably, the theory that the method of authority is a poor substitute for the pedagogical power of nature has been accepted, in varying degree of enthusiasm or reluctance, by most schools of pedagogy and has demonstrated lasting power. Yet the authority of parents and tutors is present throughout pedagogical theories, even when it is passed over in silence. Childhood is the domain where the suppression of all authority is obviously impossible. The most radical constructs of anarchy, as soon as they rise above the level of idle rhetoric, admit of qualifications so far at least as the immature part of mankind is concerned. Anti-authoritarian theorists, with few exceptions if any, do not mean that authority should disappear or that it can ever cease to be a factor of major importance in human affairs. What thinkers opposed to authority generally mean is that authority can never be vindicated except by such deficiencies as are found in children, in the feeble-minded, the emotionally unstable, the criminally inclined, the illiterate, and the historically primitive.",

This paper argues that an ideal of love for all can be understood apart from its more typical religious contexts and moreover provides a unified and illuminating account of the the nature and grounds of morality. I defend a novel account of love for all that avoids serious worries about the incoherence or impossibility of loving everyone. Doing so requires countenancing a neglected form of love. Love admits as its object not just individual entities like people and groups; we can also bear a love for the Fs in general—for all the Joneses, all the philosophers, or even all the human beings. I go on to argue that while it is possible for ordinary agents like us to love all, we shouldn't. Instead, we should approximate love for all. The minimal approximation of love for all is, surprisingly, respect; I derive the basic, structural features of deontological ethics (including anti‐paternalism and anti‐aggregation) from the ideal of loving all.",

For God to be over against the creature as an other who might threaten its autonomy in this way would imply a gap between God’s will and creaturely substance that is inconsistent with creation ex nihilo , according to which creatures are other than God, but God, as the exclusive ground of creaturely existence, is ‘Not other’ than they. This point disrupts the relationships of privation or dependence that mark inner‐worldly acts of creating. To be (always only partly) dependent on a created other is indeed to be revealed as less than sufficient unto oneself; but to be (wholly) dependent on the ‘Not other’ is to be fully sufficient to fulfil the promise of one’s existence.",

A case is presented which illustrates this definition of remorse, and suggests a therapeutic approach which involves distinguishing remorse from feelings of guilt, shame, and depression; and which then proceeds to respond to the remorseful person as one would to someone with other sorrow, with the understanding that, once experienced, sorrows remain with a person throughout one's life.",

      "abstract": "Aristotle's Forbidden Sweets JAMES BOGEN JULIUS MORAVCSIK I To ACT INCONTINENTLYis to do what one knows or strongly believes is not to be done (NE 1146b25-31).' Is incontinence possible? It is clear that one can do what one knows or believes is not to be done if one does it unintentionally or unknowingly. A man's conviction that champagne should not be spilled on the dress of the wife of his college's president will not prevent him from spilling it on her if he is tripped or if he mistakes her for someone else on whom champagne should be spilled. But Aristotle's question is whether a man can freely and intentionally do what he knows or believes he should not do when he realizes what it is that he is doing. Speaking very generally, Aristotle's answer is that a man may have knowledge or beliefs that have no influence on what he does on a particular occasion. For example, a man who is gripped by uncontrollable anger may fail to recall or consider something he knows or believes and so may act against that belief or bit of knowledge (1146b32ff.). In cases in which a belief or bit of knowledge plays no part in, determining an agent's behavior, incontinence is possible. It is only in cases where the belief or knowledge plays a fully active role in the determination of a man's action that incontinence is impossible (1146b35). Unfortunately, the details of Aristotle's view are less clear than its outline. How can we be said to retain a belief or bit of knowledge when it does not The authors constitute The West Coast Ancient Philosophy Collective. The general lines of this interpretation come from a meeting of the Northern California Aristotle reading group attended by the authors and Alan Code, David Glidden, Richard McKirahan, and Henry Mendell . Details of the interpretation came from comments from J. O. Urmson and extensive discussion with Charles Young, who made so many valuable and helpful suggestions that we offered him honorary membership in the collective, which he declined, saying that he preferred to appear in a footnote. 1 Unless otherwise noted, all references are to passages in the Nicomachaean Ethics (NE). [11:1 112 HISTORY or PHILOSOPHY determine our behavior? Which sorts of belief or knowledge are inactive in the incontinent man? In the Nicomachaean Ethics the most detailed discussion of a case of incontinence and the best place to look for the specifics of Aristotle's account is the following difficult and often discussed passage. [l] Again, we may also look to the cause of incontinence scientifically [physikos] in this way: On the one hand there is a universal belief, while the other belief is concerned with particular things over which perception is immediately authoritative [KvQi(~]. When one belief arises out of these it is necessary [&v~yKTI]in one case for the mind to affirm the conclusion, and with beliefs concerned with conduct [~v 8~ ~(~g z~QCtK~tKCffg] ~ one must act straightway. [1147a~4-28 ] [2] For example, if one should taste everything sweet, and this thing is sweet, being one of those particular things, then a man who is able and not being prevented must of necessity do this immediately. [ x147a28- 31 ] [3] And so, when there is in the mind one universal belief which forbids tasting, and another belief that every sweet thing is pleasant, and this is sweet (and this belief is active), then when desire happens to be present, the one belief tells us to avoid this, but desire leads us to it (for it can move each of the parts). 3 l1147a3t-35] [4] And so it turns out that one acts incontinently in some way under a principle or belief which is not in itself but is only incidentally opposed to the right belief [~ 8Q00~ L6y~] (for it is the desire and not the belief which is opposed). 4 [1147a35 lt47b2 ] [5] That is why animals are not incontinent; they do not have a grasp of universals, but they have only mental images and memories of particular things.

However, one might think that, strictly speaking, the perceptual language here is misleading. One might, that is, think that when we say things like this, we do not really mean that the other's state of mind is perceptible in the same way that ordinary objects in our visual field are perceptible. Rather, to say, ‘I see the anger in his face’, is to offer a kind of shorthand for something like this: I see him make a facial expression that people commonly make when angry, and so infer that he is angry. So, ordinary locutions such as ‘I see the anger in his face’ are misguided. They imply that emotions, like ordinary objects, are perceptible, and that behaviours that express our emotions enable non-inferential knowledge of them by others. But in fact there is no literal perception of emotions; at most what is perceived are behaviours that express the emotions, and our knowledge of others’ emotions is always mediated by our knowledge of other things, so that, even in paradigmatic cases where we take ourselves to recognize someone's emotion in their behaviour directly, what we do is infer the presence and character of the emotion on the basis of behavioural evidence.",

Perceptions are connected with a specific organ or part of the body and sensations such as hunger or thirst are sometimes characteristically located in parts of the body. Emotions, however, are neither connected with organs nor characteristically felt in specific parts of the body (pp. 57–58). Kenny rightly points out that emotions and sensations are alike in one important respect, namely they are both linked to characteristic forms of expression. He then says “ … the existence of characteristic expre5sions of emotion itself provides a further link between emotion and sensations: for the expression characteristic of each emotion—e.g., weeping—is itself felt, and this feeling is a genuine sensation” (p. 59).",

      "title": "Imaginary Love in the Context of Emotional Consumption: A Levinasian Perspective",
      "abstract": "This article analyses love that emerges in dancing clubs, by integrating Emmanuel Levinas' ethics of face with sociological theories on emotional consumption. The seemly ideal appearance of a strip dancer with which a regular customer falls in love is not a true display of her authentic self, but rather a mask, which is a product of her emotional labor, sold to increase her income. The customer develops emotional ties with this fabricated persona and desires her love in return. In a commercial context, the customer often fails to recognize her complex subjectivity and to welcome her true otherness. He exploits her emotional labor, while she manipulates his emotions for money. His love, which is predicated on an imaginary foundation, cannot sustain outside of dance clubs. A \"mask\" and a Levinasian \"face\" may share the same physical body yet have distinct personalities, and can thus be confusing. Levinas' ethics calls for our immediate responsibility in the face of the Other. However, not all appearances of the Other are authentic. Sometimes it is even part of one's job to be disguised, such as in the case of strip dancers, actors, etc. It is vital to first identify and embrace the Other's true face before engaging in a relationship which requires mutual responsibility.",

While I very much welcome the stress his article places on good welfare being much more than just the satisfaction of health and survival needs, I am also concerned that he may have done a disservice to non-mammalian species by implying that none of them have behavioural needs comparable to those of mammals. He acknowledges that birds are intelligent and have considerable learning abilities but then argues that this does not imply the existence of behavioural needs. On what grounds, then, does he attribute such needs to mammals and not to birds?",

      "title": "Autism and the Imagination",
      "abstract": "We associate much with the imagination: the power to evoke images of absent objects and people, to generate inner pictures of past events or memories, and to create artistic representations of important experiences and desires. We attribute the highest order of moral, intellectual, and emotional growth to the ability to engage the imagination; we see \"imaginative play\" as necessary for the development of empathy and thus healthy familial and social bonds. In art, such associations and attributions arise from a history of understanding the imagination as more than the passive ability to recollect images and instead as an active and transformative faculty of the mind. Ralph Waldo Emerson, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, and others argued that, through the productive or constructive power of the imagination, we literally create the world by giving order or larger meaning to seemingly disparate and discrete elements. In light of these notions, an impaired imagination might manifest itself in a lack of empathy, literal-mindedness, or a tendency to get caught up in the individual and distinct impression. Within a continuum of definitions that elevate the liberating (and humanizing) nature of the imagination, such qualities suggest profound limitations-and a vision of the world that closes off the possibility of great art and wisdom.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Consumers construct and maintain self-concepts through the use of branded consumer products. Yet product choice not only reflects an actual or desired image of the self but can also directly influence a person’s sense of self and even boost self-esteem. The aesthetics of a product is an attribute that has the power to transform how consumers perceive themselves. The mere act of choosing a beautiful product over a less good-looking one affirms people’s sense of self - who they are and what their values are. It goes beyond personal image building and self-presentation; its impact is also turned inwards. Choice of high design works as a unique form of affirmation. It works unconsciously, and high design may even be a particularly powerful form of affirmation precisely because its relationship to the self and one’s values is not obvious. And design is more powerful than other features in this respect. Comfort and ease of use, taste and brand do not have the same self-affirming quality as design. It is not simply that “treating” oneself or going for the pleasurable option has an affirming effect; it is specific to the choice of aesthetics.",

No obstante, el comportamiento que es producto de la evolución, incluido el de otros animales, no está completamente desprovisto de normatividad. Si se define la normatividad como la adhesión a un ideal o estándar, existe amplia evidencia de que los animales tratan a sus relaciones sociales de esta manera. En otras palabras, persiguen valores sociales. En este artículo reviso la evidencia sobre el hecho de que los primates no humanos intentan activamente preservar la armonía dentro de su red social, por ejemplo, reconciliándose después de un conflicto, protestando contra las divisiones desiguales y deteniendo peleas. Al hacerlo, corrigen las desviaciones respecto de un estado ideal. Sumado a ello, y con el fin de prevenir tales desviaciones, muestran autocontrol emocional y resolución anticipada de conflictos. El reconocimiento de la orientación hacia una meta y el carácter normativo del comportamiento social animal nos permite cerrar parcialmente la brecha entre el ‘es’ y el ‘debe’ erigida en relación con el comportamiento moral humano.",

In explaining this phenomenon in terms of an intimate relation of self-attribution or the like, I infer that a typical human person has direct consciousness of itself through inner awareness or personal memory. Direct consciousness of oneself is consciousness of oneself, but not by consciousness of something else. Yet, a perduring human person, Sp, i.e., a human person with temporal parts, is identical with the complete series of its temporal parts. I argue that because Sp is diverse from any incomplete series of its Sp cannot be conscious of all of its temporal parts through inner awareness or personal memory, Sp cannot have direct consciousness of itself. I conclude that a human person endures, i.e., wholly exists at each of the times it exists.",

      "title": "The Forgotten Message of the Infant Smile.",
      "abstract": "Few developmental phenomena enjoy the universality, inevitabil ity, and temporal determinancy of the infant smile—features that beguile the layman and bedevil the experimenter. In attempting to account for the various factors that control smiling and the it plays in human behavior, we face immediately the communication vs. expression issue, the question of whether to emphasize the effect of smiling on outsiders or the meaning of smiling for the insider, a simple point often overlooked or confused in the literature. Consider first the adult smile. As an outsider, we interpret the smile of another person (leaving aside the rare nervous smile) to mean simply that he has experienced a positive change in feeling. It may be because he is happy to see us, because he has appreciated a twist of humor, because he has mastered a problem, and so on. The social role of the smile here is to communicate to others something about the in feeling of the smiler. To the insider, if my introspections have any validity, the outsider's perceptions are fairly veridical. Treatments of infant smiling have traditionally weighed heavily the external aspects of smiling, one of which is the effect of infant smiling on others. Bowlby (1969) has rightly pointed out the value of smiling for the attachment of mother to infant. I would claim, inci dentally, that this virtue is not unique to the infant; people tend throughout life to be attracted to smilers no matter what their age. Another effect of the infant smile is to signal others that they are doing something right; mothers, fathers, and siblings will perform any number of antics to maintain the infant smile. A second ex ternal aspect of smiling has interested investigators. Smiling has frequently been treated relatively mechanically as either a triggered response, in the ethological tradition, to eyes, to faces, to voices, to jouncing or, in the operant tradition, as a response to be reinforced or extinguished. Amazingly enough, little has been said about what the smile",

Within psychology, on the other hand, surrender’s position has been likened to an “unwanted bastard child,” and its research has been neglected. Moreover, when occurring in the context of a relationship with another person, the terms “submission” and “obedience,” laden with negative connotations, have been commonly used. We propose that psychologically and spiritually developmental surrender is a common experience both when it occurs in relationship to “reality,” the Self or God, and in the context of relationship with another person, as in love, sex, patientship, followership, and discipleship. We focus on surrender to a spiritual master, which is in some respects the most extreme form of surrender to another person and the most challenging for the modern secular worldview to accept and suggest that, with all its complexity and potential pitfalls, it can be a powerful enabler and facilitator of the search for the sacred, self-transcendence, and spiritual integration.",

Little research on their meaning, how they develop, and how individual differences arises have been conducted, even though Charles Darwin discussed them in some detail as far back as his book, The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals..Darwin’s observations were not followed up by neither psychoanalysis nor developmental psychopathology until about 40 years ago. In part, this was due to Freud’s focus on guilt and on the confusion between such self-conscious emotions as embarrassment, guilt and shame. In fact, Darwin’s observations and theorizing were not able to differentiate these different selfconscious emotions, in large part due to his measurement of the self-conscious emotions, where he used blushing behaviour. While blushing is a useful behaviour to measure, many people do not blush. Moreover, blushing is a measure of self reflection in the presence of other people, most noticeable embarrassment, but is not a measure of all the other self-conscious emotions such as shame, guilt or pride. While Darwin recognized the role of a person’s thoughts, especially around the emotion of embarrassment, he did not use cognitive capacities as a way to differentiate between them.",

While modelling the systems experimentally, it is impossible to reproduce consciousness phenomena. This fact points to the global differences in the principles of management of living systems as compared to the artificial ones. Due to the existence of various forms of consciousness (from the simplest forms, such as sensing, perception, and feeling to the most complicated ones, such as motivation and desire), the living organisms are capable to interpret the complex neurodynamics of the brain into a simple and functionally significant integral form for them. Owing to consciousness, the behavior of living systems at the highest level of evolution (a human being) becomes an indeterminate behavior with the clearly expressed position of will freedom; it is also important that through consciousness an individual can influence different physiological mechanisms of living organisms.",

      "abstract": "Maximizing Prudent Behavior (practicing the Virtue of Prudence) is what Smith means by the concept of self-interest (caring for one’s self). The primacy of the virtue of Prudence was established by Aristotle based on earlier discussions by Plato. All of the other major founders of different systems of virtue ethics (for example, Confucius or Buddha or Aquinas) have emphasized prudence, since it is not possible to give anything to anyone else if you have not been successful in attaining income or financial resources yourself. There can thus never be any conflict between Self-interest (Prudence) and Benevolence (Beneficence), since these virtues deal with different situations confronted by a follower of virtue ethics at different times in their lives. Applying the virtue of Beneficence can only possibly occur after the practice of prudence has been implemented successfully. There will always be a significant lag in time during which the prudent individual has been successful in attaining financial resources and circumstances occurring which will allow him/her to later practice beneficence. Only after they have successfully attained significant financial resources through prudent behavior will they be in a position to practice benevolence (beneficence). Smith would have considered it obvious that the baker, brewer and butcher had to practice the virtue of prudence first, and be successful, before that could practice the virtue of benevolence (beneficence) second.",

We are trying to understand what are the pillars of the relationship with the Others, and the dictators’ great seduction capacity. In the condition of the incapacity and inability of these personalities to appreciate humanity, most of them were able to provoke admiration.

Consequently, evildoers—which, in the popular imagination, include evil spirits, perpetrators of satanic ritual abuse, and serial killers—pose the ultimate threat. People may therefore resort to extreme measures (like potentially lethal exorcism attempts) to resist, punish, or destroy them. Places and things, by virtue of their association with evildoers and/or their capacity to evoke raw negative feelings such as dread, can sometimes function as evil symbols.",

Today more than ever, above all in political language, good and evil (especially the latter) are omnipresent terms, imminent personifications of our fears and hopes. Not as adverbs,1Close which would perhaps be grammatically correct—such as in the common expressions “How is it going? Good, thanks, not bad”; or, “Today was a bad day”—but as substantives, as if one were dealing with rather precise beings to encourage or to fight. They were good times when “Evil” [Il male] could be used as the title of a satirical newspaper; today no one would ever think up such a title. Today, usually by carrying out—even in good faith—an ideological falsification, one speaks increasingly often of a struggle between good and evil, of an “evil empire” from which we must defend ourselves, that we will have to isolate and render harmless. This also occurs often by pointing out that whoever does not believe that the adverb refers to a noun has become an instrument of the devil, whose cunning consists precisely (like that of the mafia) in making one believe that he does not exist.",

      "title": "Cognitive Robotic Engine: Behavioral Perception Architecture for Human-Robot Interaction",
      "abstract": "For personal or domestic service robots to be successful in market, it is essential for them to have capability of natural and dependable interaction with human. However, such a natural and dependable human-robot interaction (HRI) is not so easy to accomplish, as it involves a high level of robotic intelligence for recognizing and understanding human speech, facial expression, gesture, behavior, and intention as well as for generating a proper response to human with artificial synthesis. It is our view that first key step toward a successful deployment of HRI is to level up dependability of a robot for recognizing intention of human counterpart. For instance, to date, robotic recognition of human speech, as well as human gestures, facial expressions, let alone human intention, is still quite unreliable in a natural setting, despite tremendous effort by researchers to perfect machine perception. We observe that robustness and dependability human enjoys in human-human interaction may not merely come from fact that human has powerful perceptual organs such as eyes and ears but human is capable of executing a series of behaviors associated with a perceptual goal, for instance, behaviors related to collection of additional evidences till decision is sufficiently credible. In analogy, we claim here that dependability of robotic recognition of human intention for HRI may not come from perfection of individual capabilities for recognizing speech, gesture, facial expression, etc. But, it comes with automatic generation of robotic behaviors that makes sure of reaching a credible decision for given perceptual goal.We present here “Cognitive Robotic Engine (CRE)” that automatically generates such perceptual behaviors as selecting and collecting an optimal set of evidences, for dependable and robust recognition of human intention under a high level of uncertainty and ambiguity. CRE is to demonstrate that dependability of robotic perception may not come from the perfection of individual components for perception, but from the integration of individual components into dependable system behaviors, no matter how imperfect and uncertain individual components may be. CRE presents a novel robotic architecture featuring 1) spontaneous establishment of ad-hoc missions in connection to perceptual goals, 2) determination of an optimal set of evidences to be selected and/or collected for processing based on in-situ monitoring of current situation, 3) integration of such behavioral building blocks as mission management, evidence selection, evidence",

      "abstract": "Human dignity encapsulates the notion that every person has equal worth. This simple but profound concept has two elements. First, each person – every member of the human family – has value; no one can be dismissed, ignored, mistreated, or abused as if their humanity means nothing. Dignity means that each person’s humanity means something and has worth. Each person has a right to live as if his or her life matters and to be treated “as a person.” And second, each person’s worth is equal to every other person’s. No one’s life is more important than any other person’s. If each person’s right to agency, to self-development, to choose one’s life course is the same as every other’s, then no one can determine another person’s choices, treat another as an object, or treat a person as if his or her life does not matter. Despite our differences, in our humanity, we are all equal. It is in dignity that we are united.",

      "title": "Cooley's Contribution to American Social Thought",
      "abstract": "The living social reality was for Cooley the society of which he was a part, which he approached by objective introspection. Society is an affair of a consciousness that is necessarily social. The self is not a presupposition of consciousness but arises in communication and is dependent on others who are as immediate as the self. In imagination both self and other have their origin. Public consciousness is the organization of the separate individual experiences. The self is not an immediate character of the mind, for we are not first individual and then social; the mind itself arises through communication. This represents an advance on Baldwin, Tarde, and even James. A self that can reach other selves only through the interpretation of states of consciousness can never be primarily a social self. A difficulty arises when the parallelism of \"ordinary psychology\" is accepted by Cooley. His ethical views ignored primitive impulses and insisted on standards already established. He was not interested in the scientific study of society. But does not the self belong to an objective phase in the tendency to take the role of another? Cooley did not find selves and society arising in primitive processes of communication so that he could grasp their reality in early human behavior. His sociology was in a sense an account of the American community to which he belonged. The gospel of Jesus and democracy were of the essence of it. But if we carry back the social behavior to a point which antedates the psychical as distinct from an outer world, it is to this primitive behavior that one can trace the social patterns that produce society as well as to criticism and reconstruction. To this type of analysis Cooley's assumption closes the door. But Cooley's establishment of the self and others on the same plane of reality and his impressive study of the primary group are positive accomplishments for which we are profoundly indebted.",

      "title": "Features of the structural organization of the identity of the borderline personality",
      "abstract": "The article is devoted to the analysis of the features of the structural organization of individuals who are organized borderline. At the psychotherapeutic reception today, borderline organized personalities make up a significant proportion. The given data indicate that the proportion of such individuals in the population can reach 25%, and at least twice as much at the reception of a psychotherapist. Therefore, knowing the characteristics of these personalities is useful, and is the basis for successful psychotherapy. The personal identity of borderline individuals is described as diffuse: instability and variability of ideas about themselves and the world, values, goals, desires, inconsistent and contradictory behavior associated with the actualization of various \"split\" parts of their identity. Another important feature of such people is polarization - \"black and white\" perception, when he perceives himself and others either only as \"good\" or only as \"bad\": they are not able to perceive themselves and others in the unity of bad and good. Their world can either stably split into bad and good objects, or the same objects at one time are only good, and at another - only obnoxious. Such people do not have a stable and articulated self-concept, they do not know what they want, what they strive for, experiencing an “emptiness” that cannot be filled inside. This may manifest itself in the fact that they cannot decide on professional interests, areas of employment, choice of a partner, etc. At the same time, there is no description in the literature of specific phenomena of the organization of the identity of a person with a borderline organization. We used the case analysis, as such, which describes the individual feature of the structural organization of identity. As a result, specific features of the personal identity of borderline organized individuals were revealed: ego-dystonicity of some parts of the identity; their insufficient articulation; their irrational organization according to the type of mystery and magic; polarization and contrariety of parts of identity; their fantasies coming from some parts of their identity cannot be translated into reality; parts of identity exist in different chronological spaces, which deprives them of the possibility of communication and internal dialogue; the parts of the identity themselves are internally heterogeneous, contradictory, inconsistent; identity is characterized by the presence of some \"closed\" parts that are internally negatively connoted (shame, fear, etc.) and have no opportunities for manifestation.",

It has its own linguistic status and its own lexical base (lexis of destruction). This category and its lexical stock occupy a significant place in the general classification of lexemes of the Russian and Serbian languages. The terms ?destruction? and ?destructiveness? almost always refer to negative, destructive actions, processes or phenomena. The main characteristics of destruction in the broadest sense include: change, deformation, disintegration of something; structural changes under the impact of various forces (physical, mechanical, spontaneous) or humans. The result of destruction is usually the destruction of something (partial or complete). The semantic field of destructiveness contains verbs at its core, and the peripheral part consists of nouns, adjectives, adverbs and other terminological vocabulary with destructive semantics. The central unit of such a verb-centric field is the verb destroy, which forms the semantic basis of many other lexemes in this category.",

He would probably have said something along the lines of: “I didn't really have time to think about it. I simply reacted. It felt right. I think anybody else would have done the same thing.” While the drama and seriousness of that particular scenario is not an everyday occurrence, the act of unreflectively doing something because it “feels right” is fairly commonplace. Such simple acts of kindness as giving a homeless person some spare change, giving a stranger directions, or helping someone up who has fallen on an icy pavement don't generally involve careful reflection and analysis. Instead, they seem to involve a feeling, perhaps of sympathy, empathy, care, or an unidentifiable sense of the “right thing to do,” and a corresponding action that seems to flow automatically.",

      "title": "The Peculiar Temporality of Violence: a Source of Perplexity about Social Power",
      "abstract": "Abstract Most national myths of origin begin with some transcendent or sacrificial story of violent revolution, warfare or liberation. This is also true of many origin myths of ethnic, tribal or other forms of social identity. This makes it appear that some act of violence is the cause of their coming into being. This paper argues that this is an artefact of the temporal 'peculiarity' of violence. Violent events, it is argued, are essentially unpredictable even when statistically probable. This means that violence is only 'visible' after the fact, and rarely before and that plausible causal models can rarely be constructed in advance. Violence is always seen in retrospect, then, and where it has caused significant death and destruction, it requires that we begin to make sense of what caused it. Unlike other planned or and emotionally charged social interactions (such as eating, sexuality, ritual) acts of violence interrupt (disrupt, breach, rupture, break, etc.) and terminate parts or all of previous social relations. Since the cause of violence can only be assigned retrospectively, this means that we must (re-)construct the past in a way that allows us to make sense of it. Where some violent event is followed by the eventual emergence of a new identity, the new identity is often explained as having 'originated' in violence. This implies that violence caused the new social identity in some way, and that it functions as a political instrument. But violence can only create a void, and is chaotic. After violence, we require the (re-)telling of the past in a new way. This makes violence appear at the beginning of narratives of origin, but does not imply that violence caused these identities. Since large scale violence leads cultural loss and to large scale social (re)construction, narratives of identity tend to begin at these moments in time. This account of violence seeks, therefore, to undermine the notion that violence is an efficient or final cause of social forms.",

      "abstract": "Here is a simple and appealing idea about the way people decide whether an object belongs to a category: The object is a member of the category if it is sufficiently similar to known category members. To put this in more cognitive terms, if you want to know whether an object is a category member, start with a representation of the object and a representation of the potential category. Then determine the similarity of the object representation to the category representation. If this similarity value is high enough, then the object belongs to the category; otherwise, it does not. For example, suppose you come across a white three-dimensional object with an elliptical profile; or suppose you read or hear a description like the one I just gave you. You can calculate a measure of the similarity between your mental representation of this object and your prior representation of categories it might fit into. Depending on the outcome of this calculation, you might decide that similarity warrants calling the object an egg, perhaps, or a turnip or a Christmas ornament.",

      "abstract": "Every person acquires a worldview, a picture of reality. Within that picture, the existence of some things will be taken wholly for granted as the background to, and support of, everything else. Their existence will rarely be questioned. The cosmos or universe, the gods, God, Brahman, Heaven, the Absolute--R. T. Allen claims that all these and other world- views have been held to be that which necessarily exists and upon which all other beings depend in one way or another.European philosophers, since antiquity, have offered arguments to show that their chosen candidates for the role of the necessary being or beings that support the rest of reality do actually exist. The Necessity of God sets the valid core of previous ontological arguments. It does not and cannot prove that God exists, but only that something necessarily exists. In an a priori manner and without inferring anything from what in fact exists, Allen proceeds to show that which necessarily exists is one, transfinite, eternal, and the archetype of personal existence: in short, that it is God as classically conceived. As for everything else that may exist, it must be finite and dependent for its existence upon God as its creator and sustainer.Few things are more erroneous in philosophy and disastrous in practice than artificial constructions produced without constant reference to concrete reality. That which necessarily exists may be the one exception. Before this constructive argument, Allen examines previous examples of ontological arguments in order to show exactly where they go wrong and to extract the valid core obscured within them. This will make clear the difference between them and his new version. The reader who is eager to engage the philosophical sources of belief will find a distinct treasure in The Necessity of God.",

This patholgical experience was analysed in comparison with that in one case reported in Japan.1) The patient could actually see his own thoughts or images which occurred in his mind and could change the scene or the things seen in front of his eyes according to his own will. However, he could not recognize things seen as they existed in the real world, nor see highly abstract ideas such as philosophy, realism, etc.2) The experience of the seeing of his own thoughts was considered to be an eidetic image, but he did not appear to be a man with an eidetic disposition.3) Upward eye movements were observed concomitant with the seeing of his own thoughts. However, such eye movements did not occur at the time when he did not experience such visions. Duning close observation for over 2.5 years, there was an apparent relationship between the pathological experience of these visions and the eye movements.4) A large nystagmus to the left was apparent regardless of the absence or presence of the vision.5) The slow eye deviation in the OKP test was inhibited when he experienced the seeing of his own thoughts, but was normally produced when he did not have such experiences. Smooth pursuit in the eye tracking test and normal responses in the caloric test were obtained regardless.These findings suggest that the pathological experience of the seeing of his own thoughts is closely related to abnormal functions of the oculomotor system.",

Humans from the Islamic perspective will still be born in a state of fitrah, namely holy, clean, free from all sins, and have a tendency to accept religion, faith and monotheism. Whether humans become good or bad is a result of education and environmental factors, not their original character.

Apart from being a religion of nature, Islam is also in accordance with human religious instincts and even supports the needs and development of nature.",

One's attitude towards life will be the result of the interaction between these external factors and one's psyche. These events, however, constellate complexes, which are specific to the individual. The complexes constellated in one's psyche direct his/her perception and apperception of the world. Destiny and Fate are two words which relate to important situations in life. Destiny gives us the sense of something to be achieved, while Fate has the sense of some tragedy that occurred to us. We may say that if someone can connect to the archetypal background of what happens to him, he/she will be in contact with the structures of the psyche which guides human life; therefore, one may find meaning in what has happened (what can be seen as salvation). However, if one does not relate to the totality of the psyche and is blocked in the negative aspects of the event, he/she will be isolated from psyche's creative potential and, therefore, will relate to it as fate (what can be seen as damnation).",

      "abstract": "It is quite often, wittingly or unwittingly, that people assume society, even the state, as person. They talk about society in a way as if it shares same attributes with human being: can be sick (as if it has body), can think (as if it has mind), can speak (as if it has mouth), for example. It is quite obvious that this gesture implies a view of society as an agglomeration of individuals. The problem arises around the legitimacy of this gesture: namely, to analogize the society as individuals always implies a logical leap. Things even get murkier when this gesture is applied even more to the way in which people recognize the state: as collectivities, as a &ldquo;big-person.&rdquo; This gesture, which has methodological impact, is what the author call &lsquo;anthropomorphism analogy&rsquo;. By doing what the author call psychogenealogy&mdash;a mixture of Lacanian psychoanalysis and Foucauldian genealogy, that is a way at seeing history as constituted by various contestation of materialization of desire&mdash;to the history of the modern state, namely, modern sovereign state, the author seeks to remedy this analogy with an objective account. The purpose is not to side with the analogy, but to prove that it is invalid not because it is scientifically inadequate, but that it is a true correspondence: state is person. &nbsp; Keywords: Anthropomorphism analogy, state, sovereignty, psychogenealogy, desire, anxiety",

      "title": "Patientia Regina: Patience as Character from the Morality Play to Jacobean Tragedy",
      "abstract": "Patientia Regina: Patience as Character from the Morality Play to Jacobean Tragedy The suffering o f a patient m a n , though morally admirable, is not the stuff o f drama. Kleanor Prosser, Hamlet and Revenge (70) Literary character and ethical abstraction will generate each other. Character, as an amalgam of personality traits, implies a whole human being, say Macbeth. Ethical abstraction, say Ambition, is a reduction and disambiguation of human behavior. As readers and writers we are gener­ ally dissatisfied with abstraction per se—and bored with unaugmented naturalistic behavior. John Donne, for example, disdains that love which is a disembodied General: But since my soule, whose child love is, Takes limmes of flesh, and else could nothing doe, More subtile than the parent is, Love must not be, but take a body t o o . ( Air and Angels 7-10) Ideas will find no rest in his imagination; virtue without human form is pretense. Yet, how often the creative imagination channels the disparate facets of a character's behavior into a single category—as when Orlando and Jaques (in As You Like It 3.2) dub each other Signior Love and Mon­ sieur Melancholy. The virtue of patience, like Donne's love, will have a human face, must t a k e a body t o o . Patience assumes many bodies from the early Chris­ tian era to the Renaissance. Gerald Schiffhorst, for example, has provided an impressive inventory of the literature of patience in the Renaissance; my own work has described the insistently paradoxical nature of the virtue from its earliest Christian representations. In early secular drama, characters step into (and out of) this virtue. My concern in this paper is these characters of patience and patient characters.",

      "abstract": "Ever since Plato introduced his allegory of the charioteer, where one horse is passion, the other is motivation, and the charioteer is reason, thinkers have captured conduct of life as a conflict between passion and reason. Theorists distinguished between human nature, which acts on impulses, and acts derived from reason-based morality (see Dewey 2012/1922). Humans often act on impulses that do not comply with what they themselves think would be best. Some eat too much, drink too much, or have romantic adventures they later regret. People who forget about the consequences of their actions and act based on their feelings may experience unsatisfactory results. For example, couples divorce due to a shattered relationship despite the shattered finances that follow suit. On the other hand, decision makers sometimes know that a course of action may have disastrous consequences if they follow their gut feeling. That is why employees do not walk away from their job when they are angry at their boss. Sometimes, however, it is good to act on gut feelings. For example, job applicants feel negatively about an option they think would be best. That is why people may reject a job offer that would yield a higher income and better career prospects; they feel uncomfortable at the job interview, a sign that the job has some drawbacks. Finally, although attitudes have been defined as consisting of cognitive, affective, and behavioral components (Krech, Crutchfield, and Ballachey 1962; Rosenberg and Hovland 1960), there is ample evidence for a lack of correspondence among these components of attitudes (Wicker 1969; Zanna and Rempel 1988). For example, people think of themselves as environmentalists but drive cars, produce unnecessary garbage or fly to distant conference destinations to give speeches about how to curb climate change.",

      "title": "Unconscious Processes",
      "abstract": "Consciousness has to do with two aspects of mental life: monitoring ourselves, our phenomenal awareness of our experiences, thoughts, and actions; and controlling ourselves, engaging in voluntary behavior that goes beyond reflex, instinct, and conditioned response. The unconscious mind—whether it exists at all, and if so what its scope and limits are—has been an important theoretical issue since the beginning of scientific psychology. There are of course many physical and biological processes that, in some sense, proceed unconsciously: the orbiting of planets around the sun and photosynthesis are two examples. Changes in blood pressure are not accessible to phenomenal awareness; and the brain activity which gives rise to consciousness itself goes on unconsciously (neurosurgeons assure us that there is no afference in the brain). But there is little point in talking about something being unconscious if that same thing cannot also be conscious, in the sense of being accessible to phenomenal awareness and voluntary control. Therefore, the adjective unconscious only makes sense when applied to mental states and mental activity, as an adjectival contrast to conscious. Mental states come in various forms—namely cognition (percepts, memories, thoughts, and knowledge acquired through learning), emotion (positive and negative feelings), and motivation (desires and goals of approach and avoidance). Usually, these mental states are accessible to consciousness, in that people are generally aware of what they are thinking, what they want and feel. “The unconscious” is shorthand for mental states and processes that are inaccessible to introspective phenomenal awareness and voluntary control. The question is whether, and to what extent, mental states can exist (and mental activities transpire) outside the scope of phenomenal awareness and voluntary control. Objection: If these mental states and activities are unconscious, how are we to know them? Answer: We know them indirectly by virtue of their effects on our ongoing conscious experience, thought, and action. Question: If there are two kinds of mental states and processes, conscious and unconscious, how do they compare and contrast? Answer: In principle, unconscious processes differ from conscious processes because they operate outside phenomenal awareness. And because conscious awareness is the logical prerequisite for conscious control; unconscious processes are not susceptible to voluntary self-regulation. Other differences between conscious and unconscious processes are empirical questions. This revision adds items that appeared through 2022.",

      "title": "Communication device for the treatment of a patient with an Eating Disorder",
      "abstract": "All human beings have ‘true self’ inside of them. The true self is a brilliant diamond-like mind, filled with love, wisdom, kindness, beauty and so on. The true self possesses power to believe in others and to live independently. However, when people get hurt and disappointed in relationships, they start to develop defensive ‘false self’. They then stop expressing their true feelings and start to accommmodate themselves. The false self is controlled by a negative mind such as uneasiness, fear and doubt. When the false self grows and an eating disorder emerges, people start to hurt their own bodies controlled by unhealthy thoughts about food and weight. Then the ‘sick self’ starts to surface. The sick self prevents them from connecting to other people emotionally. The patient (female) was 17 years old, 161 cm, 33.8 kg at her first visit. She was afraid of being obese and had a distorted image of her own body. Her daily life was controlled by abnormal activities like excessive exercising. In order to block her abnormal activities and help her recover from enlarged sick self, she was hospitalized in an isolated room with restrictions. Because of the treatments, her weight recovered to 45 kg. However, after being discharged, her weight dropped to 36 kg due to excessive exercising, and she was hospitalized again. I think that was because she hadn’t fully recovered from false self filled with uneasiness, fear, and defensiveness against realities. Therefore, I think, her false self enlarged and her sick self surfaced again. Being dependent, blaming, and passive about the treatments, she couldn’t face her problems because the patient's false self overpowered her true self. The patient was not able to express her true feelings and had passive communication patterns due to the fear and uneasiness regarding facing realties. Being involved in her passive communication patterns, the therapist could not help but treated only her false self. So the therapist tried to help her face the realities by explaining that the results of the treatments were dependent upon how she would face them. At the same time, the therapist looked for the way to activate her true self, although that was overpowered by her false self. One day, the therapist came up with an idea to turn her passive reactions into independent actions, and asked the patient, ‘If you can’t decide what kind of treatments you are going to choose, you can let me decide for you. However, the choice is YOUR decision’. The patient agreed to follow the therapist's decision making and, for the first time, she expressed her determination to face the treatments positively by saying, ‘I have to be responsible for the decision because this is MY decision!’. After this incident, the patient stopped blaming others gradually and started to show more independent actions, although her false self sometimes came back to her. She stopped the excessive exercising, which had been very persistent since the beginning, and her weight recovered to 47 kg. She started to say that she felt more comfortable with the treatments. When treating patients with eating disorders, the therapist tends to be involved not only in their sick selves but also in their false selves. However, it is very important for a therapist to bring out the patient's independence based on their true self. I think it is meaningful to try this kind of communication device considering their true selves’ capabilities, which are often overpowered by their false selves.",

      "abstract": "Everybody feels anger from time to time. People have been documented feeling anger since biblical times when God was considered angry. Babies even exhibit signs that are interpreted as anger, such as crying or screaming. Anger is not in any way unique to people. Animals also have the ability to feel and express anger. In our personal lives we get angry over at least one thing on almost a daily basis, whether it is on thejob, with a spouse or loved one, or perhaps with a figure of authority. Anger is a healthy emotion when it is expressed appropriately. When it is not, it can have devastating effects. Anger is at the root of many personal and social problems, e.g. child abuse, domestic violence, physical and verbal abuse and community violence etc. Problematic interpersonal relations may also disrupt employment activities because of the interference of anger on workplace performance. Anger can destroy relationships, obstruct problem solving skills, and increase social withdrawal. Anger also affects our physical health. For example, it can tax our immune system; contribute to headaches, migraines, severe gastrointestinal symptoms, hypertension, and coronary artery disease. Anger is a healthy and valid emotion. But many of us are taught not to express or show our anger. There's no doubt about it: we live in an angry society. Signs that anger abounds are all over the place. There is desk rage, road rage, spousal abuse, sports rage and most recently spam rage. Anger is a worldwide phenomenon and referrals to anger management programs have exploded since. Present paper attempt to explore anger and its remedial aspects in a theoretical context.",

      "abstract": "Physical handicap, especially congenital in origin, threatens our sense of security and raises in us distinct feelings of anxiety. We naturally tend to screen out disturbing stimuli. Visible physical handicap however is not so easy to screen out. In its more extreme forms it affronts our feelings of wholeness. To be brought face to face with physical handicap therefore causes us to want to escape the situation altogether or to dissipate in some way the embarrassment engendered. Our escape takes several forms. We may become over-solicitous for the person confronting us. We may shift attention away by focusing on anything irrelevant. We may become ‘moral’ about disabilty, holding implicit attitudes about the value of suffering. All these evasions provoked by our own attempts to handle our own anxiety make us adopt a ‘false consciousness’ or ‘bad faith’. Bad faith is trying to hide from oneself an unpleasant truth or trying to present as true some pleasing untruth. All children are vulnerable to the ‘bad faith’ practices of adults and these communicate themselves effectively to children. Laing1 writes ‘Other people become a sort of identity kit, whereby one can piece together a picture of oneself’. Questions about who one is are answered for the child by asking others. But these questions are mostly asked implicitly by acting in particular ways and finding out what happens to other people when one does.",

      "title": "Public Spaces in Local Places",
      "abstract": "Doubts are accumulating with regard to the uses of rational discourse in the rule-governed sphere once thought of as the public space.There autonomous individuals presumably resolved disagreements, worked out consensus, and devised plans of action for the benefit of those they represented and in the light of logically derived norms.Communicating within the same universe of meaning, they functioned apart from the domains of private life: the domains of women, feeling, subjectivity.Today the boundaries are no longer clear.Words, images mean variously, as the recognition grows that language does not refer to phenomena in some external \"reality.\"Multiplicity, relativism, contin gency: these are the watchwords.The very notion of representation is challenged; the idea of consensus has come to seem illusory; there are no essences to be sought within the newly acknowledged diversity.In their lived lives, people feel their own voices overwhelmed by technical talk or the formulas of the media.They turn inward, many of them, withdrawing from what lies beyond their immediate, everyday con cerns.Surrounded by simulacra, artifacts, artifices, they grope for a sense of actuality, of particularity.Powerlessness, passivity, and a kind of despair shroud many of them.As Percy's (1961) narrator says in The Moviegoer: \"Not to be onto something is to be in despair.\"How, under such circumstances, can situations be created in which persons consciously choose to appear before one another in the open, to come together in \"speech and action,\" as Arendt (1985) says, as the best they know how to be?How can they be moved to reach out from their own distinctive vantage points and constitute something they cherish and hold in common, something that will always be in the making, that can always be renewed?Or, to put it in Dewey's (1934Dewey's ( , 1954) ) terms, how can situations be created in which persons overcome their apathy enough to take heed of the consequences of certain modes of behavior, to take care of and look out for them?Consequences of particular actions (like the abuse of a child, for instance, or an instance of home lessness, or an understaffed school) ought to \"call a public into being\" if they are attended to, if they are named.And it is when an articulate public comes into being that a space opens where communication can take place and action can be taken, action that might repair, might even transform.",

      "title": "OPPORTUNISTIC DEXTERITY OR FLEXIBLE INTELLIGENCE?: CONTEMPLATING THE NATURE OF AMBIVALENCE INTRINSIC TO TRICKSTER ARCHETYPE FIGURES IN TRIBAL FOLKTALES OF JHARKHAND",
      "abstract": "Trickster figures are absolutely universal and they are creations of human collective unconsciousness. And advantageously as well disadvantageously they are not defined (confined) by any single characteristics as they are multifaceted entities, multiform beings and polytropos, with the accumulation of different qualities/features (such as ‘astuteness’, ‘ambivalence’, ‘wit’, ‘clever’, ‘cunning’, ‘tricky’, ‘creative falsehood’, ‘deceitful’ or ‘camouflage’, ‘clown’, ‘coward’, ‘cheat’, ‘humorous’, ‘brave’, etc.) and different forms (gods, demons, humans, animals), depending on the nature and requirement of the narrative programmes. Apart from being the fictional archfigures found in world mythology, folkloric materials and popular culture, the everyday social life of people is filled with the experiences of real tricksters, socially recognized antics of persons who enjoy mixed attributes of cleverness (i.e., good and bad), complementary to the logical rationality and being part of the periphery of their communities and not outside of the communities. Unlike mythological tricksters who are gods, demons, spirits and other supernatural beings, some of them are even known for having voracious appetites for food and bodily pleasure apart from being shape-shifters, rebellious and supreme boundary-crossers, their counterparts in folktales are simple, comprehensible, deliberate violators of social rules and norms, and cultural as well natural. A vast amount of trickster folktales is available in almost all languages across India. However, this study picks a few folktales from the tribal communities of Jharkhand, and the ‘tribal folktales’ is used as a category, a unit for analysis or a semiosphere to investigate the nature and interconnectedness of various elements associated with the trickster folktales. Grouped under four themes based on the actions of the protagonists or antagonists, this study proceeds to construct the nature and availability of oxymoronic figures as fundamental interdependent elements of these tales. This study reveals that the tribal tales have effectively utilized trickster characters to project the concept of altruism, along with the reflection of local culture and their critical interventions. It also highlights the facts that the trickster figures in these tales bring together two opposite worlds for different purposes through border-crossing which is a common phenomenon as far as the tribal trickster folktales are concerned, and it also reflects their worldview of coexistence attitude and perceiving them as an integral part of the ecosystem. Further, this study implies an essential point that the tricksters found in these tribal folktales perform as semiotic generators who mediate between opposites to allow a kind of cultural articulation of different cultural relationships, evaluate their contradictions and renew their moral and ethical values which are essential for the constitution and dissemination of their behaviour. Finally, this study promises to draw a brief sketch of the nature of tricksters and their social function and also unfolds the reason for the speculation that the tricksters are not enjoying heroic admiration and esteem despite their marvellous and altruistic heroic deeds.",

      "abstract": "Has philosophy paid sufficient attention to love? It is evident that the thinkers of the past expended a large part of their intellectual energies on talking about feelings, passions, emotions or affections, to mention just some of the terms under which, one way or another, love has tended to be subsumed. By doing so they undoubtedly granted it a philosophical importance, but not necessarily the kind that should be its due. Because love is much more than a philosophical subject with the same rank as the most important ones: in the end it is, to put it rather abruptly, what makes philosophy itself possible. Why not consider love as we traditionally consider the experience of astonishment, that is, as foundational, as prephilosophical, in the same sense that we commonly talk of the prepolitical? To dispute just for a moment with the authority which has held the monopoly of the prephilosophical for so long: if we are astonished it is because we love to know. Only someone who already loves wisdom is in a position to be astonished.",

      "abstract": "Aaron Beck, M.D. explained that irrational and distorted patterns of thinking lead to negative emotions and selfdefeating behaviors. He theorized that learning how to recognize specific thoughts and beliefs that precede negative emotional reactions and behaviors could provide the chance to change unhealthy thinking patterns. Many irrational patterns are acquired from early childhood and lead to emotions and behaviors that are almost automatic and spontaneous. In patients with eating disorders, cognitive distortions lead to feelings of low self-esteem; mistaken attributions of problems in life to weight, shape, and appearance; and maintenance of eating disorders as ways to manage weight and emotions. For example, a person with anorexia believes that she controls her environment as long as she maintains a low weight. She may believe that she cannot be successful or liked by others unless she is thin. The thinner she becomes, the more weight she wants to lose because her perception of perfection becomes distorted as does her image of her body. The patient with bulimia nervosa commonly believes that she cannot lose weight without binge/purge episodes, laxatives, diuretics, or over-exercising. This belief is maintained even though the patient may remain at an average weight for her height. The mechanism of binging and purging causes swelling which contributes to the body image distortion and serves to provide proof to the patient that she is, indeed, fat.",

The energy of the momentary emotion and desire is often far greater in the child than in the adult. In dealing with the subject of effort it is much less possible than in any other to look upon the child solely as a miniature adult. The child who had been so timorous in her mortal fear summons up all her strength and shows utmost daring-and right judgment. The child's acts of will are not so much hostile interplay between the earliest feelings of impulse and instinct as their refinement, regulation and development; the child is only able to aim consciously at those ends which already exist as pronounced tendencies in the Unconscious. At no period of life is simple instruction and explanation so barren of results as in early childhood.",

Diametrically opposite to the preceding meanings, ego in psychology and philosophy is referred to one’s identity, inner qualities, personality, the ‘Self’ or the ‘I-am-ness’ of an individual. \r\nCompared to the physicality of a thumbprint, ego is something intangible but it explains the quality of that entity being in existence and alive. Iqbal (1877-1938) the philosopher says that the ego is the ‘life force’ within a living organism that leaps to the external world to indicate its existence. \r\nMetaphorically it explains the action of an organism that tries to say that “this is me and I exist and need to be respected”. More to say, that individual ego is trying to show its uniqueness and for that matter, it has its own pride and dignity. As such, it demands to be respected. Since the focus of this article is not centred on the mystic understanding of ego, we would rather leave such a discussion for another time.",

      "abstract": "Volition can be studied from two perspectives. From the third-person view, volitional behaviour is internally generated, rather than being determined by the immediate environmental context, and is therefore, to some extent, unpredictable. Such behaviour is not unique to humans, since it is seen in many other species including invertebrates. From the first-person view, our experience of volitional behaviour includes a vivid sense of agency. We feel that, through our intentions, we can cause things to happen and we can choose between different actions. Our experience of agency is not direct. It depends on sub-personal inferences derived from prior expectations and sensations associated with movement. As a result, our experiences and intuitions about volition can be unreliable and uncertain. Nevertheless, our experience of agency is not a mere epiphenomenon. Anticipation of the regret we might feel after making the wrong choice can alter behaviour. Furthermore, the strong sense of responsibility, associated with agency, has a critical role in creating social cohesion and group benefits. We can only study the experience of agency in humans who can describe their experiences. The discussion of the experience of volition, that introspection and communication make possible, can change our experience of volitional actions. As a result, agency, regret and responsibility are cultural phenomena that are unique to humans.",

Certainly we may find it natural enough, in the ordinary way, to attribute a particular trait to a person and to account for particular things that he does in terms, say, of his ambition or his obstinacy. But further reflection can make it seem less transparently obvious what such ascriptions involve or what sort of explanation they afford. Are we, for instance, implying that the man's behavior is in some fashion causally determined by the trait we have attributed to him, and if so, does this impose significant limits upon his possibilities of action and choice? If, on the other hand, such explanations are held not to be causal in form, how are they to be interpreted and in what way do they help to make his actions more intelligible? Nor may it be so clear what justifies our ascriptions. To what extent must a man's conduct conform to a uniform or regular pattern if a specific trait of character is to be legitimately ascribed to him? Must he always perform in a certain way, or only sometimes? Is it, for example, possible for a man to act out of character, and if so, by what criteria do we distinguish such an action from one that merely shows that our previous estimate of his character has been incorrect?

      "abstract": "The number of notions of health is not infinite. In the history of medicine we can only find a number of different conceptions or paradigmatic ideas of health, in a variety of references and combinations. Health was seen as: 1. harmonious balance between principles or entities, 2. result of a struggle against opposing forces, 3. continuous dialectical process, 4. hierarchy of components or functions, 5. potential to perform and to develop, 6. transcendence towards higher levels of being, 7. result of conscious autonomous action, 8. optimal causal functioning, or 9. public task and responsibility. Hahnemann’s view of health, as reflected in his writings, utilized virtually all of these elements. They reappear for instance as: 1. harmonious tuning of the life force, 2. defeat of pathogenetic influences, 3. admittance of aggravations, 4. autocracy of the spirit-like life principle, 5. reference to a higher goal of human existence, 6. perfecting character of medical service, 7. concern about dietetics and life style, 8. utilization of causality and natural science, and 9. appealing to governmental provisions and medical police. These paradigms have been repeatedly recombined and applied. The theory of medicine is the attempt to analyze, adjust, and develop concepts that meet the demand of contemporary medical practice. Medical theory lies between the fields of observable facts and metaphysical convictions. Distinguishing the levels of practice, theory, and metaphysics could allow the open discussion of theoretical issues, such as the concept of health or disease, without raising purely theoretical objections to well-established practice.",

Although acting was sometimes used, the performers in Happenings generally tended to “be” nobody or nothing other than themselves; nor did they represent, or pretend to be in, a time or place different than that of the spectator. They walked, ran, said words, sang, washed dishes, swept, operated machines and stage devices, and so forth, but they did not feign or impersonate. In most cases, acting and not-acting are relatively easy to recognize and identify. In a performance, we usually know when a person is acting and when he is not. But there is a scale or continuum of behavior involved, and the differences between acting and not-acting may be quite small. In such cases categorization may not be easy. Perhaps some would say it is unimportant, but, in fact, it is precisely these borderline cases that can provide insights into acting theory and into the nature of the art.",

      "abstract": "Extract Why is loyalty such a problematic virtue? The simplest and most general answer is that it often keeps bad company. Loyalty is a virtue of association—a normative glue that binds a person to a particular associational object. Because the associational object may vary in its character, loyalty, as costly perseverance in the conditions that undergird that bond, can easily go astray if the associational object is deeply flawed. On its own, loyalty is no more able to determine the worthiness of its object than sincerity or conscientiousness, though a virtuous person, governed by phronesis, will seek to ensure that loyalty is not misplaced. Its vulnerability to bad company, however, should not lead us to dismiss its importance for maintaining good company. Loyalty’s problematic character is reinforced by the fact that, as an associative bond, it involves some form of trust in its object, and, like love, affection, and other associative bonds, views them from the inside rather than the outside. Just as the perspectives of a religious believer and friend are different from those of an anthropologist and sociologist of religious belief and friendship, the perspective of the loyalist is first and foremost that of the insider. Yet the wall of separation between inside and outside is a porous one, and the loyalist need not be imprisoned within. One of our distinctively human powers is the ability to step outside while remaining inside—of open-mindedness in trust, open to reviewing our commitments while remaining true to them.",

      "abstract": "Function attributions and functional explanations in science deal with nonintentional entities or with intentional entities under abstraction from their intentionality. A functionalist approach to social phenomena, for instance, does not deny that individuals have purposes, motives, and intentions, but it does not appeal to these to explain the individuals' activities. In fact, it may even appeal to functions to explain the existence and nature of particular purposes, motives, and intentions. A functional explanation in biology, say of the bee-hunting behavior of wasps, does not ascribe intentionality to organs and tissue or even to the organism as a whole, but it need not deny this intentionality in order to be a functional explanation. What is relevant is that a functional explanation is independent of any attribution of intentionality. Functional explanation in social science tends to be more easily misunderstood because many social institutions or cultural practices that might have an intelligible functional explanation may also be thought of as having an intentional explanation, and many social institutions were in fact intentionally founded or are now shaped and supported for particular purposes. Let us assume that public executions in a particular society have the function (and the actual effect) of representing power in naked form and thus obviating the necessity of actually exercising that power in numerous instances (which can be expensive and draining).",

      "abstract": "Abstract Double-mindedness is best understood in contrast with single mindedness. To be single-minded is to have a strong enough motive to override any other motive that may conflict with it. To be doubleminded is to have two strong motives that exist in a state of tension because acting on one excludes acting on the other. The agents feel the strength of both motives, but neither obviously overrides the other. Consequently they waver, they are ambivalent, they are of two minds about what they should do. Double-mindedness may be a temporary state or a lasting disposition. As a temporary state, it is a common experience that most agents have when they try to decide, as they must, between immediate and more distant satisfactions, between the demands of morality and self-interest, between institutional and personal loyalties, between duty and pleasure, and so forth. Such a state is intrinsically undesirable because it involves frustration,",

If the disorder is cognitive, it must be such as to prevent the person from understanding the physical or social meaning of his conduct: if it is volitional, it must be such as to prevent him, at the time of his act, from choosing between performing the act and refraining from doing so. These are symptoms of mental disorder that negatives the criminal capacity of a person, and each of them is a necessary, but not a sufficient, condition. It is essential :that this be due to a disease of the mind or an organic defect of reason. The disorder in question is therefore a radical one, and one that is also chronic if not permanent in nature, as opposed to temporary or less deep-rooted conditions such as a disturbed state, a trauma or emotional condition, impulsiveness in certain matters or urges that deviate from the normal in certain areas.",

One's first attempt to clarify this concept is likely to be in terms of other concepts equally in need of clarification: wants or preferences, perhaps. Desires, wants, and preferences all suggest being disposed to “go for” something; they all suggest action tendencies. But not just that. These terms, in their paradigmatic senses anyway, also suggest caring about what you're going for—there is an affective component to them. We do not say the wind-up toy desires the object toward which it ambulates, because, lacking consciousness, it doesn't care about this object (or anything else). But to care about something is to be concerned about getting it; it matters to one whether one gets it. Often, of course, what we desire and care about are not physical objects to be hunted down but changes in our situation; we might want rest, for example. And what we want and care about are things we like; we also care, in a negative way, about things we dislike, and they too matter to us.",

Consequently, it is simpler to think of deviance as occurring in one of two ways in a social system—the extent to which behaviors are missing that facilitate the achievement of the system goals and the degree to which behavior is present that disrupts or works against the system goals. The anomie-deviance hypothesis is about steady state behavior, the stable rates that occur after people have had a chance to learn what reinforcement contingencies are in effect in a social system. In the short run, people may be inaccurate about reinforcement contingencies. Hamblin, et al. shows that deviant behavior is routinely supported by pathogenic exchanges. A deviant person regularly outwits the other, who inadvertently rewards him or her for behavior to the other.",

      "abstract": "The concept of \"successful aging\" as coined by Rowe and Kahan in the late nineties of the last century, came to describe a period of old age with multi-functional abilities. The functions are physical, cognitive and social, without progressive chronic diseases and without disabilities. There is a change in the concept of successful aging beyond the physical dimension (daily function (ADL) and cognitive function) which is based on objective performance indicators towards subjective indicators based on the patients' feelings and their quality of life. Successful aging moves from the limited bio-physical aspect to an overall view of bio-psycho-socio which means mental-emotional-behavioral aspects, social involvement, and also an element of spirituality and even end-of-life decisions. Successful aging will be measured by objective and subjective measures that include the patient's feelings and experiences. The idea is to include and see in successful aging not only the absence of morbidity and disability as seen by Rowe and Kahan, but to a multidimensional function that includes physical and cognitive, mental and emotional, social and spiritual parameters and a dimension of the end of life in making decisions according to the wishes and preferences of the person himself and his family.",

Something that reminds us of human limitations, if we are to stay true to the concept of reverence with which we began. Therefore you must believe that there is one Something that satisfies at least one of the following conditions: it cannot be changed or con- trolled by human means, is not fully understood by human experts, was not created by human beings, and is transcendent. Such beliefs are the least you must have in order to be reverent. They do not amount to religion or even to spirituality.

      "title": "Bonum Nostrum: Thomas Aquinas and Love of Others for Their Own Sake: Thomas Aquinas and Love of Others for Their Own Sake",
      "abstract": "Thomas Aquinas understands love, in its most general and metaphysical sense, as a certain disposition of a subject by which the subject relates to something as (1) Because he conceives in this way, he associates with appetite: love is something pertaining to he says, because the object of both is the good. (2) Accordingly, he identifies at the rational level as an act of the will, and at the sensitive level as an act of the concupiscible appetitive power. (3) At the natural or noncognitive level, where there are no appetitive powers but only actual appetites, he speaks interchangeably of natural and natural appetite. (4) This association of with appetite, however, gives rise to a problem. On the one hand, Thomas unequivocally asserts the possibility of of others for their own sake. He argues that it is natural for all creatures to God more than self, and he claims that we would our friends even if we in no way benefitted from them. (5) On the other hand, he identifies the perfection of the subject as that which the subject, by means of appetite, principally seeks, and he presents the rational creature's pursuit of happiness as a particular instance of the universal pursuit of perfection. (6) But if all things are willed or sought on account of the ultimate end, and the ultimate end is the happiness or perfection of the self, (7) it seems to follow that all love, as an appetitive act, is ultimately motivated by a desire for our own happiness or perfection, and that in final analysis we cannot wish the good of others except as a means to our own In the face of this difficulty, some scholars, such as Anders Nygren and Leslie Dewart, have concluded that Thomas's thought on is simply inconsistent; Thomas attempts to unite Greek philosophy with Christian faith, but all such attempts are doomed to fail. (8) Other scholars, however, have held that Thomas is consistent and have endeavored to show how his principles, when properly understood, allow for genuine of others. Of these scholars, many have pursued the issue by participating in the discussion of the so-called problem of love. This discussion has its source in Pierre Rousselot's 1908 work Pour l'histoire du probleme de Vamour au moyen age. (9) Rousselot identified the problem of as that of whether nonegoistic is possible, and, if it is, what the relationship might be between this and of self. (10) When addressing Thomas's answer to this problem, he focused on Thomas's teaching on of God above self and argued that Thomas's explanation depends on our relationship to God being like that of a part to a whole. (11) The discussion that arose from Rousselot's work has seen a wide variety of proposed solutions. For the most part, interpreters have approached the problem as Rousselot did, namely, through an examination of Thomas's teaching on of God above self. (12) Such an approach is reasonable. If nonegoistic is to be found anywhere in Thomas's thought, we would expect to find it where the object of is said to be loved more than self. Further, in God interested and disinterested meet, inasmuch as God is both the one whom we ought to more than self and the object of true happiness which we ought most to desire for our self. While this approach has much to recommend it, there are alternatives. Some scholars have approached the problem from a more general perspective, focusing their attention on the good that is the object of and volition. (13) It is from this perspective that I wish to pursue the problem of here. In particular, I wish to pursue it by considering the nature of the good that is the object of the will and discerning the relation of this good to the perfection of the self. Scholars commonly recognize the close relation in Thomas's thought between the perfection of the self and appetitive tendency, but there is disagreement over precisely what this relation is. …",

Apart from being (one way or other) involved in the language, they all would share a demanding requirement – a second mental centre within the subject. This redefinition of the simulationism is extended in the present book in two directions. Firstly, mirror-neurons and, likewise, animal abilities connected with the visual field of their fellows, although they certainly constitute important landmarks, would not require this second mental centre. Secondly, others’ beliefs would have given rise not only to predicative communicative function but also to pre-grammatical syntax. The inquiry about the evolutionary-historic origin of language focuses on the cognitive requirements on it as a faculty (but not to the indirect causes such as environmental changes or greater co-operation), pays attention to children, and covers other human peculiarities as well, e.g., symbolic play, protodeclaratives, self-conscious emotions, and interactional or four-hand tasks.",

In the Symposium, Socrates reports that the priestess Diotima once instructed him in how “a lover who goes about this matter correctly must begin in his youth to devote himself to beautiful bodies,” first loving one body, then many (as he comes to understand that they are alike in beauty), next beautiful minds, beautiful laws and customs, beautiful ideas and theories, until finally he will come to love “the Beautiful itself, absolute, pure, unmixed, not polluted by human flesh or colors or any other great nonsense of mortality.”",

In general, their attacks are expressions of behavior depending on the animal’s breeding and learning and of varying manifestations depending on situations generated by man (3) (4) . Dogs have a complex social structure in which roles are determined in terms of dominant and subordinate. This is fundamental in the administration of resources and the cohesion of the pack. The domestic dog shows behavioral patterns proper of this social organization towards the people they live with as they substitute its pack. Hierarchies are established during its growth in which it has to learn its subordinate position under a dominance not always exerted by its owner which gives rise to conflicts such as aggression (4) (5) . When it is manifested, it is described as aggression for dominance. In general, dog owners constitute the group of people more frequently bitten, what can be explained through a higher contact with the animal and their tendency to a lesser avoidance of other people’s dogs and even of dogs without owners (6)",

      "title": "Sāṅkhya",
      "abstract": "Considered one of the oldest classical Hindu schools by Indian tradition, Sāṅkhya is most famous in Indian philosophy for its atheism, its dualist model of puruṣa (passive, individual consciousness) and prakṛti (nonconscious, cognitive-sentient body) and its theory that effects pre-exist in their cause. In its classical formulation the puruṣa-prakṛti model is analysed into twenty-five components (tattva) intended to encompass entire metaphysical, cognitive, psychological, ethical and physical worlds in terms of their embodiment as individual constituents and the creative and interpretive projection of those worlds as experience by and for individuals. Both the world and the individual, in other words, are considered a phenomenological refraction and projection of the underlying and constitutive components of the conscious body. Falsely identifying with the cognitive and sensory components of prakṛti (which according to orthodox Sāṅkhya performs cognitive and sentient operations, but is bereft of consciousness; puruṣa alone is conscious), Sāṅkhyans believe themselves to be the agents of their actions, rather than recognizing that actions are processes lacking any selfhood. Sāṅkhyans claim that liberation from the suffering of repeated rebirths can only be achieved through a profound understanding of the distinction between puruṣa and prakṛti. The latter is not abandoned after liberation, but continues to operate, observed with detachment by puruṣa. However, according to some versions of Sāṅkhya, prakṛti eventually becomes dormant. Puru ṣa and prakṛti both are considered to be eternal and to have no beginning. Since liberation is achieved through knowledge, Sāṅkhya stresses the importance and efficacy of knowledge over ritual and other religious endeavours. Sāṅkhya is cognate to saṅkhyā, meaning ‘to count’ or ‘enumerate’. Thus Sāṅkhya seeks to enumerate the basic facts of reality so that people will understand them and find liberation. Basic Sāṅkhyan models and terms appear in some Upaniṣads and underlie important portions of the epic Mahābhārata, especially the Bhagavad Gītā and Mokṣadharma. No distinct Sāṅkhyan text prior to Īśvarakṛṣṇa’s Sāṅkhyakārikā (c.350–c.450) is extant. It enumerates and explains the twenty-five components and a subsidiary list of sixty topics (ṣaṣtitantra), which are then subdivided into further enumerative lists. Most of the subsequent Sāṅkhyan literature consists of commentaries and expositions of the Sāṃkhyakārikā and its ideas, which continued to be refined without major alterations well into the eighteenth century. Sāṅkhyan models strongly influenced numerous other Indian schools, including Yoga, Vedānta, Kashmir Shaivism and Buddhism.",

      "abstract": "Perhaps no other concept seems as fundamental to common thinking about the arts as the concept of artistic creativity. This is not because creativity seems to most people to be unique to art. Quite the contrary: we speak freely of creative activity in the sciences, in academic disciplines, in cooking, in sports, and, indeed, in virtually every area of human productive endeavour. Nor is this surprising. Creating and making are closely associated etymologically (from the Latin creare) and in the popular mind, and it does no violence to common sense to say that what can be made or done can be made or done creatively. Nevertheless, creativity, if not a necessary condition of artistic practice, seems at least a hallmark or a characteristic feature of art generally. And so we think of artists as creating their works, we think of works of art (including physical things, performances, events, and conceptual objects and structures) as artistic creations, and we praise artists, their works, and even entire artistic epochs for their creativity. Many people take artistic creation to be the quintessential human creative activity.",

      "title": "Teleology and Organisms ii: Specific Explanations",
      "abstract": "Abstract Aristotle normally begins a teleological explanation of a living thing with an identification of its goods (reproduction, pleasure, intelligence, etc.). The existence of these goods implies certain requirements or “hypothetical necessity”. For example, if a fish is to survive and reproduce, it must be able to acquire food, which requires that it move, and so it must have fins, which in turn require tissues, and these must be composed of a certain combination of the elements. Some features of living things are not necessary for its survival, but only as a concomitant to some other necessity (for example the production of waste residua is a product of nutrition, but is not itself for the sake of something), or because it is better for the creature that way. The case of animal behavior shows that Aristotle does not indulge in anthropomorphism: apparently purposeful behavior (such as the weaving of webs by spiders, and the building of nests by birds) is not caused by deliberation. In fact, far from assimilating animal to human behavior, Aristotle goes the other direction and shows how many purposeful human activities (especially in the arts) happen without deliberation.",

      "title": "Knowledge as Addiction: A Comparative Analysis",
      "abstract": "I ll men by nature desire to know—this is the famous first sentence of Aristotle's Metaphysics. It is interesting to note how knowledge, at least since Aristotle, could be understood as a desire, as a mental craving, so to speak. When understood as a desire, knowledge necessarily goes along with a certain absence, a lack. Those who crave for knowledge are not yet fully in its possession, they are still on the search. If humans pursue a cognitive desire that is not wholly fulfilled—since there is something yet unknown, something yet to be discovered—are they then not pitiful beings? Aristotle did obviously not draw this conclusion. Unlike bodily desires, the soul's desire for knowledge could be regarded as a noble one, and rather than being a weakness, it could be an indicator of human dignity and power. The human strive for knowledge serves to distinguish this species from animals that do not, at least apparently, have such a desire. Aristotle praises the intellectual curiosity that was, for him, so significant for being human. Human rational desires can be distinguished from the merely physical drives of animals. Later humanist ideals accordingly view life as a process of personal transformation and growth through learning and the continuous acquiring of knowledge—or a process of Bildung to use a German term that stands for an enlightenment ideal of human cultivation. In the humanist tradition, the desire for knowledge was highly cherished—even if it was insatiable. If one leaves the humanist tradition, however, one can encounter evaluations of knowledge that are quite different. One such instance is Daoist philosophy. Here, the permanent need that goes along with the desire for more and more knowledge is seen as substantially similar to the never ending state of want that goes along with physical cravings. Accordingly, the striving for knowledge was equated with incessant bodily desires—and could thus appear as a kind of addiction. A",

      "title": "The Problem of Consciousness",
      "abstract": "Like most words, consciousness does not admit of a definition in terms of genus and differentia or necessary and sufficient conditions. Nonetheless, it is important to say exactly what we are talking about because the phenomenon of consciousness that we are interested in needs to be distinguished from certain other phenomena such as attention, knowledge, and self-consciousness. By consciousness, I simply mean those subjective states of sentience or awareness that begin when onenuAbove all, consciousness is a biological phenomenon. We should think of consciousness as part of our ordinary biological history, along with digestion, growth, mitosis, and meiosis. However, though consciousness is a biological phenomenon, it has some important features that other biological phenomena do not have. The most important of these is what I have called its subjectivity. There is a sense in which each person's consciousness is private to that person, a sense in which he is related to his pains, tickles, itches, thoughts, and feelings in a way that is quite unlike the way that others are related to those pains, tickles, itches, thoughts, and feelings. This phenomenon can be described in various ways. It is sometimes described as that feature of consciousness by way of which there is something that it is like or something that it feels like to be in a certain conscious state. If somebody asks me what it feels like to give a lecture in front of a large audience, I can answer that question. But if somebody asks what it feels like to be a shingle or a stone, there is no answer to that question because shingles and stones are not conscious. The point is also put by saying that conscious states have a certain qualitative character; the states in question are sometimes described as qualia. In spite of its etymology, consciousness should not be confused with knowledge, it should not be confused with attention, and it should not be confused with self-consciousness. I consider each of these confusions in turn.",

The character of the lost thing, lost inside a world that clearly will not let it belong, represents the unrepresentable, while the boy narrator displays subtle depictions of cognitive difference. The lost thing’s body is incomprehensible for the very reason that it is so unlike the bodies of others. Although it may be tempting to read the boy narrator as dispassionate or as too emotionally detached because of his involvement with this uniform world, the protagonist gladly assists his new friend. As a different kind of thinker, the boy also does not quite fit in his world, even as he is not entirely separate from it.",

Unrestricted and uncritical promiscuity became the New Look in virtue. The only form of Original Sin—at least in the sphere of sex—was to enter into a relationship that expressed the classic sense of romance. This would have been a voluntary and protracted relationship in which a mutually satisfying, sexual relationship was criss-crossed with a chiaroscuro of shared values, sentiments, ideas and goals and, at the same time, was overlain with the mutual exploration, by both partners, of one another's fullness of being. Today, in Maslow's terminology, this kind of relationship between the sexes would be called B-Love, that is, Being-Love or the deep affection for the total qualities of the loved one and not solely her face and curvaceousness or his vigor and pocketbook. In Brave New World “love” consisted of sexual togetherness, that is, of free and frequent access to the opposite sex. Privacy, in this, the most intimate and potentially nurturant of human relationships, was taboo. A deep and focused affection—one capable of yielding a type of experience which can enable both men and women to transcend the limitations of their everyday being-in-the-world—was an aberration.",

By accepting these messages about who we are in the world, we create a shared reality with the significant others in our lives that becomes the basis for self-regulation. This shared reality includes the message that the world either has accomplishments to be promoted, inducing a promotion focus, or has dangers and mistakes to be prevented, inducing a prevention focus. Evidence is presented that these different types of regulatory focus influence both people's memory for different life events and their emotional responses to them. Evidence is also presented that: (a) self-regulatory confusion occurs when shared reality with different significant others about desired selves is in conflict; (b) alienation is produced when there is a lack of shared reality with others about one's actual self; and (c) people prefer information about their actual selves that is shared with significant others as compared to equally self-relevant but unshared information. In these ways, shared reality shapes the world that we experience.",

Without mentally healthy, a man can not carry out duties humanity well. A healthy human is not only physically fit, but also psychologically healthy. Free from human disturbance is an indication that mentally healthy. There are various kinds of mental disorder (mental disorder), one them is the dissociative trance disorder (dissociative trance disorder).\r\nIn a society known as dissociative phenomena of trance. Trance trusted by the community as a condition that occurs when the spirit others enter one's and master it so that it becomes another in terms of speech, behavior and nature. His behavior became like there Another personality who 'enter'. Maramis (1994:418) call a dissociative mechanism which can lead to multiple personalities (multiple personality) and dissociative identity disorder (dissociative identity disorder). Kaplan & Sadock (1997:100) states that the major dysfunction in the dissociative is the loss of integrity of states of consciousness so that people feel no have experienced the confusion of identity or identity of its own or have multiple identities. Society considers that it happened because someone possessed has conceded the genie or spirit that makes strange behavior outside consciousness. And treatment according to the general public with a request help to the smart people, paranormal, religious scholars, and people which is considered an expert handle it. Rarely do patients with dissociative taken to the doctor. Trance in psychology known as dissociative phenomena which is defined as a psychological state that occurs due to a change in the functioning of self (identity, memory or consciousness) (Nevid, Rathus & Greene, 1997:236). This condition can occur suddenly or gradually, are temporary or chronic. This dissociation phenomenon refers to the trance dissociative. Dissociative trance is a temporary change in terms of consciousness or a weak / loss of feeling self-identity (sense of personal identity) without the emergence of new identities (Suryaningrum, 2006). Under conditions trance, loss of identity is not related to the emergence of new identities and actions raised during a trance state is generally not complex (Eg kejangkejang, bergulingguling, fall). According Hawari (2006), trance is a reaction that kejiwaaan called dissociation reaction (dissociative reactions). The reaction led to loss of ability to recognize the reality around him, due to pressure physically and mentally. This dissociation reaction upon them that his soul labile plus the condition that made him depressed. Stress that piled added a trigger enabling the controlled reaction of this subconscious 3 come to the surface, so that someone who is experiencing severe stress, then it very easy to experience dissociative trance. Here's one example the case of dissociative trance state as it has experienced by subjects in this study. The subjects had experienced a trance\r\nwhen aged 20 years. When the incident was the subject felt in him something control, he berteriakteriak and weeping and occurred nearly five hours ever, he did not realize that he is in a state of trance. The subject admitted before experiencing a trance, the subject has a variety of problems heavy. At that time many of the problems it faces, ranging from problems Personally, the problem with the family until the economic problems that can not be resolved. And finally permasalahanpermasalahan makes depressed subjects. The international medical world, especially psychiatry recognize the phenomenon and written in guiding the most recent psychiatric diagnosis Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorder IV (DSMIV) and The International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems 10 (ICD10). DSMIV enter possessed pathologic (pathologic possession) into a dissociative disorder diagnosis is not specific (dissociative disorder Otherwise not specified). ICD10 categorizes as disorders possessed trance and possession disorder (DSMIVTR, 2000). In fact in daily life, many people who experience dissociative trance without realizing it. In other words he refused to say trance for example, when they're driving, aircraft, and was watching TV in a state of daydreaming. Trance, case found in many third world countries. In India the culture and similar culture of Indonesia, possesion syndrome or hysterical possesion is a form of dissociation of the most frequently found. Figures happened approximately 1 4% from the general population. Epidemiological studies have possesion reportedly related to the social crisis in the community (Hidayat, 2006). Based on gender, women have a greater risk dissociative trance than boys. The condition usually occurs trans in women and is often associated with stress or trauma (Barlow & Durand, 2002:177). This is evident from the cases which occurs mostly are women. This may be because women are more sugestible or more easily influenced than boys.\r\nThose who have personality histerikal sugestible which one character is more risky for the dissociation or also become victims of crime hypnotist. Based on the age, most victims dissociation-old adolescents and young adults. Therefore, it can be concluded that those at risk for dissociation were female teens or young adults are easily influenced. Barlow & Durand (2002:174) states, when individuals felt detached from him or as if he was like a dream, it can be said he dissociative experience. Dissociation most likely occurs after kejadiankejadian which makes the individual very stressful. It may also occur when someone is weakened or psychic experience mental distress. Many species study expresses a relationship between traumatic events, particularly physical and sexual abuse during children, with dissociative (Kaplan, 1997:100). Dissociative trance state is a phenomenon that is admirable and interesting but confusing. Based on existing explanations, dissociative trance phenomenon is still unknown for certain reasons, so researchers are keen to raise this phenomenon as a scientific research. This study represents an initial step to know the factors the causes (etiology), a person may experience trance dissociative.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Against the Epicureans who conceive the gods as indifferent to make them inaccessible to anger, the Stoics assert that the god is incapable of anger due to his very benevolence. However, doesn’t the Stoic god’s concern for man threaten his impassivity and expose him to feel anger and passions? In this paper, I address, in a theological context, the classic ethical problem of the compatibility between the integrity of the individual and his concern for others. Several hypotheses are examined. Is divine benevolence merely a disposition to do good to human beings, devoid of any affection for them? If it is a feeling, is it an aspiration to the very exercise of the virtue of benevolence, rather than to the good of mankind in itself? Or could it be understood, in the context of the cosmic οἰκείωσις, as the god’s care for his own parts? Finally, should not we distinguish, in god’s philanthropy, between the φιλία he feels for the wise men and the ἔρως he feels for everyone else?",

      "title": "Aggression: Its Relation To Desire and Self-Interest",
      "abstract": "Aggression continues to be a problematic, ill-defined concept for most contemporary analysts. Questions about the nature and origin of aggression remain unanswered. On the one hand, aggression is conceived of as an instinctual drive; on the other, it is thought to originate as an instrument of reaction to external sources of frustration and environmental failures to meet developmental needs. Aggression has also been dichotomized as either the benign activity of assertiveness, or the darker destructive force of hostility, believed by many to arise from separate motivational systems. There is a problem with the view of aggression as largely an ad hoc reaction to deprivation or other environmental shortcomings leading to disappointment and frustration. This view understates the importance of the original expansive demands for pleasurable satisfaction made by the individual upon the environment. Desire itself seems to be responsible for an inward vulnerability to external sources of disappointment and frustration, so that what is not desired cannot be effectively frustrated. Though the prototypical object of aggression is taken to be an external source of frustration, danger, and narcissistic injury, the mobilization of aggression more accurately reflects a susceptibility to the disturbing pressure of psychic stimuli that are the inner desire for satisfaction. Aggression contributes its force to various constructive or destructive purposes, from love to mastery to vengeance. Its most immediate aims, primarily narcissistic, are not concerned with the needs of others. Aggression also makes important contributions to maintaining psychic equilibrium, to the psychic organization's stake in instinctual gratification, to ego function, and to superego operation.",

      "title": "The Value of Judgments Regarding the Value of Animals",
      "abstract": "Contemporary skepticism concerning the mental within philosophy of mind and psychology certainly seems to have created hard times for ethics. Eliminative materialists like Stich (1983) attack the very foundation on which moral theories are based. Since moral theories assume a certain amount of intentionality as a building block for their legislation ofrights and obligations, any positions that could demonstrate in some form that such an assumption is unwarranted, in that beliefs, desires and mental states in general cannot be shown to exist, would seem to spell death for the ethical realm. Ifmoral theories require realism about cognitive elements and their states yet are unable to present us with the evidence that will support this requirement, then they must either give up this requirement, and accept the view that moral agents and subjects no longer have any sure footing with regard to their claims concerning moral behavior toward themselves and others, or recognize some other way on which to ground their views. Does it have to be the case, for instance, that consciousness and sentience are the only conditions on which moral status can be ascribed to beings? Or can we refer to some other condition or set of conditions? Can we perhaps expand our concept of morality to include animals yet without necessarily raising the problems associated with attributions of intentionality? The general focus of this paper, then, concerns my interest in the conditions that make moral judgments about animals true. Hence, I am concerned with moral epistemology, not axiology. In Part I, I present a cursory analysis of Stich's view concerning ascriptions of beliefs to humans as well as to animals. In Part II, I analyze Regan's arguments for why certain animals ought to be regarded as moral subjects as well as his response to Stich's position. My intention behind presenting Regan's position is twofold: (1) to show that Stich's position creates some difficulty for Regan's ultimate goal of ascribing rights to animals and (2) to point out that the comparison of animal to human belief structures is not an effective way to ground what possible claims they may have against us. I conclude on a somewhat Heideggarian note in Part III. I argue that animals and nature itself may be deserving of some moral recognition just by virtue of the fact that they afford us possibilities with respect to what we can and do become. Value, in a certain sense, is to be found external to ourselves.",

      "title": "Memories, Bodies and Persons",
      "abstract": "Traditionally, philosophical writings on personal identity have taken the form of attempts to discover the dominant criterion for deciding when a person at one time is identical with a person at some other time. Among the candidates for the role of dominant criterion have been bodily continuity (or continuity of some appropriate part of the body) and memory (or the ability, in principle, to remember). In the normal case, where a person P is identical with a person P′ at an earlier time, it is true that P and P′ share a continuous body, that P can remember experiences of P′, and that many other relationships (e.g. similarity of character) hold between P and P′. Consequently, the debate as to which of the normal criteria is the dominant one has usually taken the form of imagining strange cases in which one or more of the normal criteria are lacking, and attempting to say, in such cases, who is identical with who. The scene was set, at least for modern times, by Locke's prince/pauper example, in which, according to Locke, the ability to remember experiences of a person having a different body guarantees, nevertheless, that one is that person—and hence that the memory criterion is dominant over the bodily identity one.",

This line of thought transcends biological boundaries-namely, with regard to artificially (super)intelligent persons-but is this a safe assumption? The issue concerns ultimate moral significance: the significance possessed by human persons, persons from other planets, and hypothetical nonorganic persons in the form of artificial intelligence (AI). This article investigates why our possible relations to AI persons could be more complicated than they first might appear, given that they might possess a radically different nature to us, to the point that civilized or peaceful coexistence in a determinate geographical space could be impossible to achieve.",

      "abstract": "If a hungry, thirsty, itchy person eats some food, or drinks some water, or intentionally scratches an itch, this is individual action. That is, it is the intentional behaviour of an ordinary individual human person; other human beings are not necessarily involved. If a person takes a walk down the road by herself for exercise, or eats an ice cream for pleasure, or takes a shower on a hot day, this is also individual action. Such action is not action in cooperation with, or necessarily directed at, other individuals. On the other hand, if an individual kicks or throws a football to a teammate in the course of a game of football, or puts a motion forward at a committee meeting, then this is social action. Most human action is in fact at some level, or to some extent, or in some sense, social action. Even these actions of eating, drinking, eating ice cream, individually walking down the road, or having a shower typically presuppose social forms or objects, such as farms, ice cream parlours, cups, roads, and shower rooms. But the de facto presupposition of social forms does not of itself vitiate the distinction between individual and social action. More generally, the sociality of most human action does not vitiate the distinction; it merely serves to illustrate the need to develop a more elaborate set of distinctions in this area. There is nothing to be gained from insisting that no actions are individual and/or that all actions are social, just because it might in fact be that all the actions of human beings connect in some way, however indirectly, with the actions of other human beings and with social forms and social objects.",

Identity does for Nancy constitute a property of being, but at the same time he insists on the proposition that “I is another.” One belongs to a community as one is born or thrown into one. That thrown belonging constitutes an edge or forms a contour that connects to other identities, other communities. Hence there is identity, but as communicating with other identities. This is why it is not a matter of defending one's identity or to attack it, but rather of entering in their between. The term “who” should always be put in the form of a question: who? An identity, yes, but always in question. A “who,” yes, but as always plural and in question: Who?",

However it now seems necessary to question this perception of humanity and the human condition.Indeed, longer life expectancy together with its related pathologies and medical progress lead us to think differently. Today we realise that those qualities which were thought to belong specifically to human beings, such as awareness, reason, memory and free will, can disappear. Should we conclude then that those whose capacities have decreased or disappeared have become less human or have even lost all human qualities?Such questioning leads to new ways of describing humans whereby they would be defined not in substantial but rather in interpersonal terms.Surely being a person means first and foremost that we live through and for others. And the ethics of care that define men as vulnerable beings, that is to say dependent and needing their fellow human beings' solicitude, would surely offer the possibility of creating a new ?revisited' concept of the person?",

      "title": "The Attachment Acquisition Process as Evidenced in the Maternal Conditioning of Cued Infant Responding (Particularly Crying)",
      "abstract": "Attachment was discussed as metaphor and as process. In any segment of the life span, attachment labels a complex of an individual’s response patterns controlled by cues and consequences from the appearance and behaviors of another. Any response (e.g., orienting, smiling, even crying) cued by, or differential (preference) responding to, that person can index attachment directly; disorganization patterns and/or concomitant emotion effected by interference with those cued-response systems can index attachment indirectly. Behavioral indicators of attachments of children to others are surveyed, with emphasis on crying cued by a mother’s departures, separations, or absences. These might be understood as outcomes of routine discriminated-operant conditionings effected by that mother’s responding to her infant’s crying. Such cued crying has often been an index of a baby’s attachment to its mother. In a conditioning frame, discriminated responding explains drastic diminutions of cued responses denoting attachment in an attachment figure’s absence, and their marked reoccurrence on that figure’s reappearance; and a concept of inner structure underlying attachment that endures in the absence of the attachment figure is gratuitous. Some risks in using single (or very few) attachment indices are explored.",

      "title": "Dependence and its Discontents: Kierkegaard on being Sustained by Another",
      "abstract": "Dependence and its Discontents:Kierkegaard on being Sustained by Another Edward F. Mooney To ears attuned to autonomy and independence, mention of deference or dependence spells trouble. To many it seems incontestable that to be deeply dependent on another forfeits dignity, maturity, and self-respect. Yet if this is so, we're on a collision course with Kierkegaard, at least with his picture of a full self in The Sickness Unto Death. There, quite without apology, his pseudonym Anti-Climacus tells us that the self is sustained and grounded in another—in God, or in an absolute, sustaining power.1 The objection is evident. Dependence on God seems to continue the condition of childhood. Maturity is freedom from such dependence. And so we bristle at the idea of valuing dependence, or needing it. But dependence needn't be reverting to childish subservience. Acknowledging Kierkegaardian dependence, in fact, is an achievement of reflective maturity. A self that is rich in independence will be rich in an array of decent dependencies. I start my elaboration with a quick outline of what I'll call junctures of dependence that I find implicit in a certain reading of the formula found in The Sickness Unto Death. This quick outline—only the bare bones of a reading—needs to be given some flesh and blood. Following my outline, I provide this flesh and blood by presenting Socrates as more than an exemplary Athenian. I discover him to be an exemplary Kierkegaardian self, a self relating to itself and grounded in another. [End Page 1038] We can take Socrates to be a dramatic, theatrical realization of the abstract formula from Sickness Unto Death, the formula fully clothed in that concrete, familiar, and admirable life. Following my portrait of Socrates, I take up for consideration elements of the quick outline at a much slower pace. In the long trunk of my paper I explore what it means to be an ensemble of relations relating to itself. I emphasize the ensemble's incorporation of relations to constitutive goods, and emphasize its concern with monitoring its unfolding and with testing its authenticity. The ensemble also relates 'to another' or 'to an absolute.' I take up this relation as answering several needs. The self needs a relation to God insofar as a vulnerable self needs backing or a bulwark when morale threatens to break, or insofar as a self needs a critic and forgiver beyond those available in one's social milieu. A relation to God emerges as an aspect of acknowledging the vast and uncharted territory that Wittgenstein calls \"this complicated form of life.\"2 I round off this adventure in tracing modes of dependence by dilating my focus to ask a very broad question. I ask why a dependence on God—central to Kierkegaard's formulation—needs to be understood, as it so often is, as an affirmation of belief in some kind of mysterious 'thing' on which everything else about the self and about the cosmos must rest. I suggest that understanding 'the religious' or 'God' in Kierkegaard begins by refusing to frame God as a frozen transcendental 'something' to which we owe unstinting devotion. It is far more helpful to understand a self's dependence on God as a kind of allusive shorthand for a powerful field of multiple dependencies constituting a religious sensibility. A 'dependence on God' evokes the sustaining powers of local ceremonies of gratitude, forgiveness, self-examination, and trust. These ceremonies or practices animate and constitute a broad attunement to the world and others—a religious sensibility. God is a soft-focus for the animating and shifting narrative center that stabilizes this sensibility. 1. Schema for a Relational Self The author of Sickness Unto Death has no use for a picture of 'the self' as a thing or as a natural kind, or as a pinpoint of consciousness, or as a site of decision and will. In that famously cryptic formula, \"the [End Page 1039] self is a relation that relates to itself, and in relating to itself, relates to another.\"3 A three-tiered structure can model this formula. Picture the first floor as an ensemble of parts, a gathering of opposed...",

In taking the focus off individual members and placing it on the community itself, we recognize that the whole of a university is greater than the sum of its parts, and that individual parts are repeatedly and continually shaped and defined by the whole. Being in right relationship with God begins with acknowledging our longings to be loved, to be known, and to belong in ways encouraging us to put ourselves intentionally and consistently in God’s gaze of love. Coming before God empty-handed and agenda-less, rather than starting another discipleship program or Bible Study, helps us lean into God’s love already at work—common grace. Gratitude flows from opening our eyes to the wonder of God’s sustaining love active around us. As we gaze at God, who is gazing at us, we are transformed—saved from envy, pettiness, selfishness, and sense of entitlement. Transformation begins with grace, where the response is a gratitude that moves back to God and is expressed in love of neighbor—love of all created things, both seen and unseen, held together by Christ. This movement of God in our college communities is cultivated by a shared identity as a Christian community, by seeing and knowing each other, being seen and known, using chapel as a Holy Place, and turning our love outward.",

      "title": "Transvestism and Pruritus Perinei",
      "abstract": "Summary Many papers have been devoted to pointing out the psychodynamics of various psychocutaneous manifestations. These responses of the skin, either pathological or \"normal,\" may serve the purpose of attracting love, attention, or pity, or may lead to avoidance and rejection by others. In the severely regressed or fixated patient the skin may be the target of self-punishment, self-castration, or self-destruction. Pruritus has been explained as a combination of pleasure and pain, with hostile and aggressive elements being turned inward, leading to \"self-destruction\" (scratching and tearing). Associated forbidden sexual wishes have been seen to be gratified in part by itching, which is thus looked upon as a masturbatory equivalent.25 Seitz28 demonstrated that there is an unconscious need in these patients to punish themselves by ripiping, tearing, and picking of the skin. The excoriation is so patently self-punishment, according to Seitz, that it hardly justifies the term \"symbolic.\" He adds that, nonetheless, the scratching is erotically gratifying: ..fantasies during scratching almost invariably have to do either with destructive aggressive behavior on the part of the patient, or with wish-fulfilling situations in which he is loved and approved by others, or with both. Dreams which precipitate scratching follow the same pattern of destructive rage in association with frustrated needs for love and approval. [They] suppress feelings of anger and resentment because they experience so much anxiety when hostile emotions are expressed … and they react to their own repressed rage and guilt. Excessive excoriation appears to be a symptom which both atones for this guilt through self-punishment and also at the time gratifies the need for love through cutaneous erotic pleasure. In addition, scratching probably serves as a muscular release mechanism for the physiological tension created by repressed rage. Sexual gratification, conflictual and masochistic, associated with skin eroticism and exhibitionism, has been the subject treated by various authors.21,24,25,30,32,33 It has been shown that manipulation of the skin represents attempts at gratification of sexual desires, this particular form being a regressive phenomenon from a more genital level. Scratching and other activities involving the skin have been considered autoerotic (masturbatory), and provide regressive gratification of the need for love. One of the fascinating psychosomatic phenomena seen in the psychocutaneous disorders is the syndrome of pruritus ani et scroti (pruritus perinei). Pruritus ani alone exists primarily in the male. The psychogenesis of this disorder has been the subject of only a few systematic studies, though there are numerous case studies in the literature.7,19,26,33 In contrast to most authors, Cormia6 disputes the role of overt or latent homosexuality in the genesis of pruritus ani, but admits to its importance when describing the combination of pruritus ani and scroti. He cites the fact that the severity of scrotal itching far overshadows that of pruritus ani. He also notes the absence of overt aggressive tendencies and the lack of assertiveness with a distinct submissive tendency. Saul,26 in a report of a case with pruritus ani, demonstrated the development of pruritus in situations which aroused passive homosexual anal wishes. Schilder27 cited a case where the fear of and wish for castration were present together, with the patient desiring to come into a masochistic, passive, and \"homosexual relationship with his father and mother.\" Wittkower and Russell,33 in a systematic study of patients with pruritus ani, noted that there were latent homosexual trends in a significant number of male patients. Intensification of these trends can precipitate or exacerbate the pruritus ani. Other sexual disturbances such as premature ejaculation are noted to be common.6, 19 Ferenczi9 points to severe castration anxiety present in pruritus ani et scroti, with displacement of fears of genital castration to anal and urethral excretory functions. The relationship between recta] and anal masturbation and pruritus ani has been discussed in a number of studies.9, 10, 26, 33 Exhibitionism, common to all psychocutaneous manifestations, is also cited as characteristic of pruritus ani, and to a certain extent, functions to allay anxiety of different sources.7, 19, 32 Of particular interest has been the relationship between the precipitation of pruritus perinei and the occurrence of birth or fantasies relating to birth. In one of the cases of pruritus scroti in a study noted above,6 the onset of the patient's pruritus coincided with a period of total sexual abstinence during his wife's pregnancy. Macalpine,19 in a study of patients with pruritus ani, specifically defined the core of the problem as involving the reactivation of an unconscious fantasy \"that babies are thought of as growing in the tummy and being born like a stool … and get inside by food or kissing or by the same route as they are thought to leave the body.\" Apparently the conclusion is that in the male, anal-pregnancy fantasies are incompatible with his self-concept and with the definition of a man and that if he harbors the persistent fantasy of this capacity to bear babies, it would obviously be incompatible with his self-concept of masculinity. The slightest reactivation of this fantasy would be pathogenic because, in addition to being \"fantastic,\" anal-pregnancy fantasies carry with them a threat to or grave doubt of manhood. Macalpine added that the patient reveals such doubts in himself with the urge to be examined and examine himself. She added that the precipitating situations apparently involved actual childbirth in a wife or relative, and she cited an example taken from Ferenczi, in which defecation had the symbolic significance of giving birth. Macalpine and Hunter,20 in a paper involving a reevaluation of the Schreber case, looked upon Schreber's psychosis as a quest for procreation, and noted that his wish to change into a woman was not for self-punishment by castration for forbidden homosexual wishes, but for becoming endowed with female reproductive organs in order to procreate. During the psychotic episodes Schreber would wear \"sundry feminine adornments such as ribbons, trumpery necklaces and the like,\" believing he had turned into a woman, and he suffered from many somatic complaints. In a case of pruritus ani cited by Wittkower, the patient in describing the onset of the complaint stated that \"suddenly he felt transformed from a man into a woman\"; the implications to be drawn can be in the direction of both the passive homosexual role and possibly a fulfillment in fantasy of the wish to procreate by becoming a woman. The psychodynamic similarities between the aforementioned areas and transvestism are many. The psychodynamics of transvestism have been extensively described, with certain modifications pertaining to individual cases.2, 4, 8, 12-15, 17, 23, 31 Gutheil lists 6 psychopathological factors important in the causation of transvestism. They are: (1) latent or manifest homosexuality with unresolved castration complex; (2) sadomasochism, wherein the masochism accentuates the passivity and feminity, and at times results in acts of strangulation; (3) narcissism; (4) scoptophilia; (5) exhibitionism; and (6) fetishism. Fenichel's formulation stresses two components in the transvestite act: (1) an object-erotic or fetishistic component in which the person \"lives with\" the clothes of the woman, representing his mother. Instead of coitus with the mother or mother substitute, the transvestite enters into a fetishistic relationship with her. The body odor and warmth of the clothes appear significant in addition to the sadomasochistic components; and (2) a narcissistic relationship in which the transvestite identifies with the phallic woman, wherein the love for the phallic mother is transformed into love for the ego. The narcissistic regression manifested extends beyond that seen in the homosexual. Studies of fetishism have been approached with different degrees of emphasis on the relative contribution made in terms of the libidinal level of psychosexual development. Thus, some authors have paid particular attention to the analerotic and sadistic aspects and noted that coprophilia is an important activity.1, 2, 3, 22, 31 In the case reported here, attention is drawn to the similarities between transvestism and pruritus perinei, with the demonstration that in both there are involved the aspects previously discussed, namely, castration anxiety with anal displacement, passive overt and latent homosexuality, extreme masochism, and the deeper implication in both syndromes of the wish to be a woman and ultimately to procreate. The examples of Wittkower in which the man with pruritus ani felt transformed into a woman, and the Schreber case, in which the psychosis involved the wish to be a woman, further clarify this relationship. In the case summarized, it is seen that, as the patient gratifies and acts out the fantasy of being a woman, the somatic expression of this wish, i.e., the pruritus perinei, disappears, reappearing when the transvestism is not gratified. The pruritus scroti represented an extreme masochistic and eroticized wish for castration, against which, theoretically, the transvestism should act as a defense but which apparently is not entirely the case. This interesting panorama of symptoms poses many theoretical questions which are beyond the scope of this paper, such as concepts of bisexuality, the choice of symptoms, etc. Certainly in this patient, as masculine demands were made, and especially during the period when his wife was pregnant and giving birth, there was a reactivation of analerotic and other pregenital fantasies. There is evidence that this involved the wish to procreate. With the resultant intensification of anxiety, the wish led to regression beyond somatic expression in the form of pruritus perinei to the more narcissistic, masochistic, and exhibitionistic acting out in the form of transvestism, and ultimately to transsexualism, i.e., emasculation, with the fantasy of transformation. This patient became more than identified with his \"phallic mother.\" There is a possession or introjection of her which finds its manifestations in the patient's fantasy of transformation into a woman (i.e., mother), thus endowing him with the capacity to procreate.11 Following his mother's death he lived in fantasy the role of replacing her, to the extent of sleeping in bed with his father and wearing female clothes. One can readily postulate his wish for anal impregnation by his father, thereby extending beyond the obvious wish for a passive homosexual relationship with his father. Kubie18 postulates that \"from childhood and throughout life, on conscious, preconscious, and unconscious levels, the psychosexual goal is always and invariably to be both sexes, in varying proportions or emphasis.\" He adds that the insatiability of this drive results in an \"orality\" which \"may rather be the instrument by which the unconscious goal of being both sexes is to be achieved through incorporation of breasts or penis or the body as a whole.\" The unconscious demands utilized in the attempt at achieving this bisexual goal have one common goal, namely, a \"magical bodily transformation.\" The psychological study on this patient, done following emasculation, suggests that this patient has relatively few anal (ruminative) characteristics. He is much more the narcissistic, exhibitionistic character, whose emotional relationships are characterized by their dramatic, albeit superficial, quality. His concept of himself as a \"sensitive person\" is belied by the mock quality of his feelings. His perception of the ideal female endows them with characteristics illustrative of the noblest of the \"Dickensian heroines.\" The two dreams reported in the study indicate the bisexual role this patient embodies. In the first dream, as a woman in the obvious wish-fulfillment function of the dream, and in the second, as a man (the chrome train) involving anal intercourse. The patient's persistent fantasy that his mother gave birth to another child in his first year of life would, if true, have given the patient exposure at that time to the process of pregnancy, which to an infant of 1 year might involve the inference that the baby grows in the mother's abdomen out of food and leaves the body through the anus, and thus in some special way is created and formed of feces. This paper in its entirety has been concerned only with the psychodynamic aspects of pruritus perinei as it exists in the male. It may well be that in both the male transvestite and male patient with pruritus perinei, the deepest wish is not only to bear a child but to bear their own child, the result of an autoimpregnation.",

But, leisure time is usually considered as residual time that individuals can use for their relaxation, diversion, social interaction or personal developments, free from work and other duties. However, it is not simply free time, as many unemployed people argue that such enforced time free from work does not provide them with true leisure. When we consider leisure as activity, we often list hobbies or pastimes that we choose to be involved in because we value and enjoy them. Leisure may offer means of diversion separate from non-leisure activities such as work, or an opportunity for self expression or self-development. To that degree, leisure is not a purposeless activity. It is said that leisure is a state of mind or mental condition in which we find freedom in a freely chosen activity that we undertake for its own intrinsic reasons. In other words, leisure is in the mind of the participant, and it is activity that is chosen primarily for its own sake. However, in contemporary concept, it is clear that leisure includes some ideologies in which there are educational and social purposes intentioned to control people. In this sense, the most important meaning of leisure is that leisure is not just free time, rather it is closer to social welfare aspect in contemporary society. Leisure does not exist any more as traditional concept.",

      "abstract": "Interpassivity is a widespread, but mostly unacknowledged form of cultural behavior. It consists in letting others (other people, or animals, machines etc.) not work, but consume in one’s place. When certain people, for example, take care that others drink their beer for them, fotocopy or print texts out instead of reading them, let recording devices watch TV programmes in their place, use ritual machines that pray or believe for them vicariously, or are happy that certain TV-comedies already laugh about themselves, we have to speak of interpassivity. These actions are based on certain subjects’ preference to delegate their enjoyment instead of having it themselves. This, obviously, raises a number of quite uncanny, fundamental questions: Why do certain people do not want to have their enjoyment? And why do they, if the do not want to enjoy, go to such great pains in order to ensure that somebody else enjoys in their place? The theory of interpassivity has had considerable impacts on several disciplines such as philosophy, art theory, psychoanalysis, media theory, political theory, anthropology, theory of religion etc. This volume assembles essays that reach from the fundamental philosophical questions, concerning the paradoxical pleasure gained from delegated enjoyment, to their most current consequences: for example concerning interactivity and participation in the arts and in politics, generosity in culture, the status of belief, ritual and magic, cultural capitalism, civilized urban role-play etc.",

      "abstract": "Human ontology and epistemology are bound inextricably together. Both are based on, or at least significantly conditioned by, our use of language. We tend to assume that something is knowable (or significant) if it can be framed in language, and unknowable (or insignificant) if it cannot. The places and ideas we inhabit – and therefore our mode of being – are creatures of our language. Our type of language is powerful and (for some purposes) very useful. It is not surprising that it has been favoured by natural selection. But our linguistic ways of articulating and constructing the world are not the only ways. Arguably our language means that we know much less about the way the world really is than we would know without it: that it means that we limit dangerously (to the amount language can accommodate) the amount of data we process in deciding what sort of place the world is; that language makes us self-referential and self-reverential. Our language embodies and perpetuates many sensory and other biases. Vision, cognition and language, for instance, are in an alliance that excludes many other sensory modalities. We say 'I see' when we mean 'I understand'. But there are many other (non-linguistic and non-visually dominated) ways of articulating the world and thus our way of being in the world. An olfactory landscape, for instance, behaves in a very different way to a visual landscape, and visually dominated ways of invoking it have to be abandoned. This chapter draws on work on terrestrial animal 'languages' and non-human ways of understanding the world in order to speculate about how non-terrestrial entities might know and be.",

      "title": "Perception and experience of the self in autoscopic phenomena and self -portraiture",
      "abstract": "Autoscopic phenomena are reduplicative experiences during which the subject has the impression of seeing a double in extracorporeal space either from an embodied or disembodied visuo-spatial perspective. Autoscopic phenomena include out-of-body experience (OBE), autoscopic hallucination (AH) and heautoscopy (HAS). In an out-of-body experience, subjects feel that their self, or centre of awareness, is located outside the physical body and somewhat elevated. It is from this elevated extracorporeal location that subjects experience seeing their body and the world. An autoscopic hallucination is defined as the experience of seeing a double of oneself in extracorporeal space without leaving one's body (no disembodiment). As compared to out-of-body experiences, individuals with autoscopic hallucination experience seeing the world from their habitual visuo-spatial perspective and experience their self, or centre of awareness, inside their physical body. During heautoscopy subjects also have the experience of seeing a double in extracorporeal space (as in autoscopic hallucination). However, it is difficult for the subject to decide whether he is disembodied or not and whether the self is localised within the physical body or in the double. The present review highlights recent findings concerning phenomenological and neuro-cognitive characteristics of autoscopic phenomena of neurological origin.These findings are compared with the pictorial phenomenology of self-portraits, which may also be described as reduplicative phenomenona because self-portraits contain the painter twice: as the painting painter and the painted painter (double). The comparative analysis between the three forms of autoscopic phenomena and self-portraits revealed several phenomenological similarities suggesting that some of the neuro-cognitive mechanisms of autoscopic phenomena might also be employed by artists of self-portraits as well as beholders of such works of art. Based on this analysis a division of the genre of self-portraiture in three major types of self-portraits is proposed that reflects the characteristics of out-of-body experience (OBE self-portraits), autoscopic hallucination (AH self-portraits) and heautoscopy (HAS self-portraits). It is argued that autoscopic phenomena, which have fascinated mankind from time immemorial, might add to our understanding of the central processes that mediate self-perception and self-experience in cognitive neuroscience as well as art history.",

The Latin word virtus comes from vir, a man, and the basic idea is one of manliness or manhood, if the ladies will pardon so masculine an attitude; but manliness not so much distinguished from womanliness as from childishness. Virtue is the proper characteristic of the adult. The virtues are firmly rooted dispositions or habits or attitudes by which our faculties are given a bias towards the performance of good actions instead of bad actions—the faculties we are concerned with in the moral life being the will and the sense appetites, not the mind, except for the key virtue of prudence, of which more anon. Left to themselves the other faculties lack direction, and just dissipate their energies aimlessly.",

      "abstract": "Human failure and inadequacy is a natural consequence of our imperfect nature. Guilt, however, is neither a natural nor desirable consequence of our nature or actions. This article discusses the dysfunctionality of guilt and remorse. The model presented employs the theoretical framework of cognitive-behavioral psychotherapy for the understanding and remediation of the remorseful client's dysfunctional guilt. As less-than-perfect individuals, we are more than aware that to err is human. What may not be as readily obvious is that the remorse and guilt often accompanying such personal failure or mis-performance is both needless and dysfunctional. As Ellis (1975) noted, to forgive . . . leaves one sane and realistic. Certainly there are instances where one's twinge of guilt or remorse over the performance of an ill-deed serves to motivate the individual to learn from the past and thus modify behavior. Under such conditions one could argue that the discomfort of guilt is functional. Too often, however, an individual's sense of guilt is such that it is a paralyzer, not a motivator; it is an immobilizer, not an energizer; it is destructive, not productive.",

But whereas these comparisons presuppose a species-concept in non-rational animals, nature has not equipped the human being with a universal principle or life-form that would determine what agrees or disagrees with it. As humans, we must determine our mode of life for ourselves. Contrary to other interpretations, I argue that this places the human capacity for pleasure and displeasure outside of nature and in a realm of spirit.",

      "title": "[Support psychotherapy in traumatic situations].",
      "abstract": "It seems that a certain consensus exists to speak about a traumatic situation as an experience which is made up of a threat on the physical or psychological integrity of a person and against which one responds with fear, desperation and intensive horror. Different psychological phenomena are involved with the manner through which a human being confronts his/her past. In particular, the response to traumatic situations, mourning, and blame share their characteristic of being an irreversible living reality related to facts, loss or past impacts and it is necessary to integrate these in one's life in order to advance; these comprise a triangle frequently coexisting and interconnected. Aid for these three situations has, therefore, as common elements, two premises: an active task is required by the person who suffers this situation; this person must, in some form, desire to move ahead. One can not toil in mourning, in a traumatic experience, or in a life of blame if these have a positive symbolic value for this person; for example, mourning as a manner not to treason the dead person by forgetting that person, the reliving a trauma as an attempt to provide some sense to the actions which occurred, or blame as a desire to not forget an error or as a final punishment of this active task; the final objective of this active task is not usually to forget but to integrate in order to live. If a person does not perceive this clearly, this person may not become actively involved in the task to overcome a traumatic situation and to move ahead, nor will that person accept that a person who tries to help questions this person's realities or experiences.",

This chapter suggests that we can also yearn and ‘grieve’ for relationships that we never had but needed. As a social species we are evolved with social motives and mentalities to form relationships with others. From birth, we need and are able to respond to ‘loving care’ because we have brains that are seeking and receptive to those signals. People who come from neglectful or abusive backgrounds can be forced to close down these care-seeking systems, but this form of defense does not remove the basic evolved motivational system. In psychotherapy clients can experience a new sense of connectedness to their care-seeking systems and experience ‘grief and yearning’ for the love and ‘desired parent’ their care-seeking system was designed to seek and connect with.",

      "abstract": "Suicidal overdose, running away from home, and scarification are frequent behaviors in adolescence. Like other break-away behaviors, we understand these as corporeal embodiments anchored, in both form and substance, more on the side of psychic productions than passages-to-the-act that are known to short-circuit thinking. These behaviors are linked in part to a conscious intent that embodies the erasure, or emptying of inner tensions out of oneself, “getting a handle on them,” which is synonymous with control, the transposition of psychic suffering into palpable, visible percepts and the attempt to have an effect on people around the adolescent, in order to obtain recognition and favorable rearrangements. They are also unconscious and very condensed, carrying out attempts at figuration which give form and substance to psychic representations that the subject suffering in his identity tries to avoid or cover up. Most of the adolescents in question cannot put this suffering into words. In order to prepare them for psychic work, we think it is necessary to gradually ally emotion with representation and act with speech. This can be through therapeutic acts able to foster re-binding, offered as supports to figuration. We give some examples from the experience of our staff, which for the past 15 years has been organizing brief hospital stays for suicidal youths in a specialized unit.",

This means that all objects appear placed together on an even plane, each one equal to the other. The denial of their worth goes hand in hand with the belief in an absolute meaning that exists elsewhere, behind the meaning of things, even behind the plane of reality. What original deception or betrayal is at stake for the melancholic subject to so protect himself from an essentially defaulting object and to transfer cathexis onto a presumed ideal behind all things? The collusion between the object and the ego ideal is thus to be feared. The melancholic subject, however, in a renewal of interest for a specific activity that consists in the composition and structuring of his surroundings succeeds in conjuring up objects for contemplation; in other words aesthetic objects capable, metonymically, of designating the beyond and of fulfilling the screen function attributed to reality until then. Whereas admittedly such an object seems a matter of aesthetic quality on the philosophical level, what status does it have on a metapsychological level?",

      "abstract": "The new millennium man is living in a completely new context that many people have defined liquid, systemic, global, uncertain about the consequences it could generate. \r\nThis new man will be concerned to face his own context as well as his ancestors did; he will must actively change it and must be changed by it: he has to build his life through it and, together with the others, think about what are the ways they should take to complete their growth.\r\nIn this respect, the quality of the relationship he will be able to maintain with the “out-of-him” will be crucial: at the moment it seems that the fear leads him, i.e. the fear to lose the right street to his personal growth, failing his main task as a man. The relational fragmentation with himself, with the others and with his social and natural behaviour and the lack of plans for the future spread away, making the essential objectives of the human formation farther and harder to be reached. \r\nYet not anything is lost and from the same liquid fragmented context, new proposals and new possibilities appear: actually, often the Answer is not this novelty in itself but what is new is how it is used to interpret the present. So the communitas (community), an ancient form of human aggregation, comes back, with new ideas, new features and new aims.\r\nThis work aims to analyse the issue of community, in particular in its educational meaning and in its possibility to be a mean of growth of the human being where the humanization is an excellent place. The issue, having regard to its complexity has been treated considering two points of view, linked by a common aim. From one side the community has been treated by a theoretical multi-disciplinary point of view giving a definition of communitas that groups together knowledge from psychology, philosophy, politics, sociology, history, pedagogy, etc… through 8 main dimensions (spatial-territorial, temporal-narrative, relational, cultural, educational, socio-political, psychic-spiritual, utopici-eschatological). By the other side it has been analysed from a empirical point of view studying a particular community, the Programa Educativo de Ninos, Ninas y Adolescentes Trabajadores “Alejandro Cussianovich” (educational program for working children and teenagers “Alejandro Cussianovich”) operating in the suburbs of Peru’s capital Lima.\r\nThis research is composed by the collection, analysis and interpretation of some interviews, by a researcher’s diary, written after a period of about one and half year of in situ observation and by the analysis of some institutional documents of the educational program. \r\nIt has been then tried to join the theoretical research to the most practical one with the major aim to underline the central relevance of the community in forming people and to understand whether and how it could answer, for example, to the relational fragmentation problem. In particular, the theoretical research has been used to analyze and interpret data collected in the educational program using the already described 8 dimensions, while the practical research has allowed to find a new dimension (the working-economical one) and some other nuclei (like the family, the cross-culture, the fight, and so on) which must be taken into account when we want to study and/or to promote the community in the territory. \r\nAs a conclusion of this thesis, it has been said that is possible to link community experiences although far one from each other using the conceptual instrument elaborated, and that it would be desirable apply what understood in this research to the educational program work.",

It is a by-product of the deference and responsiveness that are essential to our engagement with the world.

And we cannot develop and sustain valuable projects without responding to the constraints imposed on our activities by the nature and requirements of those projects themselves. More generally, we cannot engage with the world without responding differentially—or displaying partiality—with respect to the objects of our engagement. Partiality is thus a by-product of engagement. We cannot engage with the world at all without exhibiting forms of partiality.",

      "abstract": "Even in this scientific and jet-age, some people still believe that variations brought about by individual differences (differences in behaviour, reasoning and approaches to problem-solving) are controlled by some strange forces that cannot be seen, touch or comprehend. These forces, they believe, are real, but beyond the understanding and comprehension of humans. Predominant in this view are those who hold that humans and the propensities surrounding their complicated behaviour are innately determined and fundamentally controlled by some spiritual forces animated by the soul (which can be good or evil). Even though modern science and technology have ruled out this belief system or concept as disingenuous, yet it continues to hold prominence among people of many nations, of which Nigerians are greatly involved. Even with its commanding number of Universities and highly learned population, people in Nigeriaoverwhelmingly have the belief that humans are not intrinsically and expressively responsible for their behaviour, rather it is remotely controlled by the evil spirits and their agents. Incredibly it may seem, this view is also held among highly educated Nigerians. Through scientific breakthroughs, the mechanisms through which behaviour emerges have been revealed, showing that human behaviour and cognition are animated and propelled by the brain cells, called theneurons. How this life-animating system functions to bring about myriads of complicated and astonishing physical, mental, cognitive and emotional activities are the sole aim of this article. This article gives a fundamental background under which the brain operates and coordinates activities that give rise to human behaviour. It is basically presented as an introductory approach to biological and chemical basis of human behaviour, giving professionals, searchers-of-trueknowledge and students a friendly perspective to conceptualize the brain's responsiveness to internal and external stimuli that generate human behaviour. After this exploration, the reader will come to understand how the brain is responsible for complicated behaviour previously attributed to evil spirit.",

They perform their duties without any interior spirit, without relish and without fruit. These are in danger of mortal sin. Sometimes they are in a state of sin without realizing it, because they never seriously enter into themselves and their examination of conscience is extremely superficial. In this state of inattention innumerable objects pass through their mind each day, their heart is carried away and seems intoxicated with the turmoil of exterior matters; it is ceaselessly deceived by the illusions of nature and the devil, and it blindly follows their impulses.",

They could successfully negotiate with people who possessed supervenient moral standing. In a hypothetical evolutionary competition with the latter, they would replace them entirely. The result would be a moral community that excludes animals but that includes human infants. Membership in the moral community ends up being what it would be if moral standing supervened on the property of being human. The supervenience doctrine is also criticized on other grounds.",

      "title": "Concepts of Supervenience",
      "abstract": "We think of the world around us not as a mere assemblage of unrelated objects, events, and facts, but as constituting a system, something that shows structure, and whose constituents are connected with one another in significant ways. This view of the world seems fundamental to our scheme of things; it is reflected in the commonplace assumption that things that happen in one place can make a difference to things that happen in another in a way that enables us to make sense of one thing in terms of another, infer information about one thing from information about another, or affect one thing by affecting another. Central to this idea of interconnectedness of things is a notion of dependence (or, its converse, determination): things are connected with one another in that whether something exists, or what properties it has, is dependent on, or determined by, what other things exist and what kinds of things they are. It is in virtue of these dependency or determinative relationships that the world can be made intelligible; and by exploiting them we are able to intervene in the course of events and alter it to suit our wishes. Activities like explanation, prediction, and control would make little sense for a world devoid of such connections. The idea that real connections exist and the idea that the world is intelligible and controllable are arguably an equivalent idea. Causation is a preeminent example of what I am calling determinative or dependency relations; apart from those that are logically based, such as entailment, it is the only explicitly recognized and widely discussed relation of this kind. Causes determine their effects, and effects are dependent, for their existence and properties, on their causes. It is not for nothing that",

Although it seems paradoxical at first (for he\nwho does not tell the untruth intentionally is, strictly\nspeaking, not a liar at all), it rests upon a much more\nradical self-deception which is quite useful â€“ a systematic\nand continuous illusion regarding ourselves. Higher-order\nforms of self-consciousness, namely I-consciousness, are\nbased on a feature which is called a self-model. This is an\nepisodically active representational entity (e.g. a complex\nactivation pattern in a human brain), the contents of which\nare properties of the system itself. It is embedded and\nconstantly updated in a global model of the world, based\non perceptions, memories, innate information etc.\n(Metzinger 1993). But because self-models cannot\nrepresent their own representations as their own\nrepresentations as their own representations and so on ad\ninfinitum, they are semantically transparent, i.e. on the\nlevel of their content they do not contain the information\nthat they are models. Thus, such systems are not able to\nrecognize their self-model as a self-model (Van Gulick\n1988). The result is an ego-illusion, which is stable,\ncoherent, and cannot be transcended on the level of\nconscious experience itself.",

These are miserable feelings, and suffering them will reinforce both their sense of failure and their vengeful attitude towards the world. The avaricious, envious, proud, and resentful can all be said to be inordinate in their desire to have a certain position for themselves secured or maintained.

      "title": "MEASURE FOR MEASURE:<i>THE RELIANCE OF HUMAN KNOWLEDGE ON THE THINGS OF THE WORLD</i>",
      "abstract": "When all things were in disorder, God created in each thing in relation to itself, and in all things in relation to each other, all the measures and harmonies which they could possibly receive. —Plato, Timaeus (69b) Is my body a thing, is it an idea? It is neither, being the measurant of the things. We will therefore have to recognize an ideality that is not alien to the flesh, that gives it its axes, its depth, its dimensions. —Maurice Merleau-Ponty (1968, 152) The search for truths differs from the search for truth criteria in more ways than those that are immediately obvious. —M. C. Dillon (1997, 9) The notion that all knowledge is a form of measurement can be traced back to the Socratic insight that knowledge requires the presence of some standard against which things are measured. We cannot account for our knowledge of things, Socrates argued, without appealing to some prior capacity we have for recognizing, comparing, or measuring things in terms of something else, for example, a concept or definition. In the modern era, Kant extended this insight to include perception as such, [End Page 175] arguing that even though our perceptual experience seems to be direct and immediate, upon reflection we know that some process of mediation must be at work which enables us to have a stable experience of objects. Faced with such insights, we are compelled to ask how such measuring is possible. If experience and knowledge rely on some capacity for measurement, what is measurement and what does it entail? The most common contemporary answer to this question can be found in notion that our experience and knowledge are \"constructed\" by distinctly human, that is, cultural factors. Having abandoned Kant's notion of a priori knowledge and its various Idealist offshoots, contemporary constructivism nonetheless maintains that cultural structures (although not fixed or permanent ones) serve as the basic principles upon which experience and knowledge are built. Such a view has some merit, insofar as it enables us to acknowledge the mediated character of our experience, while also avoiding the problematic claims of traditional idealism. But as appealing as this view is, it raises the question of the place and role of nature in our experience. From a constructivist point of view, although we may acknowledge that our experience and knowledge depend in crucial ways upon natural elements and events, it can often seem naive to discuss the role of such natural factors within experience—except, that is, as we admit that nature itself is \"constructed\" by culture, for example, language, conceptual systems, theoretical constructs, ideology, political power, institutional practices, and so forth. That is, although we no longer accord cultural factors an a priori or absolute status, we remain convinced that in fact cultural norms play the final, determining role in shaping our experience. In the end, we have come to believe, it is culture that measures and defines nature, not vice versa. My aim in this essay is to articulate an alternative view of the measurement involved in human experience and knowledge, one which helps us to overcome the privileging of culture over nature that still plagues contemporary thought. My account is inspired by Merleau-Ponty's philosophy of the body, particularly his notion that the human body serves as a \"measurant of things.\" There are two key components of this claim. First, it describes the body's general capacity for measurement, and does not appeal to any specific measure or standard of measurement. As a measurant, the body is not any particular measure; rather, it is a thing that measures, an element of the natural world that brings measurement to the [End Page 176] things it encounters, thus bringing meaning into our experience. Second, the body's capacity to measure shows how our natural being as bodies is inherently meaningful, because measurement is, as we shall see...",

In these \"narrative documents,\" or \"narratives,\" the main part of the information content consists in the description of \"events\" that relate the real or intended behavior of some \"actors\" (characters, personages, etc.)—the term \"event\" is taken here in its more general meaning, also covering strictly related notions like fact, action, state, and situation. These actors try to attain a specific result, experience particular situations, manipulate some (concrete or abstract) materials, send or receive messages, buy, sell, deliver, and so forth. Note that in these narratives, the actors or personages are not necessarily human beings; we can have narrative documents concerning, for example, the vicissitudes in the journey of a nuclear submarine (the \"actor,\" \"subject,\" or \"personage\") or the various avatars in the life of a commercial product. Note also that even if a large amount of narrative documents concerns natural language (NL) texts, this is not necessarily true. A photo representing a situation that verbalized could be expressed as \"Three nice girls are lying on the beach\" is not of course an NL text, yet it is still a narrative document.

It is at such a time that the physician's humanity must touch the unique personhood of the afflicted if the death is to be \"good\". A physician's duty does not rest on the medical profession's code of conduct; it consists of the physician's moral obligation to a specific person in a specific situation. That person's entire identity--not just the physical being--is assaulted by terminal illness; the emotional, familial, and social dimensions of selfhood are ravaged by the disease as surely as is the body. Each individual is involved in his or her suffering in a way that is unique and that cannot be understood or appreciated by anyone else. But the physician must try to bridge the distance that is placed around the sufferer by the dying process. And it is only with his or her own humanity that the care giver can accomplish this. That humanity should inform all decision making, and thus bring with it genuine control and comfort. In this way the patient can truly \"own\" his or her own death. The patient can thereby attain reason and courage, which together are the quality of grace.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Compared to the extreme interest in the concept of identity and its different dimensions (self, narrative, organizational, ethnic, gender, and so forth), the concept of identification has received slightly less attention. And yet in a curious way, identification was established as an important psychological concept before identity was introduced into the human sciences by philosopher George Herbert Mead, psychologist Erik Erikson, and others. Already in the 1920s Freud was using the concept of identification extensively to describe a process whereby an individual assimilates a quality of an object and incorporates it in his or her own constitution. Thus, a child may identify with a parent or a follower may identify with a leader, imagining themselves to have some of the qualities of the person they identify with. What was important for Freud was that identification fundamentally transforms the subject who forges a new sense of identity by assimilating the perceived (and often idealized) attributes of the other person. Identification was seen by Freud as one of the two core processes of forming relations with others (the other being love for another person). He viewed the development of our mental personality as occurring through successive identifications with different people we admire. The view that identification with the parent of the same sex forms one of the commonest and firmest foundations of identity is also to be found in Erikson, who, however, argued that one must eventually ‘disidentify’ from such parent figures or risk lapsing into an identity crisis.",

There are regularities characteristic of beliefs and desires, regularities that dictate both the effect of certain sort of evidence on what beliefs and desires are maintained, and the effect of certain sorts of belief–desire profiles on what responses are evinced. Those regularities will typically identify what it is to be evidentially rational in the attitudes one holds and responsively rational in the responses one makes, though they may also point us toward obstacles that get in the way of rational performance.

I don’t mean that they are generally deviant or that they perform abnormally on conservation or class inclusion tasks. They generally seem more or less normal, and on the few occasions when I have presented tasks from the cognitive developmental literature, they have acted pretty much like the children described in the articles. Where my children are altogether different from the theoretical descriptions is in the variability of their thinking. Cognitive developmental theories generally depict age and thought as proceeding in a 1:1 relation. At an early age, children think in one way; at a later age, they think in another way; at a still later age, they think in a third way. Such descriptions are so pervasive that they begin to feel like reality. Young children are said to form thematic concepts; somewhat older ones to form chain concepts; yet older ones to form true concepts. The reasoning of young children is said to be preoperational; that of somewhat older ones concrete operational; that of yet older ones formal operational. Young children are said to have one theory of mind; somewhat older ones a different, more inclusive theory; yet older ones a more advanced theory still. The story is the same with characterizations of performance on specific tasks. In descriptions of the development of the concept of living things, 3- and 4-yearolds are said to think that anything that moves is alive, 5- to 8-year-olds that animals—and only animals—are alive, and older children that plants as well as animals are alive. In descriptions of the development of addition skill, kindergartners are said to count from one; first through third graders to count from the larger addend; fourth graders and older children to retrieve answers from memory. In descriptions of the development of serial recall strategies, 5-year-olds are said not to rehearse; 8-year-olds to rehearse in a simple way; 11-year-olds to rehearse in a more elaborate way. My children’s thinking has never looked as neat and clean as these 1:1 characterizations of the relation between age and thought.",

At least all of the virtues of character – justice, generosity, temperance, courage, and so on – just are habituated states brought about by the repeated doing of actions of a certain ethical type. We are not born courageous or cowardly (although we may have natural dispositions in one direction or the other); rather, we are made courageous or cowardly insofar as we have engaged in courageous or cowardly actions in our lives. Engaging in actions of a certain type gives rise to the corresponding habituated state of character. In short, “we become just by doing just things, temperate by doing temperate things, and courageous by doing courageous things” (N.E. ii.1, 1103a34–b2). Let us call this idea “the habituation principle” (HP). As the explicit analogy with craft (technê) in N.E. ii.1 shows, the habituation principle is itself value neutral: one becomes a good harpist or a good builder if one acquires good building or harp-playing habits, but a bad one if not; similarly one becomes a virtuous person if she engages in virtuous acts, but a bad or vicious person if one doesn’t.",

But the very condition of such a bootstrap-lifting stunt is that there is, after all, nothing to guarantee the modern self-nothing, that is, except its abandonment, in the mode of reflection or of delirium, of all external guarantees. So, according to the other story, the absence or impotence of God, the Church, the king, tradition, makes the modern subject more liable to come apart at the seams than ever before. The very strength of the modern self is its weakness, just as its weakness is the ultimate source of its strength.",

Affirmation, moreover, allows one to distinguish between the self and sources of self‐satisfaction, and take responsibility for another, thereby preventing premeditated violent acts, which it is argued, are the product of dis‐affirmations of the self. The birth of affirmation, it is postulated, derives from the gaze of the other, the domain, as Levinas stated, of concrete existence. It is here that a person is granted his or her right, simply, to be.",

      "abstract": "Stories of loss are often polyvocal, spoken differently from the perspective of the many participants in a grief system, or even from the vantage point of the many voices that issue from a given individual, simultaneously or across time. Disrupted narratives take two forms: those that are chaotic, and those that are conflictual. In both cases, an existing and previously adequate life narrative is challenged by the loss, and ceases to provide a coherent structure for integrating past experience, enacting a meaningful social role in the present, and projecting into the future. Intrapersonal chaos occurs when a loss intrudes into an individual's heretofore coherent story of the self or significant others, in such a way that it cannot easily be assimilated. Interpersonal chaos refers to the jarring disruption of a shared or communal narrative that leaves two or more persons struggling to make sense of the destabilizing transition, without access to any clear means of doing so.",

Human beings engage in relatively little direct eye‐to‐eye contact. For humans and other animal species, eye behavior is an important communication tool that has a role in survival, reproduction, and building and maintaining social and role relationships. Being watched is as important as watching others. As the target of another's eye gaze, a person's performance is infused with significance – in either positive or negative ways. Because of its importance to human interaction, people are sensitive to the absence of gaze when it is expected and its presence when it is not. We often perceive eye‐to‐eye contact when the eyes are actually tracking many points around the area of the eyes.",

      "title": "The Creative Person as Maverick",
      "abstract": "The innate talents that are the essence of creativity are associated with a particular type of character structure. The child's creative potential has to be supported by the infantile milieu, which also happens to have a characteristic stamp. Within this context of personality configurations and developmental antecedents associated with creative ability, there can be considerable variation. I am not postulating a specific or stereotypic creative character. There are, however, certain qualities that can be found in various character types (and can even exist alongside psychopathology) that are often found in creative scientists and perhaps artists as well. I believe the maverick often possesses these character traits and many of the scientists I have had the opportunity of treating proudly considered themselves mavericks. The creative personality is characterized by paradoxes; these cast it in the maverick mold. Possessors of this personality belong and do not belong. They do not break the rules but bend them a little. They are nonconformists but not rebels. They display many features that do not seem to belong together. The paradoxical qualities that dominate the creator's personality and behavior are the outcome of a certain fluidity of character and ego boundaries. The creative process involves a broad range of functioning and traverses various levels of the psyche, frequently reaching down to the very earliest, primary-process-oriented parts of the self. Ego boundaries, in turn, can become quite fluid and permeable, even though they are ordinarily firmly established and well structured. It is this broad spectrum, a prominent feature of the creative process (Giovacchini, 1965, 1971, 1981), that has been often confused with psychopathology. These paradoxical elements are the outcome of an infantile environment that has provided considerable gratification. Again the early milieu of creative personalities may be extremely varied, but there has always been some person or persons who have had a considerable emotional investment in the child. As the developing psyche incorporates and introjects these gratifying and security-establishing experiences, they become amalgamated into the self-representation. In the face of adversity, they provide confidence and reassurance and allow the creator to soothe him- or herself when upset by inner tension. Consequently, creative scientists do not depend so much on the outer world as they do on inner resources. One scientist told me that he could not understand how anyone could ever be bored. Even if he were denied access to his work, he could always find something interesting to do or explore.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

Conversation progresses on the assumption of such co-avowal, as we each manifestly endorse an increasing set of common attitudes, enabling any one of us to presume on the authorization of others to speak for what we all believe or want. And so, the motive for conversation explains the motive for co-avowal. We can have the confidence to make this sort of co-avowal insofar as we can presume on the common availability of certain data and desiderata and on our having broadly common dispositions to respond to these. I may also co-avow or co-pledge the intentions of individual others as well as myself but only in special circumstances; and I may co-avow or co-pledge the special intentions I hold jointly with others, whether within or without corporate bodies.

Platonists, for example, have sometimes viewed sexual activity as inherently bad, since in their view it lowered the spirit, which is the true self, to a preoccupation for the merely bodily. On the other hand, dualism has often led to a somewhat opposite view, namely, sexual libertinism. For, if the self is a spirit, or a consciousness, and the body is outside the self, then bodily sexual activities may be viewed as rather unimportant – useful perhaps to obtain pleasure (viewed as an effect in one's consciousness), to relieve tension, or so on. If one's body, or one's animality, is viewed as extrinsic to what one really is, then one might also conclude that what happens within the realm of the bodily or animal is of itself quite irrelevant to what occurs to one's real self. Perhaps the sexual may receive some important significance or meaning, but – if the self is a pure consciousness – it does not have within its nature, or inherently, any significance or value.",

      "title": "Loneliness: The Silent Killer",
      "abstract": "Loneliness is a universal human emotion that is both complex and unique to everyone. It has no single and widespread cause. Therefore, the prevention and treatment of loneliness as a potentially damaging state of mind can vary dramatically from person to person. Notwithstanding the deleterious impact on quality of life and life satisfaction, loneliness has an equivalent risk factor to health as smoking fifteen cigarettes a day, thereby shortening one's life span by eight years. Humans can survive three minutes without air, three days without water, three weeks without food—as told by survival lore—and three months without companionship. We are a social and gregarious people. People simply need people. Loneliness is a complicated emotion. Some people can feel lonely in a crowded room or feel content in solitude. A quick way to think about loneliness is this: It's the difference between how much social connection or interaction people want and how much they are getting. It is essential to acknowledge that these relationships should be important and positive. A few positive relationships are far better than a dozen negative interactions. Thus, it is a subjective feeling. Without that social connection, people often become depressed, which further feeds feelings of loneliness. Loneliness has been linked to higher rates of heart disease, alcohol and drug addition, violence, anxiety, depression, altered brain function, Alzheimer's disease progression, decreased memory and learning, increased stress levels, suicide, and even death. Loneliness is almost as prevalent as obesity and has shown to impact all aspects of quality of life. Loneliness causes people to feel empty, alone, and unwanted. Loneliness is clearly a public health concern. Over the past two decades, there has been a threefold increase in the number of Americans who say they have no close confidants. More than fifty-five million people in the US described themselves as lonely or socially isolated. One of our responses to COVID-19 is social distancing, where we stay six feet away from others. This is a misnomer. Don't we really mean physically distancing because we engage in phone conversations, email each other, attend Zoom meetings, and so on? Perhaps it is time for US institutions of higher education to follow one approach to combating loneliness used in the United Kingdom: appointing a minister of loneliness at the dean's level or above. Loneliness is a universal condition that affects all of us directly or through the people we know and love. A sad reality of modern life is that loneliness is pervasive and on the rise. In fact, since 1985, the number of people in the US who indicated they had no close friends has tripled. Loneliness has been found to be a serious impediment to flourishing while cultivating strong positive connections with people has been seen to bring meaning and well-being to individuals. Loneliness is also a strong predictor of poor health. To feel lonely is to experience a sense of being painfully disconnected, left out, and isolated, with no one to turn to for emotional and social support. Since the dawn of antiquity, we have been built to be social creatures. Across key demographics, younger generations are lonelier than older generations, men are lonelier than women, higher-income people are less lonely than those with lower incomes, and those living in urban and suburban communities are less lonely than those in rural areas. Department chairs are in an enviable position to address loneliness in their faculty and staff. Although COVID-19 has reduced in-person interactions, chairs can still be cognizant of how department members are relating to other faculty, staff, and students. Colleges are often equipped with resources and services such as group sessions, counseling, and workshops to proactively address many types of issues. One of the best ways that chairs can help with loneliness is to recognize that it is a very real possibility and to stay connected with faculty and staff via regular interactions with them. Perhaps Thomas Wolfe said it best in God's Lonely Man: “The whole conviction of my life now rests upon the belief that loneliness, far from being a rare and curious phenomenon, peculiar to myself and a few other solitary men, is the central and inevitable fact of human existence.” Robert E.

      "abstract": "The sublime emerges in the history of philosophy as the object of an aesthetic experience very often contrasted with the aesthetic experience of the beautiful.While the latter experience is mainly positive and pleasurable, the former experience is characterized by ambivalent feelings.On the one hand, the sublime involves an overwhelming vastness, or power, which disturbs and unsettles.On the other hand, the sublime poses a challenge, which is enlightening and elating.The overall experience of the sublime is also frequently associated with the feeling of the insignificance of human life, of our smallness compared to the grandeur we are confronted with.In the light of recent psychological and neuroscientific studies, we claim that the sublime gives rise to an aesthetic experience that, contrary to the experience of the beautiful, involves a diminished sense of the self.More precisely, sublimity experiences are immersive and tend to blur the distinction between the self and the world.Our claim has implications for a vexed question about the sublime, namely whether it is restricted to natural scenes or extends to artworks.We suggest that in favourable conditions, art can elicit sublimity experiences.We then offer a roadmap to test our claim within an experimental setting, with special focus on music and virtual reality devices to deal with the immersive character of sublimity experiences.",

С. 9-37 10 Indeed, when people feel emotions they may not only show their internal states physically (e.g. by blushing or changing their facial expression), but also perform speech acts which are interpersonal in nature and have particular consequences.And by so doing speakers manifest, and at the same time affect, certain aspects of the cognitive, social and discourse systems they belong to.Indeed, emotion affects language and at the same time is affected by language: the way we feel may influence the way we talk and express those feelings, and at the same time, the way we name or talk about emotions can affect the way we feel such emotions.Perhaps nothing is more human than the verbal expression of emotion, for even though other animal species may express certain basic emotions in non-verbal ways, they certainly cannot talk about them (Alba-Juez & Mackenzie, 2016: 242).Sharing emotions is a crucial social activity which forms part of everyday conversation and interaction and helps us maintain both our mental and physical health.To express and understand these emotions appropriately is therefore important to interpersonal relationships and individual well-being (Fussell, 2002).Furthermore, it can be said that human emotion lies at the root of verbal communication.As Russian emotiologists suggest, in the beginning was not the Word, but the Emotion, because the basis of primary and secondary nominations from the very beginning were the emotions of a person, not yet Homo Loquens, but already Homo Sentiens (Shakhovsky 2008: 10).If we do not have the motivation to talk about something, our speech will most surely be very restricted (Foolen, 2015).As Stern (1965Stern ( [1931]]: 54) put it, \"If a thing were quite indifferent to me I would not say it\".Also, if a speaker feels that her interlocutor is not interested in what she is saying, it will be hard to continue speaking.Thus, emotion in communication works in both directions: not only the speaker has to have the motivation to speak, but the interlocutor should be willing (and therefore positively predisposed, showing a positive attitude) to listen; otherwise, communication will not take place.In the 20 th century, linguistics was mainly concerned with the referential function of language and the linguistic code per se.Language was seen as an abstract and logical instrument for dealing with factual information.The also true fact that language is strongly affected by and loaded with emotion was almost completely disregarded.But towards the end of the 20 th and beginning of the 21 st centuries, the world of scientific and humanistic research started to reflect upon the fact that language/discourse is much more than a code or some grammatical, morphological or phonological rules: the pragmatic, cognitive and emotive dimensions of human communication transcend the linguistic code, and this had to be reflected upon and shown in the research.Thus the world of linguistics geared towards what has now been called \"the emotional turn\" (Le Doux, 2000).Linguists started to study the phenomenon from a more objective, scientific point of view and thus came to the conclusion that indeed, as Ochs and Shieffeling had already pointed out back in 1989, \"language has a heart\".As several authors have now observed, emotion is undoubtedly a very important part of every kind of communication, and can be found at all the levels of linguistic description (Alba-Juez",

      "abstract": "In the Yulgok's Educational Theory, the ideal man as an educated man is a superior man(君子) or sincere scholar(眞儒). The concept of a superior man can be analyzed in the two respects. One is the extension of the concept. The other is the connotation of the concept. The extension of a superior man includes variable similar concepts ie, a sage, a wise man, etc. The connotation or meaning of a superior man can be understood in the respect of virtue and social position, especially in the respect of virtue.\r\n A superior man or sincere scholar is a moral man. On the other hand, an inferior man(小人) and pseudo-superior man(鄕原) are unmoral men. At this time, the criteria of discriminating the superior man and inferior man are existence and/or nonexistence of virtue.\r\n Then, what is the central concern or essence of a superior man? It is the realization of 'Jen'. The superior man is a moral man who tries to accomplish 'Jen' and has a hope to the great union-world(大同世界), an Utopia of Confucianism where individual self-realization and social self-realization can be attained. Therefore, in the Confucianism, the cultivation of the self(修己) and the ruling over others(治人) are also important. But, after Neo-Confucianism of the Sung-Dynasty, there has been a propensity to emphasize the cultivation of the self than the ruling over others, both of which are the nature of learning and cultivation of the superior man. This propensity became an unavoidable actual restrain, politically and socially. However, Yulgok said that the sincere scholar must take positive interest in ruling the nation and giving relief to the people ie, 'the ruling over others'. It is a very positive view of the sincere scholar.",

Indeed, care for others, loving others well in ways that enhance their well-being, not only enables more people to contribute usefully to the common good. It is the healing of the soul that builds up true excellence for the enjoyment of and satisfaction with the self. To care for others is ultimately to grow toward becoming what Augustine believes God truly means for people to become: loving as God is loving, beautiful as God is beautiful, and wise as God is wise. The therapeutic dynamic is both from without to within and from within again outward. Augustine’s hope is that people will mature into adept and agile love and become less curved in on themselves for both their own well-being and that of others.",

The one emotion that is robustly demonstrated to be more associated with the left hemisphere is anger, though emotions that are superficial, conscious or willed may be subserved by the left hemisphere. The left hemisphere cannot trust and is prone to paranoia. The hemispheres have different ways of understanding the body.

They consist primarily of the promise of unconditional love and protection by a figure perceived as infallible.

      "abstract": "Like most other literary-critical terms, character, figure or person are polysemic and ambiguous. For the purpose of this essay, character or person in narrative will be understood as designating a human or human-like individual, existing in some possible world, and capable of fulfilling the argument position in the propositional form DO(X) - that is, a Narrative Agent (=NA), to whom inner states, mental properties (traits, features) or complexes of such properties (personality models) can be ascribed on the basis of textual data. This particular explication of the term has the advantage of capturing the reader's intuitive understanding of the term, while at the same time enabling a disciplined and explicit study of this phenomenon within narratology. The ascription of individual mental traits to an NA may be called and the ascription of complexes of traits character-building or portraiture. The two activities are logically and substantively different. The first is the primary one and is based on inference drawn from individual acts of the NA, details of his looks and setting, etc. (see below). Character-building, on the other hand, comes later and involves several additional operations. These include the accumulation of a number of traits from several successive acts of the NA, setting, or formal patterns; a generalization concerning their extent in terms of narrative time; the classification or categorization of these traits; their interrelation in terms of a network or hierarchy of traits; a confrontation of traits belonging to successive acts in order to infer second order traits such as inconsistent; and finally, an attempt to interrelate the traits or trait-clusters into a unified stable constellation (configuration, pattern, Gestalt, personality model) of some duration in terms of narrative time. Character-building consists of a succession of individual operations of characterization, together with second order activities of continual patterning and repatterning of the traits obtained in the first order operations, until a fairly coherent",

And now at the present stage, scientists recognize the presence of more than 20 senses in a person. For example, a person is able to feel changes in the temperature of surrounding objects and air, to analyze the degree of limb flexion, to feel the empty stomach or fullness of the bladder. Thus, there can be pain, vibration, gravitation, visceral sensitivity, and so on. Many feelings have already been well studied, but there are those that no one knows about.

And it is not uncommon for such people to argue against the destruction of human embryos by invoking the claim that the destruction of human embryos is morally on par with killing the following humans: (A) the standard infant, (B) the suicidal teenager, (C) the temporarily comatose individual, and (D) the standard adult. I argue here that this claim is false and do so as follows. First, I provide an account of the prima facie wrongness of killing individuals (A) – (D). Briefly, I contend that individuals (A) – (D) have a certain property in common, that of having a future of value. An individual who has a future of value has the potential to (i) value goods of consciousness when he will (or would) experience them and (ii) do so as a psychologically continuous individual.",

      "abstract": "Aristotle's well-known divisions of friendship, those based on utility, pleasure and virtue, are based on the kind of good each provides. It is fairly easy to see what is contributed by utility- and pleasure-friendships, but virtue-friendship presents a special difficulty. Aristotle writes that virtue-friendship occurs between good (virtuous) persons, each of whom is happy because of that goodness. Aristotle also asserts, however, that the good (happy) person, especially the philosopher, is largely self-sufficient, needing little in the way of external goods for his happiness. Such a person is virtuous not only in the moral sense but intellectually, having developed the capacities of the mind to make effective moral decisions and, in the case of the philosopher, to contemplate the most divine of subjects. If that is the case, it is not difficult to see why such a person would not need many utility- or pleasure-friends, but why would he need virtue-friends? What does virtue-friendship contribute to the happiness of one who is already happy? Possible answers to those questions have been provided by a number of commentators, whose views will be considered below. I believe their answers can be classified into three general types of argument: the �opportunity argument�, the �reassurance argument� and the �pleasure argument�. Although all of these have their merits, each has pitfalls. There is another possible answer, an �essentialist argument�, which more accurately describes Aristotle's view. I will argue that virtue-friends come to understand each other's true selves, and each, through the awareness and contemplation of the other, becomes a better human being and, consequently, happier.",

The behavior, desires, and feelings of lovers simply cannot be understood if people neglect, or misunderstand, its temporal nature. The idea of a love relationship's \"having a future\" combines an inherently conservative thought with an inherently progressive thought. The conservative thought is that the parties will continue as participants in the current relationship; thus, in this respect, the future will resemble the past. The progressive thought is that in other respects, the future should not resemble the past: although the relationship will persist, the parties will change how they relate to one another in various ways, altering their lives and, to some degree, their very selves, not only to accommodate themselves to their partners but also to permit the relationship to pass through the expected stages.",

Mentalistic psychologies insist that other kinds of events, lacking the physical dimensions of stimuli, are accessible to the owner of the skin within which they occur. One solution often regarded as behavioristic, granting the distinction between public and private events and ruling the latter out of consideration, has not been successful. A science of behavior must face the problem of privacy by dealing with events within the skin in their relation to behavior, without assuming they have a special nature or must be known in a special way.The search for copies of the world within the body (e.g. the sensations and images of conscious content) has also had discouraging results. The organism does not create duplicates: Its seeing, hearing, smelling, and so on are forms of action rather than of reproduction. Seeing does not imply something seen. We know that when we dream of wolves, no wolves are actually there; it is harder to understand that not even representations of wolves are there.Mentalistic formulations create mental way stations. Where experimental analyses examine the effects of variables on behavior, mentalistic psychologies deal first with their effects on inferred entities such as feelings or expectations and then with the effects of these entities on behavior. Mental states thus seem to bridge gaps between dependent and independent variables, and mentalistic interpretations are particularly attractive when these are separated by long time periods. The practice confuses the order of events and leads to unfinished causal accounts.",

Constructed as threats to social order and public decency, they return to haunt the lives of the more secure. To understand the ghostly dynamics of such people and groups, criminologists need methods attuned to uncertainty and absence—methods designed to engage with the presence of absence, and to distinguish between those not there, those no longer there, and those soon to disappear. Such methods must also orient criminologists to ghostly spaces: to temporal aftermaths, to residues and ruins, and to the interstitial shadows of social life. To embrace such methods, though, is not only to seek ghosts; it is to reject positivist methods and their mythologies of certainty, factuality, and predictability.",

Etymologically, pantheism is the view that Deity and Cosmos are identical. Theologically, it embraces divine immanence while rejecting divine transcendence. If atheism is the denial that anything is divine, pantheism is not atheism; if atheism is the claim that there is no Creator, Providence, transcendent Deity, or personal God, pantheism is atheistic. Spinoza, perhaps the paradigm figure for pantheism, was described by some as ‘a God-intoxicated man’ and by others as an atheist. On his account, only God or Nature exists, a single, necessarily existing substance whose modes and qualities exhaust reality. Conceivable equally properly as physical or as mental, God or Nature is no proper object of worship, creates nothing, grants freedom to none, hears no prayer, and does not act in history. Personal immortality, on Spinoza’s view, not only does not occur, but is logically impossible. It is one thing to value nature so highly that one calls it a divinity, another to believe in God in any monotheistic sense. This much said, it must be admitted that ‘pantheism’ is not easy to define precisely. As conceived here, pantheism need not be a variety of materialism, and if it is materialistic it includes a high view of the worth of matter. Yet ‘pantheism’ has served as a term of abuse, and as another term for ‘atheism’ and ‘materialism’ and ‘deism’, terms bearing quite different senses.",

If, as seems much more plausible, there are a number of intrinsically desirable objectives, our practical reasoning cannot go well unless we know whether there is some further objective to be attained or realised by or in the pursuit of some or all of these intrinsically desirable objectives, i.e. whether there is some further point to pursuing them; and if so, what that further point or objective (‘last end’) actually is. Some say that the true last end is some one of the intrinsically desirable human goods, say, the highest instantiation of the highest good attainable in this life, thus contemplation of God to the extent that God is knowable through His creatures.

The ideals of prophets and saints can take root only when they are attenuated, moderated and compromised with other contradictory ideals and with the demands of the situation and the needs of 'the old Adam'. Ideals and beliefs can only influence conduct alongside of personal ties, primordial attachments, and responsibilities in corporate bodies and they can come into play primarily in the form of vague notions regarding the Right and Good in concrete forms. Sociologists and anthropologists might make it appear as if every man is implicitly a philosopher and a theologian with a coherent image of the cosmos and society and a hierarchy of standards of preference. This is, however, very far from the truth. Man is much more concerned with what is near at hand, with what is present and concrete than with what is remote and abstract. He is more responsive on the whole to persons, to the status of those who surround him and the justice which he sees in his own situation than he is with the symbols of remote persons, with the total status system in the society and with the global system of jusiice. Immediately present authorities engage his mind more than remote ones. The ordinary man is however not a complete idiot in the Greek sense. In a dormant way, semi-conscious and peripheral, he too responds to the central authoriiies and symbols of the society. From time to iime, as occasion reqllires, he comes more closely into contact with them; his consciousness is opened to them at election time, in times of naiional troubles, in great ceremonial occasions like the Coronaiion, in the same way in which an 'Easter asd Christmas' communicant enters into communion with divinity on these",

He stops at nothing in order to try to satisfy his raging impulses. No action, or word, that comes from such a person should be seen as a surprise. \r\nThe Prophet (pbuh) thus said that if the son of Adam possessed two valleys of gold, he would long for a third one; “and nothing would fill (satiate) the stomach – or the mouth -- of the son of Adam but dust (that is, after he dies)” (Sahih Muslim).\r\nMan can easily become a world of paradoxes. Under the pressure of his recurring misjudgments, his inborn disposition and a myriad of external factors and forces, man can easily give in to the advances of his perennial anxieties, unfounded optimism and profligacy, relegating the transcendent power of his reason (intellect or ‘aql), as well as his primordial nature (instinct or fitrah), to the backseat. One moment he can think and act like an angel; the next he can be like a devil. \r\nThe similar thing Satan (Iblis) had in mind when he plotted to deceive Adam and his wife Eve (Hawa) and drive them out from the Garden of Eden.

      "abstract": "Emotion is at times foregrounded by psychonarration and manifested in utterances; more frequently its presence is indicated by somatic indices: by embodied responses and deliberate gestures. This chapter defines 'affect', somatic sensations that function at a preconscious level, and continues by exploring how medieval emotion is written on bodies, thus revealing interior emotional states. The cardiocentric model, in which emotion is understood as focused on the heart, is outlined; affect theory is utilised to unpack how medieval writers understood physical manifestations of emotion as central to contemporary theoretical formulations of the role of will in emotion, as both preconscious and yet bound up in complex cognitive interactive processes. Characters faint, change colour or fall silent, behaviours which register different kinds of feeling as in play. Turning pale, for example, can express fear or anger: precisely which emotion is at stake is crucial for the status of the chivalric male figure; trembling can be equally ambiguous. Certain behaviours – laughing, weeping – fall between the involuntary and deliberate: women can weep on cue, it is suggested, and laughter rarely expresses happiness, but rather triumph. Bodies can also express emotion through deliberate behaviour in the form of gesture: kissing, kneeling, leading by the hand and smiling all indicate different kinds of emotion that is both felt and publicly performed. The strategic deployment of emotive indicia could trump the 'natural' movements of the humours and the spirits within the body, an understanding that problematises the connections between affect, will and motivation.",

We need to see it as a radical transformation, of existing relations, even if this suspension is only temporary. In charity we see a person as someone who is no longer capable of reacting appropriately. Someone who is no longer capable of behaving as a „person‟ nevertheless continues to be a person. She does not lose her personal sanctity or dignity even if she has lost a practical grasp on controlling and guiding the course of her life. Today we often tend to reduce charity to a compassionate form of helping, or aid-giving, such as when materials, doctors and psychologists are sent to regions that are torn apart by war or famine. It is much easier to understand charity when it can be measured against the reduction of physical and emotional distress. It is much more difficult to understand charity in cases where aid proves to be powerless, when there is no measurable return or change that is brought about. While ethics cannot teach us what to do once compassion, benevolence and forgiveness fail to make any difference, prayer can help us to move forward. Praying for others, more specifically, the long-suffering involved in prayer, is a particularly important form of charity. It has the power to lift us above our inability to do anything helpful. We pray at the very moment when we experience our powerlessness to help.",

Here we examined whether the same emotion-core disgust-occurs when witnessing both types of violation, and we proposed a specific method for doing so. In two studies (N = 160; 240), American and Indian participants indicated their emotional reaction to (stories depicting) sacred or nonsacred violations, each either with or without pathogens. Both Americans and Indians felt \"grossed out\" (a term for core disgust) by events with pathogens (whether violations of the sacred or not). They felt disgusted and angered, but not grossed out, by violations of the sacred. For both Americans and Indians, grossed out was never the modal emotion when a sacred violation did not involve pathogens. Results were inconsistent with a focus on any single emotion: sacred violations were associated with several different negative emotions.

Furthermore, his presumptive impartiality as regards the incident does not of itself carry extensive implications about his intelligence, nor about his being aligned with benevolence towards any larger whole.

Living such a life is the ultimate end to which all well-chosen actions are a means, either instrumentally or as constituent parts of such a life. Actions which contribute to such a life are right. Those that detract from it are wrong. Unlike other animals, a human being can identify the actions that do contribute. In doing so, a person exercises an acquired ability-a virtue-which these writers called ‘ prudence’. In following the dictates of prudence, he may need other virtues as well, such as the courage to face pain and danger or the temperance to forego pleasure. The type of prudence a person exercises in seeing that an action contributes to the sort of life he should live (nous for Aristotle, intellectus for Thomas Aquinas) has been translated as ‘ understanding’ or ‘ intuition’. To call this ability ‘ prudence’ does not explain how it works. It is merely to say that somehow, we are able to see that some choices are right and others wrong. Without such an ability we would never be able to act rightly. In any event, this ability is not deductive logic. Prudent people understand things that they cannot demonstrate.",

      "title": "Teaching respect: philosophical",
      "abstract": "Teaching respect: a philosophical analysis According to a Zulu proverb a human being can only become truly human because of others. Each person can only become more human, more him self- regardless of his sex - through the co-involvement of others. It is the love for one’s neighbour and the respect one has for him/her as a person which makes one consider the other party's feelings, viewpoints and circumstances. In order to arrive at a situation of peaceful coexistence it is important to realize that human attitudes and a mature life style evolve through a process of learning and interaction with others. It is a time­ consuming and costly process which starts at infancy and continues throughout someone's life. Instruction concerning interpersonal relations and the teaching of respect cannot be confined to individual lessons or working sessions at home or in school. Discussions and conversations concerning interpersonal relations need to form an integral and natural part of a child’s life within the home environment and throughout the pupil's school career. It is senseless if educators talk about the importance of teaching respect only to reveal disrespectful behaviour themselves, or to talk about the importance of self-esteem in the paying of respect whilst causing children to feel negative about themselves. To be able to express respect to other human beings, one needs to be respected. A child needs to experience how it feels when homage is paid. The following rule of life applies in this regard: one can never give if one has never received respect.",

      "title": "Identification (With the Aggressor)",
      "abstract": "Within the broader framework of psychoanalytic conceptualizations of identification processes, Sándor Ferenczi's concept of 'identification with the aggressor' constitutes a core understanding of children's response to abuse. In response to an assault, the isolated, terrified child subordinates herself to the aggressor's will. She gives up her self, and 'becomes' what he wants her to be, both as a survival response when danger threatens, and as a tactic to ensure continued belonging to the family when rejection looms. Compensatory narcissistic fantasies may provide a feeling of specialness that numbs and replaces insecurities and despair; but in fact, along with accommodation on mental and moral levels, they facilitate compliance with the aggressor. Identification with the aggressor often continues as a persisting tendency; this tendency is often found in children and adults who have not been grossly abused, suggesting that more subtle acts like emotional abandonment and narcissistic exploitation can have long-standing traumatic effects. Its pervasiveness suggests that it may be an built-in response potential triggered by a fear of social exclusion, which may have evolved to maintain the social hierarchy and cooperation necessary to a species relying on a group survival strategy. This phenomenon may shed light on the puzzle of authoritarianism, notably, why so many people are drawn to authoritarian leaders and movements, often against their own real interests, suggesting that identification with the aggressor is the intrapsychic core of authoritarian attitudes.",

      "title": "Lo cortés no quita lo valiente: una comparación de la cortesía en Quito y Salamanca",
      "abstract": "La cortesia es uno de los pilares fundamentales de la comunicacion humana. La forma en la que preguntamos, pedimos cosas, agradecemos, saludamos, nos dirigimos a los demas, etc. denotan no solo nuestro grado de educacion, sino tambien rasgos propios de nuestra lengua y de nuestra cultura. Las lenguas, todas, sin excepcion, tienen, dentro de si recursos que se usan para agradar al otro, o para proteger la imagen del que las emite. No nos cabe duda de que el rol de la cortesia es promover una convivencia civilizada y amable con nuestros congeneres. No importa si esa cortesia es falsa o sincera, actua como una especie de valvula de seguridad en cualquier situacion.\nBrown y Levinson (1987) distinguen dos tipos de cortesia: positiva y cortesia negativa. La primera tiene que ver con la imagen positiva que el hablante tiene de si mismo y que aspira que sea respetada y aceptada por los demas. La segunda, en cambio, se refiere al deseo de cada individuo de que sus actos no se vean impedidos por otros. En esta investigacion se van a analizar 6 aspectos de la cortesia: los pedidos, las disculpas, las respuestas al cumplido, las criticas, el turno de palabra y el espacio interpersonal. Con respecto al tema de los pedidos, que es el tema central esta investigacion, las estrategias indirectas entrarian en lo que se considera cortesia negativa. Por el contrario, las directas se corresponden con la cortesia positiva.\nHaverkate (1994) senala que la interaccion social, en general, y la verbal, en especial, exigen que las imagenes positiva y negativa sean respetadas desarrollando apropiadas estrategias de cortesia. Asimismo, considera conveniente una sustitucion de terminos: solidaridad en lugar de cortesia positiva y distanciamiento en lugar de cortesia negativa. Estos nuevos terminos nos darian a entender que cuando somos directos nos ponemos en el lugar del otro, a su mismo nivel. Por otro lado, los que son indirectos se alejan de su interlocutor, esto no significaria creerse superior, o inferior, solamente limita la confianza. De acuerdo a Haverkate (1994), al menos parte de las culturas del mundo se dividirian en esas dos clases. Teniendo como base el criterio de que los representantes de unas culturas muestran preferencia por la expresion de cortesia de solidaridad, en tanto que los representantes de otras conceden valor especifico a la expresion de cortesia de distanciamiento. Eso querria decir que culturas similares usarian las mismas estrategias de cortesia. Al parecer, eso se cumpliria. No olvidemos que lengua y cultura estan fuertemente relacionadas. Pero, ?podriamos decir que los sudafricanos y los canadienses, por compartir una misma lengua, comparten cultura?, ?podemos hablar de una unica cultura anglosajona? ?Es legitimo poner a todos los usuarios del ingles en un mismo saco cultural? De igual modo, ?seria valido creer en la unicidad de la cultura hispana? Espanoles e hispanoamericanos con las mismas creencias, comportamientos, etc.\nDefinitivamente no. El uso de la cortesia en espanol no es homogeneo. Aunque la lengua, internamente, tiene los mismos recursos linguisticos, el espanol peninsular y el espanol americano se diferencian al momento de ponerlos en practica. Visto de ese modo, espanoles e hispanoamericanos deberiamos usar diferentes estrategias al momento de expresar cortesia. Aparentemente, los espanoles poseen caracteristicas de cortesia positiva, o solidaria. Son mas directos al momento de hacer pedidos, por ejemplo. Un gran numero de latinoamericanos, por el contrario, usaria cortesia negativa, somos mas distantes, o indirectos. Este trabajo tratara de desmontar, o ratificar, la idea de que los latinoamericanos usamos diferentes estrategias de cortesia que los espanoles. Eso si, es necesario dejar muy claro que al decir Espana e Hispanoamerica, en este caso, nos estamos refiriendo a un sector minusculo de Espana: Salamanca; y a un sector infimo de Hispanoamerica: Ecuador, mas concretamente, Quito. Y mucho mas especificamente, estudiantes de la USAL (Universidad de Salamanca) y de la PUCE (Pontificia Universidad Catolica del Ecuador). El sentido de esta investigacion no es de ninguna manera mostrar la cortesia/descortesia de uno de los dos grupos, se trata mas bien de encontrar lo que nos une, mas que lo que nos separa. Si bien es cierto, desde algunos sectores, sobre todo, el lado anglosajon, siempre se ha considerado la cortesia negativa como mas cortes, (valga la redundancia), desde ningun punto de vista ese es el pensamiento que guia este estudio. Basandose en algunos estudios, se ha llegado a la conclusion de que en las culturas mediterraneas: griega, espanola, italiana, etc. predomina la cortesia positiva. Por el contrario, en las culturas anglosajonas predomina la negativa, al igual que en algunos sectores latinoamericanos. Ante todo esto, vale preguntarnos ?cuan valido es hacer un estudio comparativo de cortesia verbal entre usuarios de la misma lengua? Nos parece que es muy relevante. Es necesario seguirnos descubriendo y acercando. Estudios como este nos ayudan a entendernos mejor y, sobre todo, a aceptarnos mas.\n Si bien el tratamiento del pedido abarca casi la totalidad de esta investigacion, tambien nos hemos ocupado de incluir otros aspectos de la cortesia, como son la prosemica, la respuesta al cumplido, la critica, el turno de palabra y las disculpas.\nPALABRAS CLAVE: CORTESIA, RELEVANCIA, ACTOS CONTRA LA IMAGEN, CORTESIA POSITIVA, CORTESIA NEGATIVA, PROXEMICA, CONFIANZA.",

      "abstract": "According to Karpman(10), \"The material for malingering must come from the unconscious reservoir of the individual.....It is a rather frequent observation that malingerers often press into service a minor experience for the purpose of gaining desired ends.\" It is a reasonable assumption, I believe, to state that the accidental axe cut last year determined the form and nature of this patient's self-inflicted wound. However, I do not agree with Hulett(3) who says, \"It is indeed devastating to recognize as we must that all men are not possessed of manhood and that the yellow streak down the backs of some of our fellows is invisible to the unaided human eye,\" since I believe more frequently than not that the sufferer of the self-inflicted wound is neither a moral nor a physical coward. He may not agree with what is the accepted community goal. He does show determination and stamina in attaining his personal desire. We have here a man who after a milder form of malingering had failed attempted to produce the desired end by a self-inflicted wound. It is my impression that the man with the self-inflicted wound is a malingerer of the severest type. This act was not a suicidal gesture nor was it performed to obtain sympathy or compensation, but rather merely to obtain release from what was to him an uncomfortable and intolerable environmental situation. I believe that henceforth the definition of malingering with reference to the armed forces should stress the intentional production of disease in addition to exaggeration and simulation.",

He asserts that the phenomena of mental illnesses, including suffering, signal “problems in living” or difficulties in determining the best use of one’s agential powers. The goals of the relationship are to enhance the client’s knowledge of his or her personality, to refine his intentions and sense of responsibility for his “symptoms” and other actions, and to achieve his aims and satisfy his desires, as long as he does not, by his actions, harm others. For the author of this chapter and other clinicians, the experience of phenomena exhibited by persons judged to be mentally ill are, to some extent and sense, apprehended as events that happen, rather than as actions authored by the person as agent. These untoward activities suggest a undesirable organismic condition of a person as agent, a diminution of the agent’s capacity for living a life, the signal of a organismic disorder, a problem with the human organismic equipment for living a life—not solely a problem about the best use of that equipment (as Szasz contends) but a state of ill health and a suffering person in need of treatment.",

Although previous research has found that people arrive at such beliefs intuitively instead of analytically, relatively little research has aimed to understand what experiences encourage or legitimate theistic belief systems. Using cross-cultural correlational and experimental methods, we investigated whether the experience of inspiration encourages a belief in God. Participants who dispositionally experience more inspiration, were randomly assigned to relive or have an inspirational experience, or reported such experiences to be more inspirational all showed stronger belief in God. These effects were specific to inspiration (instead of adjacent affective experiences) and a belief in God (instead of other empirically unverifiable claims). Being inspired by someone or something (but not inspired to do something) offers a spiritually transcendent experience that elevates belief in God, in part because it makes people feel connected to something beyond themselves.",

Hence, the Arabic word “insan”, which means “human being, person and man”, is derived from the verb “anisa” which means to be “affable”, “sociable” and “friendly”.\r\nMoreover, man is created as Allah’s vicegerent on earth. As such, every animate and inanimate creation has been subjected to him and his services in order to facilitate the execution of his noble terrestrial mission. Man thus naturally forms amiable and productive relationships with his surroundings. In fact, the quality of his stay on earth, as well as the implementation of his vicegerency mission, depends exclusively on the quality of the relationships in question. That also is the only valid measure of the quality -- or otherwise -- of his cultural and civilizational legacies.\r\nAs a result, man develops a variety of feelings, states and attitudes towards things and beings. They range from personal attachments to strong attractions, and from interpersonal affections to outright pleasures. Such feelings, states and attitudes can likewise morph into a virtue, signifying kindness and compassion, which, in turn, translate itself into a wide range of behavioural patterns towards fellow humans, animals and nature.\r\nAll those sentiments and moods are intrinsic to man and his primordial nature. However, consistent with his life purpose and design, man prefers and cultivates certain relationships more than others, and favours as well as fosters certain sentiments and moods over others. \r\nIt is here that true love begins.",

Evolved behavior, including that of other animals, is not entirely devoid of normativity, however. Defining normativity as adherence to an ideal or standard, there is ample evidence that animals treat their social relationships in this manner. In other words, they pursue social values. Here I review evidence that nonhuman primates actively try to preserve harmony within their social network by, e.g., reconciling after conflict, protesting against unequal divisions, and breaking up fights amongst others. In doing so, they correct deviations from an ideal state. They further show emotional self-control and anticipatory conflict resolution in order to prevent such deviations. Recognition of the goal-orientation and normative character of animal social behavior permits us to partially bridge the is/ought divide erected in relation to human moral behavior.",

Twenty young female adults (10 dancers & 10 non-dancers) are involved in this study and they are asked to draw a person on a paper and after completing the first drawing experimenter checked the gender of drawing and the participants again are asked to draw a person of opposite gender in another page. A number of personality traits were found that distinguishes a dancer from a non-dancer. It was found that dancers are extrovert, independent, restless, daydreamer, imaginative, open to experience, warm hearted. On other side non-dancers are self oriented, ambitious, aggressive, inhibited and assaultive.

      "title": "29 Imagination, Empathy, and the Quasi‐<i>De Se</i>",
      "abstract": "Extract The Reflexive Constraint Following Shoemaker, I imagined the alternative modes of 'quasi‐perception' and 'quasi‐memory', which are like perception and memory, save for the fact that the content of the state need not concern the person in the state. In quasi‐perception and quasi‐memory, it may not be the person in the experiential state, but some other person, who is R‐related to what the state represents. Like Evans, I emphasized how dissimilar quasi‐perception and quasi‐memory are from ordinary perception and ordinary memory. Their 'semantics', as I put it, is different. Perception and memory obey what we may call the Reflexive Constraint: if the state is veridical, the person undergoing it must be R‐related to what it represents. The Reflexive Constraint does not apply to quasi‐perception and quasi‐memory. Now quasi‐perception and quasi‐memory are counterfactual modes—modes of experience that do not actually exist—but we have just seen that, among the existing modes, one is similar to quasi‐perception and quasi‐memory in that it does not obey the Reflexive Constraint. That mode is the imagination. The person in whose situation the imagined state of affairs is supposed to hold need not be the imaginer himself; it may be anybody, including Napoleon, or the last man to be alive on Earth. The imaginer 'sees' the world vicariously, through the eyes of his imaginative target, just as the quasi‐rememberer vicariously 'remembers' the experiences of another person.",

      "abstract": "Individuals’ interaction with the external world is almost always influenced by their clothing, whether through personal choice, their “habitus”, dress codes, etc., through shaping how other view/interact with them, influencing their understanding of their identity, and conversely of influencing how others view them though how they dress. As a result of this, different clothing styles can evoke different connotations based on the viewers assumption of the ideals of the groups or contexts that the wearer’s clothing connects them to, such as formal office dress and LGBTQ+ fashions, whether by choice or by pressure. Also, through dress individuals can internalize these ideals of the group, to influence their view of themselves, and in turn how they interact with the outside world. Furthermore, clothing can also highlight a person’s individuality through failure to conform, evoking a different individual-world interaction. Regardless, an individual’s desire to express themselves and externalize the internal can lead to clothing construction or altering to better represent themselves, and/or their relationship to a group.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Most created things ‘do the truth’ by nature, incurring neither praise nor blame, but simply being what God created them to be and doing what God created them to do. But rational natures—angels and human beings—have a capacity that Anselm calls ‘the will’ by which they have an agency of their own: they can act in ways that are not entirely determined by the nature that God has given them. Anselm believes that, from the beginning, some rational creatures abandoned the truth, and he seeks to discover what has to be true about creatures, and about God, in order for such a fall to be possible and for the blame to fall squarely on the creatures themselves and in no way on their Creator. Anselm focuses on the fall of the angels as a philosophically ‘clean’ case (since the angels faced only a single primal choice, had the full enjoyment of their natural powers, and were in no way burdened by inherited sin and weakness). He concludes that in order for both the good and the bad angels to be truly the originator of their own actions, and therefore praiseworthy or blameworthy, God must have given them two basic kinds of motivation—a disposition to choose what would make them happy, and a disposition to choose what is right or just—along with the capacity to determine which of those motivations they would act on.",

      "abstract": "Oliver Sensen analyses what, more concretely, one must do to respect someone. In order to find a universal criterion of respect, Sensen first distinguishes different usages of “respect,” such as “not using someone as a mere means,” “gaining another’s consent,” feeling esteem for someone, or being polite. Sensen argues that—while these usages are of central importance in our everyday life—they are not the universal respect that we always owe to all others. Rather, he argues, universal respect consists in not exalting oneself above others, which itself consists in not breaking rules that we regard as objectively necessary. The discovery of these necessary rules is largely an empirical matter that involves universal human needs, cultural norms, and giving others a voice in how they are treated. If one does not make an exception to these rules, one’s behavior is respectful toward all others.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Phronesis, classically defined by Aristotle as knowledge of what is good and what is bad for humans, is best understood as practical wisdom, that is, the wisdom of action. The main difficulties in possessing phronesis and acting on it are that both human goods and ills come in degrees (so that it is hard to tell how much of the one is enough and how much of the other is too much) and that the goods frequently compete with each other (so that it is hard to determine which to pursue at the expense of the other). In the end, phronesis amounts to sound judgment and intuition in identifying the specific goods to be pursued and the ills to be combated in a given context. In the context of psychiatric practice, the goods and ills must be preeminently those for the patient, mainly the goods of mental health and the ills of mental disorder. But in addition to facing competing goods and subtly varying degrees of goods and ills, the psychiatrist also faces both nonmedical goods and ills and other persons to be taken into account—family members, translators, and consultants, sometimes embodying cultural attitudes different from those of the psychiatrist, as well as such nonpersons as their clinics or health maintenance organizations, insurance companies, and governmental agencies. A look at several cases of community psychiatric practice reveals the complexities that require seasoned phronesis for successful treatment.",

      "title": "Sammensmeltning/avstand og trekantforhold i familier med borderline ungdom",
      "abstract": "Borderline patients have a tendency to enter into relationships which seem addictive, intense, and brief. Their physical neediness causes them to “invade” their interpersonal objects in fantasy so as to become fused with them, and therefore to experience such claustrophobic anxiety as to necessitate breaking away into isolation and thereby to experience agoraphobia. In this article I have analyzed families with borderline members, vacillating between the desire for intense relationships on the one hand, and marked withdrawal and alienation, on the other. These vacillations are distinct, clear-cut and seem to be organized around a claustrophobia-agoraphobia dialectic.Borderline family members are afraid to be in an enclosed situation; they develop extreme claustrophobic anxiety or panic and recrue another family member (often a child) to avoid the catastrophe of identity diffusion. But when they are not contained they become agoraphobic and develop anxiety and panic. Thus they may experience object loss and complete annihilation. These vacillations are of such a discrete nature that they comprise, in my opinion, two nearly separately dissociated personalities - that is, split personalities - within the borderline self. Because the family members' internal resources for holding-soothing are always inadequate, the members must depend in an ongoing way upon external objects to supplement them enough to keep their muted anxiety at a signal level and to maintain relative psychological stability. The use of children is that they provide functions for another familiy member that are necessary for the maintenance of psychological integrity.",

The importance of such interaction to elderly people was spelt out by Freud just over sixty years ago (in 1926), when in Vienna he addressed a group of non-medical people who had come together to celebrate his seventieth birthday. He recalled a theme he first enunciated in his middle 60s, which he spelt out more explicitly in 1930 in his book Civilisation and its Discontents (Freud, 1973). He then wrote: We are threatened with suffering from three directions: from our own body, which is doomed to decay and dissolution and which cannot even do without pain and anxiety as warning signals; from the external world which may rage against us with overwhelming and merciless forces of destruction; and finally from our relations with other human beings. The suffering which comes from this last source is perhaps more painful to us than any other.… Against the suffering which may come upon one from human relationships the readiest safeguard is voluntary isolation, keeping oneself aloof from other people.… There is, indeed, another and better path to happiness — that of becoming a member of the human community.

Threats to the infant's psyche and/or physical survival normally mobilize ruthless aggression directed towards the object that is perceived as dangerous. The threat might be experienced as a direct assault, engulfment, smothering, or abandonment to starve. When the line of development from self-preservative aggression to the libidinalization of aggression progresses to the intensification of sadism, the psychic groundwork is laid for the use of sadism as a solution to neurotic or psychotic conflicts. When the mother's sadism fails to defend her against what she experiences as her child's persecution, she is at risk of relying upon ruthless aggression or its psychic equivalent. The child's wellbeing is then no longer relevant to the mother. The mother's only concern is negating or eliminating any aspect of the child that poses a threat to her survival.",

      "abstract": "As many have noted, what is often called the “problem” of personal identity can be understood either as a metaphysical issue or as an epistemological (and somewhat more practical) issue. Metaphysicians typically want to know what it is for one individual to be the same person as another. People undergo many changes over time, and some people resemble others quite closely The metaphysician wants to know, for example, what makes me—the chronologically challenged, mostly bald philosopher Stephen Braude—the same unique individual as the infant who appeared on the scene many years earlier, despite the considerable evolution in my appearance and in my psychology during the interim. However, epistemologists are concerned (at least sometimes) with a different problem: how to decide if an individual is the same person as someone else. For example, are these decisions rooted in judgments about physical continuity, psychological continuity, or both? In virtue of what, for example, do we identify a person as me, despite (so I'm told) my remarkable resemblance to other chronologically and follically challenged individuals? Granted, in real life this potential problem seldom stops us in our tracks. Although some have trouble distinguishing identical twins, and although we sometimes mistake a person for someone else, those problems are uncommon, and usually they are quickly resolved. In fact, that is about as difficult as it gets for everyday identifications.",

      "title": "Visual search speed is influenced by differences in shape arbitrariness",
      "abstract": "We hypothesized that the visual system is particularly tuned to those features which correlate with behaviorally relevant dimensions, and compared a few possibilities: how man-made an object is (naturalness), how often an object is eaten (edibility), how often an object is manipulated (manipulability), and the degree to which an object’s shape is arbitrary (shape arbitrariness; Prasada, 2001). For example, the shape of a hammer is more constrained by the kind of thing that it is (i.e., is less arbitrary) than the shape of a rock. Does variability in perceptual similarity among sets of small, inanimate objects correlate with behavioral ratings on any of these dimensions? We chose four sets (categories) of stimuli: manipulable artifacts (e.g., pens), non-manipulable artifacts (e.g., lamps), natural objects (e.g. pinecones), and fruits/vegetables. These categories did not differ on ratings of typicality, familiarity, internal details, and visual complexity, or in area, aspect ratio, contour variance, extent, spatial frequency, contrast, or luminance. Participants searched for a target image among distractors from the same or different category; they pressed a space bar when they found the target, and reported its location by clicking X’s that replaced the original images. For each category pairing, the difference in search speeds between same- and different-category trials was taken as an index of perceptual dissimilarity, and correlated with distances in each dimension for each subject (representational similarity analysis). Neither manipulability nor edibility explained the pattern of perceptual dissimilarity among categories (all r< .1, t< 1,p>.3). Although naturalness explained some variance (r=.16, t=2.13, p=.048), shape arbitrariness explained more (r=.40, t=4.05, p< .0001). Visual features correlated with shape arbitrariness include shape symmetry and regularity, according to ratings(r=.74, p< .001). These results suggest that, among inanimate objects, the visual system may be particularly sensitive to the perceptual features correlated with the arbitrariness of their shapes.

      "title": "Tracking objects, Tracking agents",
      "abstract": "Animals and humans have to keep track of individuals in their environment, both in perception (sensorimotor tracking) and in cognition (e.g., spatio-temporal localization and linguistic reference via memory, communication and reasoning). Items that are typical targets for tracking are things such as stationary physical objects (e.g., rocks, plants, trees, buildings, or attached artifacts), moving physical objects (e.g., animals, certain artifacts) and human beings. All such items are located in a spatial environment, persist over time, and are – or at least closely related to, in the case of conspecifics' bodies – physical objects that respect non trivial objecthood criteria such as having cohesive parts, following continuous spatio-temporal paths, or possessing causal powers and dispositions. Perceptually tracking these objects through space and over time requires possessing sensorimotor systems (e.g., the oculomotor system, the visuo-haptic system or the auditory system) that can anchor into and smoothly pursue objects' properties. Nonetheless, one may suspect that tracking intentional agents (i.e. creatures to whom it is natural to attribute intentional states such as beliefs, plans, desires, and who may even participate in shared intentionality), as opposed to physical objects without mental states (i.e. objects which are not intentional agents) exploits or requires further abilities and strategies. In particular, at least for humans, tracking conspecifics amounts to tracking intentional agents. This raises the question of how the perceptual tracking of non-intentional objects relates to the keeping track of intentional agents. Here, we propose an extension and augmentation of recent work on object-tracking to the tracking of intentional agents. Based on the examination of the elementary procedures available for pursing agency, our principal suggestions are as follows. First, identifying intentional agents is significantly dependent upon the perceptual abilities of physical-object tracking, and might therefore be explained by the ‘object-file' hypothesis (this hypothesis is explained in section 3), which we suggest to use in the study of the tracking of intentional agents (section 4). In the most elementary case, humans track intentional agents as physical objects: they track such agents by tracking their bodies (section 5). Even though this kind of tracking is insufficient for keeping track of human individuals ‘as' intentional agents (and explaining their behavior with an intentional stance), it may suffice to explain a number of interacting and situated behaviors in social contexts with intentional agents. Second, however, tracking intentional agents ‘as' intentional agents requires additional capacities for detecting and understanding intentional states and certain further properties which creatures with such states can exhibit (section 6) – e.g., (ir/)rationality, and the capacity to participate in shared intentionality. We note, however, that tracking a human individual as an intentional agent may require an appeal to specific perceptual cues and may even recruit basic sensorimotor skills – such as the detection of biological motions – whose tracking might be independent of the understanding of conspecifics' mental states. For reasons of parsimony and computational economy, unless we have reason to think that there is a separate system devoted to tracking intentional agents, we should suppose that the same mechanism used to track physical objects is recruited for tracking intentional agents.",

      "abstract": "Imagine entering a room for the very first time (Fig. 26.1) and then being asked to look around and to see what is in it. The first glance already tells you what kind of room it is (in our case it clearly is a scene set in a museum); immediately afterwards you begin to notice objects in the room (the prominent statue in the foreground, several other statues on pedestals, paintings on the walls, etc.). Your attention might be drawn more towards certain objects first and then wander around taking in the remaining objects. Very rarely will your visual system need to pause and take more time to investigate what a particular object is – even more rarely will it not be able to interpret it at all (perhaps the four-horned statue in the back of the room will be confusing at first, but it still can be interpreted as a type of four-legged, hoofed animal). The remarkable ability of the (human) visual system to quickly and robustly assign labels to objects (and events) is called categorization.",

      "abstract": "Interpersonal relationships need to be developed and improved by the diversity as creative potential. To make it possible it is needed one to have a true attitude of esteem toward every single man as well as toward all kinds of collectivism. Origin and religious affiliation in the fullness of freedom gifted by God stop being factors of division but they take major role to identify both individuals and collectivisms where-by the knowledge of others makes a creative progression due to the absence of selfishness. The knowledge is not based on a conflict, vengefulness and malicious joy but is directed to a creative dialog. A long way it takes to accept something that is different and some different persons as well. Peaceful and dynamic coexistence requires the appreciation of others as well as the same route for all of us. One remains to be selfish as long as he accepts a dispassionate massification without letting go of great passion in him. Upon we open ourselves up to others we become ready to grow in a creative way. Then we are able to recognize all diversities which approve us equality to diversity. And, because all of us aim toward the same and none of us endanger identity of other. Thus all of our diversities get a creative function and become important facts of harmonized mosaic of life; they are not obstacles we stumble over. But it is needed one to make efforts continuously by doing good deeds where modernizes all the good from the past in the present time. All which is unclear and make a burden need to be removed if it is regarded as an obstacle on a mutual way. One who acts according to all the above - a creative imperative overcomes all differences by accepting as well as understanding others without giving up of self and his personal identity as well.",

      "abstract": "In the ancient Hindu philosophy known as Vedanta, the mind -understood as an accumulation of memories, desires, emotions, thoughts, etc., including the self, that is, the 'I'-thought present in every conscious experience -is said to be a sense like any other physical sense: see, hear, touch, taste, or smell.The implication is that mind is also instrumental in creating our conscious experiences but it is not awareness itself.One may ask: if mind is also a sense, then similarly to a sensory experience which need not involve all the five physical senses, do we ever have a conscious experience with no 'I' in it?Indeed, Vedanta elaborately describes such a state of consciousness called Samadhi, which lies beyond waking, dreaming, or deep sleep.Vedanta also affirms the existence of a state in which one's self does not see itself as belonging to only one's own body/brain and mind but one sees nobody and nothing in the universe as different from oneself; in other words, this awareness (called Universal Self) identifies itself with everything in the universe, whether living or lifeless.Vedanta claims that in our ordinary lives, in those moments when we express love and sympathy towards others, we are indeed in that state of infinite oneness whether we know it or not, and that the expression of love is a manifestation of nothing but the Universal Self.We will attempt in this article, to examine the rationale for this claim using the notion of an ever-widening circle of identification.We will describe a simple analogy used by Vedanta in its analysis of consciousness, mind, and body relations, to explain how the individual self associated with one's body and mind arises from the Universal Self.We will also summarize Vedanta's theory of mind-body interactions and suggest that it offers solution to the 'hard problem' of today's consciousness researches in a way compatible with modern science.",

      "title": "Sublime",
      "abstract": "The sublime as an aesthetic category has an extraordinarily discontinuous history in Western criticism and theory, though the phenomena it points to in art and nature are without historical limit, or virtually so. The sublime as a concept and phenomenon is harder to define than many aesthetic concepts, partly because of its content and partly because of the absence of a definition in the first great surviving text on the subject, Longinus’s <italic>On the Sublime</italic>. The sublime is inflected differently in the major theorists: in Longinus it produces ecstasy or transport in the reader or listener; in Burke its main ingredient is terror (but supplemented by infinity and obscurity); and in Kant’s bifurcated system of the mathematical and dynamic sublime, the former entails a cognitive overload, a breakdown of the imagination, and the ability to represent, whereas in the latter, the subject, after first being threatened, virtually, by powerful nature outside her or him, turns inward to discover a power of reason able to think beyond the realm of the senses. Many theorists testify to the effect of transcendence or exaltation of the self on the far side of a disturbing, disorienting experience that at least momentarily suspends or even annihilates the self. A great deal in the theoretical-critical texts turns on the force of singularly impressive examples, which may or may not exceed the designs of the theoretical axioms they are meant to exemplify. Examples of sublimity are by no means limited to nature and art but spill over into numerous domains of cultural and social life. The singular force of the individual examples, it is argued, nonetheless tends to work out similarly in certain genres conducive to the sublime (epic, tragedy) but somewhat differently from one genre to another. The heyday of the theory and critical engagement with the sublime lasts, in Western Europe and a little beyond, from the late 17th century to the early 19th century. But it does not simply go away, with sublime aesthetic production and critical reflection on the sublime present in the likes of Baudelaire, Nietzsche, and—to Adorno’s mind—in the art of modernism generally, in its critical swerve from the canons of what had counted as beauty. The sublime flourished as a topic in theory of criticism of the poststructuralist era, in figures such as Lyotard and Paul de Man but also in Fredric Jameson’s analysis of the cultural logic of late capitalism. The then current drive to critique the principle and some protocols of representation found an almost tailor-made topic in Enlightenment and Romantic theory of the sublime where, within philosophy, representation had been rendered problematic in robust fashion.",

These seem to me to be integral features of any meaningful human life. They are aspects of what it is to be human. Some theists would simply agree with that statement. Others, however, would say that though essentially human they are also essentially religious, and that the secular humanist's participation in such experiences is in some way defective. That is the claim which I want to consider and contest.",

In so doing, they discover that individual works of art created by a single artist (or group of collaborating artists) stand in various relations to other works produced by the same person (or persons). Some of these relations are intended by the artist, others are not, and this difference makes a difference to our appreciation of the artist’s achievement.

      "abstract": "Confucius said, ”The gentleman aims at harmony, and not at uniformity. The mean man aims at uniformity, and not at harmony.” It points out that the gentleman and the mean man have different attitudes when they deal with people. This is an example of how harmony refers to the relationships between people. Yet, the domain of harmony is not so narrow. Human beings are compound substances of the body and the soul, unlike God, angels, material objects, minerals, plants or animals; they are special beings with reason, wills, feelings and complete with nature and super-nature. Instead of embracing self-isolation and seeking self-interest, they have to open themselves to the ”other.” Self-isolation and self-interest seeking would lead to egoism (privatism), egocentricism and individualism individually and anthropocentrism collectively, both of which tend to fall into insular individualism, ethnicism and categorism. Whoever that ”differs from oneself” is the ”other”; therefore, opening oneself to the ”other” consists of being open to others (of the same category of human beings), being open to the world (including things and nature), being open to the transcendental (Heaven or God). One has to be open to the other for his or her self to be whole and rounded whereby to be a ”holistic person”, which is exactly the pluralistic and comprehensive meaning of ”harmony.”",

The English word “morality”—in the limited sense of pertaining to behavior as good (right, correct, worthy, virtuous) versus bad (wrong, incorrect, unworthy, vicious)—expresses a universal concept or distinction shared perhaps by all languages, whether modern or ancient. Long before the earliest written use of concepts like “morality” and “humanity” in religious and administrative contexts, oral cultures stretching far back into prehistory distinguished between good and bad action. For many dozens of millennia, groups of Homo sapiens understood themselves as connected to but also differing from other types of beings: other groups of people, ancestors, spirits and divinities, animals and plants, mountains and bodies of water, etc. Morality—doing things well or badly, correctly or incorrectly, generously or selfishly, appropriately or inappropriately—was perceived anthropomorphically, as extending to many types of entities (e.g., a tale about an animal or divinity acting badly).",

This ideal is derived, in part, from the Jataka Tales, where the activities of the Buddha prior to his ultimate enlightenment are described. According to the Mahayana tradition, the Bodhisattva forgoes his own final enlightenment or realization of Nibbana until he has helped all other beings escape samsara. In this respect, the Bodhisattva is considered superior to the Arahant who pursues his own individual enlightenment.Mahasiddha: Sanskrit term meaning “Great Master” or “Fully Perfected One,” it refers to the ideal of Buddhist practice in the Vajrayana tradition, to one who has mastered the Tantras.Mahayana: Sanskrit word meaning “the greater way” or “greater vehicle,” followers of this version of Buddhism used this term to distinguish themselves from their earlier predecessors, the Hinayana or “lesser way” or “lesser vehicle,” most notably, the Theravada. It is now generally thought that this form of Buddhism developed within some Buddhist communities between 100 bce and 200 ce. Its teachings, which are located in its own Perfection of Wisdom (Prajnaparamita) literature, represent a major revision and reinterpretation of many fundamental ideas, concepts, and practices of “early” Buddhism. Among its most basic teachings are: emphasis on wisdom or insight (prajna) and compassion (karuna), espousal of the Bodhisattva ideal, and development of the idea of emptiness (sunyata) as a way of expressing the truth that things do not have fixed or inherent natures or essences.

Thus the need for the fundamental questions eachperson must ask himself: where is it all heading? What is the aim of all this? However, in order to find the answer to these questions, it is necessary to first ask: where has it come from? And, ultimately, the question about a human being must also be asked: where has “such” a contemporary man come from? On the one hand, a human being is rational, possesses unquestionable and unique personality and dignity, is immersedin technology and computerization (including artificial intelligence), is capable of conquering the universe and treating diseases a while ago considered incurable, is affluent, possesses a lot, and lives for much longer than ever before. On the other hand, he locks himself up in his world and his ‘ego’, relativizes morality, psyche and relations, is addicted to impersonal matter, helpless in the face of hunger and suffering, limits thepursuit of truth to empirical facts and the verification of reason, which seems to eliminate the whole sphere of spirituality...",

There is nothing beyond it, ou side of it, or ove aga nst it that is needed to explain its origin, continuing existence, or irrepressible creativity. Nature itself, without a God, Goddess, gods, or animating personal spirits of any kind, is for me an appropriate and, indeed, the most appropriate focus of religious commitment and concern?especially for our ecologically conscious times. Thus, I am neither a monotheist, a polytheist, a pantheist, a panentheist, nor an animisi, and yet I claim profound religious value and meaning for the immanent, self-contained powers of nature?admittedly impersonal though they be?that produce, suffuse, and sustain us and all other forms of being. In another work I responded to a number of objections to a religion of nature so conceived, e.g., that nature is unworthy of religious commitment because it is wasteful, cruel, or indifferent to human beings; that nature is impersonal and so cannot be a fit object of worship or provide the personal nurture, guidance, and help in time of need that are necessary for meaningful religious lives; or that nature cannot be metaphysically or religiously ultimate because its existence can only be explained on the basis of something supernatural, something more fundamental than nature itself from which it derives its character and continuing existence.1 A further objection that might well be leveled against a religion of nature is the one I want to discuss in this essay. It is the complaint that a religion of nature is so radically, thoroughly immanental and mundane as to lack reference to dimensions of transcendence that are essential to robust religious faith and that play central roles in the religions of the world.",

      "abstract": "According to the Oxford En glish Dictionary, to educate means, in its earliest sense, \"to bring up (a child) so as to form his or her manners, behaviour, social and moral practices.\"Only later does it signify \"to teach (a child) a programme of vari ous academic and non-academic subjects, typically at a school; to provide with a formal education.Also: to provide (an adult) with instruction, esp. in a chosen subject or subjects at a college, university, or other institution of higher education.\" 1 By twice referring to it within parentheses, these definitions remind us that the child is the exemplary object of education, lending even adults engaged in \"formal\" or \"higher\" education an implicit association with something that is not-or not yet fully-formed.Such formation (formation in French names a program of educational training or development) seeks to \"elevate\" the child, to bring it up, to raise it from animal existence to human subjectivity by bringing it into conformity with the logic of a given world.Jacques Lacan describes this pro cess as \"l'apprentissage humain, \" thus identifying it both as human learning and as learning to be a human. 2 Education reproduces, it passes on, the world of human sense by turning those lacking speech-infansinto subjects of the law.It inculcates not only concepts and values but also the language by which sensory impressions-other wise fleeting, discontinuous, chaotic-congeal into a universe of entities that are formalized through names.Building on the work of Claude Lévi-Strauss, who focused on the basic or elementary structures affecting human relations, Lacan asserts from early on the key to a recognizable human order: \"that the symbolic function intervenes at every moment",

      "abstract": "Oneness, Aspects, and the Neo-ConfuciansConfucius gave counsel that is notoriously hard to follow: \"What you do not wish for yourself, do not impose on others\" (Huang 1997: 15.24). 1 People tend to be concerned with themselves and to be indifferent to most others.We are distinct from others so our self-concern does not include them, or so it seems.Were we to realize this distinctness is merely apparent--that our true self includes others--Confucius's counsel would be easier to follow.Concern for our true self would extend concern beyond the narrow selves we appear to be. 2 The neo-Confucians held just such a view.They espoused an identity with the universe and everything in it, arguing that this identity explains a natural concern for everyone and everything, not just for our narrow selves.I will summarize their universal identity view as an example of the kind of oneness I am concerned with.The theme of the identity of the self with everything else is common among some adherents of many other religious traditions: Daoist, Hindu, Buddhist, Muslim, Jewish, and Christian. 3A claim so widespread must be taken seriously, yet there is an obvious objection.1 According to Karen Armstrong, \"Confucius was the first to promulgate the Golden Rule.\"Further, \"The Axial sages put the abandonment of selfishness and the spirituality of compassion at the top of their agenda.For them, religion was the Golden Rule\" (2006: 208, 392). 2 For a related approach to the same sort of issue see Baxter 2005.",

The author substantiates the idea that the orientation of Sufism to spiritual ecstasy, which arises from the contemplation of Absolute beauty, significantly facilitates a person’s access to the good and justice. In the Jewish philosophy of the Middle Ages, in particular, in Maimonides, reason and faith only on the surface give the impression of mutually exclusive. The author substantiates the idea that Jewish medieval philosophy is not carried out in isolation from the cultural traditions of Sufism and Western thought. Thus, in Maimonides, in the worldly, earthly existence, there is something higher than the necessary existence. The beauty of human relationships cannot be outside the realm of understanding the Absolute. After all, otherwise man would lose all inspiration, and man would be endowed with only passive intelligence and would reduce the distance between himself and absolute intelligence.",

      "abstract": "&#x0D; “We spin a web of dreams in our mind;&#x0D; the silken rainbow threads make us blind;&#x0D; and so we travel on, but we never find;&#x0D; the things in life we left behind1”&#x0D; &#x0D; The act of naming establishes a power relationship between “namer” and “named”. In the patriarchal tradition, for instance, man’s dominion over the rest of nature was symbolized by the privilege of naming “all the cattle and the fowl of the heavens and all the beasts of the field.”2 We bestow names not only on our children, but on our pets, properties and subordinates. The terms “Nabinyagan” or “Nabansagan” refer to the informal process of such social assignations. The “namer” assumes dominance in the relationship over the “named.” The process is not reciprocal (at least not overtly). In Filipino culture, as in other vertically-oriented societies, subordinates/youth do not address superiors/elders solely by name, but by appending a title denoting the relationship between both parties (Lolo/Lola Tatay/Nanay, Tiyo/Tiya, Kuya/Ate, Diko/Ditse, Sanko/Sanse, Sir/Ma’am) Such practices are less evident in more horizontally oriented socio-cultural contexts such as North America, where grandparents and parents-in-law may be addressed by their first name alone.&#x0D; &#x0D; The act of naming may also define3 (de, “completely” + finire, “to limit, set bounds, end”) reality for the bestower. Whether such nomenclature pertains to stars and planets, taxonomies of flora and fauna, the pharmacopoeia or computer language, recognition and use of a name allow one to understand it and to know some of its secrets. Like a magic key, using a name unlocks a relationship between the user and the person, animal or object named. Agreement on and shared use of such “rhetoric” by other observers constitutes “objectification” of what would hitherto be “subjective” reality, but may also promote “shared delusion” as was the case with the proverbial “Emperor’s New Clothes.”4 In such a situation, courage can hardly begin to describe the one who dares speak out, as he or she promptly becomes fair game for those who would prefer the delusions of darkness to the harsh realities of light. And prophets and bearers of bad news are notoriously unwelcome in their own country.&#x0D; &#x0D; As is the case with any organization, professional associations are made up of individuals and aggrupations bound by shared interests as much as (or more than) by shared friendships. These shared interests find expression in shared terminologies, while concealing self-serving agendas. What happens when rhetoric does not match reality?&#x0D; &#x0D; To call a spade a spade may be considered “impolite” and “undiplomatic,” yet coming “out of the mouths of babes” is refreshingly, disarmingly direct. Such requires the childlike ability to say things as they are, without rancor or hidden agenda. How often do we encounter empty words and phrases, devoid of meaning because the realities they supposedly point to do not really exist? How often do we ourselves silently conspire, by omission if not commission, to uphold such vacuous rhetoric? And in so doing, how much of our power do we invest in and ascribe to that which does not really exist? Does the fact that there are many of us sharing the same delusions make us less deluded? Were we more transparent in our dealings, would reality be more apparent?&#x0D; _________________________________&#x0D; &#x0D; This issue pays tribute to three colleagues who passed away this year, and coinciding with the 12th Asian Research Research Symposium in Rhinology, features a meta-analysis on intranasal corticosteroids for the medical management of nasal polyps in adults, a case report of intravascular lymphoma of the inferior turbinate, a grand rounds discussion of rhinophyma, a histopathologic case of sinonasal teratoid carcinosarcoma and practice pearls on nasal saline lavage.

On his view, the right arises from one's 'basic' or 'natural' capacity for higher mental functions: since human organisms have this capacity essentially, they have a right to life essentially. Lee criticises an alternative view, on which the right to life arises from one's 'developed' capacity for higher mental functions (or development of some other accidental property). I argue that his criticisms of this alternative view are misguided or self-defeating, and that there are good reasons to hold we have a right to life accidentally rather than essentially.",

There are a limited number of these situations and an extraordinary number of dancers in training. It is not always difference in ideology or the compulsive need to explore a single vision that produces a new modern dance choreographer. It is simply expedient to create a personal marketplace in which to exhibit one's wares. The leniency with which modern dance has come to treat the eccentricities of body structure and performance as opposed to continued restrictions in ballets, allows for great variety in style and stature. But the small company, with its specific vision, often does not. So, choreography, for some of us, is self-defense. When I began performing publicly in other peoples’ work, I had a fairly goodlooking body, (though not a very flexible one), good height, good balance, and no training.",

Furthermore, remaining faithful to the programmatic declaration of never wanting to stray from the authority of Christ (Acad. 3, 20, 43), he specifies the ontological status of the soul by affirming that it is, in itself, mutable and therefore not of a divine nature, as Varro had argued. Nor is it a substance foreign to the body, as the Platonists claimed, because the soul has an appetitus ad corpus and, if it questions itself, it easily discovers that it desires nothing else «except to do something, to know with intelligence or with the senses, or only to live, as far as this is in its power» (nisi agendi aliquid, aut sciendi, aut sentiendi, aut tantummodo vivendi in quantum sua illi potestas est).",

      "abstract": "Identification means determination of individuality of a person, or, in the case of the dead, “individualization by attribution of birth name or other appropriate name to human remains”. Trying to establish the identity of unknown dead bodies always pose a challenge to the police, and taxes the resources of the most experienced forensic experts. The usual reasons of non-identification of the dead body are: no proper history available, body often highly decomposed, face crushed or destroyed, mutilation/dismemberment of body parts either by animals or vultures when disposed in isolated lonely places or when the bodies are recovered in skeletonized form, etc. Mass disasters like Earthquakes, railway accidents, tsunami's, bomb explosions, air-crash, etc. are other common instances where the problem of identification arises. Another important reason for non-identification of the dead body is the lack of interest by the police to properly work out the case. This paper aims at understanding the principles of cadaver identification and the problems faced by the relatives, police and the autopsy surgeon in establishing the identity of the dead, particularly, the unknown/unidentified bodies.",

      "title": "Buddhism, Intuition, and Virtue",
      "abstract": "Buddhism, Intuition, and Virtue Robert Feleppa 1. Introduction Buddha's Four Noble Truths seem to embody a practical morality that values beneficial consequences and the minimization of suffering. However, there is a tension between the aim of this practical morality and Buddhism's highest good of nirvāna: although the Noble Truths aim at the reduction of suffering, they also seem to identify the pursuit of happiness and the avoidance of suffering as among the roots of delusion and attachment to self. Moreover, this practical morality seems to depend in large part on conceptual understanding of the causes of suffering and delusion, as expressed, for example, in Buddha's articulations of the Noble Truths and the Perfections. Yet conceptual modes of thought are also linked in deep ways to attachment to self. Gowans (2015) summarizes the key points as follows: A person on the path to enlightenment, but far short of enlightenment, may well succumb to something akin to akrasia: recognizing that something is wrong, but still doing it on account of lust, anger or other hindrances. Moreover, on common Buddhist models of the path to enlightenment, there is no suggestion that philosophical understanding of a sound argument for no-self or emptiness, or for universal compassion, would by itself make a person compassionate. The intellectualism sometimes associated with the Socratic claim, that a purely rational understanding of what is good would [End Page 121] be sufficient for actually being good, has no counterpart in these Buddhist perspectives. (186) These troubles about the relationship of reason and attachment obscure Buddhism's philosophical as well as its ethical import. Indeed, one might argue that Buddha's concern is with liberation and not morality at all—an amoralism often attributed to figures in the Chan and Zen Buddhist traditions—and typically seen as reflecting Daoist influences on the development of Chinese Buddhism. Daoism's emphatic assaults on conceptual/symbolic reasoning raise some serious questions about how a practice aimed at liberating us from self and reason can assist in the living of a reasoned moral life. However, I think that we can address these concerns by drawing on recent research on the psychology and neuroscience of the emotions and particularly what this research tells us about the relationships between emotion and reason.1 First I will develop two preliminary points: (1) that initial tensions between Buddhism's apparent consequentialism and its central focus on nirvana can be addressed; and (2) its apparent antipathy to conceptualized principles of morality can be partly addressed by considering its primary concern with the cultivation of virtue and not the articulation of codes of conduct. However, this only sets the stage for inquiry into the deeper connections between ethical transformation and selflessness, especially as articulated in the thoughts of the influential Third Patriarch of Chan Buddhism, Jiangzhi Sengcan (496?–606 CE), and particularly as expressed in certain passages of a work attributed to him, the Xinxinming (The Verses of the Heart-Mind). Although these can be interpreted as defending an amoralistic, possibly iconoclastic reading of Buddhism, I will support a reading with a quite different thrust. I argue that Sengcan offers a subtle understanding of the place of traditional religious practices such as meditation (zazen), sūtra study, and adherence to codes of proper conduct, essential for the cultivation of insight and moral character, while at the same time being mindful of two dangers: (1) that traditional practices alone may well reinforce afflictive tendencies if they serve only as means of escape from uncertainty and suffering—a defining feature of Chan—and (2) a related failure to appreciate the subtler and spiritually powerful attachments to beliefs, manifest in the ways we hold or favor or identify with beliefs. The two tendencies are interrelated: by suppressing thought and feeling, one prevents the inward reflection needed to reveal deeply seated emotional leanings. Jeff Shore (2016) remarks: If zazen is thoroughgoing, one's mind is not caught or hindered by anything. But if zazen is not yet settled, one may enter the concentrated [End Page 122] oneness of Samadhi—then get stuck there and dwell in it, using it as an escape. It becomes itself a hindrance. The clarity...",

Charisma and play are contrasted with the routine and reject it. Separateness and segregation are inherent in charisma and play; yet both become routinized, stylized, institutionalized. The elaborate and complex nature of these concepts is illustrated by exam ining a study of wilderness-camping in which qualities of experience are expressed that can be derived from the ele ments of charisma and play. These qualities are more readily experienced by persons who are trained to experience them; most leisure-activities are not felt to be so moving or touching, and outdoor recreation as well as the rest of the activities which occupy us during our free time are not usually endowed with transcendent qualities.",

Through the study of its most important promoters, from Guichardin to Leibniz, and assuming that its introduction provides a solution that enables them to work out new problems they have to face, this work shows that the notion of interest is not a psychological motivation that would lead to the representation of a selfish man nor to the mere introduction of the utilitarian paradigm. The analysis of its uses (whether it's used to solve economic, moral or political problems), of its objects and subjects, of its qualities (either descriptive or normative, either particular or general) and of its ambivalent effects (utility, prejudice), enables to show that its stake is wider, in so far as the modelling of the reality is concerned. Interest works as a principle of action, as a corrective variable. It allows to get the phenomenons under control, to get a phenomenal representation of the relationships between the man and his world around. Its extension leads to an upgrading of tangible world, that gives the representation of value a new start, and appraises them throughout concurrence. Therefore, it takes part in the construction of modernity.",

      "title": "Personal identity",
      "abstract": "What is it to be the same person today as one was in the past, or will be in the future? How are we to describe cases in which (as we might put it) one person becomes two? What, if anything, do the answers to such questions show about the rationality of the importance we attach to personal identity? Is identity really the justifier of the special concern which we have for ourselves in the future? These are the concerns of this entry. In order to answer the question about the persistence-conditions of persons we must indulge in some thought experiments. Only thus can we tease apart the strands that compose our concept of personal identity, and thereby come to appreciate the relative importance of each strand. There are plausible arguments against attempts to see the relation of personal identity as constitutively determined by the physical relations of same body, or same brain. I can survive with a new body, and a new brain. But it does not follow; nor is it true, that a person’s identity over time can be analysed exclusively in terms of psychological relations (relations of memory, belief, character, and so on). To the contrary, the most plausible view appears to be a mixed view, according to which personal identity has to be understood in terms of both physical and psychological relations. This is the view which can be extracted from our core (that is, minimally controversial) set of common-sense beliefs about personal identity. The possibility of the fission of persons– the possibility that, for example, a person’s brain hemispheres might be divided and transplanted into two new bodies – shows that the mixed view has to incorporate a non-branching or uniqueness clause in its analysis. The concept of personal identity, contrary to what we might first be inclined to believe, is an extrinsic concept (that is, whether a given person exists can depend upon the existence of another, causally unrelated, person). Some philosophers have recently tried to forge an important connection between theories of personal identity and value theory (ethics and rationality). The possibility of such a connection had not previously been investigated in any detail. It has been argued that, on the correct theory of personal identity, it is not identity that matters but the preservation of psychological relations such as memory and character. These relations can hold between one earlier person and two or more later persons. They can also hold to varying degrees (for example, I can acquire a more or less different character over a period of years). This view of what matters has implications for certain theories of punishment. A now reformed criminal may deserve less or no punishment for the crimes of their earlier criminal self. Discussions of personal identity have also provided a new perspective on the debate between utilitarianism and its critics.",

      "title": "Brand ﬂ ings: when great brand relationships are not made to last",
      "abstract": "It may be a Hollywood cliché, but it is nonetheless true – relationships are complicated. Because of this complexity, relationships are generally not unidimensional constructs. What is more, relationships have many moving parts, and it is the way these parts fit together which often defines the relationship type. For example, if when a person arrives you feel happy and when they leave you feel sad, this relationship is typical of friendship. But if when a person arrives you feel sad and when he or she leaves you feel happy, that relationship is more typical of an enemy. Both relationships contain the same parts: someone comes, someone goes, you feel happy, or you feel sad. But these parts fit together differently in each case, and hence the relationships they typify are also quite different. I argue here that relationship types (e.g. friendship, love, enmity) are fairly complex systems whose parts typically include behaviors, emotions, thoughts, social norms, etc. Furthermore, the relationship type is defined not just by what its components are, but by the ways these components interact with each other. I suspect that for many readers, nothing said so far has been terribly controversial. Yet it has been my experience that if one tries to apply this thinking in one's research, it raises construct validity issues which have not been well explored the past literature. And these unresolved construct validity issues make it difficult to publish research in its most useful and insightful forms. My goal, then, is to begin addressing these issues in the hope that doing so will allow consumer–brand relationship researchers to publish the most theoretically appropriate models for their constructs.",

In fact, among the many thousands of homosexual men and women I have learned to know, I have never heard one seriously say that he held another responsible for his homosexual proclivities (it may then have been his progenitors).",

In the design and organization of physical settings, the human properties of the individual are ignored, oversimplified, or implicitly assumed, because of the influence of such socioenvironmental values as scientific‐technological progress, urbanism, pseudoprogress (novelty and change), and the value placed on an ever increasing acceleration of technological change. Spaces and places are improperly designed not only in physical terms; designs overlook human needs for privacy, territoriality, freedom of choice, etc., and the conceiving of the individual as a simple “machine man.” Unintended consequences are often ignored and no attempt is made to evaluate just how well the setting actually works. The danger is that the person will adjust and at the price of a continuing erosion of the properties that make him distinctively human. It is imperative that as behavioral scientists turn to the systematic study of man/environment problems they recognize the need to maintain the contextual reality and integrity of any such problem as it evolves, develops, and becomes modified in the time framework of a complex society.",

      "title": "Diverse sensory cues for individual recognition",
      "abstract": "To be social, the ability to recognize and discriminate conspecific individuals is indispensable in social animals, including primates, rodents, birds, fish, and social insects which live in societies or groups. Recent studies using molecular biology, genetics, in vivo and in vitro physiology, and behavioral neuroscientific approaches have provided detailed insights into how animals process and recognize the information of individuals. Here, we review the most distinct sensory modalities for individual recognition in animals, namely, olfaction and vision. In the case of rodents, two polymorphic gene complexes have been identified in their urine as the key and essential pheromonal components for individual recognition: the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) and the major urinary protein (MUP). Animals flexibly utilize MHC and/or MUP, which are detected by the main olfactory epithelium (MOE) and/or the vomeronasal organ (VNO) for various types of social recognition, such as strain recognition, kin recognition, and individual recognition. In contrast, primates, including humans, primarily use facial appearance to identify others. Face recognition in humans and other animals is naturally unique from genetic, cognitive, developmental, and functional points of view. Importantly note that nurture effects during growth phase such as social experience and environment can also shape and tune this special cognitive ability, in order to distinguish subtle differences between individuals. In this review, we address such unique nature and nurture mechanisms for individual recognition.",

      "title": "A CLINICAL STUDY OF GILLES DE LA TOURETTE'S DISEASE (MALADIE DES TICS) IN CHILDREN",
      "abstract": "In his search of the literature for cases of a similar nature, Gilles de la Tourette was much impressed by reports of analogous syndromes in other cultures: \"latah,\" \"myriachit\" and \"jumping\"(13). \"The term latah conveys to the Malays a curious behavioral quirk, or aberration, normal, and yet not quite so.\"(14). The latah reaction consists of a severe startle reaction, imitative behavior, automatic obedience, and coprolalia. The victim is compelled \"against his will\"(15) to imitate the speech and behavior of others and to obey their commands, even though his tormentors clearly intend to degrade and ridicule him. He may even injure himself in the compulsion to mimic a self-destructive gesture only partially demonstrated by the person who \"teases\" him. For example, if the tormentor makes a sudden movement as if to place his hand in a fire, the latah victim may burn his own hand(16). \"Myriachit\" is the transliteration of a Russian word for an identical syndrome, one of a group classified as \"arctic hysteria\"(14, 16). The \"Jumpers\" of Maine, also known as \"Shakers\" or \"Barkers,\" were members of a deviant Methodist sect who practiced celibacy and communal living after their migration to New England(14). Church ceremonials reached a climax of religious ecstasy at which the members of the congregation would jump, shake, roll on the floor, or crawl about on all fours, all the while barking and emitting incoherent sounds (speaking in tongues). Those who participated in these ceremonials became prey to this behavior outside the church services. Members of this sect, examined by Beard in 1880(17), exhibited violent jumping and twisting movements when startled, echolalia, and echokinesis. Beard stated: \"All the Jumpers agree that it tires them to be jumped and they dread it, but they were constantly annoyed by their companions.\" It has been traditional in much of the medical literature to treat maladie des tics as though it were identical with latah and its cognate disorders. This is almost certainly incorrect. Tics, the earliest and often the most striking manifestations of Gilles de la Tourette's disease, are unknown in latah, whereas the imitation phenomena, which are the core of latah reactions, are often totally lacking in maladie des tics. The coprolalia in latah always follows provocation and is never perseverative. Latah reactions (with the significant exception of \"jumping\") are far more common in females, maladie des tics in males. Latah is never seen earlier than late adolescence. Sudden fright is consistently cited as its precipitating cause; startle reactions are prominent. When Aberle brought 3 persons familiar with latah reactions to see case #1 of this paper, they were unanimous in concluding that maladie des tics was clearly not the same as latah(16). Yap has suggested that latah reactions are a variant of traumatic or fear neurosis to be found in cultures with limited control over the physical environment(14). The etiology of Gilles de la Tourette's disease(2, 18-20) remains as obscure as it was in his time, though we may dismiss the notion of degeneracy, the catchall so fashionable in his day(1). Tics may be found in post-encephalitic conditions(21). They may accompany chorea, which may or may not be rheumatic in origin(22). They may be the symbolic crystallization of psychologic disturbances(23). Even when psychogenically induced, they may prove extremely refractory to psychotherapy(24, 25). Contrariwise, the organically grounded tic may be diminished, if not obliterated, by reduction in emotional tension. Consequently, arguments that reason from clinical phenomenology to hypotheses of origin must inevitably be inconclusive. The clinical manifestations of maladie des tics are responsive to the social environment, as our cases demonstrate; yet this in no sense constitutes proof of psychogenesis. An organic substratum may be nonetheless subject to modification or control by psychologic influences, since mental phenomena are brain events with electrical fields(26). In this connection, it is instructive to recall Efron's demonstration, in a patient with uncinate fits, that the mere recollection of odors and a conditioned visual image sufficed to inhibit the fits(27). In our experience, pharmacologic therapy, including sedatives, muscle relaxants, and tranquilizers, has been ineffective. At this stage of our knowledge, it would appear justified to continue efforts at psychotherapeutic management, despite Heuscher's admonition that the tic phenomena are defenses against an impending psychosis(20), and Mahler and Luke's warning that the release of aggressive and erotic material may \"weaken the controlling powers of the child ticquer\"(10). Very few of the cases reported in the literature have had a thorough trial of intensive psychologic treatment, still fewer in the early course of their disorder. At the least, psychotherapy may be of assistance to child and family in dealing with the social consequences of the illness. More hopefully, it may succeed in modifying the intrapsychic tensions that aggravate, if they do not cause, the symptoms. Several of our patients gave evidence of symptomatic improvement associated with psychologic treatment. The one patient with an apparently total recovery had the benefit of capably administered psychotherapy at two important junctures in his life. He had parents who, after psychiatric guidance, devoted their total efforts to his recovery. They were inclined to ascribe great value to home management with its concomitant descrease in social stimulation to the patient. It is not possible to say whether these factors or still other influences were instrumental in his recovery. Nonetheless, his gratifying response supports the wisdom of attempting total psychiatric management for patients with Gilles de la Tourette's disease.",

It is not just any relation between an action or word and a thing; the list of things which can refer, people, words and concepts, is probably not complete (scenes in more recent movies can refer to scenes in less recent movies); and a complete account would need to speak of cases in which the reference relation seems to involve three terms in a different way from the one already mentioned. In the philosophy of language, it has been customary to think of reference as a two-place relation, with some object as the second term and a word or phrase as the first.",

      "abstract": "Perhaps even more strongly than others in our contemporary Western world, psychiatrists cling to an exceptionally rigid scientific world view. When psychotic patients speak of such matters as their experiences with spirits or of being possessed or of their preoccupations with meaningful coincidences, psychiatrists discount their views as mere psychotic delusions. We suggest that psychiatrists should deal with their patient's attempts at explaining their symptoms by negotiation and compromise, just as any other physician would do when confronted with patient explanations for symptoms which do not coincide with the tenets of scientific medicine. Rather than relegating the psychotic to a meaning-vacuum by dismissing his or her explanations as totally false and non-negotiable, the therapist should help patients find meaning by linking their views and experiences to those of important thinkers within Western cultures. Almost all elements of psychotic thought including beliefs in disembodied spirits, synchronicity (meaningful coincidences), and the possibility of non-material, actions-at-a-distance can be found among respected Western philosophers, psychiatrists, religious leaders and quantum physicists. An example of the world view of a psychotic patient is presented in which a variety of idiosyncratic beliefs are described including convictions of the reality of synchronicity. We demonstrate that highly similar synchronicity beliefs have been entertained by many major Western intellectuals. We contend that on this basis and along with negotiation and compromise, a therapeutic alliance can be established which may provide a measure of symptom relief as well as improvements in rehabilitation potential.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Is it plausible to claim (some) non‐human animals have beliefs, on the (non‐behaviourist) assumption that believing is or involves subjects' engaging in practical reasoning which takes account of meanings? Some answer Yes, on the ground that evolutionary continuities linking humans with other animals must include psychological ones. But (1) evolution does not operate—even primarily—by means of continuities. Thus species, no matter how closely related (in fact, sometimes even conspecifics) operate with very different adaptive 'tricks'; and it is plausible to think these, rather than the physiological 'groundings' underlying them, are the best means of (analogies for) explaining beliefs. Also (2) it is reasonable to assimilate most cases 'down' to creatures (e.g. flies) that obviously lack beliefs rather than 'up' to others (chimpanzees) that apparently possess belief‐like states (proto‐beliefs), because observation shows the internal workings of such middle animals' 'beliefs' differ markedly from the corresponding things humans do. For example, ducks do not have beliefs about the numbers of objects, because although they estimate numerically, they do it in a way that is much more firmly connected to perceiving than would be the case either with counting or a counting‐like process.",

      "abstract": "One of our customary expectations in reading or seeing a play is that it will offer us intimate insight into the lives of other human beings, providing knowledge of the ways in which they perceive the world, or relate to others, or see themselves. But this is by no means an obligatory ingredient in the dramatic pudding: it is not a feature, for example, of the scripts which have survived from the medieval period, of which the anonymous Everyman forms a good example. Here the eponymous hero is a representative type of worldly man, and his individual quirks of personality, his responses and reactions, are irrelevant to his role in the drama: we never find out what makes Everyman 'tick'. Similarly the plays of the Japanese Noh tradition, which had a profound influence on the theatrical theories of Yeats, contain little by way of 'psychological interest' as it is understood in the West. It is simply that their authors wish to present other insights for our consideration than those which arise from an interest in human personality.",

This chapter argues that the most plausible perfectionism is consequentialist, identifying right actions by the quantity of good they result in; tells us to maximize the good rather than satisfice; and is time‐ and agent‐neutral, so we should care equally about perfections at all times and in all lives. That we should pursue others’ perfections as much as our own goes against a common view of narrow perfectionism as egoistic, but is necessary if the view does not make each person's perfection involve acting virtuously toward others. It can also be obscured if people can promote others’ perfection less well than their own and if their perfections often cooperate, so one's achieving them encourages rather than retards others’ doing so.",

One wants to go places, to see and to understand the wider world from which one is barred, but cannot without assistance. One is dependant on others and therefore lost in a world of uncertainty where most decisions are in the hands of others.

      "title": "Reframing the Theory of Hope in Conservation Science",
      "abstract": "Hope springs eternal, so they say. It is a fundamental part of being human. It is something that we experience regularly. We hope that it does not rain on our walk to work, that in leaving the office late we won't miss our train, that our favorite sporting team will win it's upcoming game. It's an almost daily phenomenon, but something to which most of us give little thought. Despite this oversight, it defines how we live, play and work. Hope can be defined as the belief that our goals can be secured through our own actions, or alternatively, that chance, luck or some universal influence bigger than ourselves will steer us toward something we desire. When considered as this dichotomy of definition, as presented in various dictionaries, the fundamental difference between these two definitions of hope becomes critically important. The first defines an individual's belief that, despite facing challenges, he or she has a sufficient locus of control to achieve a favorable outcome (self-empowered hope). The second presents as a belief that a goal will only be attainable with input from a force or entity beyond ourselves (fortuitous hope). The definition of hope a person chooses to adopt can define the likelihood he or she will attain their individual goals. Implementing effective conservation research—science translated into action—begins with an individual reflecting on his or her own values and making a decision to act towards positively changing their own behavior, and/or facilitating others to do the same. As such, self-empowered hope provides the basis for effective conservation, as it is the source of an individual's drive to achieve constructive conservation outcomes, and so it lays the foundation for robust science or evidence-based practice. Self-empowered hope also provides the basis for the common vision and sense-of-belonging that binds individuals together into the effective collaborations required to mobilize collective action toward a mutual goal. Self-empowered hope makes us individually and collectively more effective implementers because it reaffirms our ability to chart a course, and arrive at a point, where we are ensuring the persistence of Nature. The definition of hope we choose—the self-empowered or the fortuitous, or some mix of the two—influences how both individuals and groups frame and enact their conservation research and action, and hence their effectiveness. Since it's inception the discipline of conservation biology (now conservation science) has framed itself as a “crisis discipline,” likening itself to surgery in medicine or to battle in warfare. Use of the term imparts a sense of urgency to stem the decline of Nature. However, the term suggests despair, the very opposite of self-empowered hope. This negative perspective is counter-productive and self-defeating. For example, those marketing the sale of hybrid cars do not encourage us to buy a vehicle by lamenting the dire state of our world or by playing on our personal guilt in contributing toward the global decline of Nature. Rather, they promote the positives, such as the benefit that you can deliver to the planet and the financial savings you will make. We need to reframe our hope from despair to self-empowered hope so as to ensure a more positive philosophy that is effective in providing a deep foundation that promotes our drive for action. Just as the definitions of hope have been dichotomized and polarized, so too has our perspective on conservation science. For example, a common perspective seems to be to view research and implementation as distinctly separate processes. Accordingly, in enacting our approach to conservation science, research seems to often be conducted without consideration of the ways it can be presented and subsequently implemented to proactively assist in achieving conservation goals. It is hoped that an unidentified implementer will spontaneously hunt-out our research and apply it to some decision-making process. A colleague, Kevin Rogers, describes the belief that our research will be implemented without forward planning and effective collaborations as the “Theory of Hope”—researchers recognize the potential importance of their research and of supporting the decision-making of implementers with robust, practical science, but mostly live in the fortuitous hope that some entity beyond themselves will deliver and interpret their research on their behalf. This pathology of hope in conservation science manifests as a general belief that cataloguing the on-going, though potentially reversible, decline of Nature through the application of ever more accurate and precise research provides implementers (who have legal, regulatory or moral responsibility for the conservation of Nature) the opportunity to voluntarily locate information useful for delivering humanity from our environmental crisis. The widespread and unwitting adoption of this pathology goes largely unacknowledged. This manifestation of hope can never be effective. We need a new philosophy and a new perspective. We must redefine fortuitous hope to be self-empowered hope and thereby reclaim the potential effectiveness of our research. A theory of change that moves conservation science beyond fortuitous hope for translating research into action is founded upon two elements. The first is responsibility. We have the capacity to develop and deliver scientific information that provides the foundation for growing, through further research and social learning, our collective knowledge of effective conservation action. This mandates our genuine involvement in delivering solutions. The second is leadership. The conservation science research community has the opportunity to promote self-empowered hope over fortuitous hope. Further, conservation researchers can become facilitators of fundamental change through humbly enacting the quiet leadership that supports implementers through impartial and timely advice. For researchers to become facilitators of change requires that we: (1) seek-out and proactively engage with implementers and their challenges; (2) recognize that hypotheses confirmed through increasingly complex but poorly targeted research are no supplement for simple but carefully crafted problem-focused research that directly informs decision-making; and (3) present research outputs in user-useful and user-friendly ways that are positively framed solutions rather than a quantitative catalogue of on-going crisis. Napoleon Bonaparte declared that a leader is a dealer in hope. As the public face of our discipline, and the conduit through which robust research is promoted, conservation journals have a fundamentally important responsibility for playing an active role in reframing the pathology of hope in conservation science. This begins with recognizing the importance of problem-focused research, encouraging and presenting the work of implementers alongside researchers, and replacing the unhelpful catalogues of despair with studies that demonstrate advances in our learning to apply research to the implementation of effective action. This demands that we present positive alongside negative results, and successes alongside failures. It also requires ceasing to perpetuate the philosophy that conservation is a crisis discipline. Liberating ourselves from our reliance on fortuitous hope will promote our individual and collective drive for learning to be increasingly effective. Hope springs eternal, as well it should. Thanks to Kevin Rogers for introducing me to the Theory of Hope, Jim Manolis for his thoughts on leadership, Kent Redford for his insights on the foundations of effective conservation, and Richard Cowling for his example of how to be an effective pracademic.

      "abstract": "No class of diseases with which man is afflicted are so various in their manifestations as those known under the general term of insanity. No diseases present such an infinite variety of light and shade belonging to their own nature, or to their intermixture with other maladies, or to the influence of temperament, of individual peculiarities of habit, or of social position; and therefore the diagnosis of no other class of diseases taxes nearly so much the ingenuity and the patience of the physician. The Diagnosis of almost all other diseases depends principally upon weighing the evidence afforded by physical signs and symptoms, upon evidence addressed to the senses; but in mental disease, it is for the most part dependent upon evidence which is cognizable by the intellect alone, and upon data which the senses furnish to us only at second hand. The physician is compelled to bring to this investigation, not only a knowledge of those functions which are subservient to the vegetative and animal life of the individual, but also a clear and analytical conception of those which collectively constitute mind. He must not only be a physician, but a metaphysician; not indeed in the almost opprobrious sense of the term, but in that better sense which designates a lover of truth, seeking to ascertain not the essence of mind or any other unattainable abstraction, but the laws of mind which are as regular as any other natural laws, and the knowledge of which offers to philosophy a wholesome and legitimate object of research.",

      "title": "The vulnerability of God and Humanity",
      "abstract": "A study published a few years ago supported an oft-made claim: that people create God in their own image. The study suggested that people’s views on what God was like and what God wanted matched their own views of how they wanted to be and what they believed. There is, of course an irony because in the book of Genesis we are told that God created humans in God’s own image. These two views: God made humans in God’s image and humans made God in human’s image are not, of course, inconsistent. If both are true we might conclude if you want to learn what people think about themselves (or at least what people with power and influence think about themselves) look at the typical image of God. But if you want to learn about God is really like, look at the reality of humankind. This article suggests some ideas on what thinking along these lines might suggest. I will focus on Christian understandings of God. I argue that a popular concept of God is that he is like superman, just bigger, better, stronger. That he is all strong; all knowing and all mighty: exhibiting the characteristics of autonomy; self-sufficiency and strength that (generally speaking) people admire in themselves. These are reflected in the law’s assumptions about the self too. The law is largely based around an assumption of the independent individualised man. The law is a revealing way of showing us what we think about ourselves. That is because in law we seek to identify and protect the values that are most important to us. A more honest look at ourselves would indicate that in reality we are profoundly interdependent and vulnerable. These open up a more appealing image of God as different from the common assumption. A God who is vulnerable; a suffering God, a disabled God, a weak God. Centering the vulnerability of both God and humankind opens up new and interesting ways of thinking about both law and theology. These themes will be explored in this article.",

This is the our time's call of aesthetics that one should go and look for the very origin of beauty and return to nature, that one should care about human existence and the perfection of sensibilities, giving people feeling of beauty, performing beauty's social function of eliciting honesty and kindness from human being, and that beauty should, in a world of material, give any sensible individual aesthetic care and guidance, leading them out of loneliness and spiritual emptiness after their getting individual independence.",

      "abstract": "After the death of a closely related person or of a friend, after the death of a beloved animal, but also after the loss of an important personal object, mourning is a normal and an important process. The mourner and the deceased person become a single social unit where specific burial rites are practiced. so that the dead, with the help of the living, can enter the land of the ancestors. Sometimes, however, the person in mourning develops psychiatric symptoms and needs help for this process. The process has become an adjustment disorder or even has caused the outbreak of another psychiatric disorder. Specific prolonged mourning can also take place when the deceased embodies a homeland or specific aspects of the self that has been lost to the mourner either through war or other traumatic identity displacements. Likewise, when a person's body is missing, but presumed dead, he/she cannot be buried and commemorated in a way that allows the mourner to find comfort and hope that the important traits and identity of the deceased will live on as an ancestor to give continuity, strength and advice to the living. This chapter focuses on how to handle a psychopathological mourning process and how this handling depends on psychiatric diagnostics.",

They are the means by which one organism gains some advantage to the detriment of another. No hint of genuine charity ameliorates our vision of society, once sentimental ism has been laid aside. What passes for co-operation turns out to be a mixture of opportunism and exploitation. The impulses that lead one animal to sacrifice himself for another turn out to have their ultimate rationale in gaining advantage over a third; and acts ‘for the good’ of one society turn out to be performed to the detriment of the rest. Where it is in his own interest, every organism may reasonably be expected to aid his fellows. Where he has no alternative, he submits to the yoke of communal servitude. Yet given a full chance to act in his own interest, nothing but expediency will restrain him from brutalizing, from maiming, from murdering-his brother, his mate, his parent or his child.

      "title": "On R. Muth’s Impossible Dream: Trying to turn Subjective Probabilities into Objective Probabilities",
      "abstract": "R. Muth’s 1961 Econometrica paper is based on a fundamental and basic confusion on his part about the nature of subjective and objective probability that is impossible to remedy. A bifurcation occurred among scientists, mathematicians, and statisticians, starting in the mid 17th century with the work of Pascal, Fermat,and Cardano, about whether probability was subjective or objective. It could not be both. It had to be one or the other.Subjective probability always dealt with probability as being inside or internal to the human mind. It was a degree of belief of an individual based on his mental, personal, and psychological assessment of the data and factors he believed were involved in determining the behavior of the particular phenomena. On the other hand, Objective probability was always outside or external to the human mind. It was a part of the empirical, real world of phenomena that could be observed and was completely independently from any personal, emotional, mental, psychological or subjective factors. Objective probability was always a relative frequency in occurrence that would approach the true or correct answer in the limit as the number of observations of the particular phenomena approached infinity or some very large number that was an approximation of infinity. Historically, there are no adherents of the subjective approach to probability who accept the objective approach to probability and there are no adherents of the objective approach to probability who accept a subjective approach to probability. There is not, nor could there ever be, a subjective –objective hybrid theory because the definitions of subjective and objective probability directly contradict and conflict with each other.Muth had no historical knowledge of these two completely different definitions, forms, concepts and approaches to probability. Neither did the referees of his paper for Econometrica nor any proponent, advocate, supporter or user of what Muth claimed was the rational expectations hypothesis, which was that, for a given information set, the subjective estimates of probability (subjective probability distributions) were distributed around one single, objective, true, correct objective probability distribution. Muth apparently never realized that his definition was an oxymoron. It is impossible by definition. Nowhere in any of his references are there any that deal with the completely different theories of subjective and objective probability; there are no references to any sources in the history of science, history of probability, history of statistics, philosophy of science, philosophy of probability, or philosophy of statistics. There are no references to methodology or epistemology or to the philosophy of social science.Muth used the 1944 Von Neumann-Morgenstern approach to Expected Utility as the foundation for his theory of consumer and producer maximization of utility and profit in his 1961 article. However, it was made very clear by Von Neumann and Morgenstern that they were going to assume the use of objective frequencies only, because they were only going to deal with risk, where risk was defined to be based on known, objective probability. No subjective probability was allowed. Von Neumann had a completely different theory to deal with (complete) uncertainty when no probabilities were known, which he called min-max. Thus, the individual consumer-producer probability distributions would have to be objective, not subjective, in Muth’s paper in order to be consistent with the theory of risk analyzed by Von Neumann-Morgenstern in 1944. Out of nowhere, Muth starts talking about subjective probabilities (distributions) being distributed, for a given information set, around a true, correct, objective probability distribution. This is impossible and can never occur. There is absolutely no foundation at all in any theory of probability for Muth’s definition of rational expectations.The entire literature on the rational expectations hypothesis needs to be completely and totally reformulated and rewritten so as to be consistent with a foundation in either the subjective theory of probability or the objective theory of probability. Otherwise, rational expectationists need to state that they are not dealing with probability and statistics at all. They are simply assuming the very extreme position of complete knowledge from the Greenspan or Keynesian Continuum or spectrum that ranges from situations of complete ignorance to situations of complete knowledge. Currently, there simply is no foundation in any theory of probability for the rational expectations hypothesis, as defined by Muth in 1961 and accepted in the literature in economics since the Robert Lucas paper of 1972, which simply repeats all of the unsupportable claims made by Muth in his definition of rational expectations in 1961 that confused subjective and objective probability.",

      "abstract": "The notion that there is a category mistake or some other conceptual confusion in regarding seeing, hearing, and other forms of perception as events, states, or processes is incorrect. Ryle's analysis of “seeing” as an achievement word does not rule out our regarding seeing as an event, but in fact suggests that we do so when we carry the analysis beyond the point where Ryle leaves it. Furthermore there are uses of “see” not noticed by Ryle which justify our saying that within certain contexts seeing is a state and within other contexts a process. The question of what these events, states, and processes are cannot be met without recognizing a fundamental duality of aspect that characterizes perception. This duality can be formulated in terms of the way perception is known. One who observes a perceiver knows the perceiver's perception in a categorically different way than the perceiver knows it. From this it can be seen that perceptual events, states, and processes have both a physical aspect and an epistemological aspect. Any attempt to reduce one of these aspects to the other would involve a category mistake.",

      "title": "Nature",
      "abstract": "It is true indeed, that the Νοητὸν, or Thing Understood, is in order of Nature before the Intellection and Conception of it, and from hence was it, that the Pythagoreans and Platonists concluded, that Νοῦς, Mind or Intellect, was not the very First and Highest Thing in the Scale of the Universe, but that there was another Divine Hypostasis, in order of Nature before it, called by them Ἕν and Τ'ἀγατὸν, One and The Good, as the Νοητὸν or Intelligible thereof. But as those Three Archical Hypostases of the Platonists and Pythagoreans, are all of them Really but One Θεῖον or Divinity: And the First of those Three, (Superiour to that which is properly called by them, Mind or Intellect) is not supposed therefore to be Ignorant of it self: So is the First Mind or Understanding, no other, than that of a Perfect Being, Infinitely Good, Fecund, and Powerful, and vertually Containing all things; comprehending it self and the Extent of its own Goodness, Fecundity, Vertue, and Power; that is, all Possibilities of things, their Relations to one another, and Verities; a Mind before Sense, and Sensible Things. An Omnipotent Understanding Being, which is it self its own Intelligible, is the First Original of all things. Again, that there must of necessity be some other Substance besides Body or Matter, and which in the Scale of Nature is Superiour to it, is evident from hence, because otherwise, there could be no Motion at all therein, no Body being ever able to move it self. There must be something Self-Active and Hylarchical, something that can Act both from it self, and upon Matter, as having a Natural Imperium, or Command over it. Cogitation is in order of Nature, before Local Motion. Life and Understanding, Soul and Mind, are no Syllables or Complexions of things, Secundary and Derivative, which might therefore be made out of things devoid of Life and Understanding; but Simple, Primitive, and Uncompounded Natures: they are no Qualities or Accidental Modifications of Matter, but Substantial Things. For which Cause Souls or Minds can no more be Generated out of Matter, than Matter it Self, can be Generated out of Something else: and therefore are they both alike (in some sense) Principles, Naturally Ingenerable and Incorruptible; though both Matter, and all Imperfect Souls and Minds, were at first Created by one Perfect Omnipotent Understanding Being. Moreover Nothing can be more Evident than this, that Mind and Understanding hath a Higher Degree of Entity or Perfection in it, and is a Greater Reality in Nature, than meer Sensless Matter or Bulkie Extension. And Consequently the things which belong to Souls and Minds, to Rational and Intellectual Beings as such, must not have Less, but More Reality in them, than the things which belong to Inanimate Bodies. Wherefore the Differences of Just and Unjust, Honest and Dishonest, are greater Realities in Nature, than the Differences of Hard and Soft, Hot and Cold, Moist and Dry. He that does not perceive any Higher Degree of Perfection, in a Man, than in an Oyster, nay than in a Clod of Earth or Lump of Ice, in a Piece of Past, or Pye-Crust, hath not the Reason or Understanding of a Man in him. There is unquestionably, a Scale or Ladder of Nature, and Degrees of Perfection and Entity, one above another, as of Life, Sense, and Cogitation, above Dead, Sensless and Unthinking Matter; of Reason and Understanding above Sense, &c. And if the Sun be Nothing but a Mass of Fire, or Inanimate Subtle Matter Agitated, then hath the most Contemptible Animal, that can see the Sun, and hath Consciousness and Self enjoyment, a Higher Degree of Entity and Perfection in it, than that whole Fiery Globe; as also than the Materials, (Stone, Timber, Brick and Morter) of the most Stately Structure, or City. Notwithstanding which, the Sun in other regards, and as its vastly Extended Light and Heat, hath so great an Influence, upon the Good of the whole World, Plants and Animals; may be said to be a far more Noble and Useful thing in the Universe, than any one Particular Animal whatsoever. Wherefore there being plainly a Scale or Ladder of Entity; the Order of Things was unquestionably, in way of Descent, from Higher Perfection, Downward to Lower; it being as Impossible, for a Greater Perfection to be produced from a Lesser, as for Something to be Caused by Nothing. Neither are the Steps or Degrees of this Ladder, (either upward or downward) Infinite; but as the Foot, Bottom, or Lowest Round thereof, is Stupid and Sensless Matter, devoid of all Life and Understanding; so is the Head, Top, and Summity of it, a Perfect Omnipotent Being, Comprehending it self, and all Possibilities of things. A Perfect Understanding Being, is the Beginning and Head of the Scale of Entity; from whence things Gradually Descend downward; lower and lower, till they end in Sensless Matter. Νοῦς πάντων προγενέστατος, 1 Mind is the Oldest of all things, Senior to the Elements, and the whole Corporeal World; and likewise according to the same Ancient Theists, it is Κύριος κατὰ φύσιν, 2 by Nature Lord over all, or hath a Natural Imperium and Dominion over all; it being the most Hegemonical thing. And thus was it also affirmed by Anaxagoras, Νοῦς βασιλεὺς οὐρανοῦ τε καὶ γῆς, that Mind is the Soveraign King of Heaven and Earth.",

      "title": "Ethics and Values Matter: The Role of Higher Education",
      "abstract": "Human existence is a process of learning and development aimed at achieving wisdom, and education has been regarded as the ultimate value system since the birth of culture and way of life for this reason. Education is more than only the acquisition of skills or the gathering of knowledge or news about a topic of interest from others or from other parts of the world. It is not limited to the abilities of obtaining information received and preserved via knowing, or just the exploration of existential problems and familiarization with previously acquired knowledge or data, or with a system of knowledge - but also with the goal of comprehending this cognition. Knowledge is involved with the comprehension of a collection of propositions or concepts. Knowledge can be theoretical and practical, fundamental and abstract, and it may exist in any time period: past, present, and future. However, cognition is always done in the present. Past memories and future prophecies are also remembered in the present, as the ideas flash or surface in the mind. These flashes act as an impetus for our quick determination, allowing us to decide whether or not to undertake anything. However, for the purpose of brevity, I'll lump the two, knowledge and cognition, together under the heading of knowledge. Education fosters the development of talents from all three faculties, as well as wisdom in their right application for the benefit of people and society for creating value and ethics. The goal of NEP 2020 is also having important role in higher education teaching to encourage systematic and focused discoveries and practices that benefit society. Society views higher education institutions as catalysts for the transformation of knowledge into wisdom. The quality, morals, and ethics of higher education institutions are increasingly important in integrating young people into society. A country like India has a large young population, and they are the frontiers of the Indian government's Made in India Initiative. It has been well mentioned that the actual philosophy of education is in the combination of ethics, virtues, values, and the validity of human life, thus it is vital to improve ethical values, philosophical thinking, study, research, and moral growth in the Indian education system.",

Body Shaming is ridicule, criticism and comments from others that are negative about a person's physical (body size / shape) or appearance. The theory used in this research is Semiotics. The type of research used is qualitative. The researcher implemented a qualitative approach using the Roland Barthes study method with denotative, connotative and mythical concepts which are the main keys in Semiotics research. The purpose of this study is to understand the meaning of the body shaming myth contained in the film Imperfect. This film tells the story of a woman named Rara who is always a victim of body shaming around her. Having a fat body, tan skin and thick curly hair makes Rara considered unsightly. Rara is required to change her body shape according to the beauty standards that develop in her environment. Body shaming still often occurs in everyday life, whether intentional or unintentional. Body Shaming can be done by anyone, anywhere and anytime. Body Shaming has a negative impact on the victim, Rara has low self-confidence, thinks too much about what other people say about her, and has unstable mental health due to constantly thinking about what other people say about her.",

      "abstract": "The past several years have seen an explosion of research in the area of spirituality and health. However, confusion and incomprehension of the conception of spirituality (e.g. confounding spirituality with various conventional views on religiousness) hampers better understanding in this area. The present paper proposes definition of spiritual phenomena in man based on natural epistemological and instrumental criteria (whether a certain phenomenon can be objectively known and evoked): spiritual phenomena in man are those, which cannot be objectively known nor evoked, but which act (e.g., love, idea). Spiritual phenomena can be really known only in the self (\"in spirit\"). Objectively known can be only manifestations of spiritual phenomena. Some attributes of love (e.g. its personal uniqueness) or ideas (e.g., sense of own life) whose satisfaction appears to be important for health are briefly outlined. A review of some frequently cited recent papers investigating the role of spirituality in health and discussion of frequent pitfalls in this area is given. Spirituality is a universal human phenomenon. All human beings, secular or religious, encounter with spiritual phenomena. Although the present conception of spirituality distances from some conventional views on religiousness, it is not atheistic. On the contrary, it accommodates the basic religious concept \"God is love\". Conceptual clarification is essential for further progress in the study of impact of spirituality on health.",

The framework dominates wherever this micro level of interactions is the model to explain events, for instance in science or witchcraft. But can causality account for the dynamics of macrosystems? A system ‘relates’ to (rather than causes) its parts. Magical concoctions ‘relate’ well rather than cause effects with the certainty of tools or natural laws. So this macro level is the topos (common place for meaning) for users of magic/ medicine.\r\nMagical concoctions have a goal (protection, attack, love, cure,…) but are not instruments, like a hoe for cultivation. That is why their ingredients contain symbols, additives (shingila), while a hoe does not. The topos of magic is not causality but the contingency of the gift, which adds propitiation, placation, attention to the expertise invested: you count on your gift being accepted and the recipient (the world, nature, gods,…) to return the favor but you cannot be sure. \r\nMagical concoctions have a goal (protection, attack, love, cure,…) but are not instruments, like a hoe for cultivation.

      "abstract": "Some people report localised pain on their body when seeing other people in pain (sensory-localised vicarious pain responders). In this study, we assess whether this is related to atypical computations of body ownership which, in paradigms such as the rubber hand illusion (RHI), can be conceptualised as a Bayesian inference as to whether multiple sources of sensory information (visual, somatosensory) belong together on a single body (one’s own) or are distributed across several bodies (vision = other, somatosensory = self). According to this model, computations of body ownership depend on the degree (and precision) of sensory evidence, rather than synchrony per se. Sensory-localised vicarious pain responders exhibit the RHI following synchronous stroking and—unusually—also after asynchronous stroking. Importantly, this occurs only in asynchronous conditions in which the stroking is predictable (alternating) rather than unpredictable (random). There was no evidence that their bottom-up proprioceptive signals are less precise, suggesting individual differences in the top-down weighting of sensory evidence. Finally, the enfacement illusion (EI) was also employed as a conceptually related bodily illusion paradigm that involves a completely different response judgement (based on vision rather than proprioception). Sensory-localised responders show a comparable pattern on this task after synchronous and asynchronous stroking. This is consistent with the idea that they have top-down (prior) differences in the way body ownership is inferred that transcends the exact judgement being made (visual or proprioceptive).",

      "abstract": "Human existence starts from a weakness and inability which will then move towards strength. Humans can easily take advantage of the grace and gifts bestowed on them, but humans must fulfill an obligation to their Lord. Human dignity in the sight of God is not measured by how high the rank, position, lineage or wealth. But what is measured by Allah is his piety. Humans in an Islamic perspective will still be born in a state of nature, namely holy, clean, free from all sins and have a tendency to accept religion, faith, and monotheism. Humans become good or bad is the result of educational and environmental factors, not their original character. Basically humans are born in a state of nature. This means that humans are born in an equally weak state even though they have great potential. But that doesn't mean that when a human is born, it's like a white or blank slate like John Lock said or helpless like a jabarian view. This is because humans have the potential in the form of certain tendencies related to their reasoning, mental, and psychic powers which are of different types and levels. The understanding of Islamic education experts on the nature of nature brings implications for the birth of the theory of nature in education. In the context of education, this theory becomes the basis for developing human nature. In this case, the educational process becomes important to improve its quality because it is one of the means that can develop the potentials that exist within humans in accordance with the nature of their creation which is in accordance with what is described in the Al-Qur'an and Hadith.",

Second, the average person uses the face as a source of a great amount of information about other individuals. Identification is but one aspect of this information; faces also serve as the basis for inferences about character and personality, mood, and the specific feelings being expressed by another person.",

      "abstract": "If we understand death as the irreversible loss of the good life, we can give meaning to the idea that for suffering patients in the end stage of their illness, life may become an evil and death no longer a threat. Life may lose its good already in the living person. But what does the good of life consist in, then? I defend an internalist view according to which the goodness of life is intrinsically related to the attitudes, concerns, interests and experiences of the person who is leading the life. This results in the contention that the core of what we understand as the value of the person's life is to be identified with what makes life go well for the person living the particular life. This internalist view does not presuppose (or imply) hedonism or mentalism, nor does it pose an experience requirement. Something may be good for you, because it is valuable as seen from your authentic viewpoint, even if you do not actually experience this goodness, or think otherwise because you are mistaken about your own well-being. To test this position, and the authenticity-requirement it includes, I discuss three cases of patients who are persistent in denying that in their life any value is left and who contend that death is not worse than further living. Internalism acknowledges that in the life of these patients there may be 'functionings' and 'beings' that are worthwhile, where the test of value is at least partially independent of subjective assessment. Still, internalism claims that something truly valuable can only contribute to the good of one's life of it has positive meaning as seen from the attitudinal viewpoint that identifies oneself.",

      "abstract": "According to philosophers who ground your anticipation of future experiences in psychological continuity and connectedness, it is rational to anticipate the experiences of someone other than yourself, such as a self that is the product of fission or of replication. In this article, I concur that it is rational to anticipate the experiences of the product of fission while denying the rationality of anticipating the experiences of a replica. In defending my position, I offer the following explanation of why you have good reason to anticipate the experiences of your post-fission successor but not your replica: in the former case, you become (i.e., substantially change into) somebody else, whereas, in the latter case, you are merely replaced by somebody else.",

The primary container and first leader. The one who provides a non-verbal and emotional presence. She grasps his being, his unique being, and his distress. The first function as container is to translate unthinkable thoughts into those available for thinking. The message is transformed inside her, the container. The maternal object, functioning as a thinking agent. A non-verbal emotional presence. Thus a link is formed. Without this the infant, unable to tolerate his distress, can only eject it as soon as possible. Any preconception that there would be a containing and nourishing object, available for intimate relationships, is destroyed, leaving only anxiety, confusion and hatred, and it is this which is projected. The important question is, can leaders in more sophisticated settings stand and understand this aspect of their role? Can they contain the anxiety which accompanies it? I propose to link the function of the \"good enough\" mother, able to be omnipresent in a state of \"reverie\", to deal with the protomental confusion of the infant, to Bion's theory of thinking with its emphasis on role and function.",

Let a man once assume a good God or a righteous universe, and he thereby also assumes that all events must be directed, or at least overruled, for good. Perhaps, however, it is a little easier to declare what one means when he says, “there is a God,” than to explain what one means by “the divine Providence.” Do we believe in a special Providence, that enters into each particular act or moment, so that, for example, it is literally true that not a sparrow “shall fall to the ground without your Father”? Do we think that the infinite Power carries every individual life in its thought, and even plans, and cares what each man does, suffers, or enjoys? Or do we think of Providence as merely a general guiding agency, like the intelligence that steers a ship in safety without any special responsibility for the conduct or the pleasure of the passengers? Do we think that a man can interfere, by the exercise of his little will, with the working of divine Providence? Or does Providence also enter into and direct the motion of every individual will, as it may be conceived to enter into the motion of the sands on the beach?",

Neither love nor hatred of work is inherent in man, or inherent in any given line of work. For work has no intrinsic meaning. No adequate history of the meanings of work has been written. One can, however, trace the influences. of various philosophies of work, which have filtered down to modern workers and which deeply modify their work as well as their leisure. While the modern white-collar worker has no articulate philosophy of work, his feelings about it and his experiences of it influence his satisfactions and frustrations, the whole tone of his life. Whatever the effects of his work, known to him or not, they are the net result of the work as an activity, plus the meanings he brings to it, plus the views that others hold of it.",

In ascending the scale of Psychical activity, we find the operations of the Intelligent Mind becoming more and more independent of the Sensorial changes which first excited them. It has been shown that in the first or sensational stage, the Consciousness is. engrossed with self, not being as yet awake to the existence of any external cause for the subjective change it experiences; whilst in the second or perceptive stage, in which that objective cause is apprehended as something not-self, the Mind is entirely given-up to, the contemplation of it, and recognizes its properties as the sources of the various affections it experiences. Some of these affections relate to knowledge, whilst others partake more of the nature of feeling; but in all of them the percipient mind is brought face to face, as it were, with the object perceived; and the knowledge which comes to us from this direct relation, whether through our original or our acquired intuitions, has a certainty to which no other kind of knowledge can lay claim. But it is not until the Mind attains a still higher kind of activity, that it forms that distinct mental representation, or idea, of the object, which stands altogether apart from our immediate experience, and assumes the character of an independent Intellectual reality.",

      "abstract": "A fundamental claim of phenomenology is that the meaning of something is not given to us in the manner of abstract theoretical knowledge but arises out of our concrete, non-theoretical dealings with the world. Phenomenology rejects the idea that we need to find a priori or metaphysical grounds to justify what, by remaining faithful to our deepest experiential evidence, we in a certain sense already know to be true. It carefully attends to the nature of consciousness as actually experienced, not as represented by the tradition or abstract philosophizing or scientific theory. This leads to a method in philosophy: the careful description of things or their meanings as they appear to a ‘transcendentally reduced’ (Husserl 1991: 34 passim) consciousness, i.e. minus all prejudices and theoretical assumptions, while taking their very manner of appearance into consideration. But how does phenomenology shed light on something like the meaning of human dignity? If human dignity is not something I have to infer but something directly intuited in experience, how is it that human beings inhabit my experience in such a way that they present themselves to me as beings worthy of respect, possessing certain rights and generating correlative duties and obligations, which are essential components of their recognition?",

The people have basic needs, in terms of survival, and another set of needs that relates to the meaningful constitution of social reality that provides for a degree of satisfaction, or what Andre Gorz referred to as “qualitative needs” – those that make up a meaningful life in terms of such factors as communication and creativity. Part of understanding these dynamics is to consider the importance of morality and ethics in their lives. Self-preservation and moral duty often stand in tension.",

The data used are mostly extracted from Indonesian proverb books, and ones found in proverbs of other languages. First, the data are classified based on plants or parts of plant possibly concurred. Later, the investigation is directed toward the various possibility the combination might represent. Through careful analysis, it is finally found that the plants or parts of the plants to be combined can be between different plants, parts of the same plants, one plant and its parts, parts and different plants, and parts of different plants. Plants or parts of plants to be combined are perceived as: to have the same quality for representing something hard or impossible to change, something must be committed by both parties, the same destiny to be experienced, or how should someone to behave; the different quality of plants or parts of the plant is used to represent unexpected thing (better or worse) to happen, not easy to give up and always depend on something available, could differentiate between good and bad matters, to use the worse quality things first before the better ones, imbalance competition, ability and sincerity to accept the good and bad aspect of things; one plant or parts of the plant are older (coming out earlier) or younger (coming out later) than the others to represent the difficulties for the older people to change, any occasion follows cause and effect law, the new comers usually should or could not drive out or defeat the natives; and phonological representation to show that sometimes the proverbs are created on the basis of aesthetic achievements instead of merely on metaphorical similarities.",

Pretense presupposes some BIC-based human interaction, where a normal, practical behavior is used for signifying something, based on a sign that is not a conventional one. In light of BIC interaction theory, one can exploit this sign or message in a deceptive way in order to induce the other to believe that he/she is performing a given behavior or has a given mental state.",

Image is so important, and not only nowadays. Identity has always used the body as its primary source of reference. Today, there are possibilities available to each individual through MUDs (multiuser dungeons or multiuser dimensions) with their avatars in 3D Internet simulations to create their identity. The individual personality is not only staged though outward appearances (e.g. clothes), material goods (e.g. cell phones, furniture, cars), and social behaviour, but also their presence and activities within virtual spaces. Generally, the environment of MUDs are dubious, from a ethical or moral point of view, for developing personality since there is no bridge existing between physical body and identity. Still, it is possible for avatars to play a positive role in developing individual personality and social behaviour if a bridge is built within the self-designed hybrid (virtual and physical) experience and activity space. This theory is supported by the result of the ArtDeCom project, which combines theory and practice of integrated arts, design, and computer science in education.",

      "abstract": "The evolution of groups into adaptive units, similar to single organisms in the coordination of their parts, is one major theme of multilevel selection theory. Another major theme is the evolution of altruistic behaviors that benefit others at the expense of self. These themes are often assumed to be strongly linked, such that altruism is required for group‐level adaptation. Multilevel selection theory reveals a more complex relationship between the themes of altruism and organism. Adaptation at every level of the biological hierarchy requires a corresponding process of natural selection, which includes the fundamental ingredients of phenotypic variation, heritability, and fitness consequences. These ingredients can exist for many kinds of groups and do not require the extreme genetic variation among groups that is usually associated with the evolution of altruism. Thus, it is reasonable to expect higher‐level units to evolve into adaptive units with respect to specific traits, even when their members are not genealogically related and do not behave in ways that are obviously altruistic. As one example, the concept of a group mind, which has been well documented in the social insects, may be applicable to other species.",

Similarly man can envision a life with certain qualities: truthfulness, love, tolerance, peace etc., and can become the being he envisions. To explain in the words of Maslow, “being” is “that which the person is” and “becoming”, “that which the person could be”, Gordon W. Allport can be aptly quoted in this connection. He writes: “If the prejudiced style of life can be learned and certainly it is not innate-then surely the tentative style or in Gandhi's term, 'equi-minded outlook' can also be acquired”.

Apart from being (one way or other) involved in the language, they all would share a demanding requirement – a second mental centre within the subject. This redefinition of the simulationism is extended in the present book in two directions. Firstly, mirror-neurons and, likewise, animal abilities connected with the visual field of their fellows, although they certainly constitute important landmarks, would not require this second mental centre. Secondly, others’ beliefs would have given rise not only to predicative communicative function but also to pre-grammatical syntax. The inquiry about the evolutionary-historic origin of language focuses on the cognitive requirements on it as a faculty (but not to the indirect causes such as environmental changes or greater co-operation), pays attention to children, and covers other human peculiarities as well, e.g., symbolic play, protodeclaratives, self-conscious emotions, and interactional or four-hand tasks.",

      "title": "Postponement Behavior as a Function of Approach and Avoidance Motivation",
      "abstract": "Human behavior frequently involves planning in relation to interpersonal events scheduled to occur in the near future. A person may be required publicly to commit himself to participate in an impending event at some preferred point in time; thus, for example, he may freely elect to postpone his response rather than perform it immediately. One would generally expect postponement behavior to bear predictable relationships to the strength of relevant motives, particularly when these motives are incompatible with each other. This paper tests two deductions drawn from application of Miller's (1944, 1959) conflict model to postponement behavior. Specifically, the stimulus-similarity axis of the conflict model is identified with the future time dimension, along which some conflict-evoking event may be located. The hypotheses concern S's tendency to postpone his voluntary participation in the event, as a function of the strength of conflicting motives. In order to derive specific testable hypotheses consider first that S commits himself, in the immediate present, to take part in an event which is to occur at some point in futur'e time, and that he may either participate immediately or postpone his participation to some specified degree. Consider also that chis event will be both rewarding and punishing to respective degrees explicitly stated beforehand by E. If it is assumed that a temporal gradient of reward exists, then, the more imminent the event, the stronger will be the acquired approach to it al the instant of commitment. If it is similarly assumed that a temporal gradient of punishment exists, rhen, the more imminent the",

Philosophical perspectives on the character of humankind, such as those espoused by Hobbes (1651/1968) or Rousseau (1763/1974), as well as theories of personality and personality development, frequently begin with an assumption about an infant's affective character and abilities for self-regulation. From this foundation they then build a theory of character and its development, integrating issues of regulation and emotional expression. Rousseau was more optimistic in his view of infants as “pure” or basically moral and only subsequently corrupted by society, whereas most philosophers and theorists have held darker views of the clay from which personhood is molded. Thus, it has been more common to view infants as full of seething, vicious drives that are insensitive to others and potentially destructive (Freud, 1905/1953; 1935/1960; 1940/1964; Hobbes, 1651/1968), or at the very least untrammeled and in need of regulation, first from others but subsequently from the self.",

In a narcissistic state of mind, only one thing is deeply and immediately experienced: what happens to oneself. Some people, finding that this is how they are, do not like it. Differences in the degree of pathological narcissism must be attributable, at least in part, to differences in the way people's healthy narcissism was respected in childhood. The literature on mysticism shows two main approaches to the ineffable, depending among other things on how people feel about being the kind of person they are.

      "abstract": "Fashion designs reflect the trend of the times embedded within the cultural structures of eastern and western civilizations as well as the traditional styles. However, the motives in fashion designs fundamentally come from human beings' willingness for creation through deep understand of nature or using symbolism and artificial esthetic appreciation. Mankind has expressed their willingness for creation through speculation not with the attitude of conquering nature but by acknowledging the flow between their lives and nature. The purpose of this paper is to investigate human beings' transcendental and embracing attitude toward the natural environment and the human environment in fashion design. In natural environment factors, sublimity toward nature's marvelous powers and the transcending state of mind within happiness and delight or the extreme fear or unavoidable coerciveness and the consequential daunting feelings and smallness, and sorrow all stimulate the will of mental speculation and cause a transcending sublimity. A sublime state of mind does not exist in a superficial framework of enjoyment. It is rather an act of transcendence and embracement residing in a sublime object and leading man's spirit into a state of philosophical thought. Also, in man-made Environment factors, we found from magnanimity we were ability to see the true nature of an era's culture.",

While it is universally agreed that he places the particular appetites, passions, and affections at the bottom of the heap there is much dispute about the number and ranking of the superior principles. In particular, there has been a protracted debate about the position of benevolence in the hierarchy. Is benevolence a third superior principle, to be included with self-love and conscience, or is it merely a particular affection, with no more claim to authority than any other? If it is a superior principle, should it be ranked on a par with self-love or just below it? Of the two (relatively) undisputed superior principles, it is with self-love that benevolence is most naturally compared. Both are affections concerned with the promotion of well-being or happiness.",

Certainly it is not a film in the ordinary way which follows a plan, still less a script, not at all a story or a narrative and it is hardly an essay, and it destroys most systems of reference in the usual sense. What then determines not simply the images and sounds that appear but their relations to each other? Much of these seem illogical, undirected, and though it is possible sometimes to perceive an association for the most part these are extremely distant and obscure even if these remote elements 'suddenly' fuse and coalesce. The film is not a representation but a manifestation, a demonstration (but of what?), a collection of documents whose order can be stated but whose significance is hard to discern. Above all, the film seems to be a record of the direct experience of making the film itself, an immediacy which results in an abundance of metaphors and signs but outside of the logical or the significant, even beyond control as if the film, in the instantaneities of its associations and linkages, has written itself.",

Among serious offenders, self-justification in terms of having no choice is more common or the hapless claim that \"I don't know why I did that\" or even \"I can't believe I did that\" (which all too often becomes \"I can't remember doing that\" for as Nietzche (1886) wrote \"I have done that—says my memory. I could not have done that—says my pride and remains inexorable. Eventually memory gives in\"). Those who do appeal to principle to justify their evil actions almost inevitably cite value systems that have considerable, if not universal, acceptance. I have encountered men who proudly declared their killings to be part of the pursuit of righteous aims, such as protecting children from pedophiles, stopping the killing of the unborn child, reducing AIDS, and cleansing their city of vice. Interestingly the combination of dreadful, and in many cases repeated, violence with self-righteous superiority often attracts from fellow prisoners and prison staff a label of evil.",

But it is a puzzling thing to do, at least in a philosophieal sense. Because we ordinarily hold that we cannot “observe” the feelings of another, that we can never directly confront these feelings, that feelings as actually felt are private to each of us. There may be interesting ways of challenging this sort of remark—for instance, by way of telepathy. But there is an advantage in puzzling over the kind of inference indicated, without the challenge of telepathy or similar abilities.",

The fact that shame is also characterized by a heightened feeling of exposure and vulnerability, by a wish to hide, to become invisible, and to sink into the ground, should alert us to the fact that the body plays a significant role in the emotion. Sartre highlights the impact of the gaze. The case of vicarious shame provides further reason to question the proposal that others are accidental to shame, and play no significant role in its structure. It is no coincidence that the Oxford English Dictionary in its definition of shame includes a reference to situations, where shame arises from the consciousness of something dishonouring, ridiculous, or indecorous in the conduct of those whose honour or disgrace one regards as one's own.",

He or she feels ill and wants to know about the illness, adopts an attitude to it. The attitude will probably reflect some cultural assumptions about what sort of state illness is. The assumptions are not necessarily single or exclusive; but a doctrine of destiny, for example, is likely to instil attitudes to illness which differ from those deriving from belief in sorcery or belief in science.",

The same prisoner, when conducted to the scaffold, foresees his death as certainly from the constancy and fidelity of his guards, as from the operation of the axe or wheel. His mind runs along a certain train of ideas: The refusal of the soldiers to consent to his escape; the action of the executioner; the separation of the head and the body; bleeding, convulsive motions, and death; but the mind feels no differences between them in passing from one link to another.(David Hume [1758] 1975: 90)",

      "abstract": "The unique intellectual capabilities of Homo sapiens are often attributed to positive, physical evolutionary developments such as increased cranial capacity, upright posture, dexterous hands and an articulate oropharynx, despite the occurrence of similar features in other species that have not developed such capabilities. Humans are also unique, however, in lacking or ignoring instincts that define the social structures and behaviors of other animals. Genetically determined behaviors evolved to improve effectiveness in exploiting specific environmental niches. In nonhuman species, social structures, food choices, mating behaviors, child-rearing, etc. are driven strongly by pheromones and hormones and their neuronal targets, whose physiology evolves very slowly. Humans can rapidly invade new environments because they invent rather than inherit such behaviors, which cumulatively we call a culture. The invention of niche-specific social behaviors enables cultural evolution, which would otherwise be limited by the inflexibility of instinctual behavior. Suppression of instincts makes the invention and learning of cultures necessary, which imposes both an opportunity and a burden on individuals and societies. Cultural evolution enables human societies to invent, promulgate, compete and evolve their social structures in a generation or two rather than the hundreds of generations required for significant genetic evolution. Novel cultures and their social structures may conflict, however, with residual instincts. Such conflicts and their resolution will continue to constrain and drive cultural evolution.",

They include a large variety of phenomena, encompassing hearing voices, seeing presences, communication with non-incarnated entities (including channeling), transpersonal experiences, out-of-body experiences, near-death-experiences, previous life memories, presentiments and precognitions, seeing at distance, mind interactions at a distance, mind-matter interactions at distance. We think that individuals experiencing NOMEs should not feel like they were outsiders or diseased; they should feel free to talk about their uncommon experiences and be listen to with an open, not-judging mind, respecting the patients’ experience and narration. In fact, NOMEs are non-pathological phenomena laying in a still misunderstood grey area between mental health and psychological or psychiatric disorders, while some of them suggest intriguing properties of human consciousness. Their ostensible incompatibility with some axioms and theories of consciousness, shows the inescapable epistemological implications of their proper investigation and understanding.",

The diversity of natural species and the richness of human imagery have contributed to contrasting perspectives, in different cultural worlds and different eras. Initially, during the symbiosis, prior to the baby's starting to demarcate a boundary between his or her self and mother, mother and infant are actively involved in resonant, mirroring, back-and-forth action and response, mutually accommodating to match each other. The infant's interest in delineating the boundaries and characteristics of self and mother generalizes to a similar interest in exploring and delineating boundaries and characteristics of other human and animate beings. Active initiative contributes both to external actions and to a child's being active as a creator and manipulator of images and ideas in the inner world of illusion and fantasy. Human qualities are often imaginatively attributed to animals or to inanimate objects in fantasies, in dreams, and in a culture's mythology.",

Other difficulties arise when we inquire by what properties various organisms should be classed, many of these being identical or parallel in plants or animals, which in other respects are very different. It cannot be said that, in either kingdom, a satisfactorily natural system has been attained, nor, I venture to say, will any such system ever be formed, until there shall be a general consent to take a natural origin of organisms as partly our guide.",

Crucially, if reciprocity pertains to the question of how to be a proper recipient, it will say nothing about what we owe to people who cannot do their share, because reciprocity concerns what we owe to people who have already done their share. With regard to people who did not (and perhaps cannot) do anything to put us in their debt, reciprocity does not tell us what to do. It does not tell us why. More generally, it says little about when or how or why to make the first move, because reciprocity primarily is about how to respond when someone else has made the first move.",

      "title": "Letters from an invalid philosopher: the fallibility of mind and body in Seneca’s Epistulae morales",
      "abstract": "Anyone who wishes to make progress towards Stoic wisdom must cultivate a heightened awareness of their own fallibility, their susceptibility to the error of failing to appreciate that only virtue is truly good. Seneca's letters, the main focus of my discussion, regularly exhort his addressee Lucilius to scrutinise his (Lucilius') faults. In doing so, they also showcase the failings of their author; Seneca often confesses his own flaws. He describes himself disturbed by a range of emotions all of which ultimately derive from attributing value to circumstances a true Stoic should regard as indifferent. Stoic discipline focuses on the identification and cure of the particular weaknesses impairing one's mental and spiritual disposition, failings of the animus. Physical deficiencies might seem irrelevant to this quest for mental perfection; the capacity of the Stoic wise person for virtue is in no way compromised by illness, Seneca insists, or the loss of a limb. At the same time, Seneca regularly presents the therapy offered by philosophy as a cure for mental ills which is analogous in important respects to that offered by medicine in relation to physical ones. The place of this analogy in Stoic thinking was long established. I want to look more closely, however, at the significance of bodily failings in Seneca's letters and their complex relation to fallibility of the animus. In the end, I shall argue, the differences are more important than the parallels. Failings of the mind require therapeutic attention, but they are never to be welcomed. Failings of the body, by contrast, while they may sometimes be an impediment or distraction, can also offer the opportunity to hone crucial facets of Stoic virtue, such as fortitude and endurance.",

      "title": "Valuing Difference, Exercising Care in Oz: The Shaggy Man's Welcome",
      "abstract": "“…and he sighed with contentment to realize that he could now be finely dressed and still be the shaggy man.” One cannot say that the people of Oz valued difference or valued the diversity of its people. Because in Oz, difference and diversity simply was; difference in OZ simply existed. Rather, it might be more accurate to say that the people in the Fairy Land of Oz had a practice of difference in which different people or beings of all sorts were simply accepted and embraced. Not just accepted, as in tolerated in the way someone from Kansas or the greater United States might understand it, but difference in Oz was inherent in the place, it was expected -- respected -- promoted -- taken for granted -- embraced -- sometimes celebrated -- but rarely condemned or rejected. This practice of difference informed and was informed by a theory. But the theory was not a theory about the value of difference or the value of a diverse society. Rather, this practice was informed by a theory, philosophy and ethic of care; care for all sentient beings. In the United States, by contrast, the rhetoric of diversity is everywhere. This essay briefly examines the story of the Shaggy Man’s Welcome in L. Frank Baum’s series of fairytales about the Wonderful Wizard and the Marvelous Land of Oz. It argues, through an analysis of Justice O’Connor’s opinion in Grutter v. Bollinger and against the background of the debates and practices of diversity in the United States, that the people of Oz sincerely value difference and diversity, even though they do not engage the rhetoric of diversity. They instead value difference through an ethic of care, a moral philosophy developed by feminist long after the story was imagined. The essay suggests that, like the Shaggy Man, racial difference may have value for peoples of color and society at large. Thus it argues, consistent with Ozian ethics of care that society should recognize, respect, respond to and -- provide for -- differences in a manner that enables participation. This vision is in contrast to Justice O’Connor’s vision of the future in which she ultimately promotes the non-recognition of race while others seek its replacement with class.",

      "abstract": "A child who was treated morally, but who went unloved, is a child who would not, and could not, come to value itself properly. Nothing more fully bestows a sense of worth upon a newborn child than parental love. As infants, we are born into this world without a sense of self and so without a sense of value. And it is parental love, and nothing else, that at the outset makes it possible for us to have a proper sense of self. Anything else will invariably miss the mark. It is by virtue of being the unmistakable object of manifest parental love that we come to have a positive sense of worth, that we come to value ourselves as human beings. Indeed, in the absence of parental love, no sense of worth could easily obtain a purchase upon our lives, including moral worth. Thus, while there is no denying that morality is an intrinsic good, it is not first among intrinsic goods. Parental love is. From the standpoint of the development of our soul, parental love is more basic than morality.",

      "title": "Trapped in a metaphor",
      "abstract": "I have no trouble accepting the major conclusions of James Q. Wilson there are aspects of our moral life are universal(1) and these aspects can be called fundamental dispositions[226], which we might label sympathy, fairness, self-control, and duty. I take this proposition to be a self-evident product of the fact humans are bound together mutual interdependence [xii] in collectivities we call societies. Without acts demonstrating thoughtfulness, fairness, and duty shown toward at least some others, without self-control expressed in at least some arenas of desire, a functioning, healthy social collectivity would not be possible. In other words, at a certain level of generality the kinds of moral senses Wilson describes can be found anywhere among the social animals. In presenting his universalist argument, Wilson classifies anthropologists as either relativists or universalists. I am neither. I would classify myself as a culturalist interested in how generic human potentialities are focused in specific performances. In particular, I am interested in the ways in which metaphors trap people in a self-absorbed cycle of violence or free them to work for the common good. In this short essay, I will first discuss the area in which I agree with Wilson. I will then move on to the area of disagreement by presenting a short case study of the moral senses based on fieldwork in a modern Southeast Asian matriarchy. I include this information partly because of Wilson's claim matriarchies have never existed and partly to out-line the logic of an approach to the moral senses which is neither relativist nor universalist. Contemporary American Society Wilson's discussion of contemporary American society offers me much food for thought. I applaud his criticism of the all-too-frequent tendency for social scientists to suspend judgment. However, he is a little too fixated on anthropologists when making this criticism. In my mind, this tendency is widespread in academia. In today's climate of identity politics it takes courage to speak in behalf of the common good. If not judged harshly by one's colleagues, one can expect to disappear altogether from the list of names announced in grant awards. I agree we live in a world shaped by the ambiguous legacy of the Enlightenment[244]. On this point I would like to push further. As Wilson points out, we inherit from the Enlightenment the idea each and every citizen is entitled to equal and opportunity along with the notion that man must be treated as an end and not merely as a means to someone else's[245]. The first idea emphasizes equality for all; the second, for the individual. Recently, we have become a society worships rights, but not equality. The closer America inches toward sympathy (we are all brothers under the skin) or fairness (I am entitled to the same rewards for a given effort as you) the more we hear of rights talk[245]. Wilson provides a telling quote from Ronald Dworkin: [I]f someone has a right to do something, then it is wrong for the government to deny it to him even though it would be in the general interest to do so[245]. In the current climate of politics, Dworkin's words have a far greater capacity to move the nation than the words of those who preach sympathy and fairness. The contemporary rhetoric seems unable to comprehend the necessity of finding a balance between individual and the social good. There are dangers in moving too far in either direction. Too much concern for the common good can lead to fascism, too little concern can lead to social extinction. America has lost its bearings with respect to the common good. Increasingly we seem to be moving toward a Hobbesian war of all against all. Everyday, we learn about another crime of violence, be it hate crime, wife abuse, murder, drive-by shooting, or children killing one another in the schools. …",

For example, he maintains that an end is comparable to a form in a natural corporeal being (such as a plant or animal), for just as no material creature exists or has a species without a form, no human action can come to be or be of a particular kind unless a human agent wills some definite end. Even more important for Aquinas is a comparison with natural motions (such as changes in place, colour, or size). He thinks that as a subsensory motion is specified by its active principle (the nature from which the motion arises) and its ‘terminus to which’ (the motion’s final resting point), so a human action is specified by its active principle (the rational good or end which attracts the agent) and its ‘terminus to which’ (the action’s arrival at the agent’s intended goal).",

      "title": "INFINITY, ETHICS, AND OTHERNESS: LEVINAS",
      "abstract": "What could be more natural than to love something, someone, or the loves that mutually interest us? To love someone’s love becomes much more difficult, even impossible, when that which is interesting or love-worthy is absent. However, to love even the hatred with which the beloved loves—knowing that this beloved ought not to be chosen according to the love or disaffection they feel toward you—would mean loving and loving them precisely from the love they do not give you. What a challenge! This is a disarmed love: to love starting from the beloved's love, and not from what we love in ourselves or for ourselves in the other. Let us not be mistaken: this is a scandalous invitation to sacrifice—madness for men, but wisdom for Levinas. This is the challenge posed by this great thinker. And what a challenge it is to think it! It would be easier to elude it under the blindness of a philosophy that, according to him, for 2,500 years could not escape the conatus essendi. This evasion is explained by the egocentric difficulty in abstracting from the natural erotic relation in which the values of the ego always seek to prevail. Under such circumstances, only the emergence of a truly metaphysical infinity (beyond the natural) could open a breach and establish the possibility of a genuine ethics. This thesis deserves careful meditation. This is the objective of this work.",

      "title": "Audience, Uglossia, and CONLANG",
      "abstract": "Could we also imagine a language in which a person could write down or give vocal expression to his inner experiences -- his feelings, moods, and the rest -- for his private use? Well, can't we do so in our ordinary language? -- But that is not what I mean. The individual words of this language are to refer to what can only be known to the person speaking; to his immediate private sensations. So another person cannot understand the language. -- Ludwig Wittgenstein, Philosophical Investigations par. 243 I will be using 'audience' in two ways in the following essay: as a phenomenon that produces and is produced by media technologies (readers, hearers, viewers, Internet-users), and as something, audiens, that is essential to language itself, something without which language cannot be. I shall do so in specific references to invented languages. Who, then, are the 'consumers' of invented languages? In referring to invented languages, I am not talking about speakers of Esperanto or Occidental; I am not concerned with the invention of international auxiliary languages. These projects, already well-debated, have roots that go back at least as far as the 17th-century language philosophers who were at pains to undo the damage of Babel and restore a common language to the world. While Esperanto never became what it intended to be, it at least has readers and speakers. I am also not even talking about speakers of Klingon or Quenya. These privately invented languages have had the good fortune to be attached to popular invented cultures, and to media with enough money and publicity to generate a multitude of fans. Rather, I am talking about a phenomenon on the Internet and in a well- populated listserv whereby a number of people from all over the globe have discovered each other on-line. They all have a passion for what Jeffrey Schnapp calls uglossia ('no-language', after utopia, 'no-place'). Umberto Eco calls it 'technical insanity' or glottomania. Linguist Marina Yaguello calls language inventors fous du langage ('language lunatics') in her book of the same title. Jeffrey Henning prefers the term 'model language' in his on-line newsletter: 'miniaturized versions that provide the essence of something'. On CONLANG, people call themselves conlangers (from 'constructed language') and what they do conlanging. By forming this list, they have created a media audience for themselves, in the first sense of the term, and also literally in the second sense, as a number of them are setting up soundbytes on their elaborately illustrated and explicated Webpages. Originally devoted to advocates for international auxiliary languages, CONLANG started out about eight years ago, and as members joined who were less interested in the politics than in the hobby of language invention, the list has become almost solely the domain of the latter, whereas the 'auxlangers', as they are called, have moved to another list. An important distinguishing feature of 'conlangers' is that, unlike the 'auxlangers', there is no sustained hope that their languages will have a wide-body of hearers or users. They may wish it, but they do not advocate for it, and as a consequence their languages are free to be a lot weirder, whereas the auxlangs tend to strive for regularity and useability. CONLANG is populated by highschool, college, and graduate students; linguists; computer programmers; housewives; librarians; professors; and other users worldwide. The old debate about whether the Internet has become the 'global village' that Marshall McLuhan predicted, or whether it threatens to atomise communication 'into ever smaller worlds where enthusiasms mutate into obsessions', as Jeff Salamon warns, seems especially relevant to a study of CONLANG whose members indulge in an invention that by its very nature excludes the casual listener-in. And yet the audio-visual capacities of the Internet, along with its speed and efficiency of communication, have made it the ideal forum for conlangers. Prior to the Web, how were fellow inventors to know that others were doing -- in secret? J.R.R. Tolkien has been lauded as a rare exception in the world of invention, but would his elaborate linguistic creations have become so famous had he not published The Lord of the Rings and its Appendix? Poignantly, he tells in \"A Secret Vice\" about accidentally overhearing another army recruit say aloud: 'Yes! I think I shall express the accusative by a prefix!'. Obviously, silent others besides Tolkien were inventing languages, but they did not have the means provided by the Internet to discover one another except by chance. Tolkien speaks of the 'shyness' and 'shame' attached to this pursuit, where 'higher developments are locked in secret places'. It can win no prizes, he says, nor make birthday presents for aunts. His choice of title (\"A Secret Vice\") echoes a Victorian phrase for the closet, and conlangers have frequently compared conlanging to homosexuality, both being what conservative opinion expects one to grow out of after puberty. The number of gay men on the list has been wondered at as more than coincidental. In a survey I conducted in October 1998, many of the contributors to CONLANG felt that the list put them in touch with an audience that provided them with intellectual and emotional feedback. Their interests were misunderstood by parents, spouses, lovers, and employers alike, and had to be kept under wraps. Most of those I surveyed said that they had been inventing a language well before they had heard of the list; that they had conceived of what they were doing as unique or peculiar, until discovery of CONLANG; and that other people's Websites astounded them with the pervasive fascination of this pursuit. There are two ways to look at it: conlanging, as Henning writes, may be as common and as humanly creative as any kind of model-making, i.e., dollhouses, model trains, role-playing, or even the constructed cultures with city plans and maps in fantasy novels such as Terry Pratchett's Discworld. The Web is merely a means to bring enthusiasts together. Or it may provide a site that, with the impetus of competition and showmanship, encourages inutile and obsessive activity. Take your pick. From Hildegard von Bingen's Lingua Ignota to Dante's Inferno and the babbling Nimrod to John Dee's Enochian and on, invented languages have smacked of religious ecstacy, necromancy, pathology, and the demonic. Twin speech, or 'pathological idioglossia', was dramatised by Jodie Foster in Nell. Hannah Green's 'Language of Yr' was the invention of her schizophrenic protagonist in I Never Promised You a Rose Garden. Language itself is the centre of furious theoretical debate. Despite the inventive 'deformities' it is put to in poetry, punning, jest, singing, and lying, human language, our most 'natural' of technologies, is a social machine, used by multitudes and expected to get things done. It is expected of language that it be understood and that it have not only hearers but also answerers. All human production is founded on this assumption. A language without an audience of other speakers is no language. 'Why aren't you concentrating on real languages?' continues to be the most stinging criticism. Audience is essential to Wittgenstein's remark quoted at the beginning of this essay. Wittgenstein posits his 'private languages theory' as a kind of impossibility: all natural languages, because they exist by consensus, can only refer to private experience externally. Hence, a truly private language, devoted to naming 'feelings and moods' which the subject has never heard about or shared with others, is impossible among socialised speakers who are called upon to define subjective experience in public terms. His is a critique of solipsism, a charge often directed at language inventors. But very few conlangers that I have encountered are making private languages in Wittgenstein's sense, because most of them are interested in investing their private words with public meaning, even when they are doing it privately. For them, it is audience, deeply desireable, that has been impossible until now. Writing well before the development of CONLANG, Yaguello takes the stance that inventing a language is an act of madness. 'Just look at the lunatic in love with language', she writes: sitting in his book-lined study, he collects great piles of information, he collates and classifies it, he makes lists and fills card indexes. He is in the clutches of a denominatory delirium, of a taxonomic madness. He has to name everything, but before being able to name, he has to recognize and classify concepts, to enclose the whole Universe in a system of notation: produce enumerations, hierarchies, and paradigms. She is of course describing John Wilkins, whose Real Character and Universal Language in 1668 was an attempt to make each syllable of his every invented word denote its placement in a logical scheme of classification. 'A lunatic ambition', Yaguello pronounces, because it missed the essential quality of language: that its signs are arbitrary, practical, and changeable, so as to admit neologism and cultural difference. But Yaguello denounces auxiliary language makers in general as amateurs 'in love with language and with languages, and ignorant of the science of language'. Her example of 'feminine' invention comes from Helene Smith, the medium who claimed to be channeling Martian (badly disguised French). One conlanger noted that Yaguello's chapter entitled 'In Defence of Natural Languages' reminded him of the US Federal 'Defense of Marriage Act', whereby the institution of heterosexual marriage is 'defended' from homosexual marriage. Let homosexuals marry or lunatics invent language, and both marriage and English (or French) will come crashing to the ground. Schnapp praises Yaguello's work for being the most comprehensive examination of the phenomenon to date, but neither he nor she addresses linguist Suzette Haden Elgin's creative work on Láadan, a language designed for women, or even Quenya or Klingon -- languages that have acquired at least an audience of readers. Schnapp is less condemnatory than Yaguello, and interested in seeing language inventors as the 'philologists of imaginary worlds', 'nos semblables, nos frères, nos soeurs' -- after all. Like Yaguello, he is given to some generalities: imaginary languages are 'infantile': 'the result is always [my emphasis] an \"impoverishment\" of the natural languages in question: reduced to a limited set of open vowels [he means \"open syllables\"], prone to syllabic reduplication and to excessive syntactical parallelisms and symmetries'. To be sure, conlangs will never replicate the detail and history of a real language, but to call them 'impoverishments of the natural languages' seems as strange as calling dollhouses 'impoverishments of actual houses'. Why this perception of threat or diminishment? The critical, academic \"audience\" for language invention has come largely from non-language inventors and it is woefully uninformed. It is this audience that conlangers dislike the most: the outsiders who cannot understand what they are doing and who belittle it. The field, then, is open to re-examination, and the recent phenomenon of conlanging is evidence that the art of inventing languages is neither lunatic nor infantile. But if one is not Tolkien or a linguist supported by the fans of Star Trek, how does one justify the worthwhile nature of one's art? Is it even art if it has an audience of one ... its artist? Conlanging remains a highly specialised and technical pursuit that is, in the end, deeply subjective. Model builders and map-makers can expect their consumers to enjoy their products without having to participate in the minutia of their building. Not so the conlanger, whose consumer must internalise it, and who must understand and absorb complex linguistic concepts. It is different in the world of music. The Cocteau Twins, Bobby McFerrin in his Circle Songs, Lisa Gerrard in Duality, and the new group Ekova in Heaven's Dust all use 'nonsense' words set to music -- either to make songs that sound like exotic languages or to convey a kind of melodic glossolalia. Knowing the words is not important to their hearers, but few conlangers yet have that outlet, and must rely on text and graphs to give a sense of their language's structure. To this end, then, these are unheard, unaudienced languages, existing mostly on screen. A few conlangers have set their languages to music and recorded them. What they are doing, however, is decidedly different from the extempore of McFerrin. Their words mean something, and are carefully worked out lexically and grammatically. So What Are These Conlangs Like? On CONLANG and their links to Websites you will find information on almost every kind of no-language imaginable. Some sites are text only; some are lavishly illustrated, like the pages for Denden, or they feature a huge inventory of RealAudio and MP3 files, like The Kolagian Languages, or the songs of Teonaht. Some have elaborate scripts that the newest developments in fontography have been able to showcase. Some, like Tokana and Amman-Iar, are the result of decades of work and are immensely sophisticated. Valdyan has a Website with almost as much information about the 'conculture' as the conlang. Many are a posteriori languages, that is, variations on natural languages, like Brithenig (a mixture of the features of Brythonic and Romance languages); others are a priori -- starting from scratch -- like Elet Anta. Many conlangers strive to make their languages as different from European paradigms as possible. If imaginary languages are bricolages, as Schnapp writes, then conlangers are now looking to Tagalog, Basque, Georgian, Malagasay, and Aztec for ideas, instead of to Welsh, Finnish, and Hebrew, languages Tolkien drew upon for his Elvish. \"Ergative\" and \"trigger\" languages are often preferred to the \"nominative\" languages of Europe. Some people invent for sheer intellectual challenge; others for the beauty and sensuality of combining new and privately meaningful sounds. There are many calls for translation exercises, one of the most popular being 'The Tower of Babel' (Genesis 10: 1-9). The most recent innovation, and one that not only showcases these languages in all their variety but provides an incentive to learn another conlanger's conlang, is the Translation Relay Game: someone writes a short poem or composition in his or her language and sends it with linguistic information to someone else, who sends a translation with directions to the next in line all the way around again, like playing 'telephone'. The permutations that the Valdyan Starling Song went through give good evidence that these languages are not just relexes, or codes, of natural languages, but have their own linguistic, cultural, and poetic parameters of expression. They differ from real languages in one important respect that has bearing on my remarks about audience: very few conlangers have mastered their languages in the way one masters a native tongue. These creations are more like artefacts (several have compared it to poetry) than they are like languages. One does not live in a dollhouse. One does not normally think or speak in one's conlang, much less speak to another, except through a laborious process of translation. It remains to a longer cultural and sociolinguistic study (underway) to tease out the possibilities and problems of conlanging: why it is done, what does it satisfy, why so few women do it, what are its demographics, or whether it can be turned to pedagogical use in a 'hands-on', high- participation study of language. In this respect, CONLANG is one of the 'coolest' of on-line media. Only time will show what direction conlanging and attitudes towards it will take as the Internet becomes more powerful and widely used. Will the Internet democratise, and eventually make banal, a pursuit that has until now been painted with the romantic brush of lunacy and secrecy? (You can currently download LangMaker, invented by Jeff Henning, to help you construct your own language.) Or will it do the opposite and make language and linguistics -- so often avoided by students or reduced in university programs -- inventive and cutting edge? (The inventor of Tokana has used in-class language invention as a means to study language typology.) Now that we have it, the Internet at least provides conlangers with a place to hang their logodaedalic tapestries, and the technology for some of them to be heard. References Von Bingen, Hildegard.

      "title": "Social Interaction with Virtual Beings",
      "abstract": "Consumers are human and so inherently social beings sensitive to the meanings of actions and expressions of other beings, even other avatars found in virtual worlds. Automatic social responses are likely to invoke established social rules and dynamics from offline interactions so that they are transferred to online interactions with avatars. Social interaction relies on smooth synchronization, which can be difficult to achieve in online communication. Interaction behavior depends on goals, but the precise form of the behavior is dependent on societal norms, roles, understandings, and customs organized into expected interaction patterns resulting from past experiences. Burgoon and Walther define interaction expectations as cognitions about the anticipated communication behavior of specific others. In naturalistic situations, schema and goal activation is often automatic. Hence, interactions meeting expectations and norms of a relational schema move along relatively automatically as exchanges that fit with expectancies have little need for conscious monitoring.",

      "abstract": "People have said for generations that money is based on \"trust,\" or \"shared fiction.\" But that doesn't explain why cultures all eventually come to value the same metals or items as money. Others have said that the value of money depends on the way it facilitates trade, but even that doesn't explain where the value emerges before people agree to use money to trade. In actuality, there's a real value to gold, silver, and other forms of money that makes them reliably gain worth to people, and will emerge eventually even if everyone in a society does not like or believe in those precious metals or possessions. This is because possessing scarce objects has real reputational value among people, since having those objects indicates that we can go outside the known territory, and we instinctively collect and want things that have known scarcity. When that scarcity combines with other traits like transferability, durability and so on, we can see that money naturally emerges in society. We can use this idea to also see the real value and desire that people have for new forms of money like cryptocurrencies, and to know what will or won't emerge and last as a form of money in the future.",

      "abstract": "We are accustomed to hearing that modern secularized humanity rejects the sovereignty of God in favour of inferior, purely human powers and realities. Yet this new idolatory (shirk) is typically unintentional. It is not identical in character to the intentional idolatry of a Faust who consciously repudiates God for the sake of a purely natural or human ideal. There are minimal conditions for (successfully) committing the sin of idolatry; and the central one is potentially conscious belief in the true divinity. Can one meaningfully accuse the modern rejector of idolatry, given that he rejects the very outlook presupposed by the accusation?",

      "abstract": "The interpretation of man which I have defended in my book, Theory of Man , agrees with the Linnaean designation of homo sapiens , which is more exact, in my opinion, than the classical one of “rational animal.” In that work I maintain that what is peculiar to man is that he is conscious of a reality outside of himself and of his own intimate being, or, in other words, that he recognizes the independent existence of the world and is an ego. Both matters can be reduced to a unique primary function: the objectifying activity, which in normal, continuous, and accumulative operation belongs only to man, and from which all essentially human traits are derived. The peculiar characteristic of perception properly so called, that is, human perception, is the observation of things that are present, the recognition that a given thing exists. To perceive, then, is to attribute presence or existence to what is perceived, to admit it as an object existing by itself, certainly in different ways according to whether it is a question of external things, of the subjective entity, or of the processes and “states” inherent in it; let it be noted that when perceptive attention fastens upon the “states,” that is to say, on subjective, unintentional processes like those of coenesthesia which ordinarily are not perceived but are lived, enjoyed, or suffered, these become objectified without losing in themselves their condition of states. The capacity to objectify is the bedrock of human nature; animal conscience (if it deserves this name) must be imagined, save for rare exceptions, to be a succession of “states” to which objectifying attention is not applied because such attention can only come from an ego.",

Horses usually prefer using the left eye to observe novel objects and humans. This preference is more marked in emotional situations and when confronted with unknown persons. Thus the horse’s visual laterality provides a good option for assessing its mental state during training or in human-horse interactions. A strong preference for the left eye may signal that a horse cannot deal with certain training situations or is emotionally affected by a particular person.",

      "abstract": "Virtue and morality are a pair of important concepts that are related but also differ both in East and West ethical ideology.However,there is a big difference in their practical uses and interrelations.The traditional Western ethicists general tend to use the term virtue;and only up till Aristotle does there appear reason and virtue.But the traditional Chinese scholars adopts de(moral character),even though there are also such terms as de xing(virtue nature) and behavior that co-exist.The terminological difference does not mean that there is no reason.In fact,they represent essential difference in the East and in the West.For the Westerners,reason virtue is the ultimate goal itself of human beings and their activities,and moral virtue is only a process or means to complete or attain that goal.But for the Easters,they go to the opposite.A man who only knows virtue does not mean that he is moral;likewise,a man could not be a moral man before he practices virtual deeds.Moral virtue is the inner quality of man;but virtual deeds are the outer behaviors.The inner requires the outer to represent, and the outer is the image of the inner quality.Therefore,the ways people achieve virtue and moral deeds vary.We could fully understand virtue and morality and find out the way to reach them only when we make them clear in theory.",

It implies a lack of pretension — the author gets no particular credit for portraying it well. The Human Condition, on the other hand, implies a personal sense of where life is significant, of where humanity suffers especially or feels intensively; of unusual violence and unusual modes of feeling; of interesting development or of illuminating decay. The subject matter may even be the same, but those who write about the Human Condition take an attitude towards it.",

The desire in question, then, is a desire to understand God. For the desire is prior to knowing and it is compatible with not knowing. It is true if we say that man’s unrestricted desire to know is mated to a limited capacity to attain knowledge about Him.For its finiteness human capabilitycould not get hold of a complete knowledge of God.In knowing God and aknowledging Him as Being of beings, human beings must be aware of his ignorance that is “the only true wisdom is in knowing I know nothing.” God, therefore, takes the first step to contact with human beings, then He reveals Himself, He gives Himself to be known and He makes Himself known by human beings. This is a self-manifestation of Someone to someone. Revelation is due to the intiative of God that is God reveals Himself, when He wills, to whom He wills and because He wills. God’s revelation illuminates the intellectual capabilityof humans so that human beings are able to know Him and aknowledge Him and talk about Him as Being of beings. Knowledge of God is called theology. Ultimately, theology is about God in Himself. Thus, theology is the peak of knowledge and the fullness of gnosis since it was brought about under the guidance of the Spirit.So, we could say, God makes knowledge possible for human beings and God is really the Possibler of knowledge and aknowledge of Himself.",

We look for the self, we reflect, and we find no thing, nothing that is the bearer of properties, and we try to conjure it up in the concept of a soul or mental thing [Descartes 1968], or a bundle of discrete perceptions [Hume 1739]. But we are looking in the wrong direction and must reorientate ourselves. Self-consciousness requires the existence of a perceiving and conceiving being that acts and interacts with other objects and organisms in, what must at least appear to be, an objective world. It requires embodiment and embeddedness within its world; it is ’fallen’ [Heidegger 1962], necessarily adaptable, necessarily technological, extending itself through the use of tools, restoring lost functions and replacing lost organs and limbs. But also enhancing and reconfiguring itself, augmenting its capabilities and pushing itself further into its world and away from the first place we look. The self is not the body. The self is not the mind. The self is active agency within the world; it is prosthesis.",

      "abstract": "The evil eye is a widespread belief in the world, and is thought to be associated with a human propensity towards envy. The objects of envy in primitive cultures are mainly crops, food, livestock, children, and good health. In evil eye cultures people tend to keep a watchful eye on one another. The evil eye takes into account the ability of an onlooker to project psychic energy through the eyes. The evil eye causes the victim to be helpless-dominated, gripped by an overpowering occult power. Often infliction of the evil eye is unintentional and unconscious; it occurs during a moment of coveting something belonging to another. Evil eye cultures are those in which people regard goods to be limited, so that if one person possesses more than others, it is thought to have been obtained at everyone else’s expense. People in these cultures are wary of compliments, as these can be disguised expressions of envy, and hence occasions for infliction of the evil eye. In many cultures where there is scarcity of food, people will conceal food or try and conceal a prosperous harvest from the gaze of others so as to avoid the problem of envy. Envy is widespread in modern society, but is almost a taboo topic, and one will rarely admit to it. Throughout the world people use talismans, charms, religious symbols and other devices to ward off the evil eye-wearing them, putting them on doorposts, on automobile rearview mirrors. In some cultures there is a high incidence of paranoia-with people fearing that others might poison them, for instance, or that malice is the source of every ailment or misfortune; in Western cultures paranoia takes expression in conspiracy theories and the belief that semi-secret groups control the economy of the world.",

The first approach takes inspiration from human processes of personality attribution, whereby humans deploy knowledge about personality to attribute traits to other people, even those they never met before and even on the basis of very short sequences (down to a few seconds) of expressive behavior (so-called thin slices). The human attribution process can be described by means of Brunswick's lens model, as modified by Scherer. In this model, personality traits are externalized or made manifest in behavior by means of objectively measurable variables called distal cues, which the perceiver represents him/ herself as subjective/proximal percepts; the latter are then subjected to inferential processes leading to attribution. For instance, a distal cue (an externalization) of the extraversion trait can be the voice pitch, which the observer represents as loudness (the proximal percept) that he/she uses in the course of the inferential process.",

In the development of the Child the actualization of OKness depends upon the child being treated as if she is OK. Out of that experience she develops the basis for all subsequent OKness. Each stage in the development of the Child has a central existential issue that must be resolved for the establishment of OKness to take place. In C1 the infant in his helplessness requires the Protection to be. In A1 the Little Professor in her curiosity and new-found autonomy requires the Permission to be herself. In P1 the child begins to wonder who and what kind of person he is going to be according to who and what his models are. The existential issue at this stage is therefore to gain the Potency to be able. Whether the child experiences enough OKness to express herself functionally in an OK manner depends on the relationship of a sense of being OK (Natural Child) to the emerging capacity for doing OK (Adapted Child). If being OK is not established OKness can never be obtained by trying to do OK as occurs in driver behavior.",

The jolt and surprise of romantic love, its physicality and yet its transporting otherworldliness, its radical unselfing, are signs and metaphors for meaning in life. Between extreme responses of the monk and the addict is what might be called a heroic take. Romantic love goes right when we gratefully allow it to manifest itself in our calling, our insight, and our sharing and service.",

      "title": "Lost in the Socially Extended Mind",
      "abstract": "Much of the characteristic symptomatology of schizophrenia can be understood as resulting from a pervasive sense of disembodiment. The body is experienced as an external machine that needs to be controlled with explicit intentional commands, which in turn leads to severe difficulties in interacting with the world in a fluid and intuitive manner. In consequence, there is a characteristic dissociality: others become problems to be solved by intellectual effort and no longer present opportunities for spontaneous interpersonal alignment. This leads to a loss of the socially extended mind, which normally affords opportunities for co-regulation of cognitive and affective processes. However, at times people with schizophrenia report that they experience the opposite of dissociality, namely, an unusual fluidity of the self-other boundary as expressed in experiences of ambiguous body boundaries, intrusions, and even merging with others. Here, the person has not lost access to the socially extended mind but has instead become lost in it, possibly due to a weakened sense of self. We argue that this neglected aspect of schizophrenic social dysfunction can be usefully approached via the concept of genuine intersubjectivity: we normally participate in a shared experience with another person by implicitly co-regulating how our interaction unfolds. This integrates our respective experiences' dynamical bases and gives the interaction an ambiguous second-person character. The upshot is that reports of abnormal self-other fluidity are not indicative of hallucinations without any basis in reality, but of a heightened sensitivity and vulnerability to processes of interpersonal alignment and mutual incorporation that form the normal basis of social life. We conclude by discussing implications of this view for both the science of consciousness as well as approaches to intervention and therapy.",

      "title": "Excellence as Completion in Aristotle's Physics and Metaphysics",
      "abstract": "ARISTOTLE TWICE STATES, as a general truth, that being is better than nonbeing. (1) Throughout his works, moreover, goodness of beings frequently depends on their completeness. This is not surprising, given prominence of complete in Aristotelian ethics, where the best appears to be something and in particular the human good is activity of soul according to excellence; and if there are several excellences, according to best and most complete; and further, in a complete life. (2) Now crucial term in this last statement is activity, not for both inside and outside his ethics Aristotle associates good with being in primary sense of activity ([TEXT NOT REPRODUCIBLE IN ASCII]) or fulfillment [TEXT NOT REPRODUCIBLE IN ASCII]. (3) Yet he seems to think that frequently, genera] concepts of potency and act are neither necessary nor particularly appropriate for ethics or for natural science. As highly general terms of art, they tend to obscure specific contours of subject at hand. The complete ([TEXT NOT REPRODUCIBLE IN ASCII]) has a similar generality and flexibility--indeed, it is closely related to Aristotle's [TEXT NOT REPRODUCIBLE IN ASCII]--but even in translation it is somewhat less opaque. An ordinary, unpretentious notion, it can be applied helpfully to a variety of subjects without calling attention to itself. It is one of three central concepts--the determinate, complete, and self-sufficient--in terms of which he explores goodness of things that are. (4) Whether we wish to understand Aristotle's ethics, therefore, or to explore idea of good that animates his accounts of nature or of being as such, we may wish to have a synoptic view of what he means by complete, and of what sorts of things qualify as complete and why. This would require: (1) surveying completeness attained by natural substances--especially but not only living substances--in normal course of their coming to be; (2) examining contention that certain kinds of animal, and most likely of natural substance more generally, are more complete than others; (3) exploring his description of virtue or excellence as a completion; (4) investigating claim that certain excellences are more complete than others; (5) understanding completeness and incompleteness of various activities and motions. (5) Among these various tasks, third has advantage that it can be approached through study of two key texts: chapter on complete in Metaphysics 5, Aristotle's philosophical lexicon, and a discussion of ontology of excellence in Physics 7. In these texts Aristotle explores conceptual and ontological issues germane to a general concept of excellence; in both cases, key premise is that excellence is best thought of as a completion. (6) His development of this claim draws on two larger themes. In Metaphysics 5, concept of excellence as a completion belongs to a broad conceptual realm--explored in chapters 16-17 and 25-27--in which intelligible realities are presented metaphorically in terms of shape and size. Within this realm, excellence grows toward a limit set by powers that make a substance what it is. (7) In Physics, excellence belongs to a world structured by contraries and therefore also by coming to be and destruction. What it completes is a substance's power to negotiate such a world while maintaining and developing its own identity. (8) Having grown to full stature through its proper excellence, substance can keep itself from being affected or altered in ways that would undermine its being; in so doing, it approximates self-sufficient impassivity that Aristotle attributes to thought ([TEXT NOT REPRODUCIBLE IN ASCII]). The themes of alteration and identity are also pursued in On Soul 2.5, which provides an important complement to Physics 7.3. That excellences of body and certain excellences of soul merely imitate a kind of being that [TEXT NOT REPRODUCIBLE IN ASCII] exemplifies--namely, self-sufficient freedom from conditions of bodily existence, and so also from alteration and from change in general--suggests that there will be an asymmetry between excellence of soul's thinking part and other sorts of excellence. …",

      "title": "Duty",
      "abstract": "To have a duty is, above all, to be subject to a binding, normative requirement. This means that unless there are exculpating reasons someone who has a duty is required to satisfy it, and can be justifiably criticized for not doing so. Having a duty to do something is like having been given a command by someone who has a right to be obeyed: it must be done. Sometimes we speak as if we have duties to individuals (such as persons and institutions). So, for example, if Jones makes a promise to Smith, then Jones has a duty to Smith to keep the promise. We also talk as if we have duties to perform, or to refrain from performing, types of actions, for instance, a duty to help those in need. Even if the performance of such a duty involves treating an individual in a certain way, the duty may not be to that individual. For example, a duty to be charitable might not be a duty to anyone, not even the recipient of the charity. An important feature of duties is that they provide some justifying reason for action. If we explain why we did something by saying that it was our duty, we are offering a justification for the action. Such a justifying reason does not depend on the entire nature of the action. For example, if we make a promise, we have some justifying reason for keeping it, regardless of what was promised, or to whom the promise was made. Again it is like a command. If we are given a command by someone with a right to be obeyed, we have some justification for obeying it, no matter what we are commanded to do. On some views, however, the justifying reason we have for doing something because it is required by duty may not be decisive: we may have an even better reason for doing something else. None the less, that something is required by duty provides some justifying reason for doing it. Talk about duties is found in many areas; we speak, for example, of legal duties, moral duties, professional duties, the duties of a scholar and, even, matrimonial duties. This discussion will focus on moral duty, but may have wider application.",

The source of these feelings lies not only in external influences, but also in a man's own thoughts, experiences, level of education and culture, as well as the degree of development of their own volitional and emotional capacities, in which muscle movements are merely just a simple mechanical means of rendering. The entire array of facial expressions acts as a unitary system which does nothing but complete the movements of the conductor's hands, filling them with meaning. We can say that this type of communication represents a way of combining the most delicate, vibrant, profound, and subtle feelings. It would be impossible to imagine that the movement of the arms, unsupported by the expression of the eyes and face or by the position of the body, were able to express a large array of emotions (joy, pain, sadness, rage, fear, surprise, or confidence) accurately and unequivocally.

      "title": "The representation of self through the dialogic properties of talk and conduct",
      "abstract": "It is a basic dialogical principle that the meaning of what is said or done is based on its similarities and especially its differences with other things that might have been said or done as relevantly instead, just then, just there. This makes what was actually said or done meaningful as a “choice” for all practical purposes, whether the actor made it consciously or not. And any choice a person makes (or is deemed to make) is revealing about what he or she had in mind — his or her intentions and wants, values and affects, character and qualities as a social being — that subjectively warranted producing what was said or done instead of one of the alternatives. What one’s talk and conduct reveal about what one had in mind constitutes a representation of one’s self as a social being. This representation is a persona, a “face” in Goffman’s sense. This representation is discursively, dialogically produced, such that actors’ talk and conduct will unavoidably produce a representation of themselves regardless of whether they intend it. Accordingly, persons who would not be expected to have such competence nonetheless produce representations of self, for example young children or impaired adults. Insofar as those representations are in the person’s self-interest, there is a warrant for considering that they have that competence after all. In contrast, persons who can be expected to have such competence may nonetheless produce representations that work against their self-interest by accident or deficiencies of performance. Arguably, it is an additional dimension of the representation of self that an actor produces, having to do with his or her competence, whether the representation seems to be intentional, and beyond that, artful or clever. I examine two cases to elaborate on the key propositions here: (a) that representations of self are produced whether intended or not, (b) that ones that seem to be intended because they are in the actor’s self-interest are evidence of his or her competence, and (c) that ones that seem unintentional because they are not in the actor’s self-interest are evidence of a performance lapse, or more broadly, deficiencies of competence. The first case is of two young children whose talk and conduct interactively produce representations of self that do serve their respective interests, and thus warrant reconsideration of the expressive and interactional competence of children of that age. The second is of a doctor in an urban clinic whose representation of self is not in his self-interest.",

      "title": "On the Semantics of a Glance at a Scene",
      "abstract": "This chapter is concerned with the perception and comprehension of real-world scenes. Comprehension requires not only that the creatures and objects comprising the scene be identified but also that the relations among these entities be specified. No more than five classes of relations may be needed to characterize the difference in organization between a well-formed scene and an array of unrelated objects. The first two, support and interposition, reflect the general physical constraints—that most objects do not float in air and that an opaque object will occlude the contours of an object behind it. The third, probability, refers to the likelihood of a given object (e.g., a bassinet) being in a given scene (e.g., a service station). Fourth, objects that are likely to occur in a given scene (e.g., a gas pump in a service station) often occupy specific positions (e.g., not on a car). Fifth is the familiar size of objects. Thus, cups are not bigger than stoves. Although support and interposition can be specified without knowing what the object is, the other relations require access to the referential meaning or semantics of the object and its context.\n A schema of a scene is taken to be the overall internal representation of the scene that integrates the scene’s entities and relations and allows access to semantic information. Effects attributable to the semantic relations are taken as an operational definition of schema activation. Several accounts of perception hold that a schema is activated only after the physical relations are specified and the objects identified. Seven experiments exploring this issue are described. The experimental technique employed stimuli in which an object in a scene was displaced to another part of the scene or put in another scene so as to violate 214one to three of the five relations. Such objects appear to be floating, passing through the background unlikely to be in the scene, unlikely to be in a given position in the scene, or too large or too small for the scene. The experiments measured the effects of these violations on the speed and accuracy of (1) detecting an object undergoing a violation, or (2) detecting the presence of the violation itself.\n Contrary to the physical-then-semantic-relations view of scene perception, the results indicate that semantic relations are accessed at least as fast as physical relations—fast enough, in fact, for violations of the semantic relations to affect the perception of objects. Extensive semantic processing of a scene can be readily achieved from a single fixation. It is thus unnecessary to postulate eye-fixation sequences or motion to explain scene perception. Routes to the initial elicitation of a schema through scene-emergent features and the probabilistic relations among objects are discussed. The mechanisms for gaining semantic access to a real-world scene can be triggered so quickly and efficiently that conditions can readily be found in which an expectancy for a scene or familiarity with it are neither necessary nor even helpful toward its perception.",

      "title": "Bonded actions",
      "abstract": "Although all social action is directed at other people, many social actions are initiated by someone who did not perform the action. This form of social action is called bonded action - any action that is not a direct expression of the acting individual's will or decision - anything that someone asks, coerces, or forces another person to say or do. Bonded actions are characterized by the social bonds that hold a relationship together, but the action itself can also be directed at people outside the relationship. That actions are bonded means not only that they are initiated by or together with others within the same relationship; it often means that people are provided with resources to help them perform these actions. People who act on behalf of organizations are transformed into organizational centaurs. Not unlike the mythical centaurs, their individual human features are insufficient to restrain the collective power of which they are a part. Most people are affiliated with several relationships, and they perform different types of bonded actions. In this way, the individual's ability to act is divided, and each piece uses only part of the person's repertoire of actions. Both actions and emotions are divided and exercised as people move from relationship to relationship. The remainder of the chapter is an exploration of the interfaces between bonds and between individuals and their bonds. Some form of casting occurs in most social bonds as a method of creating correspondence between individuals and bonds. The concepts of greedy relationships and emotional labour are also discussed, as is the interface between bonds in such situations as multiple citizenship, whistleblowing, corruption, and match fixing.",

      "title": "Drooping genes v/s dancing genes",
      "abstract": "Exploring avenues for stimulating and harnessing the tremendous self-healing potential of the human genome, is one of the hot spot areas in current research. A prime candidate for illness is a person whose life is devoid of love or of any level of human warmth. Add to this, unresolved or deeply consuming emotional, psychological or spiritual stress along with a disempowering belief system-you have a perfect recipe for creating disease. When a person feels that he or she has no choice in the matters of his or her own life, their emotional response can lead to the development of a disease. The violation of a person's choice, often, is teeming with hostility, fear, anger and rage. 'The Lost Soul Syndrome', when a person is in 'Existential Vacuum', where suffering is accompanied by the absence or loss of meaning in one's life, could be a significant contributor to illness. This is primarily because, a life sans meaning, more often than not, leads to despair, depression and worthlessness. This implies that the physical body is strongly affected when one's state of mind and emotions are full of suffering, stemming from feelings of emptiness.[1] Life is a learning experience. By redirecting our focus, we bring about a new course of events into focus while releasing an existing course of events that may not serve us any longer. Nowhere this is more significant than where our genes are concerned. Of late, geneticists have begun to address the DNA (NOT the Brain) as our Bio-computer. It can be hypothesized that, in order to set the \"bioenergy system\" right, it is vital to access the source of electromagnetic malfunction in our genetic code. To facilitate this, it is essential to employ special sounds and intention.[2] According to Dr. Valerie Hunt, the author of \"Infinite mind: Science of the Human vibrations of consciousness\", the mind actually exists at the dimension of electromagnetic fields, rather than residing in the brain. Natalie Dobrova believes that, an individual's system comprising organs, has its own electromagnetic rhythm. Disruption in this cellular symphony signifies disease.[3] DNA is regarded as the master blue print for our biology. Vedas state that \"In the beginning was Brahman with whom was the WORD\". A parallel for this can be found in The New Testament where John states \"In the beginning was the WORD.\" A reference in Genesis 1:3 reads \"And God said, Let there be light: And there was light.\" All these point to the potential of light (electromagnetic waves) and sound (electromagnetic waves) on DNA and their EXPRESSION.[2] Horowitz, the author of \"DNA: Pirates of the sacred spiral\", states that the research carried out by neurophysiologists has clearly shown the following: \"One-third of the sensory-cortex area of the brain is fully devoted to the oral cavity, tongue, lips and speech.\" This implies that bioacoustic waves (oral frequency emissions- spoken or sung) have tremendous impact over life and vibrating genes which in turn influence total wellness of individuals and probably affect evolution of the species too.[2] Dr. Jeremy Norby, a French anthropologist, conducted detailed studies on Healing techniques of Shamans in the Amazon forests, has also authored the book \"The Cosmic serpent: DNA and the Origins of Knowledge\". He compared DNA or genetic code to books, which can be read, written or REWRITTEN (Reprogrammed). Now comes the important piece of the puzzle – the significance of 'Junk DNA' – parts of the DNA called \"Introns\" which are regarded as noncoding genetic sequences, in contrast to \"Exons\" that have identifiable coding functions in protein building through transcription. It is also interesting to note the presence of \"Jumping DNA\" or \"transposons\" in the supposedly useless 97% of junk DNA.[2] It is proposed that these mysterious junk DNA have some important function since mother Nature never does anything dumb. Horowitz hastens to add that, according to three Nobel laureates in medicine, the primary function of DNA lies not in protein synthesis (less than 3%) but in the reception and transmission of electromagnetic energy (more than 90%) functioning in the realm of bioelectric (light) and bioacoustic (sound) signaling.[2] A Russian research team of geneticists and linguists have scientifically documented the ability of sound and light to heal DNA. The research carried out by Russian scientists Peter Gariaev and Vladimir Poponin, showed that DNA has a special ability to attract photons causing them to slide along the helical molecule of DNA instead of along a linear pathway. This implies that DNA has the amazing capacity to bend or wrap light around itself! Recent studies by Dr. Rao and his team[4] showed that DNA undergoes helical change from normal B-DNA conformation to Z-DNA in Alzheimer's disease and this alters gene orientation and function. Thus DNA helicity alters depending on brain function and stress. Iona Miller and Richard Miller, genetic researchers,[2] conclude that it may be possible to activate DNA through conscious linguistic expressions (sounds-words; intentions-thoughts…forms of electromagnetic energy) to modify the human bioenergy fields, which in turn can affect anatomy and physiology of the human body. Psychologist Ernest Rossi effectively explores the revolutionary implications of newer discoveries in genetics and neuroscience, in the every day life of humans, for health and healing.[5] In his groundbreaking book \"The Psychobiology of Gene Expression\", he examines with fresh eyes, the tremendous application potential of consciously motivated behavior, subjective states of mind and our PERCEPTION of choice and free will in regulating gene expression to optimize health. Neuroscientists Gage and Kemperman[6] opine that a vital component of medical treatment is the regeneration of damaged/dysfunct neural networks. They also believe that conscious regulation of cognitive or environmental stimuli, changes in our physical activities may be part of doctor's prescription in future, besides or substituting drugs. The emerging field of epigenetics[6] has amassed mind boggling evidence to show that consciously chosen positive beliefs, feelings and spiritual practices influence our health by modulating gene expression. When we consciously intervene to send epigenetic signals to our cells, these signals can reduce stress and positively impact the synthesis of life-enhancing hormones such as DHEA and many more. We are now beginning to be aware of and appreciate, as a community, the impact of our thoughts and emotions on our genes. It is now being increasingly recognized that our body is sensitive enough to receive a signal from external environment and turn it into a sequence of electromagnetic or chemical commands for our genes. One such breakthrough experimental finding has been that, without interfering with the mouse's DNA, a small nutritional change in the pregnant mouse could have a dramatic impact on the gene expression of off – spring.[6] Bruce Lipton, author of the best selling book, \"The Biology of Belief\" showed that, the environment operating through the cell membrane, modulated the behavior and physiology of the cell, switching the genes on and off. He firmly believes that our beliefs affect the expression of our genes.[7] Extending Lipton's work, researchers at the Institute of HeartMath in California revealed that human emotions, desires and intentions can bring about measurable molecular changes in the DNA. Rewriting our 'Life Scripts' may have the power to turn on or turn off the eloquence of our genes which will have a huge impact on the quality of our lives per se. By redefining our reality, we can choose to reshape our lives.",

Surrogates can be directly controlled or just given a specific task to carry out on behalf of a human. In the context of a virtual environment, a surrogate is more often referred to as an avatar, reflecting that it is intended to represent the person in some context, rather than just carrying out a specific task on his or her behalf. In essence, an avatar is a manifestation of the human who is \"inhabiting\" it. A person's avatar can look like the inhabiter or look like some other person, or even be a personification of some non-human character Generally, the inhabiter controls all critical actions, verbal and non-verbal, of his or her avatar, although the specific manifestation of the avatar may place constraints on how it carries out some of these desired behaviors.",

      "title": "Resolving \"hopeless\" conflicts",
      "abstract": "Human conflicts to which there are seemingly no earthly solutions, arising when emotions are strongly aroused, or when face-saving necessitates intransigence, are of all-too-frequent occurrence. Schelling (1) has given as an example of a pure bargaining situation the case of two dynamite trucks that meet on a road wide enough for only one to pass. One could imagine that this might quickly develop into anything but a bargaining situation. Suppose that one of the trucking companies has a record of past dominance in such situations, and that the other has finally decided to make a stand. (Such an occurrence is not without parallels in both domestic and international relations. The Western containment policy with respect to the Soviet bloc, for instance, provides numerous similar confrontations.) Or suppose that inherent situational symmetry (Why should he have more right to pass than I?), pride, stubbornness, or other emotional involvement of the participants, brings about a genuine impasse. Each antagonist in this example has an interest in expeditious, non-violent resolution of the conflict. There are also innocent bystanders with a similar interest, who wish to see the road cleared and explosion damage to their property avoided. The presence of comparatively disinterested third parties is characteristic of almost any dispute. Their objective is to achieve resolution of the conflict on any reasonable terms, without particular preference over a wide range of possible settlement outcomes. In the case in hand, an offer of compulsory arbitration by some bystander may well be rejected, because neither trucker can be sure of the absence of hidden bias on the part of the volunteer arbitrator. If, however, someone offers to flip a coin, it is clear that there now exists a probably mutually acceptable means for resolving the otherwise hopeless conflict. Moreover, the chance settlement means becomes more, not less, effective as the emotional involvement and irrational commitment of the antagonists increase. This is a crucial point. The chance mechanism is specific for resolving the type of conflict in which conventional bargaining has had its opportunity and has failed. Let us expand this theme and see how it might be institutionalized for the resolution of a wider class of hopeless conflicts. Several broad requirements must be met. First, an acceptable conflict-resolving mechanism, whatever its precise nature, must provide no motivation to the principals to convert a bargaining conflict into a hopeless one. Judicious introduction of randomness into the settlement mechanism would seem to satisfy this requirement by offering the protagonists every inducement to let reason prevail before chance had to be invoked. Secondly, it may be desirable or even necessary to invest settlement proceedings with a formalized (legal, ethical, etc.) structure.",

When people have a self-deception, they use their hopes, needs, desires, theory, ideology, prejudices, expectations, memories, and other psychological elements to construct the way they see the world. Furthermore, as humans sample information from their environment they tend to sample more heavily the positive rather than the negative elements and the elements that are consistent with their ideology, theory, or religion rather than the elements that are inconsistent. Self-deceptions are usually individual, but when they are widely shared in a culture they are cultural. For example, humans in most cultures believed that spirits and supernatural beings make the world work. However, after around 585 bce (see Religion) some humans began to believe that the way the world works can be explained by natural factors—that is, by astronomy or physics. In another example, in many cultures most people believe that their culture is the best in the world; in fact the name they use for their own culture is often the same word used for “humans.” In short, whoever is not “us” is not human.",

First, in the context of what may be called problems facing a society, prevention always refers to a class of behaviors or actortypes or conditions or things, not just to one unit or item. It is a mass, not an individual phenomenon. Second, prevention refers to such a category only as that category is seriously believed to be a continuing phenomenon, one that will almost certainly persist or recur unless rather striking change intervenes, change which is not expected unless someone does something about it. Third, to be viewed seriously, to have any chance of being worked for with intensity and continuity, prevention needs to be directed against a class of continuing or recurring phenomena which can reasonably be interpreted by a good many people to be extensive, costly and painful. This interpretation cannot merely be applied on a now and then basis or as a sometimes tolerable, if not acceptable, occurrence. Nor can it be widely viewed as an unfortunate failure to achieve some ideal; such an attitude would render the chances of prevention almost nil. An element of intolerability is requisite.",

      "title": "The Development of Anthropomorphism in Interaction: Intersubjectivity, Imagination, and Theory of Mind",
      "abstract": "Human beings frequently attribute anthropomorphic features, motivations and behaviors to animals, artifacts, and natural phenomena. Historically, many interpretations of this attitude have been provided within different disciplines. What most interpretations have in common is distinguishing children's manifestations of this attitude, which are considered \"natural\", from adults' occurrences, which must be explained by resorting to particular circumstances. In this article, I argue that anthropomorphism is not grounded in specific belief systems but rather in interaction. In interaction, a nonhuman entity assumes a place that generally is attributed to a human interlocutor, which means that it is independent of the beliefs that people may have about the nature and features of the entities that are anthropomorphized. This perspective allows us to explain the problems that emerge if we consider anthropomorphism as a belief: (i) adults under certain circumstances may anthropomorphize entities even if they perfectly know that these entities have no mental life; (ii) according to the situation, the same entity may be anthropomorphized or treated as an object; (iii) there is no consistency among the entities that are anthropomorphized; (iv) there is individual variability in anthropomorphization, and this variability derives from affective states rather than from different degrees of knowledge about the entity that is anthropomorphized or greater or lesser naivety of the person who anthropomorphizes. From this perspective, anthropomorphism is a basic human attitude that begins in infants and persists throughout life. The difference between adults and children is not qualitative but rather a matter of complexity.",

The combination of the qualities 3, 4, and 5 are, as it were, man's accessories in his struggle for existence, and can be used to serve his aggressive needs. - Every cultural development leads in the course of generations to an increase of intellectual awareness, because an increasing share of indispensable knowledge must be passed on verbally. At the same time the importance of direct, practical first-hand experience and imitative learning declines. Especially for those men whose occupations primarily involve theoretical activities a discordance arises between the world of their imaginations and consciously-controlled ways of thought and behaviour on the one hand, and their endothymic impulses, moods and feelings (which mostly originate from the innate predisposition for gregarious life) on the other. If rationalistic processes predominate in shaping forms of social interaction, man will have to manipulate the behaviour of his fellow-men as well as his own mental capacities for emotional distancing, disregarding or even violating the incalculable \"endothymic\" part of his being.

For instance, the US Military Defense Science Board provides the following definition: 'Autonomy is a capability (or a set of capabilities) that enables a particular action of a system to be automatic or, within programmed boundaries, \"self-governing.\"' In a similar spirit, George A. Bekey describes autonomy as 'the capacity to operate in the real-world environment without any form of external control, once the machine is activated, and at least in some areas of operation, for extended periods of time.' According to both definitions, autonomy consists in the capacity for 'sustained independent action'. Thus, a system is autonomous to the extent that it can accomplish a task by itself, without external directions. Once the system starts its activity, there is no need for other human or artificial agents to monitor its behaviour and govern its functioning.",

It argues that we cannot subdivide autistic people based on criteria of functioning alone to draw ethical conclusions. Instead, philosophers and ethicists must re-examen their intuitions regarding concepts of autonomy and what it means to lead a good life. We may define autism, in all its forms, perhaps in analogy with Elizabeth Barnes’ minority body, as a minority brain. In this way, we do not have to deny that some autistic people suffer from some aspects related to autism. Nevertheless, we also acknowledge that this does not necessarily have to be so. Simultaneously, a poststructuralist approach such as ‘Reading Rosie’ demonstrates that people with specific disabilities can always ‘be read’ in different ways, in various stories that can be juxtaposed but do not have to annihilate one another. In short, we can learn from disability studies that we must take first-person perspectives seriously and shy away from quick assumptions about well-being and happiness based on broad categories such as intelligence or autism.",

These are patients who are preoccupied with maintaining proper physical distance from their objects, in order to regulate anxieties about isolation on the one hand, and identity-annihilating closeness on the other. Since they believe the activity of looking to be intrusive and devouring, hence dangerous, transparent screens are interposed between self and other, and serve as protective barriers. These screens function intrapsychically as well, to split off or hide those aspects of the self felt to be unacceptable. The analyst may witness the failure of the screen in several ways: it may create too great a distance, isolating the individual and keeping him from life; it may become contaminated by projections and turn into a persecutor, or trap the individual, a state of intolerable claustrophobia; most dramatically, it may suddenly shatter. The latter is associated with psychosis and death, and its appearance may be a harbinger of suicide.",

Not necessarily, as we shall see, an improvement on normal species functioning or species typical functioning, nor are enhancements justifled, as many seem to believe, primarily in terms of their contribution to equal opportunities. There is a continuum between harms and benefits such that the reasons we have to avoid harming others or creating others who will be born in a harmed state are continuous with the reasons we have for conferring benefits on others if we can.",

      "abstract": "Getting Acquainted with the Territory What an individual experiences depends upon which specialized structures in his nervous system are stimulated. Note the paper on which this is written. In what ways can an observer have relationships with it? He can see it, touch it, smell it, taste it, lift it, tear it, etc. Each sort of response provides one avenue of acquaintance, because the receptors (the eyes, nostrils, skin, etc.) are so differentiated that each is sensitive only to particular stimuli. wave lengths of radiations which affect the rods and cones in the retina of the eye do not also affect the nerve endings, membranes, and canals in the ear. Each nervous receptor will thus be excited by some stimuli from the paper. And since none is all-engaging, it follows that our acquaintance with the paper through any one nervous means will be specific and partial. Second, variations in sensitivity in the specialized nervous receptors in different observers will make for differences in the reports of their experiences. Deafness, color blindness, near- and far-sightedness, fatigue, adaptation, reaction time, etc., influence both the kind and the quantity of impressions, thus making acquaintance with anything personal and individual. Third, the character of an individual's habits and interests affects the working of the nervous mechanisms so that his responses to stimuli are individualized. Objects viewed by several persons may thus give rise to widely varying evaluations. How different the reactions of a hungry baby, a dairyman, a bacteriologist to a bottle of milk. 'Milk,' Barry-more looked horrified. 'I tried the stuff once,' he said shuddering, 'but the stuff turned to chamois in my stomach!' The fool sees not the same tree that a wise sees, said William Blake. Fourth, what is experienced varies with the position of the observer. Where you are determines what you see. It makes a difference whether your seat at the opera is in the orchestra or in the top gallery on the side; whether you study New York City from the tower of the Empire State Building or the lush surroundings of an exclusive night club; whether you are in a bomb shelter or near a radio getting the news summary of an air raid. In the foreground of a famous Holbein painting one can see an oblong yellow patch, but from one particular position the patch looks like the top of a skull. notion of perspective thus further emphasizes the partial character of experience. William James in Will To Believe said, There is no possible point of view from which the world can appear as an absolutely single fact. And when different observers are located in different places, it should not be surprising if they get different impressions and so make different maps. Fifth, the fact that human reactions occur in makes impossible our acquaintance with any object from all sides at once. At best, human study can proceed only serially, i.e., viewing the various aspects in turn. Details must be missed as observation goes on. A blade of grass as well as a three-ring circus defies coverage at any instant. But even if there were time to use the full resources of the nervous system, our acquaintance would still be partial, for microscopes and atom-smashing chambers would reveal new details. And special investigators, chemists, physicists, technicians, etc., could extend the areas of observation indefinitely, so that the process of becoming acquainted with anything must ever remain incomplete. In the words of George Santayana, most exhaustive account which human science can ever give of anything does not cover all that is true about it. All the external relations and affinities of anything are truths relevant to it; but they radiate in space and time to infinity, or at least to the unknown limits of the world... before we could know all about [the flower in the crannied wall] we should have to explore for ourselves the whole universe in which it grows. …",

      "title": "The Teleological Significance Of Dreaming In Aristotle",
      "abstract": "Abstract In his discussions of dreaming in the Parva Naturalia, Aristotle neither claims nor denies that dreams serve a natural purpose. Modern scholarship generally interprets dreaming as useless and teleologically irrelevant for him. This paper argues that Aristotle's teleology permits certain types of dream to have a natural role in end-directed processes. Dreams are left-overs from waking experience, but they may, like certain bodily residues, be used by nature, which does ‘nothing in vain’ and makes use of available resources, for the benefit of the beings in which they occur. Contrary to prevalent opinions, Aristotle does not assimilate dreams to sensory illusions and does not hold that they have no interaction with our reasoning capacity. Dreams constitute a special class of the products of phantasia, but this does not prevent them from functioning like other (waking) phantasmata. In Aristotle's view, dreams regularly generate 'natural signs' of diseases and cause waking actions. This preparatory power of dreams, often dismissed or attributed to divine intervention in antiquity, is captured within Aristotle’s natural philosophy, and provides evidence that (some) dreams are (or should be) regarded by him as having a teleological significance.",

      "title": "Virtue and Circumstances: On the City-State Concept of Arete",
      "abstract": "Virtue and Circumstances:On the City-State Concept of Arete Margalit Finkelberg In his discussion of virtue (arete) in books 1 and 10 of the Nicomachean Ethics, Aristotle makes the famous claim that \"it is impossible, or not easy, to do noble acts without the proper equipment ()\" (Eth. Nic. 1.8 1099a32-33). This is why arete would need what he calls \"the external goods\" () in order to be actualized: The liberal man will need money for the doing of his liberal deeds, and the just man too will need it for the returning of services (for wishes are hard to discern, and even people who are not just pretend to wish to act justly); and the brave man will need power if he is to accomplish any of the acts that correspond to his arete, and the temperate man will need opportunity; for how else is either he or any of the others to be recognized? It is debated, too, whether the will or the deed is more essential to arete, which is assumed to involve both; it is surely clear that its perfection involves both; but for deeds many things are needed, and more, the greater and nobler the deeds are.1 Since arete is essential for achieving the state of happiness (eudaimonia), in the last analysis happiness too would depend on the circumstances of one's life. Aristotle's conditioning of arete on external circumstances had been sharply criticized already in antiquity, mainly by the Stoics. Not a few present-day historians of philosophy also tend to see his approach as unsatisfactory, in that it relies on commonsense intuitions that would not withstand a proper philosophical examination. Compare, for example, Julia Annas's criticism of Aristotle's conception of happiness (eudaimonia), which is intimately connected with his conception of arete: Unreflectively, we associate happiness with success and with actual possession of affluence, worldly goods and success. But the account of happiness [End Page 35] which an ethical theory has to produce must satisfy people who have reflected on virtue and what its significance is in our lives. And to those who do this, it seems clear that worldly success is not the point at all, that what matters is being virtuous, being a moral person as we nowadays say, and that if this is what matters, one has all one needs for happiness even if one loses all the worldly goods.\"2 Accordingly, the Stoic attitude to virtue would contrast favorably with that of Aristotle. According to the alternative view, as represented by Martha Nussbaum and Bernard Williams, Aristotle in his conditioning of both virtue and happiness on external circumstances does not avoid facing harsh realities of life—the same realities, it must be added, that later attitudes to virtue tended to ignore. Thus, according to Nussbaum, \"every Aristotelian philosophical inquiry is conducted within the world of human experience and belief, limited by the limits of that world\" (Nussbaum 1986, 318). Likewise, in commenting on the substantial honesty of the attitude to slavery displayed by Aristotle and the Greeks in general, as compared to the view of Seneca and \"its various Christian relatives,\" Williams writes: \"Seneca and his various associates can let the social world be unjust, because they can, in accordance with one or another of their fantasies, suppose that one can get out of it. Aristotle knew that one could never get out of it\" (Williams 1993, 116). It should not be forgotten, however, that, whatever the universal applications of Aristotle's discussion of virtue may be, this discussion originally addressed Greek society of the fourth century B.C. In what follows, I argue that to understand Aristotle's reasons for treating arete as conditioned on external circumstances, we have to consider his conception against the concrete historical background of this society. Arete in and Out of Use The usual rendering of the Greek arete as \"virtue\" would be misleading here, in that it would irreparably distort the sense of the original. This was the opinion of H. D. F. Kitto, for example, who wrote on this \"typically Greek word,\" as he called it, as follows: \"When we meet it in Plato we translate it...",

      "title": "The Neurobiology of Love.",
      "abstract": "Love is a complex neurobiological phenomenon, relying on trust, belief, pleasure and reward activities within the brain, i.e., limbic processes. These processes critically involve oxytocin, vasopressin, dopamine, and serotonergic signaling. Moreover, endorphin and endogenous morphinergic mechanisms, coupled to nitric oxide autoregulatory pathways, play a role. Naturally rewarding or pleasurable activities are necessary for survival and appetitive motivation, usually governing beneficial biological behaviors like eating, sex, and reproduction. Yet, a broad basis of common signaling and beneficial neurobiological features exists with connection to the love concept, thereby combining physiological aspects related to maternal, romantic or sexual love and attachment with other healthy activities or neurobiological states. Medical practice can make use of this concept, i.e., mind/body or integrative medicine. Thus, love, pleasure, and lust have a stress-reducing and health-promoting potential, since they carry the ability to heal or facilitate beneficial motivation and behavior. In addition, love and pleasure ensure the survival of individuals and their species. After all, love is a joyful and useful activity that encompasses wellness and feelings of well-being.",

Foot considers the different ways happiness is predicated of human beings, distinguishing happiness as humanity's good from enjoyment and contentment. She argues that the common view that happiness is a state of mind, detachable from beliefs about special objects, is in error because happiness does not have the same logical grammar as words like excitement or pleasure. Foot concludes that happiness is a protean concept, appearing in many different forms; however, happiness may be thought of as humanity's good in such a way that combining happiness with wickedness is ruled out a priori. This understanding of happiness as humanity's good is close to Aristotle's eudaimonia, insofar as it means operation in conformity with the virtues; as Foot understands the term, happiness is the enjoyment of good things, meaning the pursuit and attainment of right ends.",

      "abstract": "The autobiographical process involves not just reporting on past events, reconstructing one’s life history, but replaying events in different voices and modes. It may be that the autobiographer is motivated by the desire to impose one version of her or his life and to scotch the others. Even then, however, other versions, the ones under erasure, often show through the fabric – the fabrication – and we detect their traces in the turns of the rhetoric. Thus, in autobiography, the real agenda is often underneath, either because a less official motive lurks behind the manifest ones or because what really drives the project of selfscrutiny is something only progressively revealed in the process of writing. This issue takes into consideration the structuring implications of turning points in the account of a life and the roles of the converse forces of forgetting and subjective destabilisation. There are two ways of looking at turning points: either as causative agents of order and coherence or as metaphors – as provisional, semi-fictional, forensic, cognitive instruments. In the latter case, they belong to an active, performative, conjectural, self-revising process, and they complement a version of autobiographical memory that involves a constant interplay of remembering and forgetting.",

Sometimes we see the psychotic living symbiotically, we feel him to be very close to us, he tells us: \"I am the moon, the sun, the universe. I am you\". At other times the patient is in his separate self but, as he is split off from the symbiotic self, his separation is extreme, it is autistic solitude: \"nothing exists apart from me: the sun, the moon, the universe, are meaningless shadows which I cannot distinguish …, you are light-years away from me … you are not there\".

      "title": "The First Gram of Jouissance: Lacan on Genet’s Le balcon",
      "abstract": "The First Gram of JouissanceLacan on Genet’s Le balcon Lorenzo Chiesa 1 Lacan introduces jouissance relatively late in his work. The term still appears only sporadically in the 1950s, where it can hardly be said to constitute an original concept. For instance, in the first two Seminars and “Function and Field,” jouissance is firmly rooted in the Hegelian, or better Kojèvian, dialectic of master and slave: put very simply, it is what the other is supposed to enjoy. We come into being through the other and are thus alienated or lacking subjects; we identify with the other and want to be in the place of his supposed enjoyment. The essence of our ego is nothing but frustration. Were we to fully reduce ourselves to the place of the other, we could not anyway be satisfied with it, since “it would still be the other’s jouissance that [we] would have gotten recognized there” (Lacan, “Function and Field” 208). 2 Jouissance features prominently in Seminar VII (1959–60). Here, it acquires several meanings, which are not fully developed into a circumscribed and consistent concept. Let us try to summarize Lacan’s main arguments. First, jouissance can only be inscribed within the Law. Or better, jouissance is given exclusively as the jouissance of transgressing the Law. If we try to have it done with the Law altogether in the name of an “uninhibited jouissance” (The Ethics of Psychoanalysis 177), jouissance is not in the least strengthened. On the other hand, it is unexpectedly the Law itself that can be regarded as the “site of some irregularity” (The Ethics of Psychoanalysis 176): interdictions grow exponentially all the more we subject ourselves to the Law. Jouissance thus amounts primarily to the Law’s jouissance. The implementation of the Law is as such transgressive, and our transgressing it presupposes this state of affairs. Second, jouissance is an evil, even the Evil tout-court, in that my jouissance inevitably entails my neighbour’s suffering. This point was already evident in the dialectic of master and slave, and is now reiterated: jouissance is what the other is supposed to enjoy (“this register of a jouissance as that which is only accessible to [End Page 6] the other” [The Ethics of Psychoanalysis 237]), whereby I will aim at replacing him, obliterating him at any cost. Jouissance therefore goes together with a suspension of the pleasure principle as a reciprocal “unpleasure principle” or “least-suffering principle” (The Ethics of Psychoanalysis 185). Moreover, given that the evil I desire is also reflexively what is desired by my neighbour, independently of the outcome of our confrontation, jouissance can only be painful for both, or at best painful pleasure. My cruelty becomes undistinguishable from that of my neighbour. Lacan however fails here to conclude that, following on his previous claims, this whole libidinal economy is given only within the limits of the Law; if jouissance is invariably inscribed within the Law, and jouissance is evil, such evil will correspond to the subject’s transgression of the Law as contained by the Law, and as in the end based on the Law’s own intrinsic Evil. It is thus unclear how he can then maintain that jouissance—initially presented to the subject as his Sovereign Good, yet soon experienced by him as suffering and evil—amounts to something unbearable we “cannot stand” (The Ethics of Psychoanalysis 73). This in fact contradictorily seems to locate it in an extra-legal domain of enhanced feelings, which, according to Lacan’s overall teaching, were never given to begin with, and can only be fantasised. Why would the subject not stand what is merely mythical? 3 We have to wait for two underestimated lectures of 1966 to find a clearer, albeit very concise, definition of jouissance, which certainly draws on Seminar VII, but also limits the proliferation of at times incompatible meanings Lacan discusses there. In a paper given in Baltimore at John Hopkins University, jouissance is unhesitatingly identified with what is experienced in the “sensible phase of the human being,” what he feels in the most basic way between birth and death that covers “the whole spectrum of pain and pleasure” (Lacan, “Of...",

A place is here, surrounded by other, similar places, that are there. Beyond, elsewhere, there is always a hinterland: beyond my world, is the World. One can only imagine the World, but the World can announce itself here, as an aspect or element of what we effectively perceive, such as a view onto a distance or the horizon. A (meaningful) environment acquires, moreover, an aesthetic quality when the successful structuring of the interplay of Place and World suggests an image to the aesthetic view: when the site is recognised as exemplifying the “topos” of a “lovely place,” or a locus amoenus: an enclosed, secret garden (“paradise”), or a “House before the Distant.”",

Our remembered emotions (memories) are usually rosier than our experienced emotions, and people are motivated by their predicted emotions, which tend to coincide with their emotional memories. This Article advocates that law should care more about experiencing selves than remembering selves if and when experiences result in chronic health or stress consequences that either (1) societies care about more than people do (because of externalities, public bads, or public goods) or (2) people also care about, but are unaware of, do not remember, or are unable to act upon (due to self-control problems). This Article analyzes examples of chronic health or stress effects from such experiences as dense and long commutes, unhealthy eating, lack of regular physical exercise, sedentary behavior, and financial/retirement planning.",

The novels are full of: temples, shrines, altars, priests, rituals and offerings, dreams (or oracles), prophecies, divine epiphanies, aretalogies, mystic language and other metaphors of the sacred (not forgetting, in addition, exotic barbarian rites). Indeed, religious elements, such as these, familiar to virtually any inhabitant of the ancient world, are richly attested, of course, in history and archaeology. The topography of any ancient city, for example, would be unrecognisable without its temples and shrines, its statues and votive offerings, its frequent public festivals and processions, and its generally familiar modes of worship. Such is the case in the novels, for all their differences, in which its characters range far and wide in the course of their wanderings and communicate with the sacred in these habitual ways, whether in the cities of Asia Minor (Ephesus, Miletus, Rhodes, Sidon, Byzantium), Egypt (Memphis, Thebes, Alexandria), Greece (Delphi, Corinth), Italy (Syracuse, Rome) or elsewhere.",

This Latin term, however, does not share the assumption of these modern terms that the individual who moves out of a community (the exul) does so involuntarily, and that in more cases than not this departure is required or sanctioned by the community’s authorities or legal system. Ancient Greek terminology also observes different boundaries. The verb φεύγω, ‘I go into exile’, also has the meaning ‘I flee’ and ‘I run away from’, and in both senses the group or individual who φεύγει may do so voluntarily or unwillingly, and the thing or person which prompts evasive or fugitive action need have no legal or authoritative backing. Hence, the ancient Greek discourse on exile cannot be considered in isolation from the similar discourses on other forms of displacement such as fleeing, migrating and engaging (less than willingly) in travel.1",

Fur ther suppose that I was deeply committed to this project, both intellectu ally and emotionally, and found it difficult to imagine life without it; the project was not merely something I chose but something I was—it partly constituted my identity. Under such circumstances, should I be given any special treatment? Specifically, should I be entitled to a greater than normal share of social resources to support my project? On one standard reading of liberalism, I should not be. Insofar as lib eralism is committed to neutrality toward (justice-respecting) concep tions of the good life, my share of resources should not vary with my plan of life and the particular ends and preferences associated with it, as liberal principles of justice properly take no notice of such variations— be they across persons or with respect to a single person across time— but rather focus on the development and exercise of those common moral powers (viz., rationality and reasonableness) that characterize free and equal citizens.1 In brief, I should adjust my plan of life to accord with my just share of social resources, not the other way around.

Evolved behavior, including that of other animals, is not entirely devoid of normativity, however. Defining normativity as adherence to an ideal or standard, there is ample evidence that animals treat their social relationships in this manner. In other words, they pursue social values. Here I review evidence that nonhuman primates actively try to preserve harmony within their social network by, e.g., reconciling after conflict, protesting against unequal divisions, and breaking up fights amongst others. In doing so, they correct deviations from an ideal state. They further show emotional self-control and anticipatory conflict resolution in order to prevent such deviations. Recognition of the goal-orientation and normative character of animal social behavior permits us to partially bridge the is/ought divide erected in relation to human moral behavior.",

The idea of the self comes very naturally to us, and it seems rather important, but it's also extremely puzzling. As for the word 'self' — it's been taken in so many different ways that it seems that you can mean more or less what you like by it and come up with almost any answer. This book approaches the (seeming) problem of the self by starting from the thing that makes it seem there is a problem in the first place: our experience of the self, our experience of having or being a self, a hidden, inner mental presence or locus of consciousness. It argues that we should consider the phenomenology (experience) of the self before we attempt its metaphysics (its existence and nature). And when we have considered what it's like for human beings (assuming we can generalize about ourselves), we need to consider what it might be like for other possible creatures: what's the very least that might count as experience of oneself as a self? This, the book proposes, will give us a good idea of what we ought to be looking for when we go on to ask whether there is such a thing — an idea worth following wherever it leads. This leads the book to conclude that selves, inner subjects of experience, do indeed exist. But they bear little resemblance to traditional conceptions of the self.",

Hence, she asks me for the favor rather than demand it. On the other hand, it seems that my refusal to do her the favor would be rude, inconsiderate, unkind, and morally wrong. This is why we tend to respond positively to favor asking and feel that we have to apologize if we refuse. In this article, I address this puzzle. I claim that refusing to do a favor is morally wrong precisely because a favor has been asked. The requestee needs me, and her very need calls upon me to reveal my goodness. In a sense, this is the strength of her weakness. I claim that acceding to do a favor is a special kind of imperfect obligation in Kant's and Mill's terminologies. As opposed to their descriptions, this obligation is directed toward a definite person at a prescribed time. It turns out that small favors are of the greatest importance for human activity. We all have our needs. We are social animals, and we are depended on others to fulfill our needs. Agreeing to do a favor is one of the building blocks of our shared social endeavor.",

      "title": "Expressivism, Self-Knowledge, and Describing One's Experiences",
      "abstract": "Each of us is normally the best person to ask when it comes to our own feelings and experiences. Speaking about one's own mental states is generally held to carry a special epistemic authority. Moreover, this authority belongs exclusively to the first person; others are not admitted to have a similar claim to know someone's experiences even if they are extremely well-informed and familiar with them. I take these to be facts on first-person authority as they appear in the practice of human life quite universally.Such authority has a central place in social life; denying it can easily (and legitimately?) be taken as an offence. However, it might be that philosophers have historically been overconfident about the special security of our knowledge of our own minds. Carruthers (2011) argues that self-knowledge is interpretive and prone to confabulation. Schwitzgebel (2011; Hurlburt and Schwitzgebel, 2007) claims that we might be regularly wrong about even quite fundamental features of our conscious experience. Therefore it is important to be clear about the nature of first-person authority, and the conditions in which it may be legitimately challenged.In this article, I seek to give a modest account of self-knowledge that still respects the special status of the subject as a knower of her own mental states. I treat commonsensical first-person authority as an explanandum, setting aside accounts that seek to dethrone the notion altogether. I start by presenting two contrasting views about the nature of self-knowledge and the basis of first-person authority. I point out how each of these views, and is unsatisfactory and how expressivism about avowals, an idea inherited from Wittgenstein (1953), can be seen as preferable to them. I owe the tenus detectivism and constitutivism, as well as the main drift of the argument in the first half of this paper, to Finkelstein (2003). Another way to refer to these two contrasting views would be to call them (species of) empiricism and rationalism about selfknowledge, as is done in Gertler (2011). I proceed to present a version of expressivism that incorporates some of the good insights made by detectivism and constitutivism. As explained in the conclusion, I hope my view to be meritorious in respecting commonsensical first-person authority without invoking privileged access, i.e,, an idea of a special epistemic channel that makes self-knowledge unproblematic to come by. I also seek to do justice to the meaning of as a process that has to do with the personal development of one's conception of oneself.DetectivismWhat is it that makes psychological self-ascriptions, or avowals, especially secure?1 One way of answering is to appeal to introspection, combined with some form of privileged access. The idea is simple: people come to know what their own mental states are like because they are the ones who directly feel or perceive those states. We are assumed to have an inner or some naturally evolved capacity that enables us to inwardly monitor our mental states. These are forms of what Finkelstein (2003) calls detectivism: the view that the source of self-knowledge is a perceptual or quasi-perceptual act of detecting that allows us to find out our own mental states.So, one possible explanation for first-person authority is a combination of two ideas: first, there is a special way of detecting one's own mental states; and second, that way of detecting is remarkably reliable. Maybe subjects are not completely infallible about everything that goes on in their conscious experience, but they have such a propensity of being right about those things that it cannot be paralleled by any other person,It is hard to deny that in an obvious sense, the subject of a painful sensation is in a better position to observe that particular pain than anyone else. But it is still far from obvious that this is what grounds the typical way in which firstperson authority is granted to subjects, or if this is a good account of what selfknowledge is, Next, I attempt to illustrate the issue by an example; my chosen example in this paper will be a case of describing a sensation of pain. …",

Aristotelian pity for undeserved misfortune and fear for a man like ourselves do not suffice as the appropriate terms for our response to the vengeance which Atreus wreaks upon his brother Thyestes by killing his children and making him eat them unawares: rather, horror, and a form of terror at the capacities of the human which are revealed to us. But the play is tragic in pushing human nature to the brink, and perhaps beyond: we are forced to attend to the bending of the human beyond what we normally prefer to think of as its limits, beyond its definition: supraque fines moris humani. The external natural world is used as a metaphor for what we would want to call the physiological, or psychological or moral, disturbance of the protagonist.",

From the same philosophical viewpoint, the immanent can refer to the generic realm of being, in contrast to the transcendent, which envisions whatever goes beyond the latter's purview. In the post-Cartesian and Kantian tradition, immanence describes the sphere of conscious subjectivity, unlike transcendence which characterizes those things or aspects of reality that fall outside the self.3 Theologically, God has often been conceived as more or less transcendent to creation, while the belief in his immanent dwelling within the world undergirds all classical versions of pantheism.4",

      "title": "Social Psychology and the Law",
      "abstract": "Virtually every aspect of legal rules and procedures relies on assumptions about human psychology — about how individuals think, feel, and make decisions. Economics focuses on how people behave and interact as economic agents; psychology also focuses on human behavior and interaction, with specific attention to the influence of social and mental processes. Sometimes the law implicitly or explicitly incorporates findings from psychological science. For example, the law of negligence accounts for some of the limitations of human judgment in hindsight (Rachlinski, 1998). Because the hindsight bias is part of folk wisdom, legal rules have responded accordingly, such as in patent law where non- obviousness is determined by reference to secondary considerations like commercial success to “guard against slipping into the use of hindsight” (Rachlinski, 1998). But sometimes folk wisdom misunderstands human behavior and decision- making processes. Thus, for example, most people deem it unthinkable that an innocent person would confess to a crime she did not commit, in the absence of physical torture. And when folk wisdom misses the mark, it is more likely that judges, legislators, and other legal actors will fail to account for what psychological science might tell us about the human behavior in question. As one pioneer of the field of law and psychology observed over a century ago, “[Jurists] go on thinking that their legal instinct and their common sense supplies them with all that is needed” (Münsterberg, 1908). This chapter examines some of the implicit psychological assumptions about human behavior embedded in legal rules and practices. We narrow our focus specifically to social psychology, which we define as the scientific study of the ways in which individuals’ thoughts, feelings, and behaviors are influenced by the real, implied, or imagined presence of others (Allport, 1924).",

And do people actually have stable traits, like intelligence, fear, anxiety, and temperament? This text takes on the assumptions behind these questions, in an attempt to prove them mistaken. Scientists, as well as lay people, tend to think of abstract processes - like intelligence or fear - as measurable entities, of which someone might have more or less. This approach, in Kagan's analysis, shows a blindness to the power of context and to the great variability within any individual, subject to different emotions and circumstances. Infant determinism is another widespread and dearly held conviction that Kagan contests. This theory - with its claim that early relationships determine lifelong patterns - underestimates human resiliency and adaptiveness, both emotional and cognitive (and fails to account for the happy products of miserable childhoods, and vice versa). The last of Kagan's targets is the pleasure principle, which, he argues, can hardly make sense of unselfish behaviour impelled by the desire for virtue and self-respect - the wish to do the right thing.",

Except where stipulated otherwise, ‘divine immutability’ shall ‘mean that God is neither subject to, nor capable of, change in being, knowing, or willing, since God is immune to external influences, and without internal needs, of the sorts that might give rise to such change. Finally, ‘aseity’ shall be used to underline the divine immunity to external influences, since a being that is wholly a se or self-caused (is ‘pure act’ in the Thomistic sense), cannot be open to such influences, cannot be made to be what or how it is by anything other than itself.",

      "abstract": "Balance disorders may result from an impairment of one of the sensorial modalities involved in the perception of the self-location in space: vestibular, proprioception and vision, a deficit of the neuronal multisensorial integration, a less effective motor or loco-motor system, the medication side effects or psychological interferences. The basic examination of a dizzy patient implies the assessment of these different aspects. The balance is not restricted to à set of reflexes. It is a distinctive expression of the sixth sense : the sense of orientation. For every moving being, to go around in circles is ineffective to find new sources of food or avoid a predator. So, the ability of self-orientation in space is a primitive, unconscious function, critical to stay alive and closely related to the limbic system. The experience of the mobility, that required the spatial memory, which evolved towards the episodic memory, could be considered as the foundation of our thought.Les troubles de l’équilibration trouvent leurs origines dans une défaillance des modalités sensorielles de la perception de soi dans l’espace : vestibulaire, somesthésique ou visuelle, d’un déficit de l’intégration neuronale de celles-ci, dans une perte d’efficacité du système moteur ou loco-moteur, ou en raison d’une interférence de facteurs médicamenteux ou psychiques. L’examen de base du patient instable cherchera à évaluer ces différents axes. L’équilibration n’est pas une combinaison de réflexes. Elle est un aspect particulier d’un sixième sens : le sens de l’orientation dans l’espace. Pour tout être mobile, tourner en rond est sans utilité pour trouver des ressources nutritives et échapper aux prédateurs. L’orientation dans l’espace est donc une fonction primitive, inconsciente et souvent vitale, ce qui explique sa relation étroite avec le système limbique de gestion des émotions. La mobilité a imposé le développement d’un sens de l’orientation puis une mémoire spatiale qui a évolué vers la mémoire épisodique, fondement de notre pensée.",

One would be hard pressed, for example, to find a prominent image of defeat in the mythologies of the United States, Russia, or China, and having just named three of the most powerful nation-states in the world, which between them incorporate about a quarter of its population and territory, one can hardly argue that the centrality of the defeat myth is a universal phenomenon. What is universal is the need for any society to commemorate sacrifice, and although the defeat myth may serve as a convenient means for the modern social construct of the nation to manage this function, it is not the only means, and it is a mechanism that will prove more convenient for some varieties of nations in some circumstances than others.",

      "title": "What, if anything, can be considered an amodal sensory dimension?",
      "abstract": "The term 'amodal' is a key topic in several different research fields across experimental psychology and cognitive neuroscience, including in the areas of developmental and perception science. However, despite being regularly used in the literature, the term means something different to the researchers working in the different contexts. Many developmental scientists conceive of the term as referring to those perceptual qualities, such as, for example, the size and shape of an object, that can be picked up by multiple senses (e.g., vision and touch potentially providing information relevant to the same physical stimulus/property). However, the amodal label is also widely used in the case of those qualities that are not directly sensory, such as, for example, numerosity, rhythm, synchrony, etc. Cognitive neuroscientists, by contrast, tend to use the term amodal to refer to those central cognitive processes and brain areas that do not appear to be preferentially responsive to a particular sensory modality or to those symbolic or formal representations that essentially lack any modality and that are assumed to play a role in the higher processing of sensory information. Finally, perception scientists sometimes refer to the phenomenon of 'amodal completion', referring to the spontaneous completion of perceptual information that is missing when occluded objects are presented to observers. In this paper, we review the various different ways in which the term 'amodal' has been used in the literature and the evidence supporting the various uses of the term. Morever, we highlight some of the various properties that have been suggested to be 'amodal' over the years. Then, we try to address some of the questions that arise from the reviewed evidence, such as: Do different uses of the 'term' refer to different domains, for example, sensory information, perceptual processes, or perceptual representations? Are there any commonalities among the different uses of the term? To what extent is research on cross-modal associations (or correspondences) related to, or can shed light on, amodality? And how is the notion of amodal related to multisensory integration? Based on the reviewed evidence, it is argued that there is, as yet, no convincing empirical evidence to support the claim that amodal sensory qualities exist. We thus suggest that use of the term amodal would be more meaningful with respect to abstract cognition rather than necessarily sensory perception, the latter being more adequately explained/understood in terms of highly redundant cross-modal correspondences.",

      "abstract": "In reciprocities, the transfers are gifts. In the simple gift/ return-gift processes, there are two agents, and agent i hands out gift xi to agent j who reciprocates with the return gift xj to agent i. The xi and xj can a priori be of any nature, but we will consider later the “quantitative case” in which each gift is a quantity of a good. A notable issue is that of gift refusal, the possibility of refusing a gift in totality or in part, and its consequences. This can apply to the initial gift, to the return gift, or to both. The issue of gift refusal is disregarded in this section for simplicity and because, in a number of cases, it does not matter, or does not occur, or even cannot occur. (It may be that the agents do not refuse because they appreciate the other's gift, or only the gifts offered matter, or refusing the gift or returning it back may not be possible for a material reason or because of a norm internalized or imposed by social pressure, or the giver may be able to refuse the refusal – for instance in not “taking back” something refused –, and so on).",

A person is ill or becomes ill, when he will not experience his inner truth or allow it to surface. Psychotherapy must help the patient to find his personal inner truth. -- To reality on the other hand do belong all objects, all processes and events, as do all other people and their individual inner thruths. By integrating the person's inner truth into reality through action, there will be changes of the reality. Expressing one's inner truth does not necessarily equate with leading a healthy existence. Mentally ill people often cannot accept their individual inner truths, which also include their mental illness. Psychotherapy should accentuate the healthy parts of the mind and emphasize all the circumstances which the patient has managed well. The freedom of a patient not to want to acknowledge his inner truth must be respected; to accompany the ill person in an unassuming way can also be effective. The specific character of his illness and its resulting actions also belong to the patient's individual inner truth. This knowledge gives rise to necessary sacrifice and helps bring about the required period of mourning. Sacrifice and mourning also constitute part of existence. They can lead man to greater psychic maturity and contribute to independent use of the achieved individual inner truth.",

      "title": "Pre-Hispanic Nahua Slavery",
      "abstract": "Abstract The article deals with pre-Hispanic Nahua slavery. Based upon an examination of Nahua perception of slavery/slaves, Nahua forms of slavery (apart from the slaves destined for sacrifice there were slaves destined for work) and the social and legal position of Nahua slaves (destined for work) the author concludes that the Nahua institution traditionally called “slavery“ is different from its counterparts known from the history of Occident. Except for slaves destined for sacrifice to the gods which are discussed only briefly in the article, the Nahua slaves (i.e. the slaves destined for work) had a certain degree of personal freedom and certain rights. Becoming a slave at birth was possible only exceptionally and the enslavement of persons was in many cases (even if not in all cases) only temporary. The treatment of Nahua slaves – compared to the living conditions of their counterparts in many other world cultures – was significantly better, more humane. This can be seen from the fact that the master was entitled only to his/her slave’s labor and not to slave’s life, health, family members or property, as well as from the fact that the slave could obtain freedom in many ways, not only by the manumission made by his/her master. Although slaves were considered a kind of both physically and mentally “less perfect“ individuals who were “dirtied“, that is, morally tainted and dishonored by their enslavement and its reasons (mainly a delinquent behavior, i.e. non-payment of debts or perpetration of certain crimes), they were not systematically excluded from the wider society formed by free persons and they lived with their families in their houses and neighborhoods.",

Perception of the individual begins to block calculation as a form of thought – looking for justification in relative numbers, thinking in terms of systems. If perception of the individual does not block calculation entirely, it acts as a pressure in the mind toward a different kind of thinking, facing the tragic in actions taken and moving into the world of remorse, forgiveness, and beginning again. Perception of the individual is as great a human achievement as the development of perception in physics and mathematics. It has been achieved not once but twice, as the human relationship with other sentient beings on earth has been brought into the world of human law. Understanding human dignity can be clarified and confirmed by turning to its analog where sentient creatures beyond the human are concerned.",

'[In] addition to the one who makes the joke, there must be a second who is taken as the object of the hostile or sexual aggressiveness, and a third in whom the joke's aim of producing pleasure is fulfilled.' In other words, jokes are constructed like theatrical events, and are verbalised for the purpose of pleasing or impressing an audience. If this were not the case, there would be no point in saying the joke aloud: the joke-maker could simply think his amusing thoughts for his own pleasure. The fact that the joke-maker goes to the effort of actually telling the joke shows that he is not the primary receiver of pleasure, that the joke is being told for the purpose of creating a relationship with someone else.",

      "title": "Living through trauma: to bear the unbearable, to speak the unspeakable",
      "abstract": "A traumatic situation can be both cataclysmic and disorganising, while putting the whole existence of the individual to the test. Every trauma causes either minor or major rifts in the psyche, thus putting a strain on the patient’s present, past and future. Specifically, when the traumatic experience remains without adequate mentalization, in an instinctive form, it can severely affect the patient, both psychologically and socially. In this paper, we discuss the dual dimension of the traumatic experience. Firstly, since the psyche cannot elaborate the traumatic event or situation psychologically, only minor symbolic or mental representations are available, and the traumatic content cannot find its place in the patient’s psychic history. Since the trauma cannot be worked through psychologically, it usually comprises a massive experience of deadly anxieties, mixed with somatic and sensorial memories. Secondly, the consequences of the trauma have a social dimension. Individuals may feel disconnected and disengaged from their social existence and identity, alone and unprotected, as trauma can lead to them questioning their social identity. The unearthing of the previous psychic traumas explains why the therapy of traumatised patients demands in-depth, individual therapeutic work. Trauma therefore attacks in a dual manner, setting out to test all the aspects of the individual’s functioning. The therapeutic challenges for working with traumatised children and adolescents are considerable, as the clinical vignettes illustrate.",

      "abstract": "When you ask people What is evil?, their responses are striking in several respects. They tend to name individuals, singling out certain people as evil?e.g., Adolf Hitler, Saddam Hussein, or Joseph Stalin. They typically view evil as inhering in people or in quasi-personal agents (e.g., devils or vampires), not in animals or natural forces. Respondents never describe themselves as evil or as in any way complicitous in evil deeds. A recent poll of Americans who regularly attend church estimated that only three percent believe that they are the ones who might go to hell.1 And they perceive evil as an active, creative, and even autonomous force at work in the world. This last response suggests that perhaps the popular imagination knows something that ethical theorists do not. Ethicists who study busi nesses and organizations typically attribute malevolence and cruelty on the part of businesspeople to either a failure of moral reasoning or to a complete lack of empathie imagination. Some ethical lapses do appear to be the result of individuals' failure to think; they operate on a kind of moral autopilot, following a script they have never thought to question. The pilots who, during the 1950s, routinely dumped fuel into the ocean prior to landing did not set out to harm the environment. They were simply following the landing procedures they had been taught by those pilots who were their teachers. If evil is identical with mindlessness, then the best way to combat it is to instill habits of mindfulness. Those of us who teach ethics try to do so by asking our students to consider cases with a view to determining where and why people went wrong. We look for revealing patterns and causes. We",

      "abstract": "There are many kinds of neural prostheses available or being researched today. In most cases they are intended to cure or improve the condition of patients affected by some cerebral deficiency. In other cases, their goal is to provide new means to maintain or improve an individual's normal performance. In all these circumstances, one of the possible risks is that of violating the privacy of brain contents (which partly coincide with mental contents) or of depriving individuals of full control over their thoughts (mental states), as the latter are at least partly detectable by new prosthetic technologies. Given the (ethical) premise that the absolute privacy and integrity of the most relevant part of one's brain data is (one of) the most valuable and inviolable human right(s), I argue that a (technical) principle should guide the design and regulation of new neural prostheses. The premise is justified by the fact that whatever the coercion, the threat or the violence undergone, the person can generally preserve a \"sanctuary of thought\" in which to defend her convictions and identity, her dignity and autonomy. Without it, the person may end up in a state of complete subjection to other individuals. The following functional principle is that neural prostheses should be technically designed and built so as to prevent such outcomes. They should: (a) incorporate systems that can find and signal the unauthorized detection, alteration and diffusion of brain data and brain functioning; (b) be able to stop any unauthorized detection, alteration and diffusion of brain data. This should not only regard individual devices, but act as a general (technical) operating principle shared by all interconnected systems that deal with decoding brain activity and brain functioning.",

It is widely held that the capacity for learning takes a unique shape in humans and differs from how non-human animals learn. This view is popular among philosophers, psychologists, and anthropologists. In spite of the wide agreement about its uniqueness, it remains unclear what exactly it is about human learning that makes it special. In this article, we take an Aristotelian approach and argue that the uniqueness of human learning can only be understood against the background of the human form of life. This form of life is characterized by a self-conscious relation between the form of life and its bearers. Learning is the form of the development from immature to mature bearers of the human form of life and carries the following three characteristics: It is second-personal, its content is general, and the learner's relation to the knowledge or the capacities she acquires is reflective.",

      "abstract": "I have argued that, in order to unearth — or construct — sociological foundations for Marx's economic theories, the two concepts of estrangement and alienation must be kept separate and distinct. In the Introduction, 'alienation' (Entäusserung) was said to refer to the renunciation or relinquishment of possession or of a claim to something — usually, but not necessarily, in favour of another person. Its correlative was said to be 'appropriation' (Aneignung): taking into possession or assuming new powers of disposal over something — often, but by no means always, from another person. Clearly, neither term refers exclusively to relations involving 'things', since it is possible to alienate and appropriate activities or capacities, such as labour and labour-power, or persons (slaves) or abstract social entities (privileges, offices, freedoms, 'goodwill' etc.) However, it is fair to say that their primary reference is to things, and that these other uses, however common, are secondary, and have a figurative content. Or, to put it another way, that these diverse sorts of object are being assimilated to things and treated accordingly when they are said to be alienated or appropriated. So whereas solidarity and estrangement concerned the social bonding and sundering of persons, appropriation and alienation concern the making and breaking of social bonds between persons and things.",

They constitute towards human behavior and to a certain extent ethical behavior is based on emotion (Goleman, 1995). Human emotion can be separated into two categories including positive emotion and negative emotion that is further accompanied by both physiological and psychological changes. Positive emotions help us to develop joy, interest, gratitude, love in which the person always feel good and remains active with physiological and psychological state of mind. However, when we have negative vibes around then the physiological and psychological state of mind can lead to changes in body gestures, facial expressions, movement of the muscles.

The effects of negative emotions always weaken your body’s immune system and give you stress, anxious, or upset and lead to demotivation.

Artifacts are manufactured by us, according to our own needs and circumstances; they are not the products of nature. Their artifactual essence will not be supported, therefore, by physical regularities, and thus cannot be objective. Is this inference correct, however? I will sketch a certain version of essentialism concerning artifacts (henceforward artifact-essentialism) and will explore how far such a position can be sustained. Artifact-essentialism does not have to maintain that all structures which humans apply to portions of stuff yield objects with independent conditions of identity. One should grant that many man-made things, such as statues or ornaments, are not objects over and above the portions of matter that make them up, in more than a conventional sense. Is it not true, nevertheless, that there exist artifacts thatfunction the way they do independently of the fact that we humans appreciate this? Given the prevailing laws of nature, similar circumstances, and the structures they have, would such objects not function in exactly the same way, even if no one were around to observe them? That the acquisition of some structures accords specific functions to articulated bodies is not at all a matter of convention; little is arbitrary or mind-dependent in the relation of such a structure-type with the function-type that correlates with it. The application of specific causes to any such articulated body yields certain effects of specific complexity, where, empirically speaking, there is a deterministic regularity, of the sort subsumable under an appropriate causal law. Indeed, it is a contingent and even an arbitrary matter that a particular piece of stuff should acquire a specific artifactual structure. Since artifacts are our own designs, the choice of the portions of matter upon which these designs are executed is again ours. But once such a design is executed, the resulting object will have the same function in every world the physical laws of which are the same as those of the actual, and it has that function",

Examining notions of completeness, closure (explanatory, emotional, and anticipatory), telos, and retroactive meaning conferral shows that none of these manages both to apply to non-literary life-narratives and to give a special status to the event of death.

      "abstract": "This exploration into social meanings packs along with it an assumption that social studies have yet to arrive at any ‘moment’ of potential in which they can confidently set about describing human behaviour in a way that makes the topic analytically familiar, and therefore warrants the analysis. Indeed, I take it for now that people’s actions are new and strange. There is a small band of the ‘self-disciplined’ who view the social landscapes around them with fresh eyes; the occasional philosopher, some of the historians, ethnomethodologists, and conversation analysts, plus a few of the anthropologists and ethnographers. But they are exceptions. The problem appears to be this: Because everyone, analyst and lay person, is a committed expert on social behaviour, very few have felt the need to attempt an agreement on the details; for example, the profoundly-social properties of the very language we all use to describe it. Practitioners of natural science are not simply observing reality but displaying also their astonishment, frustrations, equivocations, justifications, agreements, criticisms, occasional relief, and other tokens of it. If the early astronomers and chemists had an advantage, it was the lack of experts bending their ears.\r\n\r\nAccumulating empirical descriptions of social events will not necessarily result in a progressive discipline, only the potential for a workable philosophy that leaves the landscape unchanged. After that, who knows? But the potential offers more towards a warrant than what currently stands as social science. In the following chapters, the reader will find descriptions of social objects that appear in a court of law, and in settings that involve what we like to gloss as humour, laughter, and play. The analytic logic of these descriptions stands before the action and knows how to do it (such logic is not a reference to something hidden behind or within). This type of understanding features in a growing canon of studies towards which the following project aspires.",

Object relations theory, ego, and self-psychology all suggest different concepts of the self, its development, and the developmental arrests leading to adult personality disorders.

Other, non-analytic, therapies often avoid developmental issues, but have implicit or explicit models of the embedded somewhere in their theories. This same has also been a focal point of nearly 5,000 years of Eastern metaphysical and religious investigation. The Eastern effort emphasizes phenomenological investigations of the as present experience, followed by interpretations of that experience based on traditional metaphysical systems. The self's personal history and infantile origins are ignored. The Eastern approach lacks a clinical tradition as we know it, and self is often used to denote non-personal, special states of consciousness ordinarily regarded as mystical in the West. The Hindu has two levels: Jiva, or the individual soul, and Atman, its universal and spiritual aspect, the experience of which is found in enlightenment. Buddha denied that either existed, and maintained that the experience of Emptiness was the ultimate phenomenological substratum of both the and the world. Buddhism attempts a radical resolution to all psychological illnesses by ending their source, the self, and expanding consciousness towards an identification with all of reality. Efforts have been made to integrate these fundamentally different concepts of and their derivative therapies,' without a great deal of popular acceptance. Current transpersonal syntheses employ the notion of invariant stages of progressive ego development and suggest using different types of therapies for different levels of developmental arrest. This differs from psychoanalytic thinking only in the assumption of developmental stages far beyond the Oedipal stage (see table on pages 65-66).

The most unpopular is the government, or other people who have the power of preventing us from doing what we want. But our freedom is also circumscribed by lack of physical and mental strength or skill, including that of knowing how to manage other human beings. Other factors limiting our freedom are our ignorance, our passions and our habits. Some men say they value their freedom from these things, especially their freedom from passion, so much that they would prefer to be in prison or on the rack rather than be a slave to them, but one suspects they exaggerate.",

      "abstract": "Particulars are to be understood by contrasting them with universals, that term being used to comprise both properties and relations. Often the term ‘individuals’ is used interchangeably with ‘particulars’, though some restrict the term ‘individuals’ to those particulars whose existence has more than momentary duration. It is sometimes taken as a distinctive feature of particulars that they cannot be in more than one place at a time, whereas universals are capable of being wholly present in more than one place at a given time: if you have a white thing here and a white thing there, then you have two particulars but only one property. This way of distinguishing between particulars and universals may help us to focus on apt paradigm cases of each, but arguably this does not get us to the heart of the matter. On the one hand, some think it is possible, at least in principle, for a magician, or Pythagoras, or a time traveller, or a subatomic particle to be in two places at once, even though each is a particular. On the other hand, some think that there are properties which could not possibly be manifested in two different places at the same time, and yet which nonetheless are universals: think, for instance, of the divine property of absolute perfection, or of the conjunction of all intrinsic properties of a Leibnizian monad (or possible world); or of Judas’ property of simply being Judas. Particulars are things which have properties and which stand in relations – particulars ‘instantiate’ properties and relations. By itself, however, this does not distinguish particulars from universals since universals, too, are naturally thought to have properties and to stand in relations. What distinguishes particulars is the fact that, while a particular instantiates properties and relations, nothing instantiates a particular. Universals both ‘have’ (properties and relations) and are ‘had’; particulars ‘have’ but are not ‘had’. Since a particular is not instantiated by another thing, it is sometimes said to exist ‘in itself’, whereas a universal exists ‘in’ something else. For this reason, the term ‘particular’ is related to the term ‘substance’, which is traditionally used to mean something capable of independent existence.",

      "abstract": "ions of the mind, as Plato did so long ago, is a disservice because it asks us to reject This is not meant to diminish the fact that some people do feel trapped in their body either because of the extreme pain or because it feels like the wrong body for one reason or another. I would suggest, however, that perhaps much of this imagery of feeling trapped is due to the dissociation that is taught in a dualistic society (or even that dissociation which is necessary to survive mentally in a dualized community that is itself rejecting). Perhaps this dissociation makes people believe that not only are the two parts separable, but that the body is generally responsible for their negative experiences. Less dissociation and more acceptance of people as whole and situated individuals, might well lessen these experiences which mirror this artificial but current state of the society generally–but such is only possible in a world that accepts bodies and human variation. 77 important aspects of ourselves, of others and our connections to them, and makes it impossible for us to come to terms with ourselves as whole, integrated and bodily beings. The fact that dualisms still exist may seem unimpressive to some, just as the believed existence of yin and yang does not seem especially problematic to some Eastern thinkers. The point that women are associated with one side of this dualism, the side that is less valued, is unfortunate for them but does not in itself adequately refute dualism as a concept and means of understanding the world, such thinkers might argue. I think there is sufficient evidence that the harm dualism does, and the inequalities it produces, is at least adequate to challenge its usefulness and fairness. Even those readers who might reject these points surely could not easily maintain that dualism is an accurate account of human experience as it exists in the world. Granted many people believe that their mind and body are quite separate in some way, but the opinions of the masses are not in themselves adequate proof, one might think. However the average person does not experience their body as radically separate from themselves. One does not generally seek out or welcome a means of killing the body such that their immortal mind might be free to do more important things than the material tasks of maintaining a body. People experience their bodies as themselves. When physical pain is experienced–it is not just reasoned away and when psychic or emotional pain is experienced, often the body reflects that anguish. It is not just my mind that decides if I feel happy today but also my body which is me as well. The next chapter will discuss",

      "title": "Locus of Control of High School Students of Punjab State",
      "abstract": "Locus of control refers to the extent to which individuals believe that they can control events that affect them. Understanding of the concept was developed by Julian B. Rotter in 1954, and has since become an important aspect of personality studies. One's (Latin for place or location) can either be internal (meaning the person believes that they control their life) or external (meaning they believe that their environment, some higher power, or other people control their decisions and their life).Locus of control refers to a person's beliefs about control over life events. Some people feel personally responsible for the things that happen to them. Those people are labeled as internals. Individuals with a high internal locus of control believe that events result primarily from their own behavior and actions. Others feel that their outcomes in life are determined by forces beyond their control (e.g.; fate, luck and other people). These people are labeled as externals. Those with a high external locus of control believe that powerful others, fate, or chance primarily determine events.Rotter while advocating his theory of social learning has given the concept of 'Locus of Control'. The construct of locus of control is a personality dimension involving an individual's perceived control over events occurring in his life. People are having internal or external locus of control. Locus of control is the extent to which people believe that they are responsible for their behavioral outcomes. It has often been cited as an important factor in achievement oriented behaviour. Rotter terms persons who strongly believe that they can shape their own destinies are called as internals. Those who believe that their outcomes are largely the result of forces outside their control are called as externals. Internals are often happier and better adjusted than externals.People with an internal locus of control tend to believe their behaviour influences outcomes. Internal locus of control individual believes that he is guided by his/her personal decisions and efforts. On the other hand, while those with external locus of control tend to attribute outcomes to outside forces, such as fate, chance and other people. External locus of control individual believes that his/her behaviour is guided by fate, luck, or other external circumstances. These people are labeled as externals.People need to believe in their own abilities to achieve and be happy. They need to develop a sense of control. People's locus of control influences how they view the world and how they identify the causes of success or failures in their lives. Internal factors mean personal whereas external are situational ones. Obviously, most people fall between the two extremes forming a continuous distribution of locus of control beliefs. Locus of control is thought to be relatively enduring dispositional characteristics, although certainly modifiable through experience.The variable of locus of control is of major significance in understanding the nature of learning processes in different kinds of learning situations. The construct of locus of control, an integral part of social learning theory of Rotter (1954) is a personality dimension involving an individual's perceived control over events occurring in his life. This concept grew out of Rotter's Social learning theory (1954) which provides the general theoretical background for his conception of the nature and effects of reinforcement and his work on levels of expectancies.According to this theory, the unit of investigation for the study of personality is the interaction of the individual and his meaningful environment and it is the study of learned behaviour. Behaviour as described by personality theorists has a directional aspect and this aspect is inferred from the effect of reinforcing conditions. The occurrence of behaviour of a person is determined not only by the nature or importance of goals or reinforcements but also by the person's anticipation or expectancy that their goals will occur. …",

      "title": "On “Becoming Who One is” (and Failing) 1",
      "abstract": "Oscar Wilde once noted that for antiquity and for long afterwards, the great imperative in human life was \"Know thyself.\" This was the path to wisdom given by the oracle at Delphi, and was often cited by Socrates as his greatest task in life. It did not imply in antiquity what it might to us; it had much less the sense of \"avoid self-deceit,\" or \"be true to yourself\" or \"know your limits.\" It had much more the sense of \"avoid ignorance about what it is to be a human being and what happiness for such a creature consists in.\" However, said Wilde, for us moderns, the major life task had become something different. It is now: \"Become who you are.\" This imperative has also been of central concern in a strand of modern European and American philosophy (sometimes called a \"romantic.\" strand) that stretches from Rousseau through Hegel, Emerson, Thoreau, Nietzsche (with whom the phrase itself is now probably most associated) to Heidegger and Sartre. 2 A kind of anxiety that we are not in our official or public roles really or authentically \"who we are,\" that we are not what we are taken to be by others, now seems familiar to us as a characteristic problem in modern Western life. 3",

First, joy accompanies the process through and through, whereas happiness seems to be more strictly tied to the moment of achievement of the process. Second, joy is not only a direct emotional response to an event that is embedded in our life-concerns but is also tightly bound to the present moment, whereas happiness presupposes an evaluative stance concerning one period of one's life or one's own life as a whole. Even a life that has been confronted with several sad episodes and obstacles, to which one has however responded in a way that corresponds to what one takes to be a valuable accomplishment or self-realization, could possibly be experienced as 'happy' in self-evaluation.",

      "title": "Liberty, Equality, Fraternity, and . . . Vulnerability",
      "abstract": "Liberty, Equality, Fraternity, and . . . Vulnerability Julia Kristeva (bio) Translated by Jeanine Herman Disabilities are multiple—motor, sensory, psychical, mental—and singular. Each disabled person is a singular person experiencing his or her situation in a specific, different, unique way. Yet whatever the disabilities, they confront us with incomparable exclusion, different from the others: the disabled person opens a narcissistic identity wound in the person who is not disabled; he inflicts a threat of physical or psychical death, fear of collapse, and, beyond that, the anxiety of seeing the very borders of the human species explode. And so the disabled person is inevitably exposed to a discrimination that cannot be shared. If I attempt to share this situation, however, it is not only because of my son's neurological difficulties, which led to an atypical education for him and exposed me to the singularity of each disabled person. Nor is it because, as a psychoanalyst, I have treated psychical disabilities (depression, psychosis, borderline states, and other disorders). But because my frequent visits outside the Hexagon have convinced me that, compared to countries such as Sweden, Norway, Belgium, Canada, the United States, and many others, France has been slow to establish a true solidarity with disabled people and to provide personalized support for each of them.1 In fact, at the dawn of this millennium, while biology, anthropology, and astrophysics explore human frontiers and the most advanced democracies refuse discrimination against people whose bodies and minds test our notions of human identity, trying to incorporate them into every level of society, France, in this difficult, provocative, and promising moment, is still a long way from creating what one would be right to expect from the country of the rights of man. [End Page 251] More fundamentally still, faced with the rather cynical pragmatism of some and the religious clashes of others, I am convinced that humanism—which has always been in search of itself, from its emergence in the past to its crises or revitalizations today and in times to come—can find a chance to revitalize itself in the battle for the dignity of the disabled by constructing what is still sorely lacking: respect for a vulnerability that cannot be shared. My ambition, my utopia, consists of believing that this vulnerability reflected in the disabled person forms us deeply, or, if you prefer, unconsciously, and that as a result, it can be shared. Could this humanism be the \"cultural revolution\" with which to construct the democracy of proximity that the postmodern age needs? The outsize nature of this ambition is actually built on ordinary, painful, everyday experiences. Here are three, among many others: John, Claire, and the Woman on Television People Say I'm Crazy was the title of a documentary shown on TV in the United States, which I saw during a recent visit. The film aims to show how a schizophrenic person can be \"cured\" and \"integrated\" into society. The hero, stuffed full of medications that make him \"obese\" (his complaint), might be saved by his sister, a filmmaker who comes up with the idea of filming poor John, who likes to draw and make woodcuts. Thanks to the film, his works are soon made public; he has an exhibition; he is showered with grants. The madman has become \"a disabled artist.\" He can leave the appalling shelter he shares with a few others of his kind, and even find a certain serenity, because social services now pays for a home worthy of being called one. Now he is cured. The only thing left to do is to award the film a prize, which happens shortly thereafter. From time to time, the artist protests against the camera that is trained on him and, to some extent, against those who are making his illness a work of art. But he ends up going along with it, and participates, so to speak, in the filming. Isn't the camera a third party that recognizes him, a bit of space between his ill-being and his family? John is not crazy enough to deprive himself of that. More than the charming, \"very American\" therapist who encourages him with her kind, \"social worker...",

Yet, clearly, according to the normal use of the word, sensations of light, of sound, of hunger, and so forth, are not regarded as part of one's thinking, nor do we so regard the spontaneous flight of the imagination one might experience in daydreams or real dreams, or while thinking about unrelated matters. Some of these sensations, notably aches, pains, pangs of hunger, blinding light, and strong noise, are not only not counted among our thoughts, but they are apt to interfere with our thinking, and, in extreme cases, might stop it altogether. In a similar way, the lascivious play of St. Antony's imagination did not embellish his meditations on the holy mysteries; he had to overcome or ignore it to be able to pursue the train of his thought.",

What's more, there is an assumption that self-fashioning is something good, that it is something that we ought to (or at least do) value. is occasionally invoked to lend some philosophical weight to pro grams of self-creation. This is not without some support. We, however, want to become those we are?human beings who are new, unique, incomparable, who give or laws, who create or herself (GS, 335).1 In comment on Goethe, says that sought totality and to that end he disciplined to wholeness, created (TI, Skirmishes, 49).2 Nehamas complicates such picture by denying that Nietzsche's discussion of self-creation can be attributed to him as a positive view of human conduct, consisting perhaps of description of the right kind of life or of set of princi ples for becoming the sort of person admires.3 Instead, Nehamas describes how exemplifies, through his own writings, way in which one individual may have succeeded in fashioning itself.... This individual is none other than himself, who is creature of his own texts.4 That is, through his writings and his self-interpretation in such works as Ecce Homo, Friedrich (the writer) created Nietzsche (the Philosopher/Author of such texts as Ecce Homo).

      "abstract": "I raise the question of responsibility and danger because of the likelihood that being responsible inevitably includes 'something' unresponsible, as well as a concentric movement of will that excludes what is unresponsible and gives increasing power to the forces of will and subjectivity. The subject is strengthened in responsible action. The movement of subjectivity is towards itself as it acts with regard to something other to itself, to which it gives itself. It draws itself towards itself as it draws toward the other. In responsibly choosing to belong to something-be that something a god, another person, a community, or an ideal-the individual is given intensity, a strengthened sense of the future and past, and above all a sense of worldly coherence and meaning. These are good things, and they seem to be excellent things if that to which we are responsible has unqualified worth. Such values are not denied when responsibility is put in question. Further, the question of responsibility's danger does not ask about that to which we are responsible. It asks about the value of responsibility. If we protect responsibility by giving it unquestioned or hardly questioned value, the subject too will continue to enjoy a virtually unqualified value in our thought and action, and we will ignore or denigrate an absence of responsibility that is borne by responsibility. But when responsibility occurs as a question in our thinking, its own movement will be checked in our thought. Perhaps something unresponsible will take place, and perhaps the unresponsible will expose a danger in responsibility, namely that it excludes something vital for the way of being that is to",

      "title": "The Other’s Silence – between Complementarity and Distancing",
      "abstract": "Silence is an universal language. If there is anything that crosses multiple cultures, in ways that seem so familiar to anyone, this can be achieved by silence. The concept of silence does not need grammatical forms, declinations or accents, although it includes them on a subtle level, silence does not need, most of the time, translation, it goes without saying, because its peculiarities are predominantly emotional, and emotions are universal. Of course, there can be cultures of noise, just as, for example, there are cultures of silence, inclined towards an expression that includes to a very large extent the need for silence. In theatrical art, we cannot get rid of the “other” or the “others” – stage partner, audience, director, etc. The profile of a so-called “other” is a hypostasis that seems to offer a more intimate setting, a direct connection, without witnesses, that moment of wholeness to which a man, from time to time, aspires. The silent being attracts the being in need of an answer. Is “the other” a foreign, separate, culturally or metaphorically distanced formula? This study aims to x-ray moments where the other (either a character, a state, a world, etc.) meets another and decides to “complete” him, to adhere to each other's world, or, on the contrary, to cause him to distance himself and close himself in his own world. The gaze cast at the “other” is a glance thrown beyond the boundaries of one's own person – the gaze of one is silently linked to the gaze of the other.",

      "title": "Imitation and Empathy in Infancy",
      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Numerous writers have described how imitation may lead to empathy: when an imitator performs the same behavior as another, she may experience, directly or through associated memories, the same cognitions and emotions as the person being imitated. Meltzoff's recent description of newborn infants' ability to recognize selfother equivalences in action - the 'Like me' framework - links imitation and empathy in this way. The theory builds on reports that infants can imitate from birth. However, evidence for newborn imitation is open to alternative interpretation. Other findings indicate that infants' voluntary reproduction of actions of others requires substantial learning and emerges in the second year. Evidence of such learning is presented here, and implications for studying the origins of imitation and empathy are discussed. KEYWORDS: infancy, imitation, empathy, newborn. The potential for a close link between the ability to imitate others and the ability to empathize with others has been appreciated by researchers and theorists dating back at least to the late 19th century (see Iacoboni, 2009, for several early sources; see also Freud, 1921). 'Empathy' in their writings refers variously to the ability of one person to either understand or share the thoughts, motivations, intentions, or emotional experiences of another, without having had those private events explicitly communicated to them - for example, in language (Singer, 2006). The proposed role of imitation in producing empathy is to bring the person imitating into the same experiential context as the person being imitated, thus creating in the imitator a set of private experiences - understanding and/or emotional responses - that are either immediately evoked by that context or associated with that context in memory, and that match (or at least are thought to match) the private experiences of the person being imitated. Recent years have seen a rise in research studies and theoretical papers concerned with the origins of imitation and empathy in infancy (e.g., Meltzoff, 1995; 2002; 2005; 2007a; 2007b; Meltzoff & Decety, 2003; Singer, 2006), and with the neural underpinnings of these abilities in infants, children, and adults (e.g., Carr, Iacoboni, Dubeau, Mazziotta, & Lenzi, 2003; Dapretto, Davies, Pfeifer, Scott, Sigman, Bookheimer, & Iacoboni, 2006; de Waal, 2008; Decety & Jackson, 2004; Fogassi, Ferrari, Gesierich, Rozzi, Chersi, & Rizzolatti, 2005; Gallese, 2005; Gallese & Goldman, 1998; Gazzola, Aziz-Zadeh, & Keysers, 2006; Iacoboni, 2005; 2009; Iacoboni, Molnar-Szakacs, Gallese, Buccino, Mazziotta, & Rizzolatti, 2005; Iacoboni, Woods, Brass, Bekkering, Mazziotta, & Rizzolatti, 1999; Kaplan & Iacoboni, 2006; Pfeifer, Iacoboni, Mazziotta, & Dapretto, 2008; Rizzolatti & Craighero, 2004). The purpose of this article is to examine one segment of this growing literature - that is, current thinking and evidence on the origins of imitation and empathy in infancy - and to identify the implications of this examination for future research on the origins of empathy. The origins of imitation and empathy in infancy: the 'like me' hypothesis The dominant theory of the origins of imitation, and the body of evidence that supports it, have been developed over many years by Meltzoff (e.g., 2002; 2005; 2007a; 2007b), and by Meltzoff and Moore (e.g., 1977; 1983; 1989; 1992; 1994; 1997). In Meltzoff's recent formulations (e.g., Meltzoff, 2002; 2005; 2007a; 2007b; Meltzoff & Decety, 2003), it is clear that this account of the origins of imitation is also a theory of the origins of empathy. The source of empathy is described by the 'Like me' hypothesis (e.g., Meltzoff, 2005; 2007a; 2007b), which follows in the tradition of simulation theories of empathy (e.g., Gallese & Goldman, 1998). The 'Like me' hypothesis proposes that the infant from birth can experience others as 'Like me' through her own imitative acts. …",

      "abstract": "Even in this scientific and jet-age, some people still believe that variations brought about by individual differences (differences in behaviour, reasoning and approaches to problem-solving) are controlled by some strange forces that cannot be seen, touch or comprehend. These forces, they believe, are real, but beyond the understanding and comprehension of humans. Predominant in this view are those who hold that humans and the propensities surrounding their complicated behaviour are innately determined and fundamentally controlled by some spiritual forces animated by the soul (which can be good or evil). Even though modern science and technology have ruled out this belief system or concept as disingenuous, yet it continues to hold prominence among people of many nations, of which Nigerians are greatly involved. Even with its commanding number of Universities and highly learned population, people in Nigeriaoverwhelmingly have the belief that humans are not intrinsically and expressively responsible for their behaviour, rather it is remotely controlled by the evil spirits and their agents. Incredibly it may seem, this view is also held among highly educated Nigerians. Through scientific breakthroughs, the mechanisms through which behaviour emerges have been revealed, showing that human behaviour and cognition are animated and propelled by the brain cells, called theneurons. How this life-animating system functions to bring about myriads of complicated and astonishing physical, mental, cognitive and emotional activities are the sole aim of this article. This article gives a fundamental background under which the brain operates and coordinates activities that give rise to human behaviour. It is basically presented as an introductory approach to biological and chemical basis of human behaviour, giving professionals, searchers-of-trueknowledge and students a friendly perspective to conceptualize the brain's responsiveness to internal and external stimuli that generate human behaviour. After this exploration, the reader will come to understand how the brain is responsible for complicated behaviour previously attributed to evil spirit.",

But there are features of an addict's life having nothing to do with the origin of his addiction which can explain his heteronomy. First of all, an unwilling addict lacks proficiency, the capacity to control his environment in accordance with his desires. However he came to this state, the loss of proficiency is grounded in his current condition, independently of origin. He is a cripple even if he freely chose to become one. More likely, the evolution to addiction was not initiated by a free choice. A fully informed, rational adult would not choose to become an addict, especially since one item of information at his disposal is that he would come seriously to regret the decision later. But here again the heteronomy of the original decision has to do with contemporaneous features of the decision, namely, ignorance or irrationality.",

      "title": "Genomic susceptibility as an emergent form of life? Genetic testing, identity, and the remit of medicine",
      "abstract": "Do we today inhabit an \"emergent form of life\"? The term form of life was made most famous in the work of Ludwig Wittgenstein, but my use of it is hardly a rigorous application of Wittgenstein's argument. By a \"form of life,\" I simply mean to point to the rules and premises for \"behaving ourselves,\" for conducting a life; that is to say, the ways in which our forms of conduct are linked to ways in which we understand ourselves and others; to our sense of what we can hope for or what we must fear; to our ways of judging right and wrong, desirable and undesirable; and also to our conceptions of our obligations toward others and toward ourselves. I also like the term forms of life because it links this reference to the ways in which one may conduct one's life, to another sense-that implied by the idea of a \"life form.\" That is to say, it relates to the question of what we are today, as creatures, as life forms or living beings. In this essay, I want to suggest that there are some intriguing new links between our forms of life and our sense of ourselves as particular life forms. In identifying such links, I do not mean to imply that there is a simple causal connection between, say, new biomedical or genetic concepts and new ways of living. This is why I use the term emergence. The idea of emergence has become popular with the increasing interest in \"complexity theory,\" but once more I use the term rather loosely, simply to refer to something new, which arises not from a single event or discovery, but often unexpectedly and contingently at the intersection of multiple pathways. I like the term emergence because it stresses that there are no necessary relations between the different pathways which happen to coincide at a specifi c point. Something new arises when a series of often quite distinct developments intersect, interact, crash into one another, combine, and redivide, and so on. Sometimes, not always, something novel takes shape as a result. That is the kind of image that I am trying to convey in this term emergent forms of life.",

      "title": "Traits and trade-offs are insufficient for evolutionary personality psychology.",
      "abstract": "Comments on the article by D. Nettle, who has clearly shown that evolutionary psychologists need to focus more attention on individual differences, not just species-typical universals. Such differences are not mere \"noise,\" and evolutionary theory will gain by understanding how they are produced and maintained. However, by focusing on personality traits and the five-factor personality model, Nettle left unaddressed many of the most important aspects of human personality. An evolutionary psychology of personality must ultimately explain not just trait differences but also differences in personal goals, values, motives, identities, and life narratives--essential elements of human individuality and functionality. K. M. Sheldon et al suggest four reasons why traits and the five-factor personality model do not provide an optimal approach for explaining the evolution of personality: (a) As constructs, traits provide little purchase for explaining the causes of behavior; (b) trait concepts do not acknowledge or explain people's variations around their own baselines, variations that are likely crucial for adaptation; (c) traits do not explain or even describe true human uniqueness, i.e. the ways in which a person is different from everybody else; and (d) traits do not explain personality from the inside, by considering what people are trying to do in their lives. In raising these issues Sheldon et al are suggesting that the important question for evolutionary personality study is not why people fall at different points on a continuum regarding traits x, y, and z, but rather why each person is inevitably unique while still sharing the same evolved psychology.",

Nor can they be clearly distinguished from the feelings discussed in the last chapter under the terms of sneering and defiance. Disgust is a sensation rather more distinct in its nature, and refers to something revolting, primarily in relation to the sense of taste, as actually perceived or vividly imagined; and secondarily to anything which causes a similar feeling, through the sense of smell, touch, and even of eyesight. Nevertheless, extreme contempt, or, as it is often called, loathing contempt, hardly differs from disgust. These several conditions of the mind are, therefore, nearly related; and each of them may be exhibited in many different ways. Some writers have insisted chiefly on one mode of expression, and others on a different mode. From this circumstance M. Lemoine has argued that their descriptions are not trustworthy. But we shall immediately see that it is natural that the feelings which we have here to consider should be expressed in many different ways, inasmuch as various habitual actions serve equally well, through the principle of association, for their expression.",

The world too, as other, is inseparable from God, therefore, willing to be what he then is, though not temporally. Transcendence, as infinite, demands immanence. Why God has no real relation to creatures (Aquinas) is because they are not as God is, or as God transcends such being. Human actuality requires inversion of the common‐sense world. The idea of a privileged access to truth is arbitrary. Truth, rather, must be intrinsically human. We live in God. Only so are we, images, in ourselves. Emergent knowledge is natural to the universe.

Many of the observations central to his position seem to me cogent, and are shared by other writers. These include three important propositions: that a good life, one which is good for those whose life it is, is not necessarily the same as a life which they think is good for them, nor does it necessarily consist in their desires being satisfied, nor in the satisfaction of any subset of their desires (e.g. their considered desires, or those not based on any false assumptions). that people aim or intend to do what is worth doing, to have relationships worth having, and engage in goals worth pursuing, and so on, and that all of these, and their combination, are distinct from having a good life (and this explains how people can knowingly sacrifice their own good), and that what makes the well-being of people worth pursuing, to the extent that it is, what provides reasons for those same people and for others to protect or promote it, is that people are valuable in themselves.",

People differ in the degree to which they believe that everything is one, but we know little about the psychological or social implications of holding this belief. In two studies, believing in oneness was associated with having an identity that includes distal people and the natural world, feeling connected to humanity and nature, and having values that focus on other people's welfare. However, the belief was not associated with a lower focus on oneself or one's concerns. Participants who believed in oneness tended to view themselves as spiritual but not necessarily religious, and reported experiences in which they directly perceived everything as one. The belief in oneness is a meaningful existential belief that has numerous implications for people's self-views, experiences, values, relationships, and behavior.",

      "abstract": "The concept of recognition (Anerkennung in German) has been in the center of intensive interest and debate for some time in social and political philosophy, as well as in Hegelscholarship. The first part of the article clarifies conceptually what recognition in the relevant sense arguably is. The second part explores one possible route for arguing that the ‘recognitive attitudes’ of respect and love have a necessary role in the coming about of the psychological capacities distinctive of persons. More exactly, it explores the possibility that they are necessary in the kind of intersubjective relationship in which normal human infants engage in the prelinguistic communicative practice of pointing things to others, as described by Michael Tomasello. If an incapacity to participate in the already Gricean communicative practices of pointing makes it also impossible for the infant to learn symbolic communication, and if without the immediately intrinsically motivating other-regarding attitudes of recognition communicative pointing does not get off the ground (at least among the most intelligent animals currently known to exist), then the capacity for recognition may be a decisive difference between humans and their closest nonhuman relatives. That is, it may be why only human infants, but no other animals, are capable of embarking on a developmental journey that normally leads to full-fledged psychological personhood. If this is so, then the concept of recognition, today mostly discussed in social and political philosophy and Hegel-studies, could turn out to be a very useful tool in cognitive scientific work interested in specifically human forms of social intentionality, cognition, volition and so forth.",

Pudicitia could be located in the body or in the soul, or in the body and the soul; it could be more or less closely identified with virtue and moral strength or with (outmoded or inappropriate) idealism or (misleading) veneer, or with a physical state over which a disempowered individual had little control. It could be a badge of honour for married women or male politicians, a corporeal or notional purity under siege from bullying libido, a guardian of Roman freedom or an avenging brutality.",

One dimension is concerned with attribution of moral blame. Thomas Nagel explains: \"If one negligently leaves the bath running with the baby in it, one will realize, as one bounds up the stairs towards the bathroom, that if the baby has drowned one has done something awful, whereas if it has not one has merely been careless.\" How badly one has behaved and hence how much one should be blamed turns on consequences beyond one's control - on luck. The other dimension concerns the existence and extent of one's responsibility for having done harm, one's obligation to someone harmed to make amends for or repair the harm done. Someone who has been careless and lucky enough not to injure anyone has no such obligation. Someone who has been equally careless and inflicted a devastating injury may well have a ruinous obligation.",

Fear is evidence of danger; trust is evidence of reliability. Like beliefs, emotions provide orientations that render particular facets of things salient. In the grip of an emotion, we notice things we would otherwise miss. The variability and volatility of emotional deliverances might seem to undermine their claim to epistemic standing. I argue that variability and volatility can be epistemic assets, keying the subject to multiple, quickly changing features of things.

      "abstract": "There is much to be said in favour of the idea that anticipation and the preemption and deception which it permits play an important role in the social life of both humans and a number of other primates. This idea has been developed anew, particularly for the human case, in a number of different disciplines for a variety of different reasons. Goody (this volume), points to a number of instances, and the list could be extened almost ad nauseam. It ranges from computer scientists proposing plan-construction algorithms and user-modelling procedures for natural language front-ends, to economists speculating on the actions of economic agents planning their moves in the market-place with respect to the actions of others. The scope and explanatory range of this idea in any of these fields has always been questionable. In economics, for example, the very different effects of ignorance, habit and culture on individual choice have often been far greater than those of individual ratiocination. Nevertheless, any area of human activity which involves actual or potential interaction with other humans (and that might mean all of human life) can be seen to have characteristics which reveal an anticipation of how others will view and respond to one's actions.",

      "title": "Qualia",
      "abstract": "In contemporary discussions in the philosophy of mind, the terms quale and qualia (plural) are most commonly used to denote features of our conscious mental states such as the throbbing pain of my headache, the warmth I feel when I hold my hands over the fire, or the greenish character of my visual experience when I look at the tree outside my window (or stare hard at something red and then close my eyes). To use the now-standard locution introduced by Thomas Nagel, a subject’s mental state has qualia (or, equivalently, phenomenal properties) just in case there is something it is like for the subject to be in that state, and there are phenomenal similarities and differences among a subject’s mental states (that is, similarities and differences in their qualia) just in case there are similarities and differences in what it is like for that subject to be in those states. Qualia, in this sense, can be more or less specific: the state I am in at the moment can be an example of a migraine, a headache, a pain and, even more generally, a bodily sensation. And a mental state can have a distinctive phenomenal property, or quale, even if its subject cannot pick it out in terms any more descriptive than ‘I’m now feeling something funny’, or ‘I’ve never had an experience quite like this’. Sometimes the terms ‘quale’ and ‘qualia’ have been used more restrictively, to denote properties of mental states that are irreducibly nonphysical. ‘Qualia’ has also been used to denote ‘sense-data’, that is, image-like elements of perceptual experiences whose properties are directly and infallibly accessible to the subject of those experiences (and thus provide ‘data’ for our theories of the world). Indeed, C. I. Lewis, who is generally thought to have introduced the term, used ‘qualia’ in this way, and many others (e.g. Dennett 1988: 229) have understood ‘qualia’ to denote properties that are ‘ineffable, intrinsic, private, and directly or immediately apprehensible in consciousness’. Thus philosophical disputes about qualia have often taken the form of disputes about whether qualia exist, rather than about what sorts of properties qualia could be. But most philosophers now use these terms more neutrally, as characterized above - and attempt to argue that qualia must have (or can lack) these further metaphysical and epistemological characteristics. Perhaps the most contentious dispute about qualia is whether they can have a place in the physical world; whether, that is, they could be identical with physical, functional or otherwise natural properties, or must rather be regarded as irreducibly nonphysical features of our mental states. There are also significant epistemological questions about qualia - in particular, how we come to have knowledge of the phenomenal properties of our own mental states, whether our beliefs about these properties can be taken to be infallible, or at least to have some kind of special authority not possessed by our beliefs about the world outside our minds, and whether, and if so, how, we could have such knowledge of the mental states of others. In addition, it has traditionally been routine to distinguish ‘qualitative’ states such as sensations and perceptual experiences from purely representational (or intentional) states such as beliefs, thoughts and preferences, but this distinction is now under challenge. Thus another important question about qualia is how extensive they are in our mental lives: whether they are possessed by all our conscious mental states, including thoughts, beliefs, intentions and preferences, or merely some, such as sensations and perceptions.",

      "abstract": "Standard definitions posit the sign as a discrete entity in relation with other signs and standing for an object (either physical or psychological). Thus the sign has two roles, as prompt and as substitutive representation. The latter raises difficult questions about the relationship of the semiotic to the non-semiotic or pre-semiotic, which can be resolved logically (as in Peirce) or rejected as unanswerable (as in Saussure), but which can never be satisfactorily resolved empirically as the phenomenal cannot be divorced from the semiotic. This impasse can be resolved if we drop the assumption that the sign is essentially substitutive. The assumption of discrete entities, at either the phenomenal or the noumenal levels, is a function of discredited substance metaphysics. On a process metaphysical account, the reality of the sign is not attached to the discreteness of any pre-existing entity. The sign remains as prompt and as relational but not (other than sometimes with respect to other signs) substitutive. Rather than defined as standing for an object, the sign can now be regarded much more simply as a feature of an event. This conception of the sign is explored in terms of its implications for teaching and learning.",

Though latah has often been described as merely a Malay and Indonesian custom, similar startle‐matching and command obedience has been described in individuals from places as remote from southeast Asia as Siberia and the United States.

For Aristotle, thumos is not, as others have argued, a desire for the noble, social appraisal, or retaliation; rather, it is an inner drive or impulse to act. More precisely, it is an executory urge to implement or enact one’s ends or goals, whatever they are. Thumos accounts for someone’s proneness to spring into action and can contribute to bringing about rational or non-rational first-order desires. It is a second-order motivation, which both human and non-human animals have and that comes in degrees: we can be more or less thumotic, which amounts to being more or less disposed to making first-order desires effective so that they issue in actions. Aristotelian thumos, then, anticipates features of the modern notion of the will.",

      "title": "Constructing Abstract (Theoretical) Models of Actual (Material) Systems",
      "abstract": "The world around us is a global system, therefore, it can be said that all its elements are interconnected. The strength of the connections between the system’s elements and their groups is not uniform. In some cases, we can observe the links very clearly, in other cases, we assume that they exist, while, sometimes, we are not even aware of their existence. The existence of the connections of various strength shows that the particular elements are of different nature and possess some specific features and capacity allowing them to interact with others and form the particular structures when the same goal is pursued. These structures differ from others and make the systems of a particular level. Therefore, the elements relevant for the considered problem should be identified (or formed if an artificial system is considered). In other words, we should identify or form a system for solving an arising problem. Another important aspect of investigating an existing or specially formed system is associated with its reflection. To change or to manage a social economic system, for example, the state of an enterprise should be measured. This may be achieved only if all major aspects of its performance are described by the particular criteria. The values of the criteria allow us to plan the measures to be taken for improving enterprise performance. The analysis of the literature shows that we can hardly find a generally accepted concept and definition of the word ‘system’. However, a lot of various definitions are suggested. This may be explained by the fact that either various features of the system are emphasized, or not all relevant features are considered. In some cases, a definition includes too many features, often duplicating each other. Some researchers base themselves on a very wide ‘system’s’ definition, while others prefer a short one, embracing its essential features. Various approaches depend on the research objective, ‘system’s’ perception, and, finally, the researcher’s ability to see the essential features and understand the nature of the considered phenomenon. In terms of the research objective, investigators usually search for a versatile ‘system’s’ definition, while others prefer a short one, embracing its essential features. Various approaches depend on the research objective, ‘system’s’ perception, and, finally, on the researcher’s ability to see the essential features and understand the nature of the considered phenomenon. In terms of the research objective, investigators usually search for a versatile system’s definition suitable for studying any phenomenon at any investigation level. However, they also may try to find a multifunctional approach, giving the priority to general features of the system, rather than to its basic, principal characteristics, thereby restricting themselves to a ‘narrow’ definition suitable for solving a particular problem and achieving a particular goal. The latter approach makes sense only if it does not contradict a universal system’s concept and definition. This means that a universal concept and definition of the word ‘system’, which could be used as a basis for possible interpretations should be developed. The analysis of the available ‘system’s’ definitions allows us to suggest the following basic definition – a system is the structured whole of interacting elements. A basic category of the theory of systems is structure, which marks the beginning of system’s stabilization. However, we can see that a generally accepted definition of the concept ‘structure’ is also lacking. On the other hand, all definitions emphasize the same, probably, most essential, structure’s feature – the connections between the elements. In addition, the existence of the system and structure representing it is closely connected to the aim (purpose) of the system. It is the structure that orients the system to pursuing a particular aim. In mathematical terms, the establishing of invariable relations between the elements is necessary but insufficient for system formation. These relations should be properly directed, i.e. oriented to achieving the system’s aim. This may be obtained only by establishing hierarchical relations between the interacting elements, i.e. by structuring the elements according to the type of their subordination. It is the process of structuring of a set of interacting elements that gives them a particular orientation and turns them into a system. The analysis of various ‘structure’s’ definitions allows us to define it as a whole of constant relations between the elements oriented to achieving the system’s aim. Now, when the concepts of system and structure are clear, it is possible to investigate them. Classification, i.e. their subdivision into separate groups, is an efficient tool in this process. The analysis of the literature on the problem shows that, in various system’s classifications, various attributes are considered. For the case investigated in the present paper, system’s classification into actual (material) and theoretical (abstract) systems is relevant. The first class embraces the systems of organic and inorganic nature, while the second includes hypotheses, theories, formalized models, etc. In fact, the latter may be deduced from the former. Therefore, they are aimed at reflecting actual (material) systems. Thus, it may be stated that theoretical (abstract) systems are the models of actual (material) systems. - 8 - The following steps may be identified in the process of reflecting actual (material) systems by theoretical (abstract) models. First, the problem situation associated with the actual (material) system is described, then, the problem and the aim of its solution are stated. The existence of the reflected system’s problem situation, the problem and the aim of its solution determine the problem situation, the problem and the aim of the reflecting model.",

      "abstract": "The simplest way to characterize essences is to say that it makes a thing what it is.An object must have something very basic, unique, and intrinsic and more fundamental by which we can identify an object as it is.We always have a tendency to hold on something stable and discarding what is accidental and unstable.That means there is a neat dichotomy between the core vs the periphery, the central vs the margin, the permanent vs the temporary, the nec vs the possibility, the inner vs the outer.That means an object must have some properties that are essential for it and some other accidental.Now, question arises whether this basic property belongs to a particular individual or to a group.Is it unique to just one thing or these are mere concepts or ideas that are sharable or communicable or repetitive properties, or that is logically instantiable in a plurality of individuals.An individual unlike a class is spatio-temporally cohesive, it forms a unified singular unit; and hence the way in which an essence can be said to bring the spatio-temporally scattered individuals under a fixed and unitary enclosure cannot meaningfully be applied to an individual itself.And yet the individual in spite of its apparently compact unity throws up a tension between its essence and accidents.With inanimate objects the shape, size and colour may change, leaving the constituent",

This chapter surveys the available scientific evidence for episodic memory, mirror self-recognition, and the use of a theory of mind and certain other kinds of planning in a range of non-human animals. This chapter concludes that while “the usual suspects” (great apes, elephants, and cetaceans) are good candidates for near-personhood, there is at least one surprising “contender” (scrub jays) and that we may one day have strong evidence for a much wider range of mammals and birds.",

      "abstract": "Given the unwittingness of negligence, personal responsibility for negligent conduct is puzzling. After all, how is it that one is responsible for what one did not intend to do or was unaware that one was doing? How, therefore, is one’s agency involved with one’s negligence so as to ground one’s responsibility for it? Negligence is an unwitting failure in agency to meet a standard requiring conduct that falls within one’s competency. Accordingly, negligent conduct involves agency in that negligence is a manifestation of agency failure. Now, nobody’s perfect. Human agency is innately fallible, and a measure of agency failure is, therefore, unavoidable. The more one’s negligence manifests failure in one’s agency as an individual, the more one is responsible for it. In contrast, the more one’s negligence involves the shortcomings innate to all human agency the less responsible one becomes, because one’s agency as an individual is less and less involved in one’s failure. Determinative of the measure of individual and of human failings mixed into an instance of negligent phi -ing is the background quality of one’s agency at meeting one’s competency at phi -ing. That is, how able one is at delivering on what one is able to competently do. The more able, the less one’s occasional instances of negligence involve manifestations of failures of one’s agency as an individual—nobody’s perfect—and are more manifestations of one’s agency’s innate human fallibility, making one less and less responsible for one’s negligence.",

Thus, the characteristic occupation of the threshold, in the form of doorways, by homeless people symbolises an inability to make choices, whether with respect to identity or location in space. By refusing to inhabit a material, internal space, homeless people demonstrate, in concrete terms, the lack of an internal world capable of holding their anxieties. Mother's physical presence is sought in the proximity of the baby's personal body-space, and her emotional ability to contain anxiety is sought as a taking-in of a good object into the developing internal space of thought and feeling.",

Ignorance of human nature itself as a whole due to the limitations of human knowledge about him, especially in revealing spiritual things that are abstract. This limitation due to three factors: First, in the history of human life, he was more interested in investigating natural materials (concrete), than things that are immaterial (abstract). Secondly, the limitations of human reason are only able to think about things that are instrumental rather than things that are substantial and complex.

Our moral nature does not make us better because moral standards do not apply to animal action. Our higher capacities do not make us better off because the good of a creature is relative to the creature’s capacities. The two views share a common error. One thing can be better or better off than another only as measured by a standard common to both, not because different standards apply to them. The chapter also offers an explanation of the common intuition that death and certain harms are worse for more cognitively and emotionally sophisticated animals than for cognitively and emotionally simpler ones. While the explanation supports the intuition, doubts are raised about whether death is really less bad for some creatures than others.",

      "title": "“He can cane me to orgasm, or he can cane me to hysterical tears”: The Co-Construction of BDSM Experience",
      "abstract": "The potential of BDSM (Bondage, Domination, Sadism and Masochism) activity to create powerful, transformative or profound experiences is well known within BDSM communities. Academic discourse has also recognised that experiences of transcendence can be created by BDSM, but these have usually been presented within an essentialised framework that draws primarily on Christian mysticism to identify elements which are then presented as the core of all religious experience. This supports a common understanding of such experiences as wholly private and subjective internal states, separate from matters pertaining to the body of the experiencer or their inherent bodily relationality. It also creates an additional limitation to understanding BDSM experience, because it supports the assumption that such mystical-type experiences are only available to people taking the bottom/submissive role in a BDSM scene. By contrast my research suggests that transcendence is only one of a range of possible peaks of experience. The qualities that have been used by scholars to identify (and categorise as ‘spiritual’) exceptional BDSM experiences are actually common in any successful play and are shared by all players. Such successful play involves the forging and expression of relationship, intimacy and connection between play partners as they co-create a shared as-if reality and become immersed, together, within it. A successful BDSM scene is therefore a complementary and relational experience. This paper will explore those processes of co-creation, examining BDSM as a deliberate process of creating profound experiences that explore the boundaries of fantasy and reality in ways which are necessarily co-constructed and shared.",

Anyone who believes that Wittgenstein's remarks here embody important truths has quite a bit of explaining to do. What needs to be explained is why it is that enormous numbers of people, people who have never had the chance to be corrupted by reading Descartes or Dennett, are willing, with only the slightest prompting, to speak in ways which appear to conflict dramatically with Wittgenstein's thought. Many people appear to find no difficulty at all in the idea that we could ascribe thoughts, sensations, emotions and so on to things which in no way resemble or behave like a living human being—for example to disembodied ‘minds’ or ‘souls’ or disembodied brains floating in tanks. And with a little more pressing many will agree that it is never to the living human being that these states are, strictly speaking, correctly ascribed; but, rather, to one part of the living human being—the brain, for example. Now if this incredibly widespread tendency is the expression of confusion then we need an explanation of its existence. We need this partly because without it it will be difficult to undermine the tendency; and partly because we might expect that such a widespread tendency is a distortion of some truth.",

Both fantasies have been invested in the creation of the two paradigmatic figures of our time – the neoliberal homo economicus and the white masculine master of his property and affairs. Both desires have, additionally, rested upon numerous erasures not only of vulnerability and inter/dependence in general, but also and significantly of the body. I argue, however, that the desire to be bodiless goes hand in hand with the desire to place and possess bodies, as material or symbolic property, which are for various reasons denied the capacity to be self-actualizing, indivisible, and independent. Robinson Crusoe works as a fictional figure with which a self-possessed master identifies with and desires to return to.",

Thus conceived, mind traditionally has justified, and so strengthened, the ingenuous a priori regard and appreciation which unlearned persons extend to their fellows for the sole reason that they are human. Upon this conception of mind numerous popular doctrines of “personal dignity,” “human equality”, “individual liberty”, “freedom of conscience”, “inalienable rights”, and so forth, have been rationally grounded.

One has one's times according to where one stands corporeally, above all in terms of classes. Times older than the present continue to effect older strata; here it is easy to return or dream one's way back to older times. Certainly, a person who is simply awkward and who for that reason is not up to the demands of his position, is only personally unable to keep up. But what if there are other reaons why he does not fit into a very modern organization, such as the after-effects of peasant descent, what if he is an earlier type? In general, different years resound in the one that has just been recorded and prevails. Moreover, they do not emerge in a hidden way as previously but rather, they contradict the Now in a very peculiar way, awry, from the rear. The strength of this untimely course has become evident; it promised nothing less than new life, despite its looking to the old. Even the masses flock to it since the unbearable Now at least seems different with Hitler, who paints good old things for everyone. There is nothing more unexpected, nothing more dangerous than this power of being at once fiery and puny, contradicting and nonsynchronous.

      "title": "Chapter I: A Plethora of Evils: Introducing the Negative Characters",
      "abstract": "In reality, however, every ego, so far from being a unity is in the highest degree a manifold world, a constellated heaven, a chaos of forms, of states and stages, of inheritances and potentialities.1The names of the characters in English and Dutch drama of the late medieval and early modem eras make it clear that there was a proliferation of negative conceptual characters.2 These names by themselves give little further information as to the kind of character involved: it could be a protagonist, a minor vice, a devil, or, depending on whether it is an English or a Dutch play, a Vice or a sinne ken. The distinction between these various kinds of characters resides to some extent in their dramatic function: the protagonists tend to be victims whereas the vices, Vice, and sinnekens tend to be instigators of the action. Another distinguishing factor is the prominence given to characters: the Vice and sinnekens generally have more lines and more stage presence than the minor vices. Their theatricality can also tell us something about the characters: the Vice and sinnekens are normally more entertaining and memorable than the other characters. The distinction between the devil on the one hand and the Vice, sinnekens, and minor vices on the other seems to have been primarily one of costume. The other element of difference lies in the fact that the devil is not a personification but rather a 'theological-mythological being' unlike the other kinds of negative characters who are personifications of negative human characteristics and who are to some degree represented as humans.3Three forms of personification are particularly important for the moral plays under discussion.4 Firstly, there is personification or prosopopoeia, i.e. 'the translation of any non-human quantity into a sentient human capable of thought and language, possessing voice and face', as Reason in Medwall's Nature. Secondly, characters can be formed by isotyping, i.e. 'the representation of a collective where there is only a quantitative difference between the abstract personified and its personifier', which is used in the everyman figure. Thirdly, there is typification leading to 'exemplary property characters', that is 'characters who exemplify the abstract qualities reflected in their names', such as Den Daghelicxschen Snaetere (The Daily Chatterbox) in Everaert's Tspel van dOnghelycke Munte (The Play of Unequal Coinage). Typification is a variety of isotyping, and I shall use the term type to describe characters based on either personification strat egy. The main distinction between personification, on the one hand, and isotyping and typification, on the other hand, is that the former tends to lead to unchangeable, immortal characters - even if they are visually represented as humans -, whereas types tend to be changeable and mortal.Minor vices, the Vice, and sinnekens typically are personifications whereas the protagonists are normally types. However, this distinction is not always maintained. In the Dutch plays there tends to be a great deal of emphasis on the personified nature of especially the sinnekens: they are represented as eternal, general evils and they do not fear death. In the English plays, on the other hand, the supposedly immortal and unchangeable characters can be susceptible to death: Newguise in Mankind escapes being hanged and Courage in The tyde taryeth no man (henceforth Tide) is taken off to his execution at the end of the play.5 They are occasionally changeable: Perverse Doctrine in A new Enterlude ... entituled New Cusiome (henceforth New Custom) converts.6 Given the fact that the Vice and sinnekens and the minor vices normally belong to the same personification category, and given the oscillation between different personification strategies in the English tradition, the personified status of the Vice and sinnekens cannot be used to distinguish them from other vice characters. The boundaries between the various kinds of negative characters are not firm or clear in either the Dutch or the English plays and perhaps it would be foolhardy to define the different characters rigorously as this would go against the fluidity exemplified in the plays. …",

I will call all of these things ‘aims.’ Sometimes we respect another person's aims simply by refraining from doing certain things, such as treating her in ways that thwart her aims, or interfering with her attempt to pursue them. Other times we respect a person's aims by taking positive action to help her pursue them. But how exactly does respect for persons translate into respect for their aims? And which aims merit respect?

      "abstract": "In this paper we have described a number of common characteristics found in individuals who have committed impulsive senseless murders. These characteristics were: severe weakness of impulse control; blurring of the boundaries between fantasy and reality, with periods of altered states of consciousness; blunted and shallow emotional reactions; and a violent and primitive fantasy life. This constellation seems to have grown out of a history characterized by extreme parental violence and early severe emotional deprivation. In these cases, there appeared an ego weakness which allowed the periodic breakthrough of intense aggressive impulses, sometimes of homicidal proportion. When such apparently senseless murders occur, they are seen to be an end result of a period of increasing tension and disorganization in the murderer starting before the contact with the victim who, by fitting into the unconscious conflicts of the murderer, unwittingly serves to set into motion his homicidal potential. It remains a task of future research to: 1. Differentiate these individuals from other murderers as well as from others with similar disturbances but who do not kill; 2. Weigh the significance of the individual factors described; 3. Devise measures for identifying and effectively controlling these individuals before they commit murder.",

My approach has been to see the analyst (myself) as embedded in the same world as actors, but moving about in it in a different way, circulating across sites, and thus seeing different things, or at least, seeing things differently.

      "title": "Do toddlers reason about other people’s experiences of objects? A limit to early mental state reasoning",
      "abstract": "Human social life requires an understanding of the mental states of one’s social partners. Two people who look at the same objects often experience them differently, as a twinkling light or a planet, a 6 or a 9, and a random cat or Cleo, their pet. Indeed, a primary purpose of communication is to share distinctive experiences of objects or events. Here, we test whether toddlers (14-15 months) are sensitive to another agent’s distinctive experiences of pictures when determining the goal underlying the agent’s actions in a minimally social context. Across seven experiments (n = 206), toddlers viewed either videotaped or live events in which an actor, whose perspective differed from their own, reached (i) for pictures of human faces that were upright or inverted or (ii) for pictures that depicted a rabbit or a duck at different orientations. Then either the actor or the toddler moved to a new location that aligned their perspectives, and the actor alternately reached to each of the two pictures. By comparing toddlers’ looking to the latter reaches, we tested whether their goal attributions accorded with the actor’s experience of the pictures, with their own experience of the pictures, or with no consistency. In no experiment did toddlers encode the actor’s goal in accord with his experiences of the pictures. In contrast, in a similar experiment that manipulated the visibility of a picture rather than the experience that it elicited, toddlers (n = 32) correctly expected the actor’s action to depend on what was visible and occluded to him, rather than to themselves. In a verbal version of the tasks, older children (n = 35) correctly inferred the actor’s goal in both cases. These findings provide further evidence for a dissociation between two kinds of mental state reasoning: When toddlers view an actor’s object-directed action under minimally social conditions, they take account of the actor’s visual access to the object but not the actor’s distinctive experience of the object.",

      "title": "The Failure of Hate",
      "abstract": "From outset, one must admit that the failure of is hardly a hopeful phrase - at best, it is a sort of double negative whereby one negates hate without necessarily moving toward a more positive statement regarding relationships between human beings. Indeed, when one reads Sartre's Being and Nothingness,1 one is also struck by failure of love, and, in some ways, failure of any sort of relational interaction between two beings-forthemselves. The gaze of other, whether cast in love or in hate, objectifies, seeks to possess or reduce, and perhaps even annihilate other. Likewise, one both desires and fears that look, that gaze, directed upon oneself. Sartre himself acknowledges this impasse at end of Being and Nothingness, and suggests that this question of authentic relations, or ethics, is his next project. We all know, however, that this project - construction of an ethics-was never completed (or was left to us to complete),2 and thus we are left to sort through his notebooks, essays, and other works in order to piece together possibility of an ethics emerging from rather bleak landscape of Being and Nothingness. I shall contend here that while Sartre does indeed move away from this double negative of failure of hate via Marxism and a turn to a more socially oriented ethic, he does not fully escape shadow cast by Being and Nothingness, nor does he aim to do so. In this essay, therefore, I sketch a portrait of hate according to Sartre, using not only Being and Nothingness, but also Anti-Semite and Jew and several fictional works; I bring alongside this analysis some reflections on hate as it appears in Notebooks for an Ethics, and ask what this indicates regarding a Sartrean ethic. I then examine What is Literature? and Hope Now in order to do justice to more complex articulations of human relationships that Sartre explores in these works; articulations that indeed point toward a notion of human freedom that is more than merely ontological.3 What I hope to provide is a description of how hate operates viscerally both with regard to gaze or look of others and in oneself in Sartre's early works, and to use such a description to illuminate ongoing and unresolved complications that result when one tries to construct a coherent ethic out of Sartre's writings. Ultimately, what I think we find in early Sartre is both a compelling portrait of hate, and an equally compelling image of its failure; but something less than an answer to or solution for problem of such human interaction. This leaves us with an odd sort of hope, a recognition that hate is not total or totalizing, that there is always an escape, even into death; but it may not take us as far as we would like. I link this description to Hope Now, recognizing that latter is controversial, and that its ownership is in question. Yet it is precisely in questioning of origins of utterances that we may find modeled a sort of that does not annul Sartre's earlier work, but that nevertheless casts it in a light more along lines of beingtogether as a sort of thrownness that cannot be helped and that constitutes my situation. This being-together in mutual recognition is certainly helpful and more hopeful than what we find in Being and Nothingness, but I contend that it is still less than a compelling and robust ethic. Stones and Mirrors One of pleasures of studying Sartre is wide variety of genres he provides his audience. In this section, I take advantage of both Sartre's theoretical and narrative works in order to develop a more multi-faceted account of hate and inauthenticity than one may glean from an isolated account of either his philosophical texts or his fiction. Specifically, by bringing Anti-Semite and Jew, along with Being and Nothingness, alongside Childhood of a Leader and No Exit, I want to illuminate both abstractly and concretely Sartre's portrait of hatred and demonstrate his consistency with regard to its failures. …",

      "title": "The origins of face perception: specific versus non‐specific mechanisms",
      "abstract": "Abstract Many studies have demonstrated that newborns prefer upright faces over upside‐down faces. Based on this evidence, some have suggested that faces represent a special class of stimuli for newborns and there is a qualitative difference between the processes involved in perception of facelike and non‐facelike patterns (i.e. structural hypothesis). Others suggest that there is no reason to suppose that faces are different from other patterns, because faces, like any other class of visual stimuli, are subject to filtering by the properties of the visual system (i.e. sensory hypothesis). The core question that will be addressed in the present paper is whether, to manifest itself, face preference requires the unique structure of the face, represented by the relative spatial location of its internal features, or rather some more general properties that other stimuli may also possess. Evidence will be presented supporting the idea that newborns do not respond to facelike stimuli by ‘facedness’ but, rather, by some general structural characteristics that best satisfy the constraints of the immature visual system.

      "abstract": "Normal, young men and women who believed they may have lived a previous life (n = 21) or who did not endorse (n = 52) this belief of \"reincarnation\" were exposed to partial sensory deprivation and received transcerebral stimulation by burst-firing magnetic fields over either the left or right hemisphere. Individuals who reported belief in reincarnation could be discriminated from nonbelievers by their more frequent report of experiences of tingling sensations, spinning, detachment of consciousness from the body, and intrusions of thoughts that were not attributed to the sense of self. The results support the hypothesis that there may be neurocognitive processes which identify experiences as originating from the sense of self (episodic or autobiographical memory) or \"not self.\" When anomalous experiences are beyond the boundary of the experiences contained with the generalization gradient of concurrent autobiographical memory, they are more likely to be attributed to culturally available default explanations such as living a previous life.",

In medicine, trauma means a physical injury caused by impact, force, or object penetrating the skin. In psychology, psychological trauma refers to an emotional or psychological injury, usually resulting from an extremely stressful or life‐threatening situation. It is common to differentiate between man‐made trauma or disasters and natural disasters. Man‐made is further differentiated between trauma resulting from accidents or unintended damage, loss and breakdown of systems, and trauma resulting from the ultimate betrayal as in sexual abuse and violence against children, and the intentional infliction of severe pain and systematic destruction of human mind and dignity as in torture. As will become clear, intentions, meanings, and understanding are important elements in the context of psychological trauma.

      "abstract": "Humans do not have a monopoly on emotionality. More than a century ago, Charles Darwin (1872) provided compelling arguments that some animals, especially mammals, are capable of expressing human-like emotions. Today, an increasing body of research convincingly demonstrates that most nonhuman primates possess the same basic neural circuitry and exhibit the same general patterns of neurochemical change that have been implicated in human emotional expression (cf. Panksepp, 1998). Monkeys and apes routinely display characteristic patterns of emotional expression that seem strikingly similar to, if not homologous with, those routinely exhibited by infants and young children in virtually every human culture studied to date. To be sure, some complex emotions such as shame are most likely exclusively human, but they apparently require cognitive capabilities well beyond those of human infants and nonhuman primates of any age (cf. Lewis, 1992). The more basic emotions, such as fear, interest, surprise, and rage, are clearly expressed soon after birth by human and nonhuman primate infants alike, and their expression is usually obvious to all around; that is, they serve as highly visible and salient social signals (cf. Suomi, 1997b).",

However, effort alone is not enough, Allah also commands humans to pray (ask) to Him from every thing that humans want. This study will review the relationship between prayer and effort in the perspective of the Qur'an. By using the thematic method and the scientific approach of munasabah, it is concluded that the hopes desired by humans must be realized in the form of a sincere endeavor. Should not just stand idly by the results of the expectations he wants. At the same time, these hopes must also be realized in the form of prayer to Allah SWT as the One Who is All-Powerful over everything.

Such skills are essential for day-to-day human interactions and are particularly important in bonded relationships. The ability to understand another's perspective and wants has generally been considered to be to humans, but the benefits of such skills could confer an adaptive advantage for many species. Thus, these skills may be present in non-human animals but just difficult to demonstrate. Ostojic et al. use a suite of controlled experiments in Eurasian jays and find evidence that state attribution is present in these monogamous birds. Specifically, consumption of one preferred food by females reduced their desire for it later, when compared with another preferred food. They showed that males were attuned to this specific satiety and flexibly offered females the preferred food that they had not been offered previously. The authors ruled out several alternative explanations, such as the potential that the female was giving behavioral cues during the feeding: Males had to be able to observe the initial feeding in order to best judge what the female would most want next. Besides demonstrating that male Eurasian jays make thoughtful and observant mates, these results suggest that state attribution may not be ours alone.\n\nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

However, Spinoza argues that individuals—all or some—not only try to maintain themselves, but to increase their power. Guided by the imagination alone, though, the desire for more power can endanger the desire to preserve oneself, and they are only identical in an activity the imagination cannot grasp, that of increasing one's rationality. Spinoza never posits a natural desire for knowledge, and it is only through the cunning of imagination that such a desire could ever develop out of a mind limited to the imagination. Crucial to that development is the development of sociability, as we find that we best both preserve and increase our power through interaction with other people. Human social relations are unique because it is only there that one individual can increase its power without decreasing the power of something else.",

Based on this, in this paper it is postulated that there are somatizations that only indicate an excess, others that mimic a stimulus or an imaginary scene and others that symbolize an affective situation and complex links in conflict. To address them, it is proposed to study the relationship between perception, mark and representation, taking into account the relationship between the world, the body and the other.Like a banner on the street congratulating a graduation or announcing a private event, the process of condensation of the body, the world and the other is fixed on the skin or on an organ and exposed to all as a mark that can be perceived forever. Everything works as if that mark has been registered separately from the one that promotes words and language, has replaced it to face certain realities and has been linked to an innervation, an organ, a chemical reaction or a genetic expression. The person and the body of the analyst must allow themselves to be involved in that private event through a particular transference that must be understood and interpreted through analytical acts and a more active attitude than the traditional one, without losing sight of the most consistent knowledge of his theory and practice.",

      "abstract": "Belief in the existence of supernatural powers and day-to-day unexplainable experiences has led the Nyishis into believing in other than the material visible world i.e. in the invisible spiritual world or supernatural power.

      "abstract": "The structure of human subjectivity is perhaps Levinas' key concern. How does a subject emerge into a world, and what governs and guides relations between subjects? For Levinas, to be a subject is not only to be always and already with others, but more importantly, it is to be for others in such a way that the relation between the self and the other is not played out on a plane of intersubjectivity where the other and the self would stand on level ground as equals. I am not the equal of the other, nor is the other person another similar to myself. Such a relation in which it is a matter of the mutuality and the reciprocity of the same, as found in Buber, is criticised by Levinas. The relation with the other person is a relation which lacks symmetry. There is no level playing field; the other person occupies a higher position than I do, even though he or she is often encountered in his or her destitution. Height is a moral quality before ever geometrical space comes into play.",

Some are eager to arrive at a statistical measure: at its simplest, a is a settlement of a certain size. Others have in mind an ideal type, approached perhaps by Greek polis or a Renaissance city-state, and urban places are then judged in accordance with how closely they conform to ideal. Thus a settlement may be deemed too small or too agricultural in its major functions; on other hand, Imperial Rome or a modern metropolis may be deemed too large and lacking in physical as well as in sociopolitical coherence. A third group of scholars look at statement the of city and understand word nature to carry sense of origin. To know or essence of a thing-whether it be tragic drama, religion, or city-one must seek its primitive forms. This viewpoint may be characterized as etymological, because it tends to identify true meaning with root meaning.1 It is futile to seek a definition of that commands universal assent. We ask different questions and necessarily arrive at different answers. This does not mean, however, that all answers are equally arbitrary or revealing. For instance, few scholars think statistical criterion, used alone, is satisfactory. From experience we know that cities differ in character and intensity of their urban life. The problem is to conceive of a scale that is least arbitrary.

The final category involves physical characteristics that compromise bodily appearance or functioning. Whether voluntarily or involuntarily acquired, abominations of the body can be regarded as a form of deviance. Like the other types of stigma, undesirable physical characteristics isolate some individuals, disqualifying them from “full social acceptance” (p. 1). Everything about the stigmatized person is interpreted in light of the negative trait, so that interaction with the non‐stigmatized is often awkward and uncertain. Tension is manifest in people's tendency to avoid eye contact, make guarded references to the stigma, or avoid everyday words that suddenly become taboo; it leads both parties to consider avoiding or withdrawing from encounters.",

      "abstract": "“More Human Than Human”:“Flattening of Affect,” Synthetic Humans, and the Social Construction of Maleness Jordana Greenblatt We’re all schizophrenic, with defective emotional lives—flattening of affect, it’s called. What I’ve done … that’s become alien to me. In fact everything about me has become unnatural; I’ve become an unnatural self. Philip K. Dick Do Androids Dream of Elecric Sheep? In philip k. dick’s novel, androids are unable to empathize with or feel for others. Their absence of spontaneous emotional response to hypothetical scenarios is the diagnostic used to distinguish them from humans. Androids’ disconnection from others and lack of affective response constitute the “affective flattening” to which Pris, an android, refers, understood in Dick’s novel as a defect that, when unattributable to mental illness, marks one as other than human. Thus, above, Pris lies to her human interlocutor, misattributing the cause of her affective flattening in order to provide a human explanation for the feature used to identify androids, who are subject to being “retired,” a euphemism for their summary execution. In this affective deficit and its implications for human identity, Pris [End Page 41] and her fellow androids (“andys”) are hardly alone. Dick’s novel, Ridley Scott’s film adaptation, Blade Runner, and (writer) Ronald Moore and (producer) David Eick’s recent Battlestar Galactica television series are a few examples of a trend that proliferates from the 1950s onwards.1 In such science-fiction texts, humans build and often come into conflict with beings that have been created by humans or have evolved from those created by humans. These beings are almost indistinguishable from humans, except, of course, for that all-important lack of emotional connection: that necessary flattening of affect. While critics generally frame such texts as questioning the nature of the human,2 they represent specifically gendered anxieties. Synthetic humans are distinguished from “real” humans by a particular form of emotional insufficiency. While they usually do feel, they generally lack abilities to know and understand their feelings, feel in relation to others, and/or empathize with or understand the feelings of others. Commenting on the historical shift in the attributes characterizing synthetic humans, Despina Kakoudaki argues that “If for Descartes … automata differ from people because they have … no reason, by the early twentieth century artificial people differ from real people because all they have is reason” (181). Andys, replicants, and Galactica’s Cylons can all have implanted memories, which means that characters can be synthetic without knowing it. Given that the shift Kakoudaki identifies undermines modernity’s ideal of the human-as-rational-subject, it is unsurprising that the Galactica character who most persistently questions whether or not he is a Cylon [End Page 42] is Gaius Baltar, whom we initially meet as a scientist with an important role in the human Colonies’ defense system and who places great stock in his own rationality. Both Baltar’s investment in rationality and his sex are relevant; given white, Western maleness’s (and normative masculinity’s) association with logic, reason, and denying and flattening affect and femaleness’s (and normative femininity’s) with emotionality, emotional intelligence, and empathy, any sense that emotionality defines the human has gendered implications. Modernity’s rational subject, associated with Enlightenment ideals and the Classical traditions they draw on, is one whose maleness, Westernness, and whiteness has historically been used as the measure against which disenfranchised groups, including women, people of colour, and the colonized, have fallen short, judged insufficiently rational and overly emotional. It is therefore his identity that comes into question when reason is no longer a guarantor of human identity. As Alison Jagger notes, The western tradition has not seen everyone as equally emotional. Instead, reason has been associated with members of dominant political, social, and cultural groups and emotion with members of subordinate groups. Prominent among these subordinate groups in our society are people of color, except for supposedly “inscrutable orientals,” and women. (157)3 As emotion replaces rationality as the metric distinguishing humanity from its synthetic doubles, the science-fiction characters that most question if they are human are the rationalist scientist (Galactica) and the hardboiled man of action (Androids and Blade...",

Such a view fundamentally misunderstands the biological significance of all behaviours that occur in the context of attack, defence or threat. Deeply routed in the demands of the natural world, the ability to assert oneself represents a critical solution to any individual's need for self-preservation, defence of its interests or resource competition. Examples of aggression are found throughout the entire animal kingdom, regardless of its bearer's specific neural or cognitive faculties, phylogenetic origins or sociobiological circumstances.

The four clues that consist of some moral emotions(惻隱, 羞惡), attitude (辭讓之心) and reason(是非之心) are the senses to be considerate of others. Secondly, human beings each can perceive their competence but not perfectly, so need human relations. Finally, the four clues and seven emotions as reflective selfconsciousness, therefore, partly have appearance of public. Yi Hwang suggests that people have to face Li 理 before they meet everyday life and other people for being moral. It means that they recognize and secure the four clues from Li 理 in their mind. It is called ‘Ham Yang涵養’, which means cultivating one’s mind before the issuance of emotions(未發), and ‘Seong Chal 省察’ after the already issued(已發). If always so[主理], their behaviors bring about the effect of Jung Jeol中節 like as moderation, germaneness and gainliness. Yi Ik succeeds to the concept of 主理 and interprets it as Gong 公 which means public and impartial. It means that the fairness and justice of Li 理 always act anywhere through human impartial reason and behavior. Moreover he insists seven emotions also have possibility to result in germaneness only after it was cultivated, in that case they can be called Gong 公 as the public emotions. Yi Hwang’s ‘中節’ and Yi Ik’s ‘公’ mean harmonious state among people. So Their Four-Seven theories as reflective selfconsciousness already include the ethics of otherness. They pretend to develop responsibilities for the society especially from scholars士 and political man to protect society against the political power over ruled by letting control their private emotions and recognize four clues in their mind.

      "title": "Elementary concepts of medicine: VI. Genesis of illness: pathogenesis, aetiogenesis",
      "abstract": "Illness, a particular case of it, begins when the definition of the somatic anomaly at the core of the concept (as proximate genus) is first satisfied. Antecedent to this time-point, the case has its genesis, coming into being, and from this time-point forward, the case of illness has its course. On first thought it might appear to be obvious that the genesis of a case of illness inherently is entirely antecedent to its inception (and course); but it is not. The course of illness in the population of cells in a tissue can be like that of abnormally high morbidity (epidemic, endemic) in the population of persons in a community – its continuation after its inception sustained by continual conversions from normal to abnormal, that is, by continual genesis. The idea of genesis always being entirely antecedent to an anomaly's inception does apply on the level of individual cells but not on the level of tissue: a person's case of illness may be sustained by continual genesis of it, as in iron-deficiency anaemia, for example. Medical dictionaries define genesis as: 'the coming into being of anything; the process of originating' (Dorland 1994); or 'an origin or beginning process' (Stedman 1995). Though not clear from these definitions, we believe that the medical concept of genesis, in the context of illness, like the biblical and cosmological ones in the context of the world, presupposes that the outcome (here the illness) already has come into being. From the vantage of the illness already being present, its genesis naturally is its origin as a retrospective concept of its having come into being. (From the vantage of the antecedent normalcy, it would not be a matter of originating but a matter of the prospective coming into being of the illness, including, most notably, whether it will.) The coming into being we do not see as a matter of 'process' only; for, beyond this descriptive issue, there is the explanatory – causal – one. Let us consider carcinogenesis as an example. The dictionaries define it as: 'the production of carcinoma' (Dorland 1994); or 'the origin or production, or development of cancer, including carcinomas and other malignant neoplasms' (Stedman 1995). These definitions do not quite cohere with their general, non-specific genesis counterparts above; and the meaning of 'production' in this context is obscure to us. But consistent with our general concept of the genesis of illness (above), carcinogenesis to us is the retrospective, post hoc concept of origin, the 'historical' coming into being of carcinoma (or cancer more generally) that has in fact come into being, a matter of both how and why it came into being. Given this retrospective conceptualization of carcinogenesis, the particular nature (e.g. cell type) and location of the cancer are givens. Thus, as for lung cancer, for example, one distinguishes between the genesis of squamous-cell carcinoma in a central location and that of a peripherally located adenocarcinoma. The genesis of an illness, including carcinogenesis, obviously is a concept related to that of pathogenesis. Our medical dictionaries define pathogenesis as follows: 'the development of morbid conditions or of disease; more specifically the cellular events and reactions and other pathologic mechanisms occurring in the development of disease' (Dorland 1994); or 'the pathologic, physiologic, or biochemical mechanism resulting in the development of a disease or morbid process' (Stedman 1995). Clearly implicit in the concept of pathogenesis is the premise that the illness outcome actually is developing, so that the concept is conditional on this outcome and hence indeed retrospective from this vantage, as we have insisted above. The key word in both of these definitions is that favourite one of modern academic medicine: 'mechanism'. The corresponding concept the dictionaries define as: '1. A machine or machine-like structure. 2. The manner of combination of parts, processes, etc., which subserve a common function. 3. The theory that the phenomena of life are based on the same physical and chemical laws which operate in the inorganic world; opposed to vitalism' (Dorland 1994); or '1. An arrangement or grouping of the parts of anything that has a definite action. 2. The means by which an effect is obtained' (Stedman 1995). These definitions, quite remarkable per se, shed no light on the question of whether pathogenesis is genesis (of illness) in the descriptive sense only; that is, whether it concerns merely how a case of illness developed, or how the illness develops in general – each of these as a matter of successive stages of pathology intermediate between normal soma and the anomaly that is definitional to the illness (as its proximate genus). The other possibility is that pathogenesis is the comprehensive concept of the genesis of illness, inclusive of the causal influences that initiate and/or drive forward the sequence of somatic changes leading to the illness-defining anomaly. Against this background of incomplete clarity we posit that pathogenesis of an illness is that part of its origin (retrospectively, for illness that has come into being) which is constituted by the somatic process of transformation from normal soma to the somatic anomaly that is definitional to the illness. This is a descriptive concept, one of how, rather than why, the anomaly in a given instance did come into being or in general does come into being. The 'why' aspect of the genesis of illness, rather than descriptive, is inferential, causally interpretive, explanatory – a matter of what initiated and/or sustained the pathogenetic process. For this 'neighbour' of pathogenesis a natural term we take to be 'aetiogenesis' (Miettinen 1998; Miettinen 1999). A neologism as this term is, it is not an entry in our medical dictionaries, but its synonym (Miettinen 1998; Miettinen 1999) 'aetiology' is. The concept of aetiology one of these dictionaries (Dorland 1994) defines as follows: 'the study or theory of the factors that cause disease and the method of their introduction to the host; the causes or origin of a disease or disorder'. The other one (Stedman 1995) gives a definition closely similar to this. And the specialists in aetiologic research, epidemiologists, put the essence of aetiology thus: 'Literally, the science of causes, causality; in common usage, cause' (Last 1995). The ordinary medical concept of aetiology we take to be as well-established as it is poorly expressed in the medical and epidemiologic dictionaries. It corresponds to pathogenesis (as a retrospective concept) and is that of causal origin of illness (that has come into being). It is this aetiologic genesis or aetiogenesis, rather than pathologic genesis or pathogenesis, that a clinician is especially prone to contemplate during the process of pursuing diagnosis and especially upon having come to diagnosis of the presence of a particular illness, a commonly iatrogenic (doctor-caused) illness in particular. Insight into the aetiology/aetiogenesis of a diagnosed case of illness is a matter of having come to causal explanation of the occurrence, that is, of its pathogenesis having taken place. This knowing about aetiology/aetiogenesis of a particular, diagnosed case of illness we term 'aetiognosis' (Miettinen 1998; Miettinen 1999). A given antecedent of the illness outcome resulting from the pathogenetic process was aetiologic to the case of illness if, and only if, it had the 'but for' property of: everything else aetiologically relevant having remained the same, the illness would not have developed (at the time it did) but for the presence of that antecedent (in lieu of its defined alternative, as an initiator and/or driver of the pathogenesis). Commonly, a case of illness has multiple causes that jointly constituted a sufficient cause. To take a trivial example, a case of communicable disease arises from the sufficient cause that consists of the joint presence of two necessary causes: effective exposure (environmental) together with susceptibility (constitutional). In general, aetiologic antecedents of illness fall in the three broad categories of constitutional, environmental and behavioural. Even though the consideration of the genesis of an illness ordinarily focuses on the inception of the illness, the concepts of pathogenesis and aetiogenesis apply just as readily to any subsequent stage of illness, including non-recovery outcome.",

For example, conditioned reinforcers are not automatically reinforcing. Stimuli or events which were once neutral in value may acquire reinforcing properties as a result of being paired with events which are already reinforcing — either primary or other conditioned reinforcers. By repeatedly presenting a neutral stimulus prior to or along with a reinforcing stimulus, the neutral stimulus becomes a reinforcer. For example, praise may not be reinforcing for some people: therefore to establish it as a reinforcer it must be paired with an event that is reinforcing, such as food or money. Then when a behaviour is performed, the individual is praised and reinforced with money. After several pairings of the praise with money, the praise alone will serve as a reinforcer.",

The sociological approach focuses on persons who seeks to connect with Allah, and asks about why they want to connect. They are mostly urban men of culture, education, and wealth enjoying public acclaim during, and also after, their lifetime. The second conclusion turns to the process, the search itself and asks if it is an existential process. It focuses on what is linked to Allah, and asks about the nature of the links. Its advocates dwell in the mystery of the Name. Allah exceeds the Name, even as the Name itself becomes a focus of attention on Allah as an immeasurable force, the source of life and death, good and evil, hope and despair. Yet neither the sociological assessment nor the existential response will satisfy the skeptic. The skeptic may be a believer or unbeliever, but they never cease to ask: where is Allah, and when does the quest end? They assert that Allah, or God, may not exist or may exist, but only as Being—infinite, timeless, and unknowable.",

The community of minds of the concept of faith, which is equally accepted by all of them, is not necessary for the individual to self-identify. It chooses by itself what to believe and defines the concept of faith itself. Faith in its religious version becomes a necessary condition for the integrity of human consciousness. It is worth considering whether the abstract concepts defined in the mind of Homo Sapiens or its eventual desomatised aethereal being would have the same or similar connotations in the artificial variant of intelligence they created, bearing in mind that their creation presumably does not have a classical evolutionary component, nor a biochemical carrier to bind it to previous experience in the likeness of its creator.",

As this is the earliest object-relation, the beginnings of which reach into the nebulous times where the frontiers of ego and external world merge into each other, it is of paramount importance both theoretically and practically. In the case of primitive object-relation an alteration in the behaviour towards the object is not necessarily the consequence of an altered emotional attitude (love, hate), but originates in the child's naive egoism. The first disturbance of the naive egoism is caused by the mother's turning away from her growing child. To sum up: the child who has outgrown his infancy is no longer so agreeable to the mother, nevertheless he clings to her and does not know any other form of love but that of his naive egoism.",

      "title": "Forgiveness: human and divine",
      "abstract": "Human forgiveness is always a personal response to personal wrong. In this it differs from pardon, which is a social activity undertaken only by one qualified to do so. Forgiveness is different from both understanding and tolerance in its response to personal wrong. True forgiveness always includes the letting go of resentment and results in healing for the one who forgives. Prior to an act of forgiveness, repentance on the part of the wrongdoer is desirable, but not essential. When repentance does take place, forgiveness includes a measure of trust being placed in the one forgiven. Since forgiveness is difficult, there are ways in which it is falsified, knowingly or unknowingly. Forgiveness is also difficult for the one being forgiven. He should be given the opportunity to make reparation. Many situations involve wrongs on both sides with a consequent need for mutual forgiveness. Sometimes an individual will feel it appropriate to repent of wrongs committed by those whom he is seen to represent. Self-forgiveness, though difficult to understand and open to abuse, is a real and necessary activity. God’s forgiveness is examined from the three-fold perspective of release from debt, justification, and the personal bearing of hurt and renewal of fellowship. Each perspective is found in the teaching of Jesus and Paul, although their emphases differ. From all three perspectives, the Gross is found to be the cost of forgiveness. Finally, the thesis notes the elements common to human and divine forgiveness. Both are personal, and so involve the feelings. Forgiveness is costly for both man and God. It is risky, for it can be refused or abused. It is a necessity, since both man and God have a deep need to be reconciled to those from whom they are estranged.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT The oldest Norse and Celtic literature is likely to treat of exceptionalities, including those that we would call disabilities, in a fashion quite unlike that to which we are accustomed to find in modern literature. In the archaic literature, we find mythological motifs about contact with the supernatural and the related notion of a trade-off of a body part for superhuman abilities, and at the same time we notice a general disinterest in impairments as they might affect a character's competence. While there does seem to be some concern for dangers an individual's impairment might pose to society and some desire for cures, there is no evidence for the later disabling notion of daemonic possession, little recognition that impairments might be medical conditions or personal tragedies, and no hint of marginalizing pity or consequent charity.",

This is the reason why wise states will not endure, in the midst of effort and industriousness, that sort of political parasitism which is confused by stern moralists with the idleness of wealth accumulated by hard work. This latter is a necessary idleness and useful insofar as society expands and the administration of public affairs contracts. By parasitism I mean that kind of inactivity which contributes neither labour nor wealth to society, which accumulates without ever losing, and which the masses regard with foolish admiration and the wise with scornful compassion for those victims who fall into its clutches and who lacking that drive towards an active life which is given by the necessity of caring for or increasing the requisites of life, let all their energies drift at the mercy of the passions of opinion, which are not the weakest of passions. We cannot call someone a social parasite who enjoys the fruits of his own forefathers' virtues or vices and who, in return for his temporary pleasures, dispenses bread and a livelihood to the industrious poor, and who wages by means of his wealth the silent war of trade in peacetime, rather than waging with force the uncertain and bloody sort of war.",

Feminist concerns aside, it repre­ sents the evolution of Man from a shambling, stooping, ape-like creature to the modern paragon we all know (and some admire).

Or is it a cult object with supernatural powers? 'Man the Symbol-Maker'? 'Homo religioso'? When we contemplate this evolutionary seq­ uence we tend to think in terms of increasing intelligence - the very faculty we ourselves use to try to understand human evolution and other problems in life. Perhaps because we value intelligence above all else, we believe that it was improving IQ scores that made evolutionary advance not only possible but also attractive. There is, however, another part of being human that is just as - arguably, more - important than intelligence. It is human consciousness. No one argues that intelligence is unimportant or that it is not in some ways related to consciousness, only that it is not everything.",

Others are less straightforward characters. They can be unnerving, certainly. And yet somehow we feel that they are with us because they still have their own mysterious purpose to fulfil. The ghost in the machine is like that. It can undoubtedly lead us astray if we begin to take it too seriously. And yet we cannot stop telling our stories about it, for it provides our best way of making sense of ourselves and our place in the world. Long ago, many philosophers accepted the ghost on its own terms. Its presence was to be granted as something otherworldly, or at least not of the material world. The ghost's remarkable abilities—to describe or picture the world outside, or perform feats of telekinesis to animate the machine it haunted—might be accepted as part and parcel of its ethereal character. Those of a more nervous disposition attempted to exorcize the ghost entirely. But their attempts to make do without its presence were ultimately doomed to failure.",

That such restitutional attempts fail and instead reflect the murderous (both the anal and the genital) intent is no surprise for the psychoanalyst who regularly witnesses contradictory aims in the manifestations of all the neuroses and psychoses including the obsessional. The observations (as well as a host of other clinical phenomena) indicate the intimate relation of anxiety to the aggressive strivings (despite the fact that anxiety instigates repression of the sexual wishes). Anxiety serves as a precipitant of repression and symptom formation while guilt, both conscious and unconscious manifestations, is a product of the oedipal sexual wishes.",

      "title": "(Dis)utopian Landscapes in Don DeLillo’s Fiction",
      "abstract": "The concepts of utopia (a good place) and dystopia (a bad place) might be arrived at and developed by one’s contact with the (constructed) reality and comprehension, yet frustration and discontent with it, and one’s pessimism and optimism over a better present and future contingent upon the place and time in which one exists. The former has a long history, whereas the latter is a work in progress. That is, one cannot simply distinguish between the two by asking whether the latter is primarily precautionary and reactive, cautioning us what not to do, whilst the former is proactive, pointing us towards the right direction. Both the former and latter may have similar motives, namely, to demonstrate the dark characteristics of one society by comparing it with another, fictitious culture. Someone’s utopia might alternate dystopia, or many traditional utopias from the past include aspects that modern readers would identify as dystopian. On the other hand, one could argue that dystopia serves as the worst-case scenario, presenting a degraded, collapsing, and/or collapsed society, be it socio-culturally, economically, or technologically, worse than another, yet still hopeful for a drastic change for the better. Utopia could be received as the best-case scenario for people in a society considering its socio-political demise. Shortly, both utopian and dystopian scenarios would fit into an extended framework of contemplations on a catastrophe that would either signal a tremendous shift for the better or result in an apocalyptic nightmare. Drawing on the standpoints of Giles Deleuze and Jean Baudrillard and tracing Don DeLillo’s fiction, this paper seeks to explore the notion of dystopia, the future assumptions that dystopian fiction puts forward, and the challenges and issues it highlights, such as digital surveillance, technological control, the disappearance of individualism, uncertainty, and dread.",

Oleh\r\n karena itu, sukses tidaknya kerja\r\n sama \r\ntersebut ditentukan oleh peran dari ked\r\nua orang atau kedua \r\npihak yang bekerja sama tersebut.\r\n2) \r\nAktivitas, menunjukkan bahwa kerja sama tersebut terjadi \r\nkarena adanya aktivitas yang dikehendaki bersama, sebagai \r\nalat untuk mencapai tujuan dan ini membutuhkan strategi \r\n(bisnis/usaha).\r\n3) \r\nTujuan atau \r\ntarget, merupakan aspek yang menjadi sasaran \r\ndari kerja\r\n sama usaha tersebut, biasanya adalah keuntungan \r\nbaik secara finansial maupun nonfinansial yang dirasakan \r\natau diterima oleh kedua pihak. \r\n4) \r\nJangka waktu tertentu, menunjukkan bahwa kerja sama \r\ntersebut dibatasi oleh waktu, artinya ada kesepakan kedua \r\npihak kapan kerja\r\n sama itu berakhir. Dalam hal ini, tentu \r\nsaja setelah tujuan atau target yang dikehendaki telah \r\ntercapai.\r\nCV. Jasa Surya adalah perusahaan bergerak dalam bidang penerbit dan \r\npercetakan\r\n buku-\r\nbuku pelajaran, seperti buku Lembar Kerja Siswa (LKS), \r\nBuku Sekolah Elektronik (BSE), buku Muatan Lokal (BAM), dan \r\nPendidikan Al\r\n-Qur’an (PQ). \r\nPerusahaan berusaha untuk mempertahankan \r\npangsa pasarnya sehingga produk yang dipasarkannya dapat terus \r\n4 \r\ndipertahankan bahkan ditingkatkan, hal ini sangat penting mengingat salah \r\nsatu sumber pendapatan CV.

The individual citizen, the family and the state display a dearth of introspection, a lack of allegiance to or recognition of friends, family and political allies and an unproductive or perverted desire for intimacy.

      "abstract": "Abstract Our capacity for impersonal reflection, for looking at our own perspective from without, as part of a world that exists independently of us, is our most distinctive trait as human beings. It finds its most striking expression in our moral thinking. For we are moral beings insofar as we stand back from our individual concerns and see in the good of others, in and of itself, a reason for action on our part. It is not, to be sure, in morality alone that we exercise this power of impersonal reflection. We do so too, whenever we set about weighing the evidence for some belief without regard for what we would like to be true or for what common opinion would say. Yet nowhere does this self-transcendence show forth more vividly than when we turn our attention from our own happiness to that of another, taking the same immediate interest in that person's good—just because it is his or hers—as we naturally harbor for our own. In this essay, I explore the way that the moral point of view is shaped by the nature of impersonal reflection and thus constitutes a signal expression of our humanity.",

      "title": "Relational goods and overcoming barriers to collective action",
      "abstract": "Relational goods contribute to understanding why people engage in collective action, notably including political participation, even though, as Olson showed, it would often be more rational for them to free-ride on the activity of others. Relational goods are neither public goods nor private goods but a third type of good. They must be jointly consumed with another person or persons (unlike private goods), but the identity of the other persons matters crucially (unlike the case for public goods). Relational goods can only exist by mutual agreement as part of a relationship with non-arbitrary others, in the context of an interaction. Friendship is a prototypical example. Relational goods can exist along a range of personal contact from direct, where individuals interact face to face, to indirect, where the interaction may be at a distance with a certain type of person. In the indirect case the relational good may frequently take the form of reinforcing a desired social identity. The distinction between “consumption” and “instrumental” goods applies, parallel with other usage. The consumption relational goods are produced independent of any consequences of the action or relationship, while the instrumental ones refl ect consequences, such as from an action that enhances the value of an identity. People who value relational goods may act collectively even if other net benefi ts of action are negative. Larger groups become more, not less, prone to collective activity. Relational goods provide a missing element to understand how the process of mobilization works at the individual level; leaders can infl uence people’s perceptions of what others are doing, of the value of a shared identity, and of the likelihood of success. Some limited empirical evidence is consistent with relational goods playing a role in enhancing collective action.",

Assigning objects or events or attributes to categories provides the child's world with stability: Each entity no longer must be treated as unique. Entities assigned to the same category are alike in important respects, and thus can be treated similarly. Categories also allow a child to go beyond the information perceptually available from observing an entity, to make inferences about that entity. Consider the case of an opaque object that is currently stationary. Once the category assignment of that object is known, a child can predict both the internal (invisible from the surface) attributes of the object and the functions or characteristic actions of the object (based largely on the correlated form attributes).",

Nadel can be understood to limit ‘symbol’ to those situations where the relationship between something and what it stands for is intended, conventional and can be put by the actor into words. It points up the distinction between the communication of meaning to people within the society (actors) and items of social behaviour or belief which express in an indirect or obscure fashion some principle, value, conflict or problem occurring in that society. Expression is not the same thing as communication. You can express your feelings to a stone, yet it is unmoved. You could also, like the mystic Henry Suso (Huizinga 1965, p. 148) eat three-quarters of an apple in the name of the Trinity and the remaining quarter in commemoration of ‘the love with which the heavenly Mother gave her tender child Jesus an apple to eat’ and unless you or Henry Suso told me, I would not, though I watched you twenty times, discern your symbolism or even that what you did was symbolical.",

They hint \nthat thus the museum collection becomes serviceable even to the multitude who “have no eye for beauty.” Per contra, the retort is made that the \nlove of beauty is indeed an emotion, but one which is latent in all normal \nhuman beings, and which can, by judicious suggestion, be kindled; that \nfacts regarding the origin and historical relations of a given work of art \nare, however, quite irrelevant to appreciation, and tend rather to stiﬂ e it; \nand that the docent, therefore, should conﬁ ne his comments largely to \nmatters of line, hue, and texture.

Standard histories of philosophy trace the modern formulation and initial solution of this problem to Locke's ideas regarding the connected nature of consciousness, a connectedness cashed out in terms of memory. What makes a person now the same person as at some earlier time is current consciousness of, the ability consciously to remember, that earlier time, or as Locke himself puts it: “as far as this consciousness can be extended backwards to any past Action or Thought, so far reaches the Identity of that Person; it is the same self now it was then” (Locke 1975: 335). For Locke, then, personal identity depends exclusively upon certain psychological relations obtaining, which is simultaneously to insist that personal identity does not depend on any physical relations obtaining. The continuation of a person owes everything to the continuation of the mind (or soul) and nothing to the continuation of the body.",

A mechanism known in psychoanalytic theory as displacement consists in the moving of genital affects from a primary object or function to a secondary one. When displaced associations become attached with sufficient tenacity to the secondary object, the latter may assume the functions of the first and may eventually become a welcome substitute for the primary one in fulfilling certain emotional needs of the organism.

      "title": "Toward applied behavior analysis of life aloft",
      "abstract": "This article deals with systems at multiple levels, at least from cell to organization. It also deals with learning, decision making, and other behavior at multiple levels. Technological development of a human behavioral ecosystem appropriate to space environments requires an analytic and synthetic orientation, explicity experimental in nature, dictated by scientific and pragmatic considerations, and closely approximating procedures of established effectiveness in other areas of natural science. The conceptual basis of such an approach has its roots in environmentalism which has two main features: (1) knowledge comes from experience rather than from innate ideas, divine revelation, or other obscure sources; and (2) action is governed by consequences rather than by instinct, reason, will, beliefs, attitudes or even the currently fashionable cognitions. Without an experimentally derived data base founded upon such a functional analysis of human behavior, the overgenerality of “ecological systems” approaches render them incapable of ensuring the successful establishment of enduring space habitats. Without an experimentally derived functional account of individual behavioral variability, a natural science of behavior cannot exist. And without a natural science of behavior, the social sciences will necessarily remain in their current status as disciplines of less than optimal precision or utility. Such a functional analysis of human performance should provide an operational account of behavior change in a manner similar to the way in which Darwin's approach to natural selection accounted for the evolution of phylogenetic lines (i.e., in descriptive, nonteleological terms). Similarly, as Darwin's account has subsequently been shown to be consonant with information obtained at the cellular level, so too should behavior principles ultimately prove to be in accord with an account of ontogenetic adaptation at a biochemical level. It would thus seem obvious that the most productive conceptual and methodological approaches to long-term research investments focused upon human behavior in space environments will require multidisciplinary inputs from such wide-ranging fields as molecular biology, environmental physiology, behavioral biology, architecture, sociology, and political science, among others.",

Border shows its difficulties in being unambiguously defined. For instance, to which of the contiguous areas it belongs? Neither one of the single-bounded regions is sufficient for that. Border is not just a non-place, but is a space with its own characteristics that makes living there very specific, regulating the dynamic with the surroundings and even the way of thinking, acting and feeling. Living in a borderland makes the identity of the inhabitants and their meaning-making process very peculiar. The way in which the border residents perceive the relationship between the self, the others and the environment, as well as their process of meaning-making is unavoidably linked with the existence of the border itself, with all its ambivalent theoretical features and practical implications in settling the daily activities and the human psychological functioning.",

      "abstract": "At creation God made humans in His image and likeness, endowing them with powers and abilities akin to their Creator. One distinguishing quality which humans alone possessed, unique from all other creatures, was the power of choice—the will. This unique attribute made humans the only creatures with the ability to say yes or no to God. Since the devil’s fall from glory, it has been his mission to deceive and enlist others in his rebellion against the sovereignty of God. Continuing the work of deception and rebellion he began in heaven before he and his confederates were forcefully expelled, he seeks in his wrath against the Creator to totally deface the image of God from the lives of His children (Rev 12:17). To achieve these objectives Satan seeks inroads into people’s lives; means by which he can obtain a foothold, which could later become a stronghold, to gain total control or subordination of the human will to his whims and pleasures. Ultimately, as Jesus stated, his mission is to “kill, and steal, and destroy” (John 10:10). The beginning point for his objective is finding a foothold to obtain access into the lives of God’s creatures, for whom He sent His Son to die on the cross. As a result of the great conflict which broke out in heaven (Rev 12:7-11), the devil and his evil angels were expelled from their former abode and became vagrants in need of new habitations. This problem was solved when the devil tempted Eve in the Garden of Eden to disobey God. By complying to the counsel of the deceiver, the earth’s dominion was ceded to the usurper (Gen 3). The fall of Adam and Eve occurred because the devil found a foothold, an entry point into the heart of Eve. This foothold was the sin of covetousness. Eve apparently coveted the adulation and glory only God should have; she desired to be worshiped (v. 5). Eve was deceived by Satan who thereby gained control of her and subsequently used her as an agent to tempt Adam to join in the rebellion against God. Adam, on his part, apparently chose to join his wife in her disobedience rather than to obey God and live. In attempting to be godlike Adam and Eve lost their paradise home, their dominion over the entire creation, and their position as custodians of God’s world entrusted to them. Intriguingly, the same unholy ambition which Satan had nursed—the desire to have the position, dominion, and glory belonging to the Creator—he transmitted to Adam and Eve.",

These lie close to the fundament of his character, and few means of communication reach them so effectively as do the fine arts. When the experience of a work of art takes place at the fullest potential of its power, when it involves the mans rational faculties as well as his intuitive, wordless reactions to the eloquence of form, then his capacities to feel and understand are expanded, he learns to transcend his limited self. To insist that aesthetic experience is a central issue in any discussion of the humanities may be restating what is obvious to everyone; but I honestly fear that too often what is commonly accepted becomes commonplace and is thus neglected. Moreover, scholars frequently hesitate to discuss matters that seem to verge on the irrational, and we generally recognize that the experience of a work of art is almost totally subjective. The quality of this event, its intensity and duration, are difficult to measure or to compare with analogous moments?the feeling of fulfillment of a chemist as he perfects a complex synthetic compound, the ex ultation of a victorious athlete, or the mood of a fisherman sitting silently along the banks of a river at dusk. I am concerned here less with the problems and insights of the creative artist, whether ancient or modern, and more with the reaction of his audience who are far more numerous. The mo ment when any man among them becomes enthralled with a work of art, the moment of true and private revelation, becomes one of the important events of his biography?the night he at tended a performance of Shaw's Saint Joan or The Marriage of Figaro, the afternoon he walked about the Church of St. Pierre 837",

      "abstract": "Ahiysa is one of the core ethical values in Jainism, as expressed in the oft-quoted\nphrase “ahiysa paramo dharmah (nonviolence is the supreme form of religious\nconduct).” Padmanabh S. Jaini has observed that within Jainism there is a\n“preoccupation with ahiysa,” for no other religious tradition “has carried it\n[ahiysa] to the extreme of the Jainas. For them it is not simply the first among\nvirtues but the virtue.”1 Although in most religious traditions non-harming relates\nto other living beings, Jaini has noted that “for Jainas, however, it [hiysa] refers\nprimarily to injuring oneself – to behavior which inhibits the soul’s ability to\nattain moksa.”2 The reasoning here is that a tendency to intentionally harm other\nliving beings that is motivated by strong passions (kasaya) causes the binding of\nharmful varieties (papa prakrti) of karmic matter to one’s own soul. These\nkarmas cause rebirth in undesirable states of existence as hell-beings (naraki) and\nanimals (tiryanca) that are characterized by a preponderance of suffering and that\nare not conducive to spiritual progress, thereby prolonging the soul’s journey in\nsaAsara.3",

      "title": "Bored and spoiling for a flight: capabilities lost and found in lockdown",
      "abstract": "Human beings are dynamic; our innate faculties beg to engage in activities. To achieve fullness and human dignity, people “convert” personal capabilities into active “functionings,” Amartya Sen explains. This means that staying still is not a normal state. It can feel like punishment. Forced inactivity will generate resentment, resistance, and boredom that can fester until pent-up energy explodes violently, or implodes in depression. Boredom defaults on capabilities and resources in many cases. In other cases, stillness is a gift. It can stimulate the imagination to fill in emptiness with memories and new explorations. Either boredom builds toward doing damage, or it releases energy to think and to create. What people don't do is stay put, mentally or physically. Authorities-including police, judges, teachers, parents –should take this dynamic human condition into account and reconsider the effects of conventional command and control policies. Then they can choose between violence and creativity as alternative outlets for the energy that boredom generates. Short of facing up to human dynamism, decision-making may continue to favor strong-arm tactics, which trigger the violence and pain that policing is meant to mitigate. Is it surprising that apparently peaceful peoplebecome enraged in lockdown conditions? Do adults wonder why students drop-out of school and suffer escalating rates of depression and suicide? Boredom is certainly not the only cause for these disastrous effects, but to ignore it risks remaining complicit with processes that perpetuate personal and collective dysfunctions. Complicity with harmful practices will miss opportunities to channel frustrated energy toward developing human capabilities. Authorities are responsible for promoting peaceful development. We are all responsible.[2] Normally, people stay busy with routine activities. We work, play, attend to family and to friends. Particular activities have even become our public badges of identity, as is evident in surnames (Cooper, Baker, Taylor, Farmer, etc.) that trace back to work that ancestors answered to. Lockdown during COVID-19 meant that many otherwise occupied people had few outlets for energy. Those who knew how to meditate managed to assuage anxiety through contemplation and the pursuit of ideal emptiness.",

      "abstract": "Abstract At the beginning of his 1895 novel, The Time Machine, H. G. Wells has his main character, the otherwise unnamed “Time Traveller,” point out to his friends that any physical object has to have four dimensions: “It must have Length, Breadth, Thickness, and-Duration.” The first three were obvious, but, “through a natural infirmity of the flesh,” most people tended to overlook the fourth.’ Infirmities of the flesh-and of the intellect-are real enough, and one of their effects is to limit the capacity of individuals and nations for self analysis. It is never easy, whether in the realm of interpersonal or international relations, to “see ourselves as others see us.” Just as individuals (at least those who can afford it) expand self-awareness through psychoanalysis, so nations tend to rely on perceptive outsiders for the clinical detachment that produces insights into their own character. Infirmities-whether of energy, imagination, or honesty-keep them from achieving this themselves. The problem has been greater for Americans than for most other people, because the very pervasiveness of this country’s influence throughout the world has prohibited the use of distance-the great advantage of foreign observers-to gain detachment. One liability of living in the “American century is that Americans who move through space so often encounter their own culture in its transplanted forms. And, whether for better or for worse, American culture has, rather like kudzu, transplanted very well indeed.",

      "title": "The Role of Healthy Narcissism in Relating Emotionally to Familiarity and the Unknown",
      "abstract": "Narcissism is a greatly maligned human characteristic.It's understandable.Narcissists tend not to consider others' feelings.They think only of themselves, and use those who care for them without giving anything in return.In psychological literature, narcissism is predominantly discussed within a pathological context.The focus is on helping the narcissist see past his own self and learn to relate to others more openly.Within this, the evolutionary need for narcissism tends to be ignored.In this paper I intend to elaborate on the other side of narcissism that elicits attraction to the familiar and triggers resistance/rejection of the alien or unknown.What is this function of narcissism?We know that all personality traits, whether they're perceived as healthy or pathological, have an evolutionary basis.They exist in order to ensure our survival as individuals and as a species.So, what about narcissism?What is it that narcissism ensures or preserves?Why do we have this trait, and do we need it?healthy narcissism as a preserver of a separate self-familiarity and self-continuity and as a defense against alien stimulation -essentially, against otherness [20] which might also be expressed as racism [2,21]. Healthy narcissism is in the service of self-preservationIt is the narcissistic processing that serve as a protective shield or immunization against alien stimuli that might endanger the familiar sense of our Self and its safety [1,12].Thus, we all have a narcissistic sensitivity to characteristics that emanate from anything that triggers the sense of what is alien or unknown to us [22][23][24].Freud describes this sensitivity towards \"minor or major differences\" [25,26] as the \"undisguised antipathies and aversions\" [2] p. 102) that people feel toward strangers with whom they must interact.This sensitivity triggers their need \"to get rid of the unpleasant awareness\" [27] and of the acute mental pain [1,28].We build a familiar sense of self throughout the accumulation and integration of memory traces from all our experiences, while the constructive and positive memory traces overcome the destructive ones.It includes our own Self, parents, family, friends, and other familiar individuals and groups.That sense of self is protected by narcissistic impulses to reject the strange.It is easy to see the importance of this.If we don't have some suspicion of strange people or situations, we will not be able to survive in what is sometimes a hostile world, as with Daesh today.Hence, the stranger anxiety -at eight months when object constancy is consolidated -can be considered as normal and healthy narcissistic self-immunization [1].",

      "abstract": "Click to increase image sizeClick to decrease image size Résumé Il suit de l'histoire et de la logique que la vérité, comme nous la connaissons, est une croissance sujette au changement, et est le résultat, dans la dernière analyse, du jugement individuel. Même “le test objectif de la vérité” se réduit au test par “l'expérience fondamentale individuelle,” c'est-à-dire, la douleur, le toucher, et la vision. Ni le groupe social, de l'un côté, ni un composant quelconque de l'individu, tel que l'organe ou la cellule, de l'autre côté, ne peuvent être ainsi fondamentaux à la vérité; parce que, malgré les similarités entre les organisations de l'individu, de la société, et des composants de l'individu, respectivement, il y a des différences importantes. Les individus peuvent vivre en dehors de la société, comme la société ne peut pas vivre et comme les composants de l'individu peuvent rarement vivre en dehors des individus eux-mêmes; les composants des individus, bien qu'essentiels au développement de la vérité, ne sont pas encore ceux qui tiennent la vérité; et la société en elle-même ne peut voir et jouir de la vérité. Cette vue permet les vérités acceptables, en effet, les vérités socialement acceptables, pourvu que leur test définitif soit admis comme individuel; et la vue permet l'organisation collective, la “décision,” et l'action; car la vue donne à entendre et la liberté intellectuelle pour les individus, et l'intérêt individuel dans les intérêts communs. Referat Dass die Wahrheit, wie wir sie kennen, eine Entwicklung ist, die Veränderung ausgesetzt ist, folgt aus der Geschichte und der Logik. Sogar der “objective Prüfstein der Wahrheit” lässt sich auf den Prüfstein der “individuellen Grunderfahrung” zurückführen, d.h. Schmerz, Tast, und Gesicht. Weder die soziale Gruppe einerseits, noch irgendeine Komponente des Individuums, wie ein Organ oder eine Zelle, andererseits kann die Grundlage der Wahrheit sein, weil es trotz den Ähnlichkeiten zwischen dem Aufbau des Individuums, der Gesellschaft und der Komponenten des Individuums wichtige Unterschiede gibt. Individuen können von der Gesellschaft getrennt leben, wie die Gesellschaft nicht leben kann, und wie die Komponenten des Individuums selten von den Individuen selbst getrennt leben können; Komponenten der Individuen, obgleich sie zur Entwicklung der Wahrheit wesentlich sind, sind nicht die Besitzerinnen der wahrheit; auch kann die Gesellschaft für sich die Wahrheit nicht wahrnehmen und geniessen. Diese Ansicht gestattet natürlich annehmbare Wahrheiten, ja sozial annehmbare Wahrheiten, insofern ihr Urmerkmal anerkanntermassen individuell ist; und die Ansicht gestattet Gruppenaufbau, “Entschluss,” und Tätigkeit; denn die Ansicht schliesst in sich sowohl die intellektuelle Freiheit für die Einzelwesen als auch individuelles Interesse an gemeinsamen Interessen.",

This is not a bridge that links distinct entities into a common purpose, resemblance, or mutuality. For, bridges also point to breaks and frictions in putting to work different operating systems. Without such frictions there is little motivation to work out ways of associating things that have no overarching reason to be associated. Endurance means to conjoin ourselves with others in the possibility of \"saying something\" that need not be summed up, that need not have specific parameters of efficacy or objectivity, something that keeps people going in and through transformations that are without precedent in the sense that they need not represent the culmination of a goal or necessity. It means the capacity to risk what is familiar, because what is familiar may not be what it seems to be; every ground and appearance is deceptive.",

Some accounts of friendship can include (other than human) animals more easily than others. I present an argument in favour of characterising some animal-human connections as friendships, and address some of the standard objections to this characterisation. It might seem that under any conception of friendship, characterising animals as (potential) friends would likely lead to better treatment of animals, as various kinds of ill-treatment or use would not be consistent with treating someone as a friend. However, concern for animal welfare typically extends well beyond the direct concern for our own household companions, and is a concern for animals (or certain animals) in general, whereas friendship, by its nature, is particularist. There are limits to applying the concept of friendship to animal treatment beyond particular relationships.",

      "abstract": "Every person acquires a worldview, a picture of reality. Within that picture, the existence of some things will be taken wholly for granted as the background to, and support of, everything else. Their existence will rarely be questioned. The cosmos or universe, the gods, God, Brahman, Heaven, the Absolute--R. T. Allen claims that all these and other world- views have been held to be that which necessarily exists and upon which all other beings depend in one way or another.European philosophers, since antiquity, have offered arguments to show that their chosen candidates for the role of the necessary being or beings that support the rest of reality do actually exist. The Necessity of God sets the valid core of previous ontological arguments. It does not and cannot prove that God exists, but only that something necessarily exists. In an a priori manner and without inferring anything from what in fact exists, Allen proceeds to show that which necessarily exists is one, transfinite, eternal, and the archetype of personal existence: in short, that it is God as classically conceived. As for everything else that may exist, it must be finite and dependent for its existence upon God as its creator and sustainer.Few things are more erroneous in philosophy and disastrous in practice than artificial constructions produced without constant reference to concrete reality. That which necessarily exists may be the one exception. Before this constructive argument, Allen examines previous examples of ontological arguments in order to show exactly where they go wrong and to extract the valid core obscured within them. This will make clear the difference between them and his new version. The reader who is eager to engage the philosophical sources of belief will find a distinct treasure in The Necessity of God.",

Care recipients are typically people who could not flourish without it, such as the very young or ill. Another meaning of 'care' is that it is a motivation based on concern for someone or something outside of oneself. There is a general sense that 'care activities' are of highest quality when accompanied by, and motivated by, authentic emotional commitments, or 'caring feelings'.1How does caring figure into economic life? From the viewpoint of orthodox neoclassical economics, it does not figure in at all. From this viewpoint, economics is centrally defined around the topics of (i) markets in which the goods and services are exchanged for money and (ii) the choice behavior of the rational, autonomous, self-interested agents thought to populate these markets. 'Economic man' then, is imagined as a creature who neither needs care nor has any responsibility or motivation to provide it. The model of the economy that, in theory, is created by these creatures is often taken as an accurate portrayal of real-world capitalism and a simple description of a heartlessness that is presumed to be of its essence. As a result, over the centuries, many supporters for a more caring economy have called for the dismantling of individualist capitalism in favor of a more solidaristic state socialism and/or local, nonprofit familial and community systems of cooperation and sharing.",

      "abstract": "Many researchers have studied Manhae's poems and thoughts. Thanks to them, srriking results continue to be accumulated all this while. Especially diverse approaches and various interpretations for understanding his poems' show his works' profundity and width. But like widely known remarks, to substantialize the Nim is impossible. Such attempts will be forced to fail because it is not to lie within the range of a phenomenon or being. Ironically endeavors to grasp or conceptualize the Nim’s identity have interrupted the conduct of understanding and comprehension of the Nim. In other words, to describe the Nim definitely which is closely connected to sudden shocks or jumps of linear time, is almost impossible. Speecilly because Nim comes to destroy anticipation or memory of thingking, or continuity of perception, to reduce any personality is very difficult. Namely the Nim makes an abrupt appearance without one’s will. Also the Nim does not follow sequential flow of time. Consequently at that instant ones seizing or contacting with irs do not mysteriously exist here. Anything that eternally exists by trace, we could name its the Nim. On the one hand such a Nim purely does not remain personal matters or existential dimension. As a poetic epiphany or theophany Nim’s birth couple with East-Asia’s circular causality that cause and effect follows one after another. And the Nim is connected to sacred time, which affords basis for nature’s endless the circulation than western' linear time, which presupposes finitude of history and life. On the other hand, Manhae is free from indigestive modern poetics' fishing nets, by realizing importance of East-Asianic contradiction and paradox. By facing western modernity world is based on the theory of contradiction and the deductive method that does not endure mutual difference and discrepancy, Manhae also could produce the East Asianic Nim that is different with the being theology each other.",

      "title": "The Psychology Of Acquisitiveness",
      "abstract": "Abstract Human and nonhuman animals share an adaptive capacity to plan for the future by acquiring and saving important items, such as food to survive long, cold winters. In addition, humans amass material goods well beyond what they appear to need—a tendency that we refer to as “acquisitiveness.” The current chapter frames our view of acquisitiveness as a typical, human phenomenon that exists across individuals to varying degrees, from a “Spartan” desire to avoid excess possessions or clutter, through normal levels of acquisition, up through the excessive acquisition and retention observed in hoarding disorder. Acquisitiveness is adaptive at most levels but shares features in common with the excessive hoarding of clinical populations including hoarding disorder, OCD, frontal lobe syndrome, and eating disorders. Acquisitiveness appears to derive from multiple underlying instincts, including the tendency to hold on to goods that are needed in the future, the desire to display one’s quality to mates and social partners, and the “nesting instinct” to surround oneself with materials that afford a feeling of security. We summarize this framework and our own work on the phenomenon. Acquisitiveness is an important and ubiquitous human behavior that reflects adaptive instincts, which can nevertheless negatively impact personal finances, emotional well-being, and the environment in ways that we need to understand.",

      "title": "Moral Traces and Relational Autonomy",
      "abstract": "One feature of James Childress's approach to ethics is the experience of \"moral traces\" that agents ought to feel in situations of conflict after they have overridden one strong value for the sake of another.1 This experience grasps at something intuitive about the moral life, that in situations of intense moral conflict when we are faced with a choice to act in a way that goes against a deeply held value, it is morally important that we feel and respond a certain way. At the most immediate level, this might entail privately mourning or grieving that we had to violate the value. Doing so would affirm that we care about the overridden value, and by acknowledging such a care we would feel that our moral integrity has been protected. But shouldn't the concept of moral traces entail more than a private process of grief? Shouldn't it have an effect on our relations with others? Moral traces ought to obligate us to act toward others in certain ways, and in that sense it is a concept quite distinct from the pangs of conscience we feel when we have behaved badly. At the very least, these traces ought to press us to offer an explanation or justification to others for why we acted against an important moral value, especially if those others were affected negatively by our action. In more extreme cases, we might even be compelled to make amends or offer reparations to the one or ones who were harmed by our action.2In this article I am interested in sorting through the ways that moral traces function in the moral life, especially in terms of the work they do in maintaining and building social and institutional relationships. I want to suggest that moral traces are more than an internal attitude that pertains to individual flourishing; they are also integral to communal well-being. By pointing to a contrast between moral traces as important for individual flourishing and moral traces as conducive to increased communal well-being, I also hope to expand our thinking about the liberal principle of autonomy that is central to Childress's approach. I am motivated in this article by a worry that some might use the appeal to moral traces to reinforce an individualistic, psychological notion of the self. This is clearly something that Childress does not do, as can be seen in his 1970 Soundings article, \"Who Shall Live When Not All Can Live?\" There he tethers the equitable distribution of scarce medical resources firmly to the maintenance of relationships of trust. In later writings, he explicitly outlines the obligations to others that emerge in situations when an important value has been overridden. Relationships of trust and the obligations to others incurred by moral traces both point to a conception of agency that is relational.In what follows, I hope to suggest the broad contours of an account of moral traces that highlights its relational features. Looking at moral traces through a relational lens accentuates, and perhaps even intensifies, the obligations that they incur. Put differently, relational conceptions of autonomy require a more careful account of moral traces—one that focuses on what we owe one another. By a relational conception of autonomy, I mean a view of agency that sees the choices we make as shaped by our relations with and commitment to others. Highlighting moral traces as central to the moral life is a way to recognize the importance of human accountability, which ensures that we are always fully aware of how our actions affect others. Ultimately, the significance of the effect of moral traces does not lie simply in protecting an agent's integrity or sense of herself as morally whole but rather in how it promotes the building and maintaining of relations.Annette Baier makes this point eloquently in her critique of Michael Stocker's account of moral guilt—a concept that, while not exactly synonymous with moral traces, does share a family resemblance. She notes that although Stocker is concerned about the effects of moral dilemmas, his \"attention is given to the emotions of choosers, not to the feelings of the victims or beneficiaries of their choices\" (1992, 363). At another point, Baier refers to the \"dirty hands\" metaphor as pushing us \"into a Lady Macbeth frame of mind, obsessed with our own stained character rather than what we have done to others and how that felt for them\" (363).3 It is precisely this sense of how those harmed by our actions might feel that makes moral traces such a central component of a relational account of morality. Baier writes, \"Without a moral psychology that puts informed empathy and willingness to listen to others' point of view squarely in the center of our moral-psychological capacities, without a social interactive account both of rationality and of morality, the constraints that moral psychology can put on what counts as 'a more acceptable version of ethics' will be merely formal and very limited\" (365).While Childress does not use the term moral traces in his early Soundings article, he does offer some brief thoughts that hint at its further development in later writings. His short mention of moral guilt in this article serves as an impetus for my reflections about how moral traces can serve a relationship-building or maintaining purpose. I begin by assessing what he says in the Soundings article, especially as it relates to the view of the theologian Helmut Thielicke, whom Childress discusses in this article. I then look to Childress's discussion of moral traces in later writings on war, bioethics, and public health. Finally, as a way to further examine the relational implications of the concept, I turn to two fairly recent concepts in the bioethics literature: moral distress in nursing ethics and \"the patient as victim and vector model\" in public health ethics. While certainly not identical to Childress's conception of moral traces, these concepts reinforce a similar sentiment about relationality and our obligations to others in difficult moral cases. They also help us see that moral traces are not only located in the individual conscience or in the moral universe more generally; their effects are also embodied in institutional procedures.4 This echoes Childress's sentiment in the 1970 Soundings article that one of the tasks of social ethics is \"to propose relatively just institutional arrangements within which self-interested and biased men can live\" (Childress 1970, 342).In the 1970 article \"Who Shall Live When Not All Can Live?,\" James Childress makes a passing reference to a concept that forms a connective tissue through the corpus of his work in areas as diverse as conscience, war, and bioethics. He suggests that the allocation of scarce lifesaving medical resources (SLMR) presents us with \"'borderline situations' which inevitably involve guilt\" (1970, 175). He borrows the phrase \"borderline situations\" from the German theologian Helmut Thielicke, who had only recently addressed the issue of allocation of scarce lifesaving resources at a symposium held in Texas. It is not fully clear in his brief discussion of Thielicke whether or not Childress believes that decisions about allocating scarce medical resources must involve guilt.5 He writes, \"Even if all actions in SLMR should involve guilt, some may preserve human dignity to a greater extent than others\" (347). What is clear, however, is that he distances himself from Thielicke's view that the best humans can do in the face of these borderline situations is \"to understand and endure—not 'solve'\" them. By contrast, Childress believes that one can make discriminating judgments using the tools of ethics so that even our choices about \"who shall live when not all can live\" are informed by the notion that some decisions may \"preserve human dignity to a greater extent than others.\" For him the preservation of human dignity is achieved through a careful evaluation of the factors and norms in a given situation. Thus, whereas for Thielicke, any ethical judgment in such situations is flawed, Childress holds more optimistically that reasoned ethical judgments are possible. For both of them, however, the agent's realization that she is affected in some way by such difficult moral choices is important to her human flourishing. What is unclear in this brief reference is the nature and extent of this effect on the moral agent. Does it morally obligate her to make some sort of amends, or does it simply do its work on a psychological level in terms of ensuring that the overridden principle does not lose its potency?Thielicke's ideas about moral guilt are both deeply existential and deeply theological. For Thielicke, the guilt that results from moral dilemmas is debilitating to the point that it leaves the Christian moral agent with very few viable options. Indeed, he does not see the task of evangelical theological ethics as providing easy answers or solutions to ethical problems.6 Roman Catholic casuistry and its legalistic and naturalistic theology falls prey to this temptation. He uses the term \"borderline situations\" (Grenzsituation) to depict what he calls \"abnormal cases,\" ones that involve \"transitions or complications\" (Thielicke 1966, 578).7 The prime example of such a situation for Christians, according to Thielicke, is when they must use the methods of their evil opponent, as in the case of the duty to fight oppressive tyrannical dictatorships. Thus the individual Christian, especially if he holds political responsibility, is \"ineluctably forced into a situation in which he must act within a framework of injustice\" (585). What such situations teach Christians is that the world is fallen: \"man has perverted his world, and no man is exempt from sharing responsibility for this human character of his world, this demonic humanizing of the world. No man is merely the object of a conflict situation. We are all part of the human subject that helped to bring it about\" (597). Thus what is communal about this guilt for Thielicke is that the difficult moral conflict serves to remind Christians of their ongoing guilt as children of Adam. The borderline situation has its \"origin in a communal guilt which already stands behind our situation and which we for our part ever increase and intensify…. We are both channels and perpetrators of cosmic guilt\" (602).Borderline questions, according to Thielicke, \"preclude the possibility of any final answers.\" He writes, \"The questions must remain open\" (1970, 147). The impossibility of any final answers to difficult moral dilemmas is firmly grounded in certain theological presuppositions, such as human sinfulness. Thielicke understands the human condition of sin as a usurpation of man's limits—a going beyond the limits to which humans are destined. Put differently, it is that man \"has placed himself in sinful contradiction to the destiny for which he was created\" (154). In essence, human creativity—the ability to transform nature into culture—is always tainted by humanity's inability to accept its destiny as God's creatures. Humans are always pressing the boundaries of their creatureliness. He contrasts the Christian view that identifies suffering with human guilt and responsibility to secular ideas that attribute life's tragedy to the structures of the world. He writes, \"In myth … this world which is no longer whole tends to be regarded as something given, an intact structure in which guilt and fate are inseparably interwoven. The Bible, on the contrary, looks instead at man. It sees not the structure, but this personal representative of our disjointed world\" (156).Human sinfulness is not manifested in particular actions. Rather it is the very structure of human existence that is the root of human guilt. In essence, for Thielicke, there is no possible choice that a human can make in the face of any moral decision that would relieve her of this existential guilt: \"It is a matter of being, not action\" (164). Yet there are certain types of situations in which human decisions and human actions can bring about greater guilt. Indeed it is the experience of guilt that is a measure of the person's moral health and well-being. Like a wound that cannot be allowed to heal, the guilt one feels when making difficult moral decisions such as allocating scarce medical resources is difficult. In contrast to the utilitarian who is able to make a decision with clear-cut objective criteria, the moral person must suffer the anguish of the \"impossibility of the task.\" Her suffering is felt in \"pangs of conscience\" that are \"a kind of gauze placed in the wound to prevent its healing in the wrong way.\" Continuing with the metaphor, he insists that while the wound must not be closed, it must not be allowed to infect the moral actor: \"The pus of the insoluble dilemma must have some way of escaping. Otherwise, the very humanity of the physician himself becomes infected; he succumbs to the illusion of the easy solution\" (173). Only by keeping the wound open does Thielicke believe that humans can arrive at an awareness of the very essence of what it is to be human.The most obvious contrast between Thielicke and Childress in the Soundings article is that Childress's view of human guilt is not explicitly connected to theological and existential ideas about the ongoing guilt of humans before God. Thielicke's view of cosmic guilt undermines his confidence that any method of deciding how to allocate scarce lifesaving devices can ever really be justifiable. He invokes casting lots, but unlike Childress, his endorsement of it is lukewarm at best. He sees it as an unsatisfactory option but perhaps the best one humans have available to them in such a situation.There are two points from the Soundings article that are relevant to my attempt to rethink the concept of moral traces. First, while Childress's view about guilt in \"borderline situations\" is not explicitly developed in the article, his engagement with Thielicke is illuminating because I believe it foreshadows his later emphasis on moral traces. Thielicke's insistence that the \"wound\" should not infect the actor supports my contention that moral traces ought to do more than simply affect the individual; they must incur some sense of obligation to others. Second, Childress bases his strong support of random selection on the belief that it is the best option for maintaining human dignity, equality, and trust. All three of these values are, in his view, important for building and maintaining relationships. Childress is explicit about this in several places in the article. Quoting Paul Ramsey, he describes equality of opportunity \"as the ethical substance of the relations of those individuals to one another\"(Childress 1970, 348). In another passage, he describes trust as \"an attitude of expectation about another,\" namely, the expectation that one will be treated with respect (349).When we turn to Childress's 1978 article on just war in Theological Studies, we begin to see the full development of the concept of moral traces. In this more extended discussion, he situates them within \"the logic of prima-facie duties.\" Relying on the moral philosopher W. D. Ross, he argues that prima facie obligations are more binding than relative principles that function like rules of thumb, and less binding than absolute principles that can never be overridden. Thus, a prima facie obligation is \"intrinsically binding, but it does not necessarily determine one's actual obligation\" (1978, 430). A central component of the logic of these conflicting obligations is that \"an overridden or outweighed prima-facie obligation continues to function in the situation and the course of action one adopts\" (431; emphasis mine). Childress explicitly uses the phrases \"moral traces\" and \"residual effects\" in this article to describe how the outweighed obligation \"continues to function.\"He also turns to A. C. Ewing, who specifies more clearly how the overridden obligation continues to have a hold on the moral agent. For Ewing this hold results in a \"mental attitude\" that evokes regret, but even more important, that ought to affect the agent's future actions. Ewing writes, \"My omission to fulfill my prima facie duty to him in this case will increase the force of any prima facie obligations I may have to him as regards future actions. And even if it did not affect overt action, the existence of a prima facie obligation not to do it should always affect our mental attitude towards an action.\" Ewing describes the mental attitude as \"a positive thing even if not translated into action\" and writes further that \"a good man will at least regret the violation of prima facie duties\" (1959, 110). In a footnote, Childress comments that for W. D. Ross, the appropriate response to an overridden obligation is not shame or repentance but rather compunction.Childress's views about the intensity of this mental attitude after a moral conflict are not fully developed in this discussion. Yet he manages to introduce a broad array of terms to describe it: residual effects, regret, shame, repentance, compunction. He seems to favor the terms—traces and residue—that suggest a less intense effect on the moral agent. Elsewhere in the article, he claims more directly that guilt is not the appropriate emotional attitude in such cases. He supports, without fully developing, a notion of \"creative regret\" that he borrows from Albert R. Di Ianni (Childress 1978, 433). However, in discussing the jus ad bellum criterion of \"right intention\" as the maintenance of proper motives, he states \"an attitude of regret, if not remorse, is appropriate when a prima-facie obligation is overridden\" (438). Such a clear statement equating moral traces with regret is not typical of his discussions in later work, such as Principles of Bioethics (PBE).Nevertheless, in his view, overriding a principle does lead to specific obligations. These are most explicit in his discussion of the jus in bello criteria—the criteria that govern how to conduct war. His primary point is that even though a just war requires one to overrule the prima facie obligation not to injure or kill another, the hold that the obligation has on the moral agent is not \"overruled.\" In other words, the agent still must discharge some obligations to the other—and these obligations require that (1) the immediate object of war is not to kill or even injure, (2) one ought not directly target noncombatants, (3) one cannot impose \"unnecessary suffering,\" and (4) any effect (even if only indirect) of war on civilians \"must be justified by the principle of proportion\" (441). By connecting moral traces to the jus in bello criteria, Childress reinforces a notion that these traces are more than just an internal wound or disposition, and instead constitute an attitude that necessarily entails an obligation to minimize the harms caused by overriding a prima facie duty.When we turn our attention to Childress's later work, especially in PBE, we see that moral traces play a significant role in two ways: to remind the agent that prima facie duties are not neutral values and to highlight the centrality of conscience and integrity as virtues in the practice of medicine. The account of the logic of prima facie duties in PBE follows quite closely the account presented in the earlier just-war article. For example, Childress and his coauthor, Tom Beauchamp, argue that when overriding a prima facie obligation, there will always be traces of \"regret and a sense of moral residue.\" They write, \"Moral residue results because an overridden prima facie obligation does not simply go away when overridden\" (Beauchamp and Childress 2009, 19). While overlapping in some ways with their discussion of conscience, the two concepts remain distinct. Childress describes conscience as \"an internal sanction that comes into play through critical reflection.\" While this sanction may have different forms, he notes that it \"often appears as a bad conscience—in the form of feelings of remorse, guilt, shame, disunity, or disharmony—as the individual recognizes his or her acts as wrong\" (44). The sanction of a bad conscience is different from the feeling of moral traces, because with the former, the agent feels that the act she performed is wrong. Moral traces, by contrast, imply that one has \"residual obligations\" or that one needs to at least acknowledge internally that an important obligation or value has been sacrificed, but not that the act itself is wrong. Nevertheless, moral traces share with the conscience the ability to help repair any disunity or disharmony that the agent may have experienced in the context of the difficult dilemma.One final example of the role of moral traces in Childress's work comes from his writings on the moral foundations of public health. Along with several colleagues, he has suggested that public health officials must satisfy five justificatory conditions when choosing to override individual liberty or justice. These are effectiveness, proportionality, necessity, least infringement, and public justification. It is the last of these that I think illustrates most clearly the connection between moral traces and obligations. In particular, the public health setting provides an example of institutional obligations that result from acknowledging that an important value has been overridden. The responsibility that public officials have in this regard is \"to explain and justify that infringement, whenever possible, to the relevant parties, including those affected by the infringement.\" They must offer moral reasons because they are required to \"treat citizens as equals\" (Childress et al. 2002, 173). This activity of accountability to the public is, in Childress's words, \"indispensable for engendering and sustaining public trust, as well as for expressing justice.\" It involves actively seeking ways to engage the public with the decisions being made on its behalf. This engagement involves seeking out the public's input, maintaining transparency about the process, and providing relevant information to the public. Although Childress and his coauthors do not use the language of moral traces in this discussion of public justification, their appeal to the obligations that public authorities have when they have infringed upon or overridden important moral values is a by-product of the traces. Childress's emphasis on ongoing obligations illustrates his belief that difficult moral decisions do not come to an abrupt end; they do not disappear. Rather, responsible moral agents ought to continue to act and feel in ways that acknowledge the ongoing implications of these decisions.What can we conclude about Childress's view of moral traces from this quick summary of his work? First, it seems clear that he does not see moral traces as identical to moral regret. Individuals can experience moral traces while being sure that they made the right decision in difficult moral situation. In other words, they are not wishing that they had done something else.8 Rather, they are taking the implications of what they did seriously. Second, his view of moral traces as incurring ongoing obligations supports an account of agency that is relational. This conclusion runs counter to prevailing critiques of Childress's \"principlism\" that depict it as grounded in a conception of the agent as an isolated, atomistic individual.Accounts of personhood as relational have become fairly commonplace in normative ethical discussions, especially ones that are informed by feminist, virtue, narrative, or communitarian visions. The \"relational self\" is usually posited over against the individualistic moral agent believed to be prevalent in certain liberal philosophical approaches. This individualistic vision of autonomy is also commonly associated with bioethics discourse, especially with Childress's approach.9 Critics of autonomy worry about the tendency to see the self as independent and separate from the discursive contexts that shape our commitments and values. They think a more accurate description of moral agency is one of responsiveness to the particularities of situations and to the network of dependencies that enable individuals to flourish. While the emphasis on particularity and dependency has been appealing to many feminist theorists, some have rejected a wholesale abandonment of autonomy as potentially antithetical to feminist political goals. They are skeptical of views that mistakenly stereotype individual autonomy as fundamentally individualistic and rationalistic. Thus they want to salvage autonomy because of the central role they believe it plays in feminist analyses of oppression, subjection, and agency. The model of relational autonomy has emerged as a useful hybrid that takes the concerns raised by critics of autonomy seriously without abandoning the important function of respect for the dignity of the individual.10The principle of autonomy is clearly central to Childress's ethics. Even in the Soundings article, we can see that he supports random selection for the allocation of scarce medical resources because it preserves respect for dignity and autonomy. Yet it is important to note that for Childress this respect for autonomy does not preclude attention to relationships. Indeed, it is intimately tied to the attitudes of trust necessary for society to function. Trust provides us with one example of a deeply relational concept that is intimately tied to respect for autonomy, insofar as it reflects our ultimate respect for the other's dignity and humanity. Childress's emphasis on moral traces and the obligations they produce also supports a concept of autonomy that is attentive to human relationships. While Childress avoids pressing moral traces and regret into the stronger realms of remorse or guilt, his emphasis on residual obligations in the contexts of war, bioethics, and public health suggests that the effects of moral traces extend beyond individual conscience. They require the moral agent to attend to the impact of her act on human relationships, both private and public. This suggests that for Childress, no moral decision exists in an isolated vacuum. We cannot thus speak of individual autonomy apart from the broader social contexts that all humans inhabit. As Courtney Campbell reminds us, certain elements of Childress's theology—namely, his claims about humans created in God's image—provide the basis for a view of autonomy that goes against certain secular notions of autonomy that privilege individualism and self-determination. Childress's theologically informed view of autonomy, according to Campbell, \"must be qualified by considerations of dependence, sociality, and finitude\" (Campbell 1989).Moral traces result when one voluntarily makes a choice to act in a certain way, but recognizes that in one's doing so, an important moral principle or value is threatened or even sacrificed. But what about cases in which the choice to act is not completely voluntary, when the agent is constrained by institutional pressures? These cases are captured by the terms moral distress and moral residue—terms that have come to be associated primarily with nursing ethics. The discussion of these terms is not always very precise in the literature, where we often see the terms conflated. It is useful, however, to get a sense of how these concepts work and to ask whether they offer any useful insights for thinking about the relational component of moral traces.The appeal to the language of moral distress and moral residue in nursing ethics refers to a much more intense sentiment than Childress's appeal to moral traces. Indeed, at times it sounds like a radically different phenomenon—something that results from forced violations of moral values, rather than from genuinely dilemmatic situations. In that sense, it is more like situations that involve violations of conscience and integrity. Recall that in PBE, Beauchamp and Childress distinguish moral traces from conscience. Nevertheless, discussions of moral distress can show us how internal reflections about our moral choices can and should have an effect on our obligations to others. More particularly, they draw attention to the implications of moral traces on institutional structures and procedures.Jameton's pioneering article on the issue of moral distress in nursing makes an important distinction between moral dilemmas (which Childress believes gives rise to moral traces) and moral distress. Moral dilemmas occur when \"it is clear to the nurse that different and important values conflict, but no choice presents itself that preserves both\" (Jameton 1993, 542). In contrast, distress is what occurs when a moral agent is unable to act on a judgment as a result of institutional or professional constraints. For Jameton, moral dilemmas present interesting material for students of philosophy to ponder, but in reality, they are rare and, in his words, \"are bad news and to be avoided\" (543). By dismissing moral dilemmas as rare occurrences, Jameton pays little attention to the experiences of moral regret or guilt. He worries, however, that nurses often conflate or confuse dilemmas (in the philosophical sense) with the experience of moral distress. In other words, when asked to describe their experiences, nurses often characterize the distress they feel at not being able to act on their judgments as dilemmatic. Although he acknowledges that distress can and often does give rise to \"second-order\" moral dilemmas, it is a mistake to view situations when one's choices are constrained institutionally as dilemmatic. To do so leads nurses to unnecessarily blame themselves for situations over which they have little control. I think Jameton's point is pertinent because I take him to be saying that when nurses view their actions as resulting from genuine dilemmas instead of from unjust institutional structures, they will experience the wrong kind of guilt. What really matters for nurses is that institutions treat them justly by allowing them opportunities to participate fully in the decision-making process. Jameton is worried about the conflation of dilemmatic situations and situations of moral distress because of its implications for moral responsibility. The importance of the category of \"moral distress\" is that it draws attention to how nurses are often forced to act in ways that violate their deeply held beliefs and commitments. This violation leads to a significant moral crisis that can potentially paralyze the agent. In other words, unlike moral traces, moral distress does little for relationship and community building. Indeed, it leads to disintegration. The \"distressed\" nurse is isolated and finds herself alienated from her institutional and professional role. In the end, while the literature on moral distress often seems to be referring to something different from moral traces in the sense that Childress uses the term, it can offer us some useful insight about relationship/community building in the aftermath of difficult moral problems. In particular, it helps us to think about how moral traces in Childress's sense ought to lead to just social and institutional arrangements.Margaret Battin's recent contribution to public health ethics offers us more resources for thinking about moral traces and their relational features. She intends her work as an intervention in bioethics and public health ethics—one that attempts to undermine the notion of the self that underlies these approaches. Her approach is animated by several concerns. One has to do with a failure of bioethics to account for infectious disease as a defining feature of human experience. For Battin, this seemingly minor oversight overlooks something very important about our nature as human animals. She writes, \"Infectiousness is an especially direct reminder of how misleading the paradigms of individualism can be\" (Battin et al. 2009, 78). Battin's overarching goal, however, is to develop a more sensitive account of public health ethics. While she does not explicitly address the ideas of regret, remorse, or conscience, I believe her reminder about our biological reality as deeply interconnected creatures serves as a useful impetus for thinking about the implications of relational autonomy.Battin describes the self as a \"way-station,\" and \"embedded\" self, a vision of subjectivity that resonates with many feminist critiques of autonomy.11 Battin's important insight is that to speak of persons as shaped and constituted by and through their webs of relations is to speak about something physical and biological. She visualizes, rather than a romantic vision of relationality as constituted merely by friendship and familial relations, the individual as a \"launching pad and breeding ground for trillions of organisms that move from one human being to another, either directly or by way of intermediate vectors\" (462). This biological view expands the feminist account of relational autonomy. She writes, \"Attention to social locatedness is not enough. Physical locatedness … is critical as well\" (78).While clinical medicine has tended to see the patient primarily as a victim, public health has seen the patient primarily as a vector. Battin urges public health and bioethics to view patients as both simultaneously, \"an account in which the patient can be seen as both victim and vector at the same time, a person simultaneously occupying both morally relevant roles\" (87). Another way to put this is that we need to think of ourselves not only in terms of the threats to us but also in terms of the threats we potentially pose to others. This, according to Battin, draws a more nuanced and complex picture of moral agency. In particular it complicates notions of responsibility and blame that posit that we can always know who is to blame and for what. The biological view of ourselves as victims and vectors of infectious disease acknowledges that we cannot always know with certainty who is to blame (who harms and who is harmed).This view of the self provides an interesting grounding to the notion of moral traces as a relational concept. Agents in a dilemmatic situation are never fully relieved of the traces of guilt or sorrow for what they have done, and that is a good thing. It serves as a reminder of our shared vulnerability and woundedness as human subjects. In other words, our actions have effects and the virtuous agent is sensitive to these effects. In the image of Battin's way-station self we see how we are all biologically connected in pathways of disease. In a similar way moral traces remind us of our roles as both subjects and objects.We can see the implications of Battin's metaphysical view in her treatment of the ethics of distribution of scarce medical resources in cases of pandemic emergencies. She concurs with the pandemic triage plans put forth by Canada, Tennessee, and Utah that all base their allocation decisions on \"medical criteria of survivability and need\" (397). However, she notes that the patient as victim and vector (PVV) perspective draws our attention to two additional points. First, these plans fail to give an adequate account of what kind of care those who are \"deprioritized\" receive, and second, existing injustices in health care are exacerbated by these allocation criteria. Consequently, Battin argues that the plans must be clear about the obligation they have to care for those who will not be first in the queue to receive care in such an emergency. The issue of injustice only makes clear that we have an obligation to attend to health care inequities before such emergency situations strike. These conclusions illustrate the importance of the residual obligations incurred in situations of moral conflict. Like Childress's views about the necessity of the jus in bello criteria, and about the importance of public justifications in public health, Battin affirms that overriding a principle leaves traces that are not only wounding to the moral agent but also damaging to the relationships of trust that enable communities to exist and flourish.Without a strong sense of moral traces or even moral regret, we are left with a view of an agent who is not fully accountable to others—who can override important moral norms without having to incur any costs. Moral traces acknowledge the vulnerability and limits of our humanity. Yet it would be a mistake to stop there by allowing such an acknowledgment to turn us inward by focusing exclusively on whether our integrity has been damaged. Moral traces ought to do more than just make us feel bad. They are the impetus for broadcasting our accountability to others by offering reasons for our actions. In the case of the allocation of scarce medical resources, that accountability is necessary for extending and maintaining trust between health care providers and patients. Childress argues that randomness and chance are \"most in accord with this relationship of trust\" (1970, 349). Decisions about who should receive lifesaving treatments based on social worth are not attentive to the long-term effects of our actions on the fundamental relationships that form the basis of our society.",

A place to complain about all the problems of life, without Him humans may lose their direction and purpose in life. It has become human nature created by Allah SWT, for the purpose of worshiping God. The human relationship with God is as a servant, so humans are obliged to worship Allah throughout their lives, because everything that humans do will be accounted for in the future. Correlation analysis is a statistical tool that can be used to determine the degree of linear relationship between a variable and another variable. Correlation can be positive or negative. Correlation analysis can only explain one correlation value, when the r value is positive then the relationship is positive or when the r value is negative then the relationship is negative, the r value cannot be both. Where as in Islam, the relationship between Allah and His servants can be positive or negative.",

Moreover, this reality or event or encounter, which in a sense is beyond our thinking, our concepts, and our rules, and prior to them, is determinative and unconditional. It is all plea and command, made again and again, in episode after episode.

I present the position that understanding of the norms of living organ donation requires an examination of the personal social “network” surrounding the potential donor. Networks rely on connection which may lead to deliberate consensus building (or a reason to conform in order to limit disharmony). But I argue, even when there is a supportive social environment supporting a particular bioethical value, there will be some level of network level engagement with others in this process (for better or for worse).",

When friendly, robots can be inspiring or pathetic – they can overawe us with their superhuman powers (and with their greater than human virtue as well, at least in the writings of some authors), or they can amuse us with their stupidities and naiveté. Robots have been ‘known’ to fall in love, go mad (power- or otherwise), annoy with oversolicitousness. At least in the literature of science fiction, then, it is possible for a robot to be ‘conscious’; that means (since ‘consciousness’, like ‘material object’ and ‘universal’, is a philosopher's stand-in for more substantial words) to have feelings, thoughts, attitudes, and character traits. But is it really possible? If it is possible, what are the necessary and sufficient conditions? And why should we philosophers worry about this anyway? Aren't the mind–body problem, the problem of other minds, the problem of logical behaviorism, the problem: what did Wittgenstein really mean in the private-language argument?

      "title": "La dignidad humana en Tomás de Aquino",
      "abstract": "The notion of personal dignity was widely developed in the late Middle Ages. The labour of the authors of the Modern Age consisted in making this legacy more operative. Dignity came with the notion of person who is a being of a rational nature characterized by its incommunicability and dignity. The nominalists (Duns, Ockham, Gerson, Conrado or Biel) made, during the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, a rather abusive use of the person in law and in comparison with them, Aquino appears to be less 'personalistic'. It turns out that Thomas Aquinas had a superior jurisprudential training to those of these other authors and did not consider it appropriate to solve a problem by claiming the qualitas personalis when that subject could be decided with the instruments of the law. In addition (and this would be a valuable clarification) he does not regard the person -with his consciousness and awareness- as an isolated being, but rather describes both realities as Cum alio scientia: man is formed in his own being and there is cum Aliis. In any case, the notion of the human being with the equal dignity inherent to every rational being is already fully present in Aquino. But it is present in the way that we could call 'jurisprudential', in the way of the most classic jurists. Surely D. Alvaro d'Ors would agree very much with this way of presenting personality in law.",

In this paper we explore an interesting countertrend that seems to be occurring as well. In a variety of contexts, people are experiencing not an illusion that a mediated experience is in fact nonmediated, but the illusion that a nonmediated “real” experience is mediated. Drawing on news reports and an online survey, we identify 3 categories of this “illusion of mediation”: positive (when people perceive natural beauty as mediated), negative (when people perceive a disaster, crime, or other tragedy such as the events of September 11, 2001, as mediated), and unusual (when close connections between people's “real life” activities and mediated experiences lead them to confuse the former with the latter). We label this phenomenon inverse presence and consider its place and value in a comprehensive theory of presence, its possible antecedents and consequences, and what it suggests about the nature of our lives in the 21st century.",

      "abstract": "Previous theory proposes that humans perceive ordinary objects and experiences as beautiful, which motivates the pursuit of life. This quality is crucial among organisms that are cognitively capable of understanding that they can end their own suffering through self-killing (i.e., suicide). This paper argues that borderline personality disorder (BPD) is characterized by an inability to find beauty in ordinary experiences, which results in increased susceptibility to suicide. Accordingly, individuals with BPD pursue meaningful relationships to supplement this deficiency. Thus, those with BPD are hypothesized to have increased emotional sensitivity to interpersonal contexts, but muted emotional responses to ordinary experiences that elicit awe or happiness in others (e.g., pictures of landscapes, poetry about nature, etc.). Suicidality in individuals with BPD is often precipitated by fear of separation or rejection. At first glance this may appear as a bargaining tactic, designed to rekindle a dying relationship. Alternatively, this paper suggests that a predisposition to suicide is causal of extreme relationship-seeking behaviour in BPD. Additionally, this theory suggests that those with BPD who do not meet the interpersonal criteria for the disorder may be at a heightened risk of suicidality, because they have fewer objects to derive beauty from.",

      "abstract": "Fashion and identity are deeply intertwined with one another and in situated performativity, entailing not only individuals but atmospheres and relations to others and the Other. Something drawn upon by fashion retail, perhaps most noticeably through mannequins (living or dolls). Comparatively, fashion museums can be argued to have difficulties evoking similar reactions and participation even though often ostensibly operating with the same tools.This can be argued to depend on a number of factors, including degrees of interactivity and directionality. While mannequin dolls are seldom directly for interaction, their incarnation in commercial space represent interactivity to commodities in, within, and through spaces around them, and they have a temporal as well as an ownership directionality that proposes identities and identification. The logic of the mannequin, as Vanessa Osborne names it, is dependent on this, as well as an abstracted or de-personalized character of the mannequins, requiring the viewer to participate through completion, often involving placing oneself in the mannequin’s place.A situated experience rather than a person-object relation architecture, atmosphere, other mannequins, and other consumers participate. Thus the understanding of the mannequin can be said to be dependent on understanding its situatedness on a stage of multiple actors and actants where consumers complete the composition, much like Giovanna Stavroulaki and John Peponis observes the choreography of statues in Castlevecchio demands the visitor to complete their internal, configuratively staged narrative.By balancing the concrete and the abstract, providing enough information to trigger reading but not enough for stable interpretation, these situated presentations draw upon the viewer‟s imagination, allowing and requiring completion. In this sense, the mannequins perform diagrammatic operations, as discussed by Gilles Châtelet, but ones situated in space as almost bodies, almost persons.The recent exhibition at the Dance Museum, Stockohlm, Koroly’s Costume Drama, offered a unique opportunity to investigate this in-betweenness, as well as questions of situatedness, abstraction, expression, atmosphere, and various forms of interaction – from directly completing or participating in the staged drama to ignoring them altogether, to treating them „as is‟; that is, as inanimate objects. As few other exhibitions it allowed touch and interaction, and the staging was elaborate, dramatic, and playful. It allowed questions of architectural staging, situation, identity, and the curious operations performed by the mannequin dolls to be investigated in hands on experiments, upon which this presentation elaborates, comparing to material on mannequins in commercial as well as traditional museum environments.",

But social scientists are as inquisitive as anyone about human individuals, what makes them tick and whether they are the creators or creatures of the social world. This curiosity, I hope, warrants a focus on versions of individualism, where individuals are human agents with desires and beliefs and act in ways which account for what happens. Admittedly, there are behaviourists, who contend that a properly scientific approach neither wants nor needs to credit individuals with a subjective point of view or, indeed, any mental states. Also we have noted that, in some theories usually deemed individualist, the individuals are firms, nations or other agents lacking flesh and blood.

      "title": "Introduction: Our Automated Bodies/Our Selves",
      "abstract": "What is an automated body? What constitutes automaticity or makes an action or an impulse automatic? What is difference between an automatic--or reflex--response to stimulus and an automated-machinic--response? What is difference between a body that is constituted as a machine and a body that is self-acting in way we understand human body to be? Is an automated body always a machine? Is a human body always not a machine? Or always one? This special double issue of English Studies in Canada arises in response to a recent proliferation of narratives in which automated bodies call into question nature of humanness, both as it is comprehensible in relation to machinic and to artificially constituted elements (AI, prosthetics, and more) and as it is measured by ways in which humans respond to humanoid bodies. In recent representations, that is, ways in which humans intersect and interact with humanoid entities mark automated body as a site of anxiety not only about technology and humanness, or humanity as the human race, but humanity as kindness or benevolence--or, in other words, ways humans behave to each other, desires and impulses that can be exercised on humanoids if not on actual humans, limits of love and cruelty. Although essays in this issue do not all or necessarily respond to texts of this moment, they undertake an engagement that can be understood in context of same questions raised by contemporary representations: Are we automated? Are automated bodies us? Who is in control? These, at any rate, are kinds of questions arguably at heart of recent films such as Alex Garland's 2015 Ex Machina, television series such as HEO's 2016 Westworld or 2015 series Mr. Robot and Humans, and books such as Paolo Bacigalupi's 2009 The Windup Girl, to name only a handful of early twenty-first-century narratives in which relationships of automated and human bodies are salient and complicated and in which operates as a narrative crux: thus marketing of Mr. Robot with tagline Control is an illusion and of Humans as a story of entities who are Made in our image. Out of our control The tagline for Westworld, Every hero has a code, similarly foregrounds pivoting of narrative on balance of power between machine and human. While representation of relationships between humans and machines is not new--such representation is evident long before industrial revolution and machine age in, for instance, Da Vinci's late fifteenth-century automaton (1)--recent robot stories tend to depart from construction of robot friends and enemies as visibly machine and to demonstrate anxiety about human inability not only to machine but to recognize machine as other. That is, in recent representations, ability to distinguish between humans and robots has become increasingly urgent, as production of humanoid machines has moved away from clearly machinic--Gort in 1951 film The Day Earth Stood Still, Rosie maid in 1960s Hanna-Barbera animated series The Jetsons, Paul Verhoeven's 1987 RoboCop--and toward a commodity valuing of apparent humanness of machine. Series such as Westworld represent robot designers and robotic system coders who are driven to make theme park's android hosts as human as possible, as part of what makes their services even more desirable to real human users. Anxiety about inability to recognize robots is not, of course, a phenomenon only of past couple of decades. Ridley Scott's 1982 film Blade Runner, based on Philip K. Dick's 1968 novel, Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?, in which former detective Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford) needs to find humanoid workers who have escaped from offworld colonies where they function as slave labour, is able in film to determine madeness of replicants only by their serial numbered parts; even empathy test designed to distinguish androids from humans does not provide indisputable results. …",

      "abstract": "This article reflects and builds on the notion of a ‘non-personal Universe of Being’, a parallel realm of all essences in nature and human beings, with which we are connected via what William James called ‘the higher part’ of our soul. After reviewing that idea, its root in the inexplicability of evil and its advantage of not requiring a theodicy, there follow reflections on its implications for the daily life of any person who believes in a higher power acting in the world, but does not understand it as a personal God or Father. From that notion derives, first, the urge to look at things and humans around us for their content in being (essence) behind their appearances. On that content are grounded, on the one hand, a deep respect for nature and for its messages and, on the other hand, the need to reach out to the inner life of fellow humans (empathy) and to create being/good in daily life. Second, the notion encourages the efforts of the human soul to reach out to the Universe of Being itself, with the qualification (stressed by James) that attaining such connection depends on the self-surrender of the former to the welcome ‘invasion’ by the latter, rather than on the works of the human intellect or will.",

      "title": "A Spherical Model of Spirituality: A Pluralistic Perspective on the World's Religions",
      "abstract": "I. A Two-Dimensional Model of Spirituality O my heart, if you wish to arrive at the beginning of understanding, walk carefully. To each atom there is a different door, and for each atom there is a different way which leads to the mysterious Being of whom I speak. To know oneself one must live a hundred lives. But you must know God by Himself and not by you; it is He who opens the way that leads to Him, not human wisdom. The knowledge of Him is not at the door of rhetoricians. Knowledge and ignorance are here the same, for they cannot explain nor can they de scribe. The opinions of men on this arise only in their imagination; and it is absurd to try to deduce anything from what they say: whether ill or well, they have said it from themselves. God is above knowledge and beyond evidence, and nothing can give an idea of His Holy Majesty. Attar (1) What does it mean to be spiritual? What is spirituality, and why has it been so important in human history? Does humanity have an inherent need to be spiritual? Whether or not spirituality is a need, the question of why one is attracted to spirituality is a fundamental one. The spiritual dimension of life has always been a matter of major importance to human beings. Our spiritual heritage (2) is perhaps our richest inheritance. The Perennial Philosophy (3)--the search for Wisdom--is a cornerstone of human civilization. The world's religions provide us with the most profound questions of human existence. They have much in common in their teachings on the purpose of life. (4) To describe what spirituality is and how it is related to religion, different models have been used. Models, similar to analogies, signs, and symbols, have their own limitations. A model, whether mathematical, physical, or spiritual, tries to explain an aspect of a phenomenon or an event in nature. To that extent, every model is built on a series of assumptions, some tacitly assumed. While there are many models describing the relationship between human beings and the Ultimate Reality (God, Truth), this essay focuses on a model that has been used by many mystics, especially the Sufis: a circle. There are other models. For example, the symbol of many lines' converging to the same point is olden employed to explain the various ways of reaching the same goal. (5) Other examples are that of the valley (6) and the mountain (7) or the ox-herding pictures that are used in Zen. (8) Different religions can be compared to different ways of climbing to the peak and possibly circumambulating as one is climbing. (9) Sufism, the mystical dimension of Islam, (10) uses symbols to explain the essence of that religion. Nevertheless, like other forms of mysticism, it has a universal message. One of the most basic and fundamental assumptions in Sufism and mysticism in general is that we can know the Truth. However, before that happens, we, in our state of ignorance or illusion, have lost the ability to see and to know. To overcome this, there are certain spiritual faculties that need to be developed. With this in mind, I propose a spherical model by generalizing the circular model used in Sufism. A Sufi scholar, Seyyed Hossein Nasr, has described this model as follows: From any point in space there can be generated a circle and an indefinite number of radii which connect every point of the circumference of the circle to the Center. The circumference is the Shari'ah whose totality comprises the whole of Muslim community. Every Muslim by virtue of accepting the Divine Law is as a point standing on this circle. The radii symbolize the Turuq (plural of Tariqah). Each radius is a path from the circumference to the Center. As the Sufis say there are as many paths to God as there are children of Adam. The Tariqah, which exists in many different forms corresponding to different spiritual temperaments and needs of men, is the radius which connects each point to the Center. …",

The pre-persons are not, neither should they be considered as they were, persons. If we decide to guarantee their existence or well-being this decision must be based on considerations that are independent of their ontological constitution, of their actual biological status, and of the concept of potentiality.

As one whistleblower put it, \"They wouldn't talk about it, and they wouldn't talk about not talking about it.\" Silence does not just mean the absence of speech. Silence means that one party to the dialogue refuses to engage the other. Whistleblowers try to talk about what the organization is doing. Their bosses will only talk about the whistleblowers and their problems. \"Nuts and sluts\" is the name given to this strategy by experienced whistleblowers, in which the goal of the organization is to turn the issue into one of the mental health or morality of the whistleblower. What is unsaid, what cannot be spoken, is almost always the moral and ideological corruption of the organization. Corruption means the loss of an organization's mission. Society is a conspiracy of silence against those who cross an invisible boundary that most of us will not recognize, for to do so would establish our willingness to do almost anything to belong.",

      "abstract": "Fulfilment of existential needs has been a top priority for human since its inception. Success in achieving this is conditioned by several different factors, which in different ways and with different consequences prevented people from fulfilling their needs. The result of the action of different forces was always the same, i.e. human suffered pain. Starting from natural disasters, which he did not understand, to other people who wanted to steal his prey, the environment became more and more dangerous. Joining different groups brought certain advantages in the field of joint action, against certain dangers, but at the same time new conditions of life and realization of life's needs. In social groups, new relationships were developing, which were driven by previously unknown forces, which represented new dangers. Therefore, human no longer had individual problems, but they were raised to the social level, and with that the level of complexity of mutual relations between people increased. Human is simply forced to protect his values in order to fulfil his needs. In order to realize this, he had to create an environment in which there is no danger, that is, a safe environment. The creation of such an environment was influenced by many factors, i.e., forces in nature and social groups. Emergency situations are a significant danger to modern society. Observed in terms of intensity or consequences, the hazards that cause them generate significant problems for society. The last decades of the 20th century are full of an increasing number of emergency situations, which significantly disrupt social security, at the local, regional and global level.",

      "title": "The Phenomenon of Aggressive Behavior of Learners in the School Situation.",
      "abstract": "Aggression is an internal process of human being in relationship with his/her self, other persons and the environment. The external manifestations of aggression, whether constructive or destructive, are not the starting point of aggression. Aggression develops from childhood and continues into adulthood. In this regard Chamberlain (2000:1-4) even states that aggression can develop from before birth. Aggression starts within the psychological world of the individual. The way in which the individual interprets his/her perception will elicit an emotional response that will affect the person's decision on what to do with his/her interpretation of the world. What matters is the way it is expressed-either constructive or destructive behaviour. Aggression is expressed in a constructive manner if it is about the survival and personal and healthy growth of the individual, family, group and/or the community. Aggression is expressed in destructive manner if it harms self and/or others and/or the environment (Tesser, 1995:383-418). According to Kruger, Rech and Van Staden (1993:9) aggression can viewed as any type of behaviour that is directed to harm, hurt, inflict pain or destroy another person when this person is motivated to avoid such behaviour. Aggression can also be self-directed-consciously or unconsciously (self-critical, self-harm, verbal threats and assault). Psycho-social factors that contributes towards aggressive behaviour include inability to cope with frustration; uncomfortable livelihood; exposure to aggressive models such as violence in the media and parents with aggressive behaviour; poor socio-economic circumstances especially in urbanized areas; poor family relationships; times of social stress (such as high inflation rate and increasing divorce statistics), and rejection by peers (Pepler & Sedighdeilami, 1998:205-214; Collings, 1994:35-37; Pulkkinen & Ramirez, 1991:69; Kruger, Rech & Van Staden, 1993:9-10). Situational factors can contribute towards aggressive behaviour including competitive sports, physical pain, anxiety, being in a crowed; and air and noise pollution (Smith & Furlong: 1998, 2021-202; Kruger & Van Staden, 1993:10). Biological factors contributing to aggression include constitutional factors (a person's temperament); genetics; hormonal factors; neuro-anatomical factors such as neurotransmission and neuro-logical disturbances (Mooij: 374; Kruger, Rech & Van Staden, 1993: 10-11). The self-determination theory state that the motivational orientation have been linked to how individuals regulate self-esteem in other potentially threatening contexts and social interactions (Hodgens, Koestner, & Duncan, 1996; Hodgins, Liebeskind, & Schartz, 1996; Knee & Zuckerman, 1996, 1998). Further, Deci and Ryan (1991) stated that when self-regulation proceeds according to an unintegrated aspect of the person, as with the ego involvement on controlled behaviour, the experienced emotion will be less flexible, more pressured, and more subjective to defensive reaction that less fully express one's integrated self. Investigators have operational zed self -determination in various ways, including the aspiration that individuals endorse (Kasser & Ryan, 1993, 1996), coercive elements of the social context (Deci, Spiegel, Ryan, Koestner, & Kauffmann, 1982; Ryan, Mims, & Koestner, 1983), self-reported reasons for engaging in various behaviours (Vallerand & Bissonette, 1992; Vallerand, Blais, Briere & Pelletier, 1989), and individual differences in motivational orientations (Deci & Ryan, 1985a; Hodgins, Liebeskind, et al, 1996; Knee & Zuckerman, 1996, 1998). This latter work on motivational orientations evolve from the assumption that people differ in the extent to which they regulate their behaviour based on autonomy and choice, or based on pressure (either real or imagined; Deci & Ryan, 1985a). Same-level or cross--level processes (interaction) may exist. …",

      "title": "Autistic States in Children",
      "abstract": "Frances Tustin (1913-1994) was one of the first professionally trained child psychotherapists in Britain. Although internationally recognised for her pioneering therapeutic work with autistic children, her approach is considered by some to be controversial, as her psychogenic view of childhood autism challenged the belief that it is biological and genetic. Autistic States in Children is widely regarded as a vitally important work for understanding the causes of autism in young children. Vividly describing her clinical encounters with autistic children, Tustin argued that autistic states were above all self-protective ones. In her observational studies, she noted how autistic children's interaction with physical objects, such as keys, toy cars, or other play items, had a rigid and ritualistic quality, far removed from the typical kind of fantasy play seen in other children. Such objects are not used by autistic children for their intended purpose, Tustin argued, but rather in sensation-dominated ways that interfere with mental development. She also drew a fundamental distinction between two autistic groups: an 'encapsulated' group, which is withdrawn and non-verbal, and an 'entangled' group, who are hyperactive and chaotic but have some language. Autistic States in Children influenced not only those in psychotherapy and psychoanalysis but countless others who have contact with autistic children, especially families, and remains essential reading for anyone seeking a creative and compelling understanding of autism. This Routledge Classics edition includes a new Foreword by Maria Rhode.",

This chapter explores ancient conceptions of liberality as a virtue, freely granted favors, and gratitude, as discussed by Cicero, Seneca, and Aristotle, and argues that gratitude is not a response to generosity as such but rather to the love that is manifested in the act of giving.",

Something similar can be said of interpersonal systems such as the family, the community, or whole societies, which must be capable of acquiring, transforming or transmitting, processing, and allocating resources and information among their human components. The way a social system performs these functions will affect power relations and condition the behaviors of its human components, but it is also true that people — both as individuals and through their organizations — affect their encompassing social, economic, and political environments. In responding to events and maintaining themselves, people alter their surroundings in ways that then push their lives in directions that often were not anticipated. Thus, we all tend to influence our futures in ways that may be indirect, complex, and difficult to perceive or understand.",

      "abstract": "Resisting our judgments and inner conflicts only perpetuates and intensifies them; \"what we resist persists.\"It is important to compassionately, calmly, courageously, accept our natural judgments, reactions, preferences, and emotional pain without being controlled by, acting upon, or exclusively identified with non-constructive or inappropriate urges.We can let be and embrace our judgments and conflicted feelings but also see beyond them to a deeper level of our being that is unconditionally relaxed, serene, intrinsically selfaccepting, and naturally, compassionately nonjudgmental.We have an innate urge to restore our natural wholeness of being by reunifying with formerly estranged, disturbed, self-conflicted, aspects of ourselves.When we stop struggling against, distancing, identifying with, taking a judgmental partisan stance for or against, or being overly dominated by emotional negativity or conflicted, disturbing aspects of our energy, then our energy is thereby liberated from self-division and self-conflict, which makes our energy, feelings, and behavior less tense, less negative, and produces greater inner relaxed peace, fulfillment, and wholeness of being.That inner wholeness is also our natural psychotherapeutic healing, health, happiness, wholesomeness, and holiness, not an idealized perfectionistic holiness, but attunement to what is naturally easeful, harmonious, regenerative, sacred, precious, beautiful, truly good, and life-affirming in ourselves and others.][6][7][8]",

      "title": "Socrates and the supremacy of virtue",
      "abstract": "Even a casual reader of the Apology understands that Socrates believes that virtue is more important than anything else, even his own life. What has not been recognized, or at least not accorded any significance, is that for Socrates virtue is an aim. He believes that you should never aim simply at saving your life at the expense of aiming at what is virtuous; in other words, your life counts for nothing as an aim when compared with virtue as an aim. But “the supremacy of virtue” does not imply the quite implausible view that many readers apparently attribute to Socrates, that one's loss of life is not relevant to the deliberation about what is in fact the virtuous action in some circumstances; that is, the view that one's life counts for nothing in a different sense. It is not as though one could determine what the virtuous action is independently of considerations of life, death, pleasure, pain, or material loss or gain. Socrates is not saying that we should ignore these things absolutely. Any fact described in non-evaluative terms may in principle be relevant in a deliberation that seeks to determine what the virtuous action is here and now. Certainly factors like pleasure and pain, life and death, wealth, and the welfare of friends and family will be most relevant to such deliberations. We must ignore such things, however, as aims of action when they conflict with what virtue requires.",

      "abstract": "In the human brain, simple molecules and complex circuits are constantly making decisions which are indispensable for our survival and also to accomplish a variety of daily activities such as walking, memorizing, conversing, composing music, painting or poetry.... All are the result of the integration of many neural systems that perceive many and simultaneous visual, tactile, auditory and/or mental stimuli. Once synthetized, they are immediately transmitted to the corresponding executive systems, thus completing the fascinating functional loop of decision-making: a) perception of stimuli or information which originate in the environment, b) selection and elaboration of the decision which is considered more appropriate or attractive according to personal experience or intuition and c) execution. If these neural nets have been damaged or haven failed to develop the mechanisms of facilitation or inhibition that govern them become unbalanced. If inhibition is reduced, excessive and violent behaviour is expressed as in patients suffering from manic phases. Conversely, if inhibition is excessive, decision making mechanisms are not operative. In either case, behaviour is not \"reasonable\" and does not follow prototypical patterns. All these processes must be the consequence of a constant molecular activity full of micro-decisions whose effectiveness depends on the histological and biochemical integrity of the neurons. This microenvironment is responsible for all types of decisions of all forms of life and represents one of the fundamental successes of evolution.",

      "abstract": "&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Emotions which are considered as a basic factor of all relationships 1are very powerful and to a very great extent they control our behaviour, thoughts and all other aspects of life. The behaviour and thought processes are directly influenced by the past experiences and early developmental stages. Emotion is the feeling aspect of consciousness characterized by a physical aspect like physical arousal, behaviours that reveal emotion to the outside world, and an inner awareness of feelings. Healthy emotions motivate us and give us energy for appropriate action. Unhealthy emotions are either overly intense or suppressed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt; Smiston in 1974 defined “Emotional maturity is a process in which the personality is continuously striving for greater sense of emotional health, both intra-physically and intra-personally” (as cited in Singh &amp;amp; Bhargava, 1990). Kaplan and Baron describes a emotionally mature person as having the capacity to withstand delay in satisfaction of needs, ability to tolerate a reasonable amount of frustration, has belief in long-term planning and is capable of delaying or revising expectations in terms of demands of situation, has capacity to make effective adjustment with themselves, members of family, his peers in the school, society and culture. Maturity is not only the capacity for these attitudes and functioning but also it is the ability to enjoy them fully (as cited in Singh &amp;amp; Bhargava, 1990). According to Hollingworth (1928) an emotionally mature person will be capable of responding in gradation or degree of emotional responses, he does not respond in all or none fashion, but keeps within bounds. He will be able to delay his responses as controlled with the impulsiveness of young child. And he will also be able to handle self-pity (as cited in Singh &amp;amp; Bhargava, 1990).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

      "title": "Wondering Animals: Reflections on Human Exceptionality",
      "abstract": "Both historically and in common human practices, attitudes, and beliefs, a sense of human exceptionality in comparison with other animals undergirds normative anthropocentrism, i.e. prioritization of human interests. The question I wish to address in this article is whether we can use a particular element of the cognitive apparatus or toolkit that supposedly makes us special, namely our s e n s e of wonder, to decenter us. Several authors have argued that when we view other beings or the natural world with wonder, we are inclined to care for and wish to protect them. But here I am interested in what happens when we turn our sense of wonder onto ourselves as the peculiar animal, the strange evolutionary experiment that we are. Not, as has historically been done, in an admiring way, but in an evaluatively more neutral way, characterized by puzzlement, an attunement to mystery, and a sense of unlikeliness and contingency. In particular, how might our thinking about ourselves change when we think from a wonder that revolves around our embodiment, around that which roots us most firmly in the world, in “nature,” and reminds us most clearly of our membership of a community of earthly life? Wondering at and about ourselves as an animal species may remind us of our material embeddedness in the world, but what could its ethical import be? More specifically, the paper explores whether there is an escape from the ethical quandaries of human exceptionality, which relate to the impossibility of doing with or without that exceptionality. I argue that there is not, but that in wonder we can hold together incompatible possibilities.",

This chapter explores a number of basic structural features of bias, including the facts that biases have a characteristic direction and that they typically come in complementary pairs. It defends the idea that whether a person or thing counts as biased can be a relative matter and offers preliminary discussions of the phenomena of higher-order bias (or bias about bias) and biased representation. Finally, it explores the relationships between biased wholes and biased parts. It argues that a group might be biased even if all of its individual members are unbiased, and that, conversely, a group might be unbiased even if its members are severely biased.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Physical and instinctive needs are natural and neutral, can not in itself be said that one's needs are higher than the other. It is precisely the way in which people manage and satisfy those needs that can be given a praiseworthy or despicable title. In the view of Islam, if these needs are met with the actions carried out according to Islamic guidance, then it will be a commendable act. Conversely, if these needs are met with acts that violate the guidance of Islam then he becomes a disgraceful act. Spiritual intelligence associated with the problem of meaning, value, spiritual intelligence is able to guide humans to find meaning and can also guide people in reaching his ideals. Spiritual intelligence goes beyond the ability to intelligently think, feel, act and behave in situational contexts or given frameworks. Spiritual intelligence enables humans to be wise in reflecting on the situation to find themselves more meaningful so as to be able to transform something more precious. With the formation of spirituality culture in the workplace, it is expected to form employees who are happy, know and able to meet the purpose of life. Such employees generally have a balanced life between work and person, between duty and service. In general, they also have higher performance. The results of a large consulting firm, the application of a spiritual work environment increase productivity and reduce turn over. Other studies show that employees of high spiritual intelligence and supported by a work environment that is also spiritual, positively become more creative, have high job satisfaction, are able to work well in teams, and have a high commitment to the organization.

      "title": "Counseling: Application in the Muslim community setting",
      "abstract": "Muslims have concrete life guidance that manifest itself in the Quran and the prophetic traditions, however, they are not completely immune from the psychological imbalances\r\nin their lives. Like any other people in this world they face many types of difficulties in their lives that create havoc and maladjustment's in their personalities. These\r\nmaladjustment's pose as catalysts to anxieties and stubborn thresholds to an individual’s and group’s normal functioning. In Islamic thinking and belief, Muslims admit that the human is made up of two different creations, the spirit and the body. Al Ghazali, one of the great and famous Muslim scholars asserts and misery are caused by the conditions of the soul. The soul is a substance by itself (al Ghazali) but the body of a\r\nhuman being relies on the soul to achieve its optimum functioning. The human soul is not perfect in nature and when it joins the human body, it is subject to some influences of human desires that pollute its status and fall sick with some mischievous diseases. Among the diseases of the soul that have direct implications to hunan functioning are sorrow, excessive anger, unrealistic fear, selfishness, destructive envy, dissatisfaction, rancor, and failure to stick to Allah’s guidance. Therefore, this paper is an attempt to provide some useful interventions that could be used to properly deal with these human\r\npredicaments in the Muslim communities in order to achieve the real happiness in our lives in this world and that of hereafter. Some essential counseling interventions in the\r\nMuslim communities include strengthening their souls, strengthen their Iman, awareness of whom they are (self-awareness), the purpose of their creation, analyzing things and occasions rationally, eradication of negative thinking and self defeating thoughts, patience and prayers, understanding that life calamities are part of our lives as tests, fighting the narcissistic self talk, etc.",

Making time is a depressive-position activity, necessitating acknowledgement of the other's separateness and significance to oneself and of one's role in the existence and well-being of the other person. To make time is, ultimately, an act of love. There are expressions of killing time that are not necessarily symptoms of borderline states but that also signify disavowal of object need. The borderline personality kills time to keep apart from objects. Time is omnipresent and a central human preoccupation. Varying definitions of time arise as a consequence of cultural and psychological influences reflecting subjective and social perspectives.

      "title": "Containing Multitudes: Reflection, Expertise and Persons as Groups",
      "abstract": "From time to time, philosophers like to raise the possibility of the existence of group minds or group persons. In order for something to be interestingly and appropriately described as a group person it must satisfy two conditions. First, it must itself exhibit various characteristics that are distinctive of persons. Unless it did this, it would not be a group person. Secondly, it must be composed of entities that are themselves persons or relevantly person-like. Without this, it would not be a group person. It is the difficulty of seeing how these two conditions can be satisfied together that has made the existence and possible natures of group persons problematic. For the things that paradigmatically satisfy the first condition, namely persons, are not obviously thought of as being composed of person-like entities related in some group-like way. And the things that paradigmatically satisfy the second condition, such as sports teams, committees and string quartets, are not obviously thought of as themselves displaying personal characteristics. Investigators of group persons – though not always thinking of themselves as such – have usually approached the problem by starting with paradigmatic and uncontroversial groups and exploring the extent to which personal characteristics can be attributed to them. Since it would be unreasonable to expect such groups to exhibit, even in some possibly attenuated way, all the characteristics of an ordinary person, attention is usually directed to some subset of these characteristics. Can such a group have a single consciousness? Can it be the subject of intentional mental states like belief? Can it act? Can it be guilty?",

      "abstract": "This paper aims at answering the following question: why does Pliny the Elder attribute to the Persians the discovery of perfumes? According to him, they are supposed to use them to hide the smell of their own dirtiness. These unjustified assertions are to be considered as an expression of Roman prejudices towards the Oriental world—whether real of fantasized. Perfumes, in Pliny’s context, are in themselves an evocation of this world: their ingredients are extracted from Arabia or India; moreover, Pliny associates them with luxuria, which is—according to Roman cliches—a distinctive feature of the East. The “indolent” Persians are excellent representatives of this specific feature; they are thus set in opposition with the Romans, which means they are unable to respect the standards of an honorable Roman citizen. According to these standards, the Roman is supposed to have a balanced behavior in his body presentation (avoiding dirtiness—which would make him uncivilized or even wild—but also avoiding an excessive care—which would make him effeminate). By nature, the Persian cannot do that; as a basic stranger to Pliny’s ideal world, he is not able to take accurate care about himself; and as an Oriental, he is easily corrupted by decadency. In other terms, Persians are both uncivilized and effeminate. The perfumes, as presented by Pliny, are the mirror of this twofold incapacity.",

The strategy can be traced back at least to Aristotle, who suggested that human beings have a characteristic function or activity (rational activity of soul), and that the virtues are traits of character which enable humans to perform this kind of activity excellently or well. The defining feature of this approach is that it treats the virtues as functional concepts, to be both identified and justified by reference to some independent goal or end which they enable people to attain (human flourishing, rational perfection, participation in practices, ‘narrative unity’ in a life). Some recent philosophers seem to have hoped that by following this perfectionist strategy, we might attain a more convincing account of our moral practices than rule-based theories of ethics have been able to provide.",

      "title": "Synchronization and Self-Organization in Organizations. The Combinatory System© View.",
      "abstract": "In any organization people may be observed from two different points of view: first of all as organs (or components of organs), in the sense that organizational relationships assign them a precise spatial and temporal placement, they carry out a specialized function in relation to the entire structure, they have a specific functionality that delimits the admissible interactions with the other elements, and they show a particular functioning; secondly , as members of a social collectivity in which, independently of their organizational role and connections, they appear as similar agents , moved by private objectives, capable of producing micro decisions, behaviours and effects relatively analogous to that of the others. My study considers the second aspect of human behaviour in organizations and aims to present a simple theory - the Theory of Combinatory Systems - which may allow us to describe, explain, and to a certain extent control many relevant and intriguing collective phenomena and their observable effects, which are produced by agents acting as unorganized social systems, even if they are also members of an organizational structure. In plain words I define as a combinatory system any collectivity (composed of individuals or organizations) whose agents, consciously or unconsciously, act (exclusively or prevalently) on the basis of global information which they direcly produce and update as the consequence of their micro behaviours. On the one hand, the global information is - or derives from – a synthetic variable whose values are produced by the combination of the micro states of the agents (hence the name Combinatory System ) but, on the other, these values affect the subsequent states as a result of a micro-macro feedback , acting over a period of time, that produces self-organization in the agents’ micro behaviours. If we accept the traditional definition of self-organization as the macro behaviour of a collectivity of agents in which the micro behaviours appear to be “directed”, or “organized”, by an Invisible Hand , or Supreme Authority , in order to produce the emerging phenomenon represented by the formation of ordered structures, of recognizable patterns, then it is easy to recognize that the macro phenomena produced by the macro behaviour of the system become factors in self-organization, since they are interpreted by the agents as information they can base their decisions on. In other words, the invisible hand is nothing other than the synergetic effect of the micro-macro feedback action (or circular causality ) that generates and updates the global information that produces self-organization and emerging macro behaviours attributable to the collectivity.",

      "abstract": "Denial, acting on both the inner and external world, relies on further defence mechanisms in the form of object manipulations aimed at changing reality to make it fit the denying person's inner needs. If the object's ego is not strong enough to resist these manipulations, it is pressured into a submissive relationship. By means of seduction or its opposite, intimidation and the use of threats, the object is made to believe the content of the denying persons's inner or external world. The result is a mutually intrusive and reciprocal relationship in which the roles of victim and perpetrator alternate. This is the case when children are not allowed to acquire their own experiences during the process of transition from symbiosis to separation. Constant exposure to irritation leads to a regression of the ego, to the illusion that everything is possible in the 'we'. Object relations in adult life are then based on a parasitic need for the object in order to realize inner goals. In analysis this is manifested as symbiotic omnipotence, posing a 'serious stumbling block' to the analytic process, which may take the form of an 'as-if' analysis.",

The toy is defined as an object that physically and virtually personifies what the child wants his toy does. From the patterns of identity, relating the child's toy with their interests and needs of being accompanied or supported by a friend or whatever their interest.

In other words, this project seeks to give life to everyday objects to weave new bonds between people and objects, symbiotic processes that help the user to think about why they use or preference of one object or another, seen from the emotions and memory that person gives the object the user experience. Consequently the proposal would streamline daily life, and enhance the experiences from the use and interaction mediated through an exchange of stimuli between people and objects.",

      "abstract": "Though it was commonly accepted by early modern Spanish intellectuals that animals feel pleasure and pain - that they feel and respond to what they feel - a debate arose over whether animals possess some degree of agency or feelings similar to human love. Scholastics like Francisco de Vitoria and Francisco Suarez emphasized what they themselves saw as fundamental species-specific differences between humans and other animals. Given Scholasticism's influence in early modern Spain, and its reliance on arguments from authority, the extent to which Spanish intellectuals' actual interaction with animals informed their arguments is not clear, but attraction or aversion to other animals and behaviors deemed animal is. Despite their differences, intellectuals of the Spanish Empire did generally agree that humans and other animals share sentience. While Suarez's animals are fully sentient and beings full of feelings, predetermined in their responses and actions by God, and bereft of true agency and choice.Keywords: animals; feelings; Francisco de Vitoria; Francisco Suarez; human love; interaction; Scholasticism; sentient beings; Spanish Intellectuals",

      "title": "Depression: Discrete or Continuous?",
      "abstract": "Elucidating the true structure of depression is necessary if we are to advance our understanding and treatment options. Central to the issue of structure is whether depression represents discrete types or occurs on a continuum. Nature almost universally operates on the basis of continuums, whereas human perception favors discrete categories. This reality might be formalized into a 'continuum principle': natural phenomena tend to occur on a continuum, and any instance of hypothesized discreteness requires unassailable proof. Research evidence for discrete types falls far short of this standard, with most evidence supporting a continuum. However, quantitative variation can yield qualitative differences as an emergent property, fostering the appearance of discreteness. Depression as a continuum is best characterized by duration and severity dimensions, with the latter understood in terms of depressive inhibition. In the absence of some degree of cognitive, emotional, social, and physical inhibition, depression should not be diagnosed. Combining the dimensions of duration and severity provides an optimal way to characterize the quantitative and related qualitative aspects of depression and to describe the overall degree of dysfunction. The presence of other symptom types occurs when anxiety, hypomanic/manic, psychotic, and personality continuums interface with the depression continuum.",

Ideally, we think, it should be possible to present our progress through life not as a thing of fits and starts, of zig–zags, gestures and recoils, but as aimed in a single uniform direction. If we esteem some things above others, praise some men, commend some deeds, admire some paintings this should be (according to the ideal) because in each case the Supreme Value or Ultimate Good finds expression in the esteemed, praised, commended or admired thing, man, deed or picture.

      "abstract": "Human existence is specific in that it involves upbringing based on setting goals, which people attain or strive to attain over a shorter or longer period of time. Such goals are necessary for people and their upbringing. Many contemporary concepts of human existence emphasize this goal-oriented human nature. For instance, Alfred Adler’s individual psychology includes a theory that our goals influence our life plan and lifestyle. Goal-oriented human nature seems to be in harmony especially with the specificity of pedagogical thought and action, spread continually between the actual state and the possible state of man and community, in a kind of a tension between reality and ideals, between the actual state and the desired state (axiological outline of upbringing, pedagogy and its individual disciplines). While on the one hand we have the actual state of a person and their surrounding reality, we also need the ideal dimension as well as the third category, that is the values that are between the Absolute and the values of the various stages of existence, which find their fulfillment in the value of freedom, without which man not only would not be able to possess the highest values, but he would also remain crippled as a result of being who he should be, not who he actually is. It is the value of freedom that makes man become the creator of values in the process of adopting an external ideal and making it the inner form of a person (introception of values). The presence of goals in the process of the act of education makes it possible, as well as causes outcrop or exteriorization of man himself in his humanity.",

When people engage in these experiences and with these objects they seem to move from a realm of necessity to a realm of higher values and of real freedom, to use a famous image of Karl Marx. Using Hegel’s metaphor of the ‘Sunday of life’ as its guide, the Conclusion responds to this final objection by showing the many connections that tie the realm of necessity to the realms that transcend necessity.

      "abstract": "We live in an age of outspokenness, when disclosure of once-unmentionable attitudes, proclivities and private practices is commonplace and even encouraged. Yet one intimate personal habit remains widely concealed, a subject of embarrassment and ridicule, although it is probably universal, extremely useful, an intrinsic part of a full and productive life, and completely harmless to anyone else. I am referring to the unspeakable and largely untalked-of practice of talking to oneself. Psychologists have shown a remarkable neglect of the conversations that individuals have with themselves, except for Ruth Weir's (1962) classic account of infant-eavesdropping in Language in the Crib , and a controversy between Piaget and Vygotsky. Piaget (1959) referred to talking to oneself as part of an outward progression from egocentric thought to socialized speech. From an opposing perspective, Vygotsky (1962) regarded as a transition from external control of an infant's behavior by the language of others to personal and internal speech which is eventually silenced to become thought. Both seemed to regard talking to oneself as an essentially childish episode. Yet I doubt if many adults live in a silent world inside their heads, whether or not they make much noise outside. Many of us sing to ourselves, with or without an inner instrumental accompaniment. We whistle, hum and produce other sound effects. And especially, we talk to ourselves. I have been casually interested in talking to oneself for several years. The question which I first asked myself concerned what fluency in writing and fluency in speaking might have in common. Many people speak articulately but find writing difficult. Others write fluently but are reticent in speech. Some, of course, do both, and a few have difficulty in doing either. My question was whether there might be an underlying language fluency which in some people is expressed orally,",

First, it must be more cautious than many examples of the anthropology of character past in taking for granted that character can be generalised to the level of the ‘national’. Second, it should not fall back on a general psychology – whether of temperament or of the strategic actor. Third, it should take the complexity of character – from its embodiment and re‐embodiment in the individual to the plural and often competing and inconsistent collective demands of the formation of character that any given individual in any collective context must face – as its point of departure. Fourth, it should not privilege the homeostasis of the reproduction of character over the dynamics of the alteration of character. Fifth, it should avoid the anthropic as the only or even the chief domain of which judgements of character might be of anthropological interest. All of these requirements can potentially be met in approaching the analysis of character through extrapolating system‐theoretically from the logic of the Bourdieusian field.",

What I mean by the constitution of a system is the aggregate of those causes and tendencies which produce its observed character, when operating, without interference, under those conditions to which the system is conceived to be adapted. Our judgment of such adaptation must be founded upon a study of the circumstances in which the system attains its freest action, produces its most harmonious results, or fulfils in some other way the apparent design of its construction. There are cases in which we know distinctly the causes upon which the operation of a system depends, as well as its conditions and its end. This is the most perfect kind of knowledge relatively to the subject under consideration. There are also cases in which we know only imperfectly or partially the causes which are at work, but are able, nevertheless, to determine to some extent the laws of their action, and, beyond this, to discover general tendencies, and to infer ulterior purpose. It has thus, I think rightly, been concluded that there is a moral faculty in our nature, not because we can understand the special instruments by which it works, as we connect the organ with the faculty of sight, nor upon the ground that men agree in the adoption of universal rules of conduct; but because while, in some form or other, the sentiment of moral approbation or disapprobation manifests itself in all, it tends, wherever human progress is observable, wherever society is not either stationary or hastening to decay, to attach itself to certain classes of actions, consentaneously, and after a manner indicative both of permanency and of law.",

The level of communication he must have had in mind lies deep in the human dependency on expressive symbols. These primary factors of human experience—primary in the sense that nothing stands between them and the raw sensations and impulses—are made up of words, gestures, and images which are, in turn, invariably organized in systems or complexes.

But identity is the only relation that each and every thing necessarily bears to itself and that no thing could bear to anything distinct from itself. By contrast, some things don't point at all, much less point at themselves, and sometimes you point at things other than yourself. For any relation, there are criteria that objects must meet if one is to bear the relation to the other: you are pointing at yourself, for instance, only if your finger is directed toward your body. Locke's Scholastic and Cartesian predecessors used the term \"principium individuationis,\" or the principle of individuation, to refer to the criterion that two things meet just in case they are, indeed, two things and not one. The flip side of the principle of individuation is what we might call the principle of identity, a criterion that two things meet just in case they are not two things at all but are, in fact, one. Imagine, for instance, that you are looking at a picture, taken some years ago, of a baby, and you are wondering if it is a picture of you. A specification of the principle of identity of persons would be a specification of a rule, or principle, that would be met by you and the baby in the picture just in case you are the baby in the picture.",

To be a human person includes both objectivity and subjectivity, both physicality and spirituality. A person is endowed with the capacity for rational activity. As such, every person is endowed with the capacity for self-reflection and interiority. human person is a synthesis of two poles. On the one hand, every human person is always situated in one’s physicality, in a particular environment, at a particular time and place, in a specific cultural milieu. On the other hand, every human person is endowed with the capacity to gain a critical distance from one’s situation, to become self-aware, to reflect, and to become detached, taking up a stance over against one’s position in the world. Each of these two capacities, the ability to be immersed in the here-and-now as well as the ability to gain a critical distance from one’s environment, is open to abuse. It is possible to throw oneself so completely into the moment, that one entirely neglects one’s capacity for transcendence, for interiority, and for critical detachment.

Or can the other in these communicative interactions be otherwise?</JATS1:p> <JATS1:p>This book is about others (and other kinds of others). It concerns the current position and status of the other in the face of technological innovations that can, in one way or another distort, mask, or even deface the other. Ten innovative essays, written by an international team of experts, individually and in collaboration with each other, seek to diagnose the current situation with otherness, devise innovative solutions to the questions of alterity, and provide insight for students, teachers and researchers trying to make sense of the opportunities and challenges of the 21st century.</JATS1:p>",

      "title": "The sublime : groundwork towards a theory",
      "abstract": "This is a work of quite unusual philosophical interest, original and deeply insightful. Dr. Tsang argues on the one hand that sublimity is not a property of objects regarded as sublime, but belongs to our construal of objects, while on the other he also argues that when we so construe an object we are giving expression to some limit to our life, not an external barrier, but a limit internal to it. But what lies at the limit cannot be represented. So the sublime can be evoked by language, but not represented in it. This leads Dr. Tsang on to a philosophical analysis of evocation and of the evocative possibilities of a sublime object. What he says about evocation presupposes and requires for its completion an account of how affective elements are involved in the experience of the sublime and what he claims here is that there is no one feeling or type of feeling involved in the experience of the sublime, but that a wide range of different feelings may be involved on different occasions. The quality of the feeling is closely bound up with the character of the experience of the sublime as a limit-experience. Finally Dr. Tsang considers the cultural and social context of experiences of the sublime, both what is universally recognized as sublime, because bound up with the general conditions of human life, and what is specific to particular cultural and social contexts. He then moves to the conclusion to examine the relationship of the sublime to human willing. As a postscript there is an excellent treatment of Kant's theory of the sublime.",

      "abstract": "Methodological individualism (MI) is the thesis that certain psychological properties are intrinsic properties, such as ‘being made out of iron’, rather than externally relational properties, such as ‘being an aunt’. It has been challenged by influential ‘anti-individualist’ claims of, for example, Putnam and Burge, according to which the content of an individual’s words or thoughts (beliefs, desires) is determined in part by facts about their social or physical environment. Putnam, for example, imagines a planet, ‘twin earth’, which is identical to the earth in 1750 (prior to modern chemistry) in all respects except that wherever earth had H2O, twin earth had a different but superficially similar chemical, XYZ. Putnam argues that the English word ‘water’ in 1750 referred only to H2O, while the twin word ‘water’ refers only to XYZ. Historically, the term ‘methodological individualism’ has referred to the thesis that all social explanation must be ultimately expressible in terms of facts about individual human beings; not about economic classes, nations and so on. For a treatment of this subject, see Explanation in history and social science §1.",

Yet, paradoxically, this indirect impression can be the strongest and most lasting, our unspoken nervousness or confidence making a greater effect than considered conversation. And sometimes the indirect impression is one we do not take into account ourselves; perhaps some person arouses a reaction which we have never recognized in ourselves, or a situation makes us more afraid than we are able to admit. But even so, others may observe our changed behavior, for the effect we make individually is both direct and indirect, conscious and subconscious.",

      "abstract": "Many people believe in supernatural entities, which might be personal (deities, devils, ghosts) or impersonal (fate/destiny, karma, luck). Some people see such entities as causing events in the world, including experiences in their own lives. Our study draws on social, motivational, and cognitive frameworks to predict beliefs and experiences involving supernatural entities. We hypothesized that positive predictors of beliefs in specific entities (God, the devil, ghosts/spirits, impersonal forces of fate/destiny, luck and karma) would include being taught about the entities early in life, anticipating positive reactions from peers about one's beliefs, and wanting to believe in such entities. We also proposed that beliefs in specific entities, along with beliefs that such entities can affect the natural world, would predict more perceived experiences with these entities. We preregistered and tested these hypotheses in two samples (Ns = 475 and 290) of undergraduates. Path analytic results were largely consistent across entities. Being taught to believe in a specific entity early in life predicted current desire to believe in the entity but anticipated reactions from peers did not. Current desire to believe, in turn, strongly predicted belief in the entity, belief that the entity can affect the natural world, and perceived experiences with the entity. Belief in supernatural entities strongly predicted perceived experiences with them. These results map the structure of relations between relatively stable predictors of supernatural attributions, with an emphasis on social, cognitive, and motivational factors, and they suggest some plausible pathways by which such beliefs and experiences might develop.",

      "abstract": "150 BOOK REVIEWS on them the ability to judge more surely in the practical order than can those who have only book knowledge (cf. STh 11-11, q. 45, a. 2, on the gift of wisdom, with the example of chastity). Each virtue, or more precisely all the virtues united in the active experience, provide such a knowledge which is specifically moral. The knowledge through experience that is given by the gifts is inseparable from that proceeding from the virtues, for the organism of virtues and gifts, united in the believer, intervenes integrally in the concrete action. The gifts are rooted in the theologal virtues and cannot be separated from them. Nevertheless, the experience of the gifts possesses its own special character, an awareness of an inspiration or a motion of the Spirit calling for docility and inciting to action. From the subject's point of view the modality is more passive or receptive. There is a sense of being moved by another, while at the same time acting very personally in faith, confidence, and love. Many other things could be said about this beautiful book which touches upon numerous problems. I only hope these lines will be sufficient to make it appreciated. (Translated by Sr. Mary Thomas Noble, O.P.) SERVAIS PINCKAERS, 0.P. Albertinum Fribourg, Switzerland The Beginning and the End of \"Religion.\" By NICHOLAS LASH. New York: Cambridge University Press, 1996. Pp. 284. $54.95 (cloth). ISBN 0-521-56232-5. About halfway into this book of collected essays, Nicholas Lash mentions that he keeps at home a poster from the British Government's Propaganda Office during World War II, one of a series meant to sustain high levels of vigilance in the civilian population. Its message: \"Careless talk costs lives\" (127). Only slightly altered, this monitum could also serve as the epigraph to what, in retrospect, makes for a remarkably cohesive assemblage of essays: \"careless God-talk corrodes faith.\" Like a leitmotifin an opera, Lash, the Norris-Hulse Professor of Divinity at the University of Cambridge, alerts the reader to this central concern of his, as when he defines theologians as those people \"who watch their language in the presence of God\" (59), or when he wittily points out that too often in contemporary theology the bandying about of the term \"ineffability\" has become an all-purpose cop-out for hard theological analysis: \"As the God of modern deism fades from view like Lewis Carroll's Cheshire Cat, his only trace a smile of vague and indeterminate benignity, some people BOOK REVIEWS 151 construe ineffability to mean that we may say, concerning God, more or less whatever takes our fancy\" (58). But more centrally, this motif emerges both from the author's insistence that words be defined carefully and from his own consistency in their use. This requirement has become especially exigent in today's global civilization, where nearly everyone is aware that past traditions are now colliding in a \"clash of civilizations,\" so that it becomes imperative to speak across traditions in a way that both respects the integrity of the other tradition and yet also allows real conversation to occur. Consider this dilemma: In contemporary uses of the word \"god,\" there is a common carelessness which takes two forms. On the one hand, we find it far too easy to label as \"gods\" whatever other people worship and, on the strength of this ascription, to judge such people to be \"polytheists.\" Whereas, of course, although \"we\" reverence, cherish, hold in high respect and worthy of devotion a great diversity of people, values, things, ideas and dreams, we suppose ourselves to worship only that which we call \"god.\" (31) This passage occurs in part 1 of this two-part book, that is, the section devoted to the encounter of Hinduism and Christianity (the three chapters of this section are made up of Lash's Teape Lectures in India, which were established by the Revered W. M. Teape to promote Hindu-Christian relations), where these kinds of misinterpretations are especially tempting. Soi-disant monotheists are especially prone to look on apparently \"polytheist\" religions and cultures as tautologically idolatrous, but Lash insists that this too-easy classification...",

It is rather that which provides a general focus for our other deliberations on goods.",

He says, “They are predicates, roughly, which involve doing something, which clearly imply intention or a state of mind or at least consciousness in general, and which indicate a characteristic pattern, or range of patterns, of bodily movement, while not indicating at all precisely any very definite sensation or experience … . Such predicates have the interesting characteristic of many P-predicates, that one does not, in general, ascribe them to oneself on the strength of observation, whereas one does ascribe them to others on the strength of observations. But, in the case of these predicates, one feels minimal reluctance to concede that what is ascribed in these two different ways is the same. This is because of the marked dominance of a fairly definite pattern of bodily movement in what they describe, and the marked absence of any distinctive experience.",

The goal of the extension was to locate stimulus and subject parameters which might influence the relative strength of these two processes: self-persuasion from behavior or judgments based upon changing stimulus attributes. High tolerance subjects are expected to show the self-persuasion effect; they are relatively unafraid and insensitive to shock. Their escape behavior is likely to be salient to them. Self-persuasion from one's instrumental escape behavior occurs only for high-shock-tolerance subjects. Low-tolerance subjects show an opposite pattern—after choosing to escape a shock they rate it as less uncomfortable than a shock which is escaped without choice. The low tolerance subjects are relatively fearful and sensitive to the pain of shock. Thus, when the shock is escaped by choice one expects them to feel less discomfort than when the shock is terminated by chance.",

It exists within the boundaries of its “benevolent self-sufficiency”, as a mobile force of production (immanence) and, at the same time, as absolutely oriented and enclosed in itself (transcendence). It is a dual state, which is perpetually stable and, therefore, not subject to any circumstances. At the same time, however, it is also a reality which is circulated in the realm of “intention” since the One is absolutely free to choose the quality of its self-determination. In a different approach: the “intention” of the One ultimately suggests that it is from its domain that the perfect union of nature with the will, of substance with \"intention\", of \"remaining\" with \"movement\", draws its culmination or even its prototypes.",

If we really believe that it is God who wants us to do something then we are more likely to do it (or at least feel more guilty if we do not do it) than if George or Tony or even our guru asks us to do it – unless we believe that our guru is God, or is the only one with a direct hotline to Him (or Her).

The differentiation between psychotic, neurotic, or autistic functioning depends in part on whether or not it is possible to develop a contact barrier. Some autistic children are echolalic, so their verbal productions seem very limited and bizarre. The behavior of autistic children becomes automatic and mechanical. Autistic children seem to skip weaning—they maintain the illusion that mouth, tongue and breast are one—and they skip all the steps of growing up that imply weaning as a differentiation process. Infants that develop autistic tendencies do not tend to explore their own bodies, or the vocalization of sounds they produce. There is a difference between the transitional objects and playing with sounds and the use, including the imitative use of autistic objects of sensation.",

      "title": "The Relation of Human Suffering in God's Grace",
      "abstract": "Suffering is a legacy of the existence of the world of souls [humans] living on earth. Suffering is not imagination, not some nightmare, on the contrary is real, actual, but not academic. Suffering comes when humans are born. Humans cannot escape suffering. Suffering comes from various angles of life. Suffering comes from a broken relationship with God. Starting from the failure of Adam and Eve's relationship with God, humans began to feel suffering. Humans cannot resist the suffering they experience. The purpose of this study is to determine the cause of human suffering and its consequences, and how to overcome suffering. The author uses a descriptive method of literature and research results as follows: first, mercy is the perfect character of the deity of God. God's mercy from eternal to eternal until humans are afraid of God. Kindness is the essence of the quality of divinity, but God shows mercy on an ongoing basis through His sovereign will. Second, the source of God's mercy. The source of God's mercy is God's goodness and love expressed mysteriously. God's mercy is stated to guide someone to live righteously. People who receive God's mercy are living in godly living conditions and they need God's protection or care. Third, God's mercy cannot be stopped by humans. Instead humans can be made to not understand by God. God is free to act surprisingly, correcting human deviation. God is free to allow the test of Satan and not to tell anyone about it that was tested. God is also free to regulate&#x0D;",

The statesman looks for perfection in international relations as well as in national affairs. The lawyer looks to the future for laws that are not ambiguous, and that the simple man can understand. The manufacturer looks for trades relations that will absorb his output at a profit. The laborer looks for a time when he shall be paid sufficiently for his work to enable him to live and save a little (which seems to us to be in the present and not in the future). And so on throughout the various occupations. The Christian looks forward to the coming of the Lord and His rule in righteousness and justice, when sin, the cause of all man's troubles, shall be abolished. The anesthetist is no exception to this rule, for he, too, looks forward to the discovery of a perfect anesthetic agent and method for its administration. He thinks it, dreams it and works to that end. Each succeeding generation builds on the works of the preceding, and adds its efforts towards advancement—perfection being the hoped for goal. However much has been done in anesthesia, much more lies in the future as reward to the diligent and faithful thinker, observer and worker.",

      "abstract": "<title>Abstract</title> Attachment theory holds that development of normal affective and social behavior requires physical contact between infant and caregiver. The elevation of touch to paramount importance has gone unchallenged because, prior to the present study, no individual with a congenital lack of somatosensation has been reported, much less studied for psychosocial development. Here we describe Kim, who since birth, has been unable to perceive touch, temperature changes, or pain on the body surface. Despite her inability to sense physical contact, Kim has above-average intelligence. She functions normally in social situations with a variety of people, recognizing emotions in herself and others and demonstrating appropriate affect. Kim experiences anxiety that appears grounded in realistic fears and uncertainties particular to her somatic insensitivity, thus serving as adaptive vigilance in reaction to an abnormal sensorium. Her normal socioemotional development, evident from an early age, likely resulted from Kim being able to appreciate her parents’ loving care through gaze, movement, and hearing. In sum, Kim upends the idea of touch as critical to developing a sense of self, secure attachment, and family bonds.",

      "abstract": "I argue that savant skills are latent in us all. My hypothesis is that savants have privileged access to lower level, less-processed information, before it is packaged into holistic concepts and meaningful labels. Owing to a failure in top-down inhibition, they can tap into information that exists in all of our brains, but is normally beyond conscious awareness. This suggests why savant skills might arise spontaneously in otherwise normal people, and why such skills might be artificially induced by low-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation. It also suggests why autistic savants are atypically literal with a tendency to concentrate more on the parts than on the whole and why this offers advantages for particular classes of problem solving, such as those that necessitate breaking cognitive mindsets. A strategy of building from the parts to the whole could form the basis for the so-called autistic genius. Unlike the healthy mind, which has inbuilt expectations of the world (internal order), the autistic mind must simplify the world by adopting strict routines (external order).",

Manusia juga dibekali Tuhan akal pikiran untuk mempertahankan hidupnya dari segala macam rintangan dan cobaan. Akal pikiran inilah yang membedakan manusia berpikir, berbuat, berencana, menurut logika itulah manusia mampu menciptakan ilmu pengetahuan modern. Dengan akal pikiran manusia dapat membedakan yang baik dan yang buruk tentang segala tindakan yang akan dilakukannya. Perilaku manusia sangat dipengaruhi oleh cara berpikir mereka terhadap apa yang sedang mereka hadapi. Didalam Al-Qur’an sebagian manusia ada yang dicintai dan dibenci oleh Allah swt.\r\nMemperhatikan suasana kini, sebagian umat Islam hidup rukun dan damai dan sebagian yang lain hidup terzalimi, dan banyak di antara tetangga-tetangganya yang kurang memperhatikan. Demikian pula sebagian lain terpecah-pecah, kurang terdorong untuk bersatu ataupun memantapkan di lingkungan mereka. Adapula sebagian lagi yang sering mengkritisi, mencaci, ataupun melakukan tindakan-tindakan tidak terpuji. Semua keyakinan, ucapan, ataupun amalan yang diperintahkan oleh Allah dan Rasul-Nya, baik yang sifatnya wajib maupun sunnah, semuanya dicintai dan diridhai oleh Allah. Sebaliknya, semua keyakinan, ucapan ataupun amalan yang dilarang dan bertentangan dengan syari’at, maka itu semuanya dibenci Allah swt.\r\nPenelitian ini bersifat kepustakaan yang didasarkan pada Al-Qurˈān sebagai sumber primer dan buku-buku lainnya yang terkait dengan tema ini sebagai sumber data sekunder. Adapun data-data yang dibutuhkan dalam penyelesaian penelitian ini diperoleh dengan menggunakan teknik dokumentasi yaitu menghimpun literatur-literatur yang berkaitan dengan objek penelitian penulis yaitu tentang orang-orang yang dicintai dan dibenci oleh Allah swt. Sementara metode yang digunakan untuk mengolah data dalam penelitian ini adalah dengan menggunakan metode tematik. yaitu mengelompokkan ayat sesuai dengan turunnya ayat Al-Qur’an, menggunakan asbāb al-nuzūl, mengelompokkan ayat-ayat yang telah ditemukan berdasarkan Makkiyah dan Madaniyah, dan menggunakan kitab-kitab tafsir untuk memperjelas kajiannya.\r\nDari penelitian ini ditemukan informasi, bahwa ada 35 ayat Al-Qur’an yang menyebutkan siapa saja yang Allah sukai dari hamba-hambanya yang beriman. Di antara orang-orang yang dicintai Allah ialah yaitu orang-orang yang berbuat baik, orang-orang yang bertobat dan menyucikan diri, orang-orang yang berbuat kebajikan, orang-orang yang adil, orang-orang yang bertawakkal, orang-orang yang bertakwa, orang-orang yang sabar, dan orang-orang yang beriman. Adapun konsekuensi orang-orang yang dicintai Allah yaitu akan mendapat pahala dan ganjaran di akhirat tidak lain adalah surga. Dan Ada 27 ayat dalam Al-Qur’an yang menyebutkan siapa saja orang-orang yang dibenci oleh Allah antara lain yaitu: orang-orang yang melampaui batas, orang-orang kafir, orang-orang zalim, orang-orang sombong dan membanggakan diri, orang-orang yang berkhianat, orang-orang yang membuat kerusakan, dan orang-orang yang berlebih-lebihan.

      "title": "A Genealogy of the Sin of Sloth - or Why We Neglect Social and Economic Rights (La Paresse du Droit ou Pourquoi Neglige-t-on les Droits Sociaux et Economiques)",
      "abstract": "This paper argues that the sin of sloth (acedia), as understood by the Christian tradition, has been replaced by its opposite in the modern world. Sloth, according to Aquinas, is the sin of the soul that does not act for the good in itself, that does not act out of love for God, but rather, that acts merely on the basis of fear or out of a desire to gain benefits. The slothful person was the one who acted (or did not act...) according to his or her own calculated interests instead of acting according to his or her telos. Thus, total inaction from the slothful sinner came from his or her belief that he or she was lost and that nothing he or she could do could save him or her. Inaction was thus considered incidental to, a mere symptom of, one's dispersion of will. The modern conception of sloth tends to reverse this scheme by focusing instead on the unresponsiveness to incentives. Not following one's telos appears to have nothing to do with the modern conception of sloth. Inaction is considered rational if an agent is not subject to appropriate incentives to act (i.e. the potential to gain benefits or avoid losses through action). In effect, acting without the appropriate incentives only means spending irrationally one's energies, it means being wasteful. At the opposite, inaction is considered slothful when the agent does not take positive steps to materialise potential gains or to avoid potential losses. The structure of modern law reflects the inversion of meaning that struck sloth when we moved from the Medieval man to the homo economicus. This inversion of meaning explains to a large extent the attitude that a majority of jurists have about social and economic rights: if those rights are not justiciable, they are not real rights, they impose no duty, people are thus not bound by them, thus, they are not real law. Through a genealogy of the sin of sloth, this paper offers a criticism of this dominant mode of legal thinking.",

The guide for all his activities proof famous of this saying know yourself (because when a person himself and know what is useful to him and distinguishes between what he can do and what he cannot do he supplies himself with what is necessary and lives happily and abstains from what is beyond his capabilities and avoids .the mistakes and misfortunes that arise from a person s ,knowledge of his inner world the feeling of a clear person of life that health of the mind the harmony of internal forces and external effectiveness and the satisfaction that is caused by moral behavior and results in the highest good and highest values. Socrates focus came on the relationship of identity this are associated whit freedom and responsibility because when a person knows himself and knows the responsibilities he has he controls his freedom for example a person bought a car and this is his freedom but his responsibility is to learn the rules of driving or another person expressed his opinion but his responsibility is to know the controls of speech that does not contain hatred hostility or violation of sharia and the law …etc therefore these responsibilities must be subjected to the controls of reason and with these issues the person becomes virtuous and he who acts according to them virtue only does good and whoever does good is happy according to this a virtuous society is achieved because virtue is knowledge and vice is ignorance",

      "abstract": "We care for our own future experiences. Most of us, trivially, would rather have them pleasurable than painful. When we care for our own future experiences we do so in a way that is different from the way we care for those of others (which is not to say that we necessarily care more about our own experience). Prereflectively, one would think this is because these experiences will be ours and no one else's. But then, of course, we need to explain what it means to say that a future experience will be mine and how knowledge of this fact renders it rational for me to care for this experience in a special way. Indeed most philosophers take this route. But in doing so, they quickly stumble on insuperable problems. I shall argue that the problem of egocentric care, as it is sometimes called, can be solved by turning things upside down: it is much more fruitful to think that the special kind of care we feel for some future experiences (and not others) is part of what makes them ours should they occur. This requires an explanation of egocentric care for future experiences that does not draw in a theory of personal identity, but rather contributes to one. I will attempt to provide this explanation by making use of the idea of a diachronic mental holism.",

      "title": "Ethnological Background of the Sheep’ Names",
      "abstract": "The subject of analysis comprises 287 Lithuanian sheep’ names. According to the author, traditionally the naming of sheep rests on somatic motivation (204 names, or 70.7 percent), including the animal’s color, its inborn or acquired bodily peculiarities or shortcomings, height, complexion, and age. Along with visible features, tactile appreciation of the wool’s quality and audible perception of the animal’s sounds are also important. 25 names (or 8.7 percent) of ethologically motivated zoonyms are related to denotative sphere, being influenced by the animal’s character, habits and manner. 53 (or 18.5 percent) names of evaluative and 5 names (1.7 percent) of subjective motivation reflect not only emotional, but also pragmatic relations between humans and animals. In order to emphasize belonging of the animal as a tangible property to a certain person, the sheep may acquire its owner’s name, surname or a metaphorical denomination of a specific mark that is exclusive to the owner and is tied onto the animal, or cut out on it, etc.Comparison of the motivation and metaphoric character of the names with broader linguistic, ethnological and folkloric context (including stable epithets, parallels, paremias, nicknames, zoomorphisms, the devil’s names and other mythical denominations, endearing names of the animals, customs of herding, relics of folk magic, etc.) shows that naming of animals is such a sphere, research of which enables experiencing vitality of the ancient beliefs, customs, and the mythical worldview. In terms of ethnology, the mythological contents of motivation for the name Rasa (‘dew’) seems particularly fascinating. The name has a magical function, as its etymon relates to the notion of water, thus naming of the sheep aims at ensuring and enhancing the quantity of its milk. In addition, this onomastic situation is far from accidental: a goat is known of having acquired a similar name (in diminutive, Raselė) for similar reasons. Besides, cows are also frequently given names deriving from appellatives or hydronyms related to water, e. g.: Banga (Lith. banga ‘wave’), Upė (Lith. upė ‘river’), or Agluona, Šešupė (Lithuanian hydronyms). Therefore, such phenomenon may be considered a systematic quality of the Lithuanian zoonyms.",

      "title": "Critical Thinking: Thinking to Some Purpose.",
      "abstract": "A British scholar by the name of Susan Stebbing (1952) once wrote a book on the importance of purpose in thinking. In it she said: think logically is to think relevantly to the purpose that initiated the thinking: all effective thinking is directed to an end. We agree. All thinking pursues a purpose. We do not think unless we have something we are trying to accomplish, some aim in view, or something we want. In other words, when humans think about the world we do not do so randomly but rather in line with our goals, desires, needs, and values. Our thinking is an integral part of a patterned way of acting in the world, and we act, even in simple matters, with some set of ends in view. To understand someone's thinking-including our own-we must understand the functions it serves, what it is about, the direction it is moving, the ends that make sense of it. In a word, we must understand that person's purpose. Of course, much of what we are after in our thinking is not obvious to us. Raising human goals and desires to the level of conscious realization is an important part of critical thinking. In other words, though we always have a purpose in thinking, we are not always fully aware of that purpose. We may have some vague idea of it. Perhaps we have not clearly come to terms with our purpose. For example, everyone's thinking is a product of many influences, most of which we have never thought about. Consider some of the major influences that shaped your thinking (and ours): You were born into a culture (European, American, African, Asian). You were born at some point in time (in some century in some year). You were born in some place (in the country, in the city, in the North or South, East or West). You were raised by parents with particular beliefs (about the family, about personal relationships, about marriage, about childhood, about obedience, about religion, about politics, about schooling, etc.). You formed various associations, largely based on who was around you, associations with people with a viewpoint, values, and taboos. Change any one of these influences and your goals and purposes would be different. Consider this, suppose you had been born in the Middle Ages as a serf in the fields in France. Can you see that if you had, virtually all of your beliefs would be altered? See if you can perform similar reflective experiments of your own. For example, imagine other changes in these influences, and then imaginatively compare some of the beliefs you likely would have with the beliefs you actually do have. You will begin to appreciate how much you, and every other human, are a product of influences over which you, and they, had little or no control. Neither you nor we directed these influences upon us. Their effects, clearly, were both good and bad. If, for example, we assume that many of these influences engendered in us beliefs that are false, it follows that in our minds right now there are false beliefs, and we are acting on them. Yet, we must realize that the mind has no mechanism for screening out false beliefs. In other words, we all carry around in our minds prejudices from our culture, prejudices from where we were born and raised, prejudices from our parents, and prejudices from our friends and associates. Finding ways to locate those flawed beliefs and replace them with more reasonable ones is part of the agenda of critical thinking. One problem with human thinking is that we sometimes pursue contradictory ends. We might want to become educated but also want to avoid doing any intellectual work. We might want others to love us but not behave in loving ways toward them. We might want people to trust us but behave in ways that undermine trust. The purpose we might explicitly state may be simply what we would like to believe of ourselves, and our real purpose might be one that we would be ashamed to admit. We might think we want to get into medical school to help and care for people when our actual purpose may be to make a lot of money, gain prestige and status, and be admired by others. …",

      "title": "Acting on Behalf of Another Without Consent as a Source of the Right of Obligations in the Republic of Kosovo",
      "abstract": "In life, it often happens that humans take different actions on different occasions to save man or his wealth. These actions can be taken when there is a need to protect the integrity of man and his wealth, both individual and social wealth. Man performs these actions morally and without any institutional obligation. Man does the action without consent in order to save one's life or another's wealth. There is a need for such an action, because everyone sometimes in certain cases needs mutual help. With these behaviors of people, it is seen that they do not take these actions out of legal obligation, but act and should act with the consciousness and conscience of the civilized man. People who do this are driven by the need for cooperation, humanity, existence at the expense of the other, namely society. A person performs this action by perpetrating the work of another without consent for any other person. Hence, they undertake some factual and legal action for the other, sacrificing something that can be the property value and their bodily integrity. Sometimes this action must be taken because there are actions that cannot be postponed, therefore someone should take an action in such situations even when uninvited. Consequently, the subject matter analyzed in this paper is the act of perpetration of the work of another without consent as a source of the right of obligations in the Republic of Kosovo.&#x0D; &#x0D; Received: 6 October 2021 / Accepted: 1 November 2021 / Published: 5 November 2021",

      "title": "EMOTIONS IN THE ORGANIZATIONAL ENVIRONMENT",
      "abstract": "At the heart of any workplace behavior (and not only), there are always one or more emotions (pleasant/unpleasant, partially controllable/uncontrollable, aware/ unconscious, useful/useless/harmful, intense/less intense, predictable/unpredictable, expressed/ repressed, observable/ unobservable, explained/ unexplained, rational/ irrational, and so on). Emotions are the foundation of a complex and mysterious mechanism of action and behavior. Emotions are triggered by certain things, people, events, situations, processes, results, interactions and so on, and are informed by a variety of endogenous (biological) and exogenous factors, and also by the intellectual potential of each individual. Emotions lie at the intersection of rationality, body (physical) and soul (spirit), thought, reason, logic, compassion, autonomy and action/behavior, individual and environment. This article undertakes to define emotions and identify their impact on the organizational environment, with emphasis on emotional climate and managing emotions. Moreover, we will focus on human behavior/action, rather than on the evolution of the nervous system or the cortex in particular. Work itself should not be a source of suffering. It is obvious that certain emotions cause bad moods, unnecessary and even harmful ones, conditions that should be considered, even if they have a situational and subjective character. Some managers think that the decision-maker fulfills his/her duties by strictly conforming to the law and to the agreement clauses and by meeting his/her obligations in a timely and exacting manner. Others believe that a good leader, in addition to observing the applicable rules and regulation, must be honest also to his colleagues and collaborators and sympathetic to the needs, ideas and emotions of those who are interested in the optimal operation of the company. Managers must remain alert to events, people and behaviors that can trigger harmful emotions within the organization. Employees should be encouraged to express their emotions in order to avoid tense situations. Even though tensions may occur, they must be managed effectively because, as we all know, avoiding a war does not mean peace, just as avoiding unnecessary inconveniences does not always equal pleasure. The improvement of emotional behavior represents a competitive edge in business activities for any organization. The main target of this undertaking is to provide a certain perspective on emotion; to be more specific, we are concerned with discovering the circumstances and causes that trigger off emotions in organizational environments. Theoretical approaches conveyed in this article may be perceived as a call to mindfulness and to the managers\\\\\\' awareness as to the importance of improving the emotional climate of the workplace.",

      "abstract": "The feeling aspect that, according to James, every state of consciousness possesses—what is it and what is its function? From a previous article, I continue here an effort to spell out how the feeling aspect and a cognitive aspect—which, too, was proposed to characterize all pulses of mentality—belong together to a single integral whole. Every state of consciousness is both a feeling and a mental apprehension of something, or at least as though of something. Although states of consciousness vary in veridicality, no state of consciousness is more or less cognitive than any other. Nor is any state of consciousness more abstract, less finite, than any another, less of a concrete feeling. Even an awareness of something universal or general is a “perfectly determinate, singular, and transient thing. … a perishing segment of thought's stream, consubstantial with other facts of sensibility.” The feeling aspect is the experiential, qualitative way in which—or form by which—a state of consciousness feels the totality of items, properties, events, relations, and so on, that it apprehends or seems to apprehend.",

      "abstract": "Alarms about the environment have brought about superficial changes of environmental attitudes, but deep attitudes will remain the same unless our conception of reality changes. Ontology determines how one pursues one's needs and welfare. The crucial element is the conception of an actuating factor (AF) in nature: whether personal or impersonal, one or many, in material things or separate. One's point of view is that of an agent with a body, and therefore involves identifying with the AFs and using the AFs in the world to obtain desired results. The major ontologies are: (i) animism (AF=personal, many, in things): one identifies with the spirits and tries to get them on one's side; (ii) polytheism (AF=personal, many, separate): one identifies with gods and makes deals with them for exploiting the environment; (iii) monotheism (AF=personal, one, separate): one \"obeys\" and prays to God for an exploitable environment and help in exploiting it; and (iv) the ambiguous ontology of modern science: (1) it is matter-active (AF=impersonal, many, in things), yet (2) laws underlie nature, so it is implicitly monotheistic (AF=personal, one, separate): one identifies with matter and with separate agents and uses laws to manipulate the AF in things to exploit the environment for material indulgence. An alternative ontology (AF=impersonal, one, not material) actuates events in accordance with the total state of matter. One identifies with the AF and belongs to the material world, since the AF is devoid of separate interests. Therefore, one tries to make the world a good place to belong to.",

      "abstract": "Large groups are social systems of approximately 30 plus persons. Such groups offer unrivalled opportunities to study the dynamics of large institutions, particularly if the meaning of participation is expanded to include the capacity for reverie and to hearken to come to know the group in an hermeneutic-spiritual way. It is this \"mental disposition\" that allows for new dimensions of large group life to be brought into being. There are, however, larger preoccupations available for exploration. There is the imago of the cosmos that is held in the minds of participants; the potential experiences of transcendence and immanence. There is also the nature of the relatedness and separatedness between Self and Other. This paper focuses on the evidence for the experience of transcendence (signals or fragments of transcendence), which is possible if the individual is neither lost in the Self or the Other.",

      "title": "Public mental health--what is to be done?",
      "abstract": "Mental health has been an integral part of an individual's well-being, although there have been difficulties in defining it and in whether mental illness should be seen as the opposite end of this spectrum. Sartorius (1) defined mental health as a state of the organism which allows the full performance of all its functions or as a state of balance within oneself and between an individual and his or her physical, social (and cultural) environment. Another definition used is absence of disease. However, the key is that an individual must be able to function well and in so doing meet the needs of food, shelter, survival, and so forth. (2) Mental health is related to feelings of self-worth and contributes to self-esteem. As such mental health is a mixture of physical, social, and psychological well-being. Interactions between the individual and that person's immediate family and peers and society at large will allow him or her to function effectively and successfully. Bhugra et al (3) noted that mental health is about a state of equipoise, where the individual is at peace with themself, functions effectively socially, and is able to look after his or her needs. Psychiatry has often focused too much on mental illness and not enough on mental health. Training both at undergraduate and postgraduate levels may cover some aspects of preventive and social medicine, but often does not deal with mental health and well-being. We ignore the interaction between physical and mental health at our peril. There is ample evidence that co-morbidity of physical and mental illness can diminish overall prognosis. Positive mental health can result in better educational attainment, greater productivity, reduced mortality, and reduced risk behaviours. (4) The relationship between mental health promotion and prevention of mental ill health is important. Clinicians are trained in managing mental illness and mental ill health. The challenge is to encourage them to lead on prevention. Mental ill health poses a considerable imposition on society directly and indirectly. In the United Kingdom, for example, mental ill health accounts for 22.8% of total disease burden, compared to 15.9% on cancer and 16.2% on cardiovascular disease, and the economic cost of mental illness is 105 [pounds sterling] billion in England alone. (4) The case for prevention is significant not only for economic reasons but for the functioning of society as a whole. There is evidence to indicate that the burden of mental illness cannot be reduced simply by treating mentally ill individuals. (5) It has been argued that the only sustainable method of reducing the burden of disease is prevention. (6) We know that half of lifetime mental illnesses (except dementia) starts by the age of 14 years and 75% by the mid-20s. (7,8) Risk factors for mental ill health in adulthood date back to childhood where these factors can be divided into those relating to the child, those relating to the family, and those related to the household itself. Maternal stress, substance abuse during pregnancy, child (physical, sexual and emotional) abuse, lone parents, low income, poor housing, overcrowding, debt, violence, unemployment, and other factors all play a role. Looked-after children (those in care), the elderly, women, lesbians/gay/bisexual and transgender (LGBT) people, and prisoners are all at a higher risk of developing mental ill health. Mental health and physical health should be promoted together and not in isolation from each other. Mental health promotion can be focused on societies and families as well as on individuals. Individuals must develop the personal ability to deal with the social environment and that subject's internal world. The entire population as a whole should be seen as the base of a pyramid. Most individuals will seek help from their personal, social and folk sector in the first instance. A small proportion will seek help in primary care and of these only a few may be referred on to secondary care. …",

      "title": "Symbolic Environment and Liking",
      "abstract": "George C. Homans (1950) has set forth an assumption about the relation between interaction and liking: the frequency of interaction between two or more persons increases, the degree of their liking for one another will increase, and vice versa. (p. 112). After some criticism concerning the generality of the assumption, he has added that the thesis is valid only when the interaction is not forced (1961, p. 186-187). This reasonably means that if one of the actors in the interaction sequence dislikes one of the others, the thesis is not assumed to be generally valid. Homans has shown in a somewhat convincing manner that this thesis is reasonable and can be supported by different kinds of empirical data. From this it follows that: (1) If A likes B (and B does not dislike A), then A and B will interact. By interaction or communication we mean every action performed in a social situation. The concept interaction is a central one in what Homans means by group, namely: . . a number of persons who communicate with one another often over a span a time, and who are few enough so that each person is able to communicate with all the others, not at secondhand, through other people, but face-to-face (1950, p. 1). From this definition and (1) it follows that: (2) If A and B interact then A and B belong to the same group. This is true only provided that A and B do not meet by chance at some isolated times and are temporary acquaintances. Now let us introduce Torgny T. Segerstedt's concept of symbolic environment, which can be defined in the following way: the symbolic environment is the meaning the words (the verbal symbols) have for a person. By meaning we imply here the object to which the word is knitted, the behaviour which is associated with the word, and the emotion which is associated with the word.",

Possibly a poet but quite possibly an ordinary citizen that – in the spur of his/her passion – wanted to share with everyone a pearl of his/her wisdom. Amare in Latin is ‘to love’ and, like in English, it is not just about sex or romance, but it is also about a passion for a cause or an ideal. The Latins knew that being in love – to have a passion!- is being healthy in the body and as well as in the mind. In this article, I hypothesise that the lack of passion and love in life is one of the main causes of modern diseases and specifically immune/inflammatory diseases. I will explore in layman terms the limitations of current ways we deal with diseases by specifically focusing on controlling bodily functions without considering the social and emotional dimensions of one’s life. Lastly, I will highlight the importance of cooperative research and engagement with the public and education as the way forward for a more effective and democratic design of new socially inclusive therapies.",

      "abstract": "In the Modem Age, the individual prefers logical-abstract relationship with reality of any form, sacred or transcendent. Nevertheless, the alienation from the wholeness, divinity, unconsciousness led to break in the modem man's communication with himself. Thus, the man started to become aware of an immense inner emptiness, both at individual and social level; not knowing anymore who he is, where he comes from and where he leads to, he feels confused in an over-technological society, substitute for lost wholeness: through scientific understanding, our world has become dehumanized. Man feels himself isolated in cosmos. He is no longer involved in nature and he has lost his emotional participation in natural events ... No river contains spirit, no tree means man's life, no snake is the embodiment of wisdom, and no mountain still harbors great demon. Neither do things speak to him nor can he speak to things, like stones, springs, plants, and animals. His contact with nature has been lost, and so has that profound emotional energy springing from this symbolic contact.2Starting in France at the century's turn, the Decadence is based on models of romantic irrationalism. Refusing the positive view (according to which the science and reason could guarantee an objective knowledge of reality), the decadent considers that all these cannot offer him the real knowledge of mysterious and enigmatic reality. Therefore, giving up reason, the Decadence replaces the objective reality questioning the unconsciousness of dark area where the individuality is taken as an unconscious remote wholeness. Because of this, we can state that the real target of Decadence is the discovery of the unconsciousness dimension.As the mystery - the secret essence of reality - cannot be deciphered by reason and science, the decadents will try to reach it through other instruments: dream and nightmare, hallucination and delirium, disease, neuroses and dementia. Thus, the decadent heroes have complicated, sinuous psychology, dominated by contrasts, and this new status leads to the psychological novel.At the peak of the American Decadence, Edgar Allan Poe infers and describes the inner conflict of the modem man, confident in the scientific and rational discoveries, at the same time being incredulous when thinking of his existence and his world existence.What characterizes Poe consists of gloomy and sensational elements, reminding of the English novel from the late 18th century, Gothic and dark. The short existence (40 years) of the American writer proved to be deeply troubled. Being in constant conflict with others, he finds refuge in art. Thus, his writings are works in which the author examines the harsh compensatory both external life (mutilated picture if we think of the Red Death Mask) and the inner turmoil, the thirst for knowledge, exploring the mysteries of the inner world.Poe's The Mask of the Red Death (1842) begins with description of the bleak and hopeless disaster of plague. It makes its presence felt everywhere by sharp pain, meaning people and places by redness and the horror of blood.Despite all these troubles, Prince Prospero was happy, bold and lively, serenity and his optimism do not give up even when more than half of his servants die from the epidemic. Confident in fate, he chooses a thousand strong and brave friends among the knights and ladies in his court and retires to seclusion of one of his castellated abbeys, figment of the prince himself.The author mentions that once you are here, courtiers stuck locks to prevent 'entry or exit of despair' caused by outside or inside insanity.The castle shows the projections of the unconscious, where memory is stored (memory), subjective contributions of functions, affects and unconscious irruptions. Thus, in the castle, the Prince gathered all that can delight the man: clown, comedians, dancers, musicians, wine, and reassurance. …",

      "title": "The Robust Demands of the Good",
      "abstract": "Abstract This book argues that we human beings can enjoy a good life only insofar as we act towards one another out of attachments like love and friendship, virtues like honesty and fidelity, and the respect that enables us each to enjoy autonomy in exercising our basic liberties. The goods we put in one another’s hands by acting out of such dispositions make robust demands. I do not enjoy an attachment like your friendship just because you actually give me favour; you must provide that treatment regardless of my charm or your convenience. And as this is true for friendship and favour, so it is true for a virtue like honesty and truth-telling, and for any form of respect and non-interference. In each case my enjoyment of the good requires you to treat me well, not just actually, but robustly: that is, across ways things might be as well as ways things actually are. The book argues that making a place in ethics for the goods of attachment, virtue, and respect has serious implications for how we think people ought to behave. It means that doing good is not just a matter of performing beneficial acts; it requires performing those acts out of beneficent dispositions. And it requires those who seek to do what is right to let themselves be guided under suitable conditions by motives of attachment, virtue, and respect: they must give those dispositions a controlling role in their lives.",

This ability - known as `sense of agency' - cannot be taken for granted in infancy. Yet, somehow, it rapidly develops from infancy into childhood. Children's understanding of the causal efficacy of their own actions is of such sophistication that they can use their own actions as interventions to learn about the causal structure of the world. In other words, a sense of agency allows children to learn from interacting with their social and physical world in ways that would not be possible otherwise [1], and may thus be crucial for human cognitive development in general.",

The study found that Mana,, which is one of the fetters stated in Saṁyojana, refers to conceit or pride about self. The person with Māna will be very reserved and proud. He believes that he is outstanding and is doing better than others. The person would have strong inner conceit for himself, etc. The practice of Satipaʈʈhāna or foundation of mindfulness by having awareness on one’s body, feeling, mind and mind-objects until one can understand that Nāma (mind) and Rūpa (material) are impermanent, deteriorated, suffering, and not self, is the way for one to eliminate the lower fetters. In conclusion, one can eliminate the lower fetters when one has reached Sotāpattimagga : the Path of stream-Entry, Sakadāgāmi-magga: the Path of Once-Returning, Anāgāāmi-magga: the Path of Non-Returning, while the Arahatta-magga: the Path of Arahantship is the only path for one to eliminate the higher fetters include Māna in Saṁyojana.",

Accordingly, one might come to believe that ‘The Attention’ names the capacity to harbour events of the specific idiosyncratic type, noticing. In fact it signifies an experiential mental space to which objects can come in perception and, which can contain experiences. After all, many mental phenomena other than perception require awareness if they are to so much as exist, e.g. emotion and thought, thanks to being experiences. That experiential space is of limited extent, for at any moment the mind can experience so much and no more. Indeed, the space is no more than the existence of such a limit, and has no autonomous existence other than the fact of that limit, and it is a dangerous illusion to hypostatize the limit as a real space, leading one to misunderstand what it is to experience an experience. Then there is reason for supposing that the experiences of the moment constitute a system. This circle or centre of awareness is the Attention. And it is to this Attention that perceived existents come—as object. This happens when a noticing or perceiving occurs.",

      "title": "Beyond Shallow Models of Emotion",
      "abstract": "There is a huge diversity of definitions of “emotion” some of which are associated with relatively shallow behavioural or measurable criteria or introspectable experiences, for instance use of facial expression, physiological measures, activity of specific regions of the brain, or the experience of bodily changes or desires, such as wanting to run away, or to hurt someone. There are also deeper theories that link emotional states to a variety of mechanisms within an information processing architecture that are not easily observable or measurable, not least because they are components of virtual machines rather than physical or physiological mechanisms. We can compare this with “shallow” definitions of chemical compounds such as salt, sugar, or water, in terms of their appearance and observed behaviours in various test situations, and their definitions in the context of a theory of the architecture of matter which is mostly concerned with postulated sub-atomic entities and and a web of relationships between them which cannot easily be observed, so that theories about them are not easily confirmed or refuted. This paper outlines an approach to the search for deeper explanatory theories of emotions and many other kinds of mental phenomena, which includes an attempt to define the concepts in terms of the underlying information processing architectures and the classes of states and processes that they can support. A serious problem with this programme is the difficulty of finding good constraints on theories, since in general observable facts are consistent with infinitely many explanatory mechanisms. This “position paper” offers as a partial solution the requirement that proposed architectures be capable of having been produced by biological evolution, in addition to being subject to constraints such as implementability in known biological mechanisms, various resource limits (time, memory, energy, etc.) and being able to account for a wide range of human functionality. Within such an architecture-based theory we can distinguish (at least) primary emotions, secondary emotions, and tertiary emotions, and produce a coherent theory which explains a wide range of phenomena and also partly explains the diversity of theories:",

He can, however, lose his trading position by a surfeit of his particular commodity or to a superior knowledge.

Finally, empathy-induced altruism can pose a threat to the mental and physical health—and even to the life—of the altruistically motivated individual.",

      "abstract": "It is well known that Emmanuel Levinas places the ‘other’ at the heart of his phenomenology, as an agency the relation toward which constitutes subjectivity. As such, the Levinasian other is deprived of violence, and it is identified with the figures of the foreigner, the orphan, and the widow. The only resistance the other could muster against the violence directed at him/ her, argues Levinas, is what he terms as the resistance of lack of resistance. This article aims at questioning this premise. Is the other indeed deprived of any violence? The readings of Derrida, Sartre, Foucault, Agamben, Freud, and Lacan can prove otherwise: either the other is equipped with contingent violence, in accordance with its intentions, as Derrida argues; or it is equipped with a priori violence, administered through the gaze, as Sartre shows. The violence of the other is linked to the violence of identity, as that which alienates the self from itself by depriving it of its fluctuating heterogeneity, whatever name it assumes.",

      "abstract": "Foulds (1965) proposed that the classes of psychiatric illness can be described in terms of a continuum of increasing degrees of failure to maintain or establish mutual personal relationships. This concept of all psychiatric illness as an “illness of the person” centres on processes which occur in the mentally ill that interfere with the satisfactory establishment and relative endurance of adequate personal relationships. Foulds conceptualizes these interfering processes as barriers to achieving “personhood”: they may present as signs or symptoms of psychiatric illness or as abnormal degrees of personality traits. Thus, for example, cognitive disorder would make the schizophrenic unable to cope with the demands of interpersonal situations. Similarly, egocentricity would render the psychopath incapable of empathy and with a tendency to treat “others as objects or as organisms than as persons”. In both examples social alienation is inferred, manifested in the first case as withdrawal and in the second case as rejection. It is Foulds' thesis that this incapacity for mutual relations increases along a continuum from normality, through the personality disorders, neurosis, integrated psychosis (melancholics, manics and paranoids) to non-integrated psychosis (the schizophrenics).",

      "title": "Past-Life Experiences: Re-living One’s Own Past Lives or Participation in the Lives of Others? / Erfahrungen früherer Leben: Wiedererleben eigener früherer Leben oder Teilnahme an den Leben anderer?",
      "abstract": "In past-life experiences (PLEs) subjects identify with a person from the past. PLEs are often considered to be memories of the subjects’ past lives, and thus as evidence of reincarnation. In the introductory sections, I argue for the use of a personal concept of reincarnation and reject various non-personal reincarnation concepts on logical-semantic grounds. I proceed to reject the widespread notion that the occurrence of personal reincarnation can be investigated by scientific means. I suggest that memories in the sense of re-experiencing are the primary access to a person’s past. The experiential perspective of PLEs often does not fit the assumption that PLEs are such memories. This applies to PLE passages where the subject takes the outside perspective or (sometimes voluntarily) switches between different perspectives. Such passages are neither demarcated from passages experienced from the first-person perspective nor do they seem to differ from the latter phenomenologically or in terms of their closeness to reality. Therefore, I propose that PLEs as a whole are not memories in the sense of re-experiencing, and, consequently, not evidence of reincarnation. The overlap between the lives that seem to be experienced in the PLE and the current lives of the experiencers, (the extent of which has been underestimated) also speaks against the reincarnation interpretation because overlap cases do not seem to differ from non-overlap cases in other respects. As an alternative interpretation, I propose to understand PLEs (if they actually revive an earlier experience and are not due to prior knowledge) not as memories, but as direct participation in the past experiences of others. Examples of direct participation in other people’s experiences that are phenomenologically similar to PLEs can be found in the context of life reviews of near-death experiences, telepathic and mediumistic experiences, and animal communication. Four explanations of PLEs as participation in experiences of others are discussed: ESP, possession, other kinds of influence of deceased persons on the experiencer, and the expansion of consciousness. Keywords: life after death – reincarnation – memories – experiential perspective – near-death experiences Bei Erfahrungen früherer Leben (PLEs) identifizieren sich die Subjekte mit einer Person aus der Vergangenheit. PLEs werden oft als Erinnerungen an frühere Leben der Subjekte und damit als Beleg für Reinkarnation angesehen. In den einleitenden Abschnitten argumentiere ich für die Verwendung eines personalen Reinkarnationskonzepts und lehne verschiedene nicht-personale Reinkarnationskonzepte aus logisch-semantischen Gründen ab. Wegen der wissenschaftlichen Unerreichbarkeit von Bewusstsein und von Personen als Bewusstseinssubjekten lehne ich überdies die verbreitete Vorstellung ab, die Frage des Vorkommens personaler Reinkarnation könne mit wissenschaftlichen Methoden untersucht werden. Ich schlage vor, dass Erinnerungen im Sinne von Wiedererleben den primären Zugang zur Vergangenheit einer Person darstellen. Die Erlebnisperspektive von PLEs passt oft nicht zu der Annahme, dass PLEs derartige Erinnerungen sind. Dies gilt für PLE-Passagen, in denen das Subjekt die Außenperspektive einnimmt oder (manchmal willkürlich) zwischen verschiedenen Perspektiven wechselt. Solche Passagen lassen sich weder klar von Passagen abgrenzen, die aus der Ich-Perspektive erlebt werden, noch scheinen sie sich von letzteren phänomenologisch oder hinsichtlich ihrer Realitätsnähe zu unterscheiden. Daher schlage ich vor, dass PLEs insgesamt nicht als Erinnerungen im Sinne eines Wiedererlebens und folglich auch nicht als Beleg für Reinkarnation anzusehen sind. Die Überschneidungen der Leben, die in den PLEs erlebt zu werden scheinen, mit den gegenwärtigen Leben der Subjekte (deren Ausmaß unterschätzt wurde) sprechen ebenfalls gegen die Reinkarnationsinterpretation von PLEs, da sich die Überschneidungsfälle ansonsten nicht von den Fällen ohne Überschneidungen der Leben zu unterscheiden scheinen. Als alternative Interpretation schlage ich vor, PLEs (wenn in ihnen tatsächlich ein früheres Erlebnis wiedererlebt wird und sie nicht auf Vorwissen zurückzuführen sind) nicht als Erinnerungen, sondern als direkte Teilhabe an vergangenen Erlebnissen anderer zu verstehen. Beispiele für eine direkte Teilhabe an den Erlebnissen anderer Menschen, die phänomenologisch PLEs ähneln, finden sich im Zusammenhang mit Lebensrückblicken im Kontext von Nahtoderfahrungen, telepathischen und medialen Erlebnissen und Tierkommunikation. Es werden vier Erklärungen für PLEs als Teilhabe an den Erlebnissen anderer diskutiert: ASW, Besessenheit, andere Arten des Einflusses verstorbener Personen auf das Subjekt und Bewusstseinserweiterung.

The Psychology of Personal Constructs is a theory that has within its intended range of convenience an exceptional variety of behavior of which the human organism is capable, including learning, dreams, occupational choice, and sexual activity. Kelly thought he saw in the people around him, with whom he was working and associating, the same goals and desires as those of the scientist, namely, to be able to anticipate and ultimately to control their environments.

      "title": "Understanding And Individuality In The Three Cities: An Interpretation Of Plato's Laws 1",
      "abstract": "In the Laws, Plato asks, first of all, whether humanity, through reason and the political art, possesses some sovereignty in ordering human life to the divine good, and secondly, whether the human individual has the freedom to realize this good in and through his own private interests. Does humanity have any substantial meaning, or does it exist as a mere toy of the gods? Does the individual, in his human attachments, desires, and doubts, have a relation to the historical manifestation of divine objectivity (the state), 2 or is this connection to the whole only achieved through denying these aspects of life that differentiate us from our common identity as citizens? 3 Guiding these political questions in the Laws is one of the most fundamental questions to the whole Platonic philosophy: does that which is many, different and particularizing have any existence and truth, or is it merely opposed to the truth of the complete, undivided whole? What is the relation between self-complete divinity and incomplete humanity? In answering these questions, the Laws belies a fundamental tension between recognizing and repressing difference. There is, on the one hand, an emphasis in the dialogue upon the importance that the individual personally understand and internalize the rationality of the laws, and that he retain certain aspects of the private realm of human 1 This interpretation arose out of a graduate seminar on Plato's Laws co-taught by Richard Kraut and Sarah Monoson at Northwestern University. I express thanks to both of them for their helpful criticisms, and to all the other participants in the seminar for their contributions, many of which are undoubtedly reflected in my argument. I also thank Michael Naas for his helpful comments on this paper. 2 Throughout the Republic, Statesman, and Laws, the relation between the common identity of the state (as promoted by the ruling principle of the city) and the various natural interests of individuals as separate from this political unity is intimately related to two important aspects of Plato's ontology. This political relation of ruler and ruled, of state and individual interests, corresponds to the structure of the first principle and its relation to everything that is other than this principle, as well as the relation between a form and the different and divided instantiations of its universal identity. I call the state, for this reason, the historical manifestation of divine objectivity. Because of this intimate connection in Plato's thought between ontology and politics, if he cannot show the logical connection between the united Good and its divided manifestation, or, in the language of the late dialogues, between the limit and the unlimited (peras and apeiron), he will remain unable to show the internal connection between the collective, common interest of the city and the particular, individual natural desires and happiness of individual citizens. 3 In contrast to this second option, Thucydides reports that Pericles commended the laws of Athens for their",

      "abstract": "Richard Rolle's English letter The Form of Living examines self-injurious behavior by anchorites and other ascetics not by condemning it wholesale but by resisting its logic of renunciation. This logic sought to abolish interiority's multiplicities and to render the subject more strictly unified and calculating, a subject stripped of otherwise inextricable ties to its \"other\" (both within and beyond the subject) for whom penance is performed. The Form argues that extreme ascesis did not necessarily entail a reduction of the self to an exterior presence and fullness, nor did it inevitably assimilate the ritually exteriorized subject to its social engagements and towards an abolishment of the inner life. Yet penitential practices often lead to an exploitation of the body in these terms and do so through a disavowal of fragility — a fragility that for Rolle was essential to and constitutive of the contemplative subject.",

But there are occasions when we accept reference to the function of something as a satisfactory answer to a genuine why, how, or what question. And we often do this without – at least knowingly – presupposing or implying that there is any intentional agency involved. Under the appropriate circumstances certain kinds of things are explained, to the satisfaction of those involved, by appealing to their functions. In many areas of the life sciences, such references may in fact merely be shorthand for hypotheses about the past or present adaptive value of organic or behavioral traits and about the role of natural selection in their genesis; but this is certainly not always the case. And biology is not the only discipline in which functions are regularly adduced. Functional explanation has also been rampant in the social sciences.",

      "abstract": "Dividing moral questions into those of substantive ethics, what should I do, and those of metaethics, why should I do what I should do, the mechanistic/Darwinian approach has little novel to say at the level of substantive ethics. One possible exception is that it is doubted we have equal moral obligations to all humans indifferently. We have special obligations to our children and other family members, and more to our friends and our countrymen than to others. We have obligations to the starving poor in Africa, but charity begins at home. Metaethically, the Darwinian can offer no justification. That would be to violate the naturalistic fallacy, going from claims about matters to claims about values. For the Darwinian the world has not intrinsic value. This means that the Darwinian is a moral non-realist. It does not mean they have no substantive ethics, but that these are psychological not grounded in external supports, natural or non-natural (like Platonic forms or the will of God). We objectify morality, thinking substantive claims do have support, are objective, otherwise we would all begin to cheat and the whole system breaks down. Ultimately, however, face to face, Darwinism demands a dramatic rethinking of common sense and the assumption of the ages, at least in western civilization.",

      "title": "Why Cannot Today’s Medicine Tolerate Man?",
      "abstract": "Today, anyone who has travelled a little through history or reflected on social systems knows that although they are established and designed to satisfy our needs and demands, they have needs of their own which guarantee their life and may precede our needs. Hence, these systems, which were supposed to serve us obediently like the magic lamp genie, make us serve them in different ways. Medicine is one of such social systems which were undoubtedly established to satisfy our vital need to care and cure. To exist and develop, medicine needs to know and control personal and social conditions, and to satisfy these, it needs knowledge, money, and, perhaps prior to all of these, it needs to be trusted. To be known, man should be completely uncovered, observable, and dissected into his parts and the relationship between his parts should be explained in simple models. And to direct the condition toward maximum health, man should be converted into a statistical entity and his individual differences, conditions, and narratives have to be ignored so that he becomes predictable and, consequently, controllable creature. The story of relative, and almost necessary, conflict between man and medicine is as simple as it is explained. Before we go any further into the discussion, we should remember that a real man, with his whole phenomenological world and new-emergent and unique properties of autonomy and consciousness, may suddenly behave like a joker and disturb all the rules of medicine's play. It is natural that such subtleties cannot be tolerated by a materialistic model which is relied on knowledge of mechanistic organization of parts. The aim of this theoretical essay is to increase the readers' awareness of biomedical model restrictions and organized cruelties it imposes on man in practice and theory. The discussion of alternate models which we are turning to recently are dealt with in other essays.",

One contentious issue is how we can be both naturally determined and morally responsible. I will deal with the subject of agency very broadly and try to put the question of causality in a philosophical and historical context. Personists assign the power of agency to the person. This leaves them with the task of explaining how persons can be causes and how the agency of persons differs from the agency of animals. Sub-personal theories have to show how an ‘executive mechanism’ in the mind or brain can account for the sense people have of being aware of their reasons for acting and their belief that it is they who are in control. Supra-personal accounts of agency face similar problems in so far as they dissolve distinctions between events caused by persons acting intentionally and natural processes taking place between persons. And when agency is explained as the product of social practices and social structures, the sense of a person having any autonomous control seems to disappear.",

      "title": "The Development of the Idea of Habit in the Thought of Saint Augustine",
      "abstract": "This study is concerned with Augustine's use of habit ( consuetudo ) to explain man's reluctance to raise his mind to God, and his difficulty in doing good. In the books that will be examined here, consuetudo is nearly always used in a pejorative sense, and can thus be translated as bad habit (be it of a psychological or ethical nature). Habit as a formal instrument of thought was known to Augustine early in his life from a reading of the Categories. There he learned that habit was a quality of a substance, not a substance itself: ‘One kind of quality let us call habits ἕξιϛ and conditions ( διάθεσις ). A habit differs from a condition in being more stable and lasting longer. Such are the branches of knowledge and the virtues . Justice, temperance, and the rest seem to be not easily changed.’ Augustine was also aware of the idea of habit as a second nature ( consuetudo secunda natura ), i.e. a tendency which is created by one's own activity, and which in turn produces effects in a predictable sort of way. This idea was a commonplace of the ancient world, and may have come to Augustine through the professors of rhetoric, who taught speech and composition through the inculcation of good habits.",

      "title": "Rethinking the Individual’s Place in an African (Esan) Ontology",
      "abstract": "The paper challenges the dominant view of the individual's place in an African (Esan) structure of Being or culture as one cast in the midst, and subject to the operations of (spiritual) forces, which are independently real and existent and can make or mar the individual's existence based on the kind of relationship he/she establishes with them. The individual is expected to have reverence and awe for these forces; hence he/she is consistently striving to fit into the established structure of Being for his/her own good. The paper asserts that this is not a fair situation because it is the individual who conceptualizes and constructs such an idea of Being to account for his/her perplexing, multifaceted experiences and his/her ontological wonder; the individual is the fundament of Being; he/she illuminates Being. Thus, though the structure of Being in which the Esan finds himself/herself playing important roles in his/her life and in the society, he/she must not always strive to fit into it, particularly when it outlasts its suitability for answering fundamental and baffling questions that keep confronting the individual in his/her existence. Since Being keeps unfolding and our knowledge of the Being-process is never complete, the individual must therefore consistently revisit, re-conceptualize and improve on the prevalent conception or structure of Being in order to account for current experiences that confront him/her.",

      "title": "Fragment of a Case of Posthysteria: D’or Owns the Jewel",
      "abstract": "Fragment of a Case of Posthysteria:D’or Owns the Jewel Shannon Bell (bio) A major radical transformation from the nineteenth-century hysteric to the twenty-first-century posthysteric is a transformation in discourse and, of course, in the agency embedded in that discourse. In this narration Dora becomes the posthysteric D’Or. The French meaning of the name D’or is golden. Freud gave his star hysteric the name of his sister’s maidservant, Dora (O’Neill 80). Lacan refers to Dora and two other hysterical patients as “mouths of gold” for the knowledge Freud gathered from them (Lacan XVII 99). It is said of the name D’or that: People with this name tend to initiate events, to be leaders rather than followers, with powerful personalities. They tend to be focused on specific goals, experience a wealth of creative new ideas, and have the ability to implement these ideas with efficiency and determination. They tend to be courageous and sometimes aggressive. As unique, creative individuals, they tend to resent authority, and are sometimes stubborn, proud, and impatient. (www.sheknows.com/baby-names/name/d’or) The name alteration indicates that the posthysteric has gone beyond the hysteric’s positioning as a servant to Freud and psychoanalysis: in the [End Page 189] nineteenth century, the tracks of psychoanalysis were laid on the back of the hysteric. In the twenty-first century the posthysteric drives a gold spike through these tracks and in so doing reroutes the way and destination. In the name alteration, the missing a that changes Dora to D’or is the a of object a, the truth position in Lacan’s famous four discourses. Object a is embodied in D’or as the agent who occupies the discourse positions of Master s1, Analyst a, and University s2, in addition to the position of Hysteric $. This, of course, changes the agent position of the barred subject $ of the hysteric to the posthysteric position that blends the structural positions of truth/agent/production/other into a new agency that can be written as a-$-s2-s1 and a new discourse: the Discourse of the Posthysteric. In presenting the case of D’or I take my utterances regarding the case and the assertion of my interpreted scenarios as reality; this is to say that what I in the dominant position of the Master (s1) detail about D’or in subsection 4, “Eighteen year old D’or,” is presented as objective fact and I refuse to acknowledge that the scenarios derived are constructed. What I in the position analyst (a) in subsection 5, “D’or Owns the Jewel: D’or and Female Ejaculatory Agency,” re-member is accomplished through the postmodern techniques of queering and speed; what I in the dominant position of Knowledge (s2) in subsection 5 reveal is the techné of female ejaculation; and, what I in the dominant position of posthysteric ($) bring forth in subsections 4 and 5 is an ownership of the female phallus by providing the blade for the hysteric’s double-edged sword questions: “What is the female organ?” “What is it to be a woman?” (Lacan III 171). It is the additional third question that D’or asks, “How to [female] ejaculate?,” which reworks the hysteric’s two questions and in so doing not only brings the “the master to heel” (Lacan XVIII, X, 11), which the hysteric was capable of doing, but also brings psychoanalysis to its knees. A Matheme in which the hysteric $/s1/s2/a becomes posthysteric a-$-s2-s1 This subsection sets out 1) the formal structure of Lacan’s Four Discourses, paying particular attention to the vectors or arrows of the circuit, 2) the matheme of Lacan’s Discourse of the Hysteric, and 3) my matheme of the Discourse of the Posthysteric.

One subject may be dominant over one partner and submissive with another.Aggressive behavior is not indispensable to obtain and keep dominance status. It seems that dominance sustained without aggression is more stable than dominance formed on the basis of aggressive display, since experiments on predatory dominance in pairs and groups of cats support such an assumption. Various brain structures were found which are involved in aggressive behavior, but in respect to dominance our experiments point to the role of the dorsal amygdala in predatory dominance.",

Its definition differs from “expert” to “expert” and from culture to culture. Nonetheless, “addiction” (from the Latin addicre) to ecstasy is a serious mental disorder for many people, whether the ecstatic feelings are due to substances (such as alcohol) or behavior (such as gambling). We have focused on substance addiction in this essay because of the plethora of research on this topic. “Bliss” is a desirable human condition, but can be attained through spiritual practices, human relationships, and positive artistic, athletic, cognitive, and other activities where the possibility of addiction is still present but less likely to occur.",

      "title": "Emotions, Decision-Making and Mass Atrocities",
      "abstract": "This book rehumanizes perpetrators of mass atrocities. At present a victim/perpetrator dichotomy appears to be the dominant paradigm: perpetrators have either been 'mechanistically dehumanized', that is, perceived as unemotional, hard-hearted and conforming and thereby lacking the core features of human nature or alternatively, they have been 'animalistically dehumanized'. In other words they are seen as immoral, unintelligent, lacking self-control and likened to animals. Within sociology and criminology the dominant view is that genocide and other mass atrocities are committed by technologically-lobotomized perpetrators. Somehow the process of rationalization is believed to have transformed these people from emotionally healthy people into hollow soulless shells of human beings or zombies, devoid of a full range of normal emotions. These people are considered bereft of any ability to reason, think or feel, yet ambulant and able to respond to surrounding stimuli. However it is difficult to imagine crime (especially those involving a group of people working together for the duration of a particular criminal activity) without emotions. For instance, there is ample evidence suggesting that both crimes of passion and pre-meditated crimes involve emotional arousal. Furthermore, research in fields such as evolutionary biology, psychology and sociology of work and organizations suggest that emotions are essential for human progress and survival. In addition, emotions help us make the right call in risky and uncertain situations, in other words, the majority of real life situations. There is, therefore, a need to revisit existing assumptions around the role of emotions in mass atrocities.",
